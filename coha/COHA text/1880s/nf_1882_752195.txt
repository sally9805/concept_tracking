txt // of Atlantis ; and the acts attributed to them in mythology are a confused recollection of real historical events . 7 . That the mythology of Egypt and Peru represented the original religion of Atlantis , which was sun-worship. 8 . That the oldest colony formed by the Atlanteans was probably in Egypt , whose civilization was a reproduction of that of the Atlantic island . 9 . That the implements of the " Bronze Age " of Europe were derived from Atlantis . The Atlanteans were also the first manufacturers of iron . 10 . That the Phoenician alphabet , parent of all the European alphabets , was derived from an Atlantis alphabet , which was also conveyed from Atlantis to the Mayas of Central America . 11 . That Atlantis was the original seat of the Aryan or Indo-European family of nations , as well as of the Semitic peoples , and possibly also of the Turanian races . 12 . That Atlantis perished in a terrible convulsion of nature , in which the whole island sunk into the ocean , with nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ships and on rafts , and , carried to the nations east and west the tidings of the appalling catastrophe , which has survived to our own time in the Flood and Deluge legends of the different nations of the old and new worlds . If these propositions can be proved , they will solve many problems which now perplex mankind ; they will confirm in many respects the statements in the opening chapters of Genesis ; they will widen the area of human history ; they will explain the remarkable resemblances which exist between the ancient civilizations found upon the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean , in the old and new worlds ; and they will aid us to rehabilitate the fathers of our civilization , our blood , and our fundamental ideas-the men who lived , loved , and labored ages before the Aryans descended upon India , or the Phoenician had settled in Syria , or the Goth had reached the shores of the Baltic . The fact that the story of Atlantis was for thousands of years regarded as a fable proves nothing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a scepticism which is born of intelligence . The people nearest to the past are not always those who are best informed concerning the past . For a thousand years it was believed that the legends of the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were myths : they were spoken of as " the fabulous cities . " For a thousand years the educated world did not credit the accounts given by Herodotus of the wonders of the ancient civilizations of the Nile and of Chaldea . He was called " the father of liars . " Even Plutarch sneered at him . Now , in the language of Frederick Schlegel , " the deeper and more comprehensive the researches of the moderns have been , the more their regard and esteem for Herodotus has increased . " Buckle says , " His minute information about Egypt and Asia Minor is admitted by all geographers . " There was a time when the expedition sent out by Pharaoh Necho to circumnavigate Africa was doubted , because the explorers stated that after they had progressed a certain distance the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused suspicion , now proves to us that the Egyptian navigators had really passed the equator , and anticipated by 2100 years Vasquez de Gama in his discovery of the Cape of Good Hope . If I succeed in demonstrating the truth of the somewhat startling propositions with which I commenced this chapter , it will only be by bringing to bear upon the question of Atlantis a thousand converging lines of light from a multitude of researches made by scholars in different fields of modern thought . Further investigations and discoveries will , I trust , confirm the correctness of the conclusions at which I have arrived . CHAPTER II . PLATO 'S HISTORY OF ATLANTIS . Plato has preserved for us the history of Atlantis . If our views are correct , it is one of the most valuable records which have come down to us from antiquity . Plato lived 400 years before the birth of Christ . His ancestor , Solon , was the great law-giver of Athens 600 years before the Christian era . Solon visited Egypt . Plutarch says , " Solon attempted in verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Island , which he had learned from the wise men of Sais , and which particularly concerned the Athenians ; but by reason of his age , not want of leisure ( as Plato would have it ) , he was apprehensive the work would be too much for him , and therefore did not go through with it . These verses are a proof that business was not the hinderance : " ' I grow in learning as I grow in age . ' And again : " ' Wine , wit , and beauty still their charms bestow , Light all the shades of life , and cheer us as we go . ' " Plato , ambitious to cultivate and adorn the subject of the Atlantic Island , as a delightful spot in some fair field unoccupied , to which also he had some claim by reason of his being related to Solon , laid out magnificent courts and enclosures , and erected a grand entrance to it , such as no other story , fable , or Poem ever had . But , as he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the more the reader is delighted with the part that is written , the more regret he has to find it unfinished . " There can be no question that Solon visited Egypt . The causes of his departure from Athens , for a period of ten years , are fully explained by Plutarch . He dwelt , he tells us , " On the Canopian shore , by Nile 's deep mouth . " There be conversed upon points of philosophy and history with the most learned of the Egyptian priests . He was a man of extraordinary force and penetration of mind , as his laws and his sayings , which have been preserved to us , testify . There is no improbability in the statement that he commenced in verse a history and description of Atlantis , which he left unfinished at his death ; and it requires no great stretch of the imagination to believe that this manuscript reached the hands of his successor and descendant , Plato ; a scholar , thinker , and historian like himself , and , like himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Egyptian priest had said to Solon , " You have no antiquity of history , and no history of antiquity ; " and Solon doubtless realized fully the vast importance of a record which carried human history back , not only thousands of years before the era of Greek civilization , but many thousands of years before even the establishment of the kingdom of Egypt ; and he was anxious to preserve for his half-civilized countrymen this inestimable record of the past . We know of no better way to commence a book about Atlantis than by giving in full the record preserved by Plato . It is as follows : Critias . Then listen , Socrates , to a strange tale , which is , however , certainly true , as Solon , who was the wisest of the seven sages , declared . He was a relative and great friend of my great-grandfather , Dropidas , as he himself says in several of his poems ; and Dropidas told Critias , my grandfather , who remembered , and told us , that there were of old great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivion through time and the destruction of the human race and one in particular , which was the greatest of them all , the recital of which will be a suitable testimony of our gratitude to you .... Socrates . Very good ; and what is this ancient famous action of which Critias spoke , not as a mere legend , but as a veritable action of the Athenian State , which Solon recounted ! Critias . I will tell an old-world story which I heard from an aged man ; for Critias was , as he said , at that time nearly ninety years of age , and I was about ten years of age . Now the day was that day of the Apaturia which is called the registration of youth ; at which , according to custom , our parents gave prizes for recitations , and the poems of several poets were recited by us boys , and many of us sung the poems of Solon , which were new at the time . One of our tribe , either because this was his real opinion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in his judgment , Solon was not only the wisest of men but the noblest of poets . The old man , I well remember , brightened up at this , and said , smiling : " Yes , Amynander , if Solon had only , like other poets , made poetry the business of his life , and had completed the tale which he brought with him from Egypt , and had not been compelled , by reason of the factions and troubles which he found stirring in this country when he came home , to attend to other matters , in my opinion he would have been as famous as Homer , or Hesiod , or any poet . " " And what was that poem about , Critias ? " said the person who addressed him . " About the greatest action which the Athenians ever did , and which ought to have been most famous , but which , through the lapse of time and the destruction of the actors , has not come down to us . " " Tell us , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from whom Solon heard this veritable tradition . " He replied : " At the head of the Egyptian Delta , where the river Nile divides , there is a certain district which is called the district of Sais , and the great city of the district is also called Sais , and is the city from which Amasis the king was sprung . And the citizens have a deity who is their foundress : she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith , which is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes called Athene . Now , the citizens of this city are great lovers of the Athenians , and say that they are in some way related to them . Thither came Solon , who was received by them with great honor ; and he asked the priests , who were most skilful in such matters , about antiquity , and made the discovery that neither he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old . On one occasion , when he was drawing them on to speak of antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our part of the world  --  about Phoroneus , who is called ' the first , ' and about Niobe ; and , after the Deluge , to tell of the lives of Deucalion and Pyrrha ; and he traced the genealogy of their descendants , and attempted to reckon bow many years old were the events of which he was speaking , and to give the dates . Thereupon , one of the priests , who was of very great age ; said , ' O Solon , Solon , you Hellenes are but children , and there is never an old man who is an Hellene . ' Solon , bearing this , said , ' What do you mean ? ' ' I mean to say , ' he replied , ' that in mind you are all young ; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition , nor any science which is hoary with age . And I will tell you the reason of this : there have been , and there will be again , many destructions of mankind arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even you have preserved , that once upon a time Phaethon , the son of Helios , having yoked the steeds in his father 's chariot , because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father , burnt up all that was upon the earth , and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt . Now , this has the form of a myth , but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving around the earth and in the heavens , and a great conflagration of things upon the earth recurring at long intervals of time : when this happens , those who live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the sea-shore ; and from this calamity the Nile , who is our never-failing savior , saves and delivers us . When , on the other hand , the gods purge the earth with a deluge of water , among you herdsmen and shepherds on the mountains are the survivors , whereas those of you who live in cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country neither at that time nor at any other does the water come from above on the fields , having always a tendency to come up from below , for which reason the things preserved here are said to be the oldest . The fact is , that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer sun does not prevent , the human race is always increasing at times , and at other times diminishing in numbers . And whatever happened either in your country or in ours , or in any other region of which we are informed  --  if any action which is noble or great , or in any other way remarkable has taken place , all that has been written down of old , and is preserved in our temples ; whereas you and other nations are just being provided with letters and the other things which States require ; and then , at the usual period , the stream from heaven descends like a pestilence , and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and education ; and thus you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of what happened in ancient times , either among us or among yourselves . As for those genealogies of yours which you have recounted to us , Solon , they are no better than the tales of children ; for , in the first place , you remember one deluge only , whereas there were many of them ; and , in the next place , you do not know that there dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived , of whom you and your whole city are but a seed or remnant . And this was unknown to you , because for many generations the survivors of that destruction died and made no sign . For there was a time , Solon , before that great deluge of all , when the city which now is Athens was first in war , and was preeminent for the excellence of her laws , and is said to have performed the noblest deeds , and to have had the fairest constitution of any of which tradition tells , under the face of heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest to inform him exactly and in order about these former citizens . ' You are welcome to hear about them , Solon , ' said the priest , ' both for your own sake and for that of the city ; and , above all , for the sake of the goddess who is the common patron and protector and educator of both our cities . She founded your city a thousand years before ours , receiving from the Earth and Hephaestus the seed of your race , and then she founded ours , the constitution of which is set down in our sacred registers as 8000 years old . As touching the citizens of 9000 years ago , I will briefly inform you of their laws and of the noblest of their actions ; and the exact particulars of the whole we will hereafter go through at our leisure , in the sacred registers themselves . If you compare these very laws with your own , you will find that many of ours are the counterpart of yours , as they were in the olden time . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is separated from all the others ; next there are the artificers , who exercise their several crafts by themselves , and without admixture of any other ; and also there is the class of shepherds and that of hunters , as well as that of husbandmen ; and you will observe , too , that the warriors in Egypt are separated from all the other classes , and are commanded by the law only to engage in war ; moreover , the weapons with which they are equipped are shields and spears , and this the goddess taught first among you , and then in Asiatic countries , and we among the Asiatics first adopted . " ' Then , as to wisdom , do you observe what care the law took from the very first , searching out and comprehending the whole order of things down to prophecy and medicine ( the latter with a view to health ) ; and out of these divine elements drawing what was needful for human life , and adding every sort of knowledge which was connected with them . All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing your city ; and she chose the spot of earth in which you were born , because she saw that the happy temperament of the seasons in that land would produce the wisest of men . Wherefore the goddess , who was a lover both of war and of wisdom , selected , and first of all settled that spot which was the most likely to produce men likest herself . And there you dwelt , having such laws as these and still better ones , and excelled all mankind in all virtue , as became the children and disciples of the gods . Many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your State in our histories ; but one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valor ; for these histories tell of a mighty power which was aggressing wantonly against the whole of Europe and Asia , and to which your city put an end . This power came forth out of the Atlantic Ocean , for in those days the Atlantic was navigable ; and there was an island situated in front of the straits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was larger than Libya and Asia put together , and was the way to other islands , and from the islands you might pass through the whole of the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean ; for this sea which is within the Straits of Heracles is only a harbor , having a narrow entrance , but that other is a real sea , and the surrounding land may be most truly called a continent . Now , in the island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire , which had rule over the whole island and several others , as well as over parts of the continent ; and , besides these , they subjected the parts of Libya within the Columns of Heracles as far as Egypt , and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia . The vast power thus gathered into one , endeavored to subdue at one blow our country and yours , and the whole of the land which was within the straits ; and then , Solon , your country shone forth , in the excellence of her virtue and strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage and military skill , and was the leader of the Hellenes . And when the rest fell off from her , being compelled to stand alone , after having undergone the very extremity of danger , she defeated and triumphed over the invaders , and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjected , and freely liberated all the others who dwelt within the limits of Heracles . But afterward there occurred violent earthquakes and floods , and in a single day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sunk into the earth , and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared , and was sunk beneath the sea . And that is the reason why the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable , because there is such a quantity of shallow mud in the way ; and this was caused by the subsidence of the island . ' ( " Plato 's Dialogues , " ii. , 617 , Timaeus . ) . . . " But in addition to the gods whom you have mentioned , I would specially invoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell is dependent on her favor , and if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said by the priests , and brought hither by Solon , I doubt not that I shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre . To that task , then , I will at once address myself . " Let me begin by observing , first of all , that nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between all those who dwelt outside the Pillars of Heracles and those who dwelt within them : this war I am now to describe . Of the combatants on the one side the city of Athens was reported to have been the ruler , and to have directed the contest ; the combatants on the other side were led by the kings of the islands of Atlantis , which , as I was saying , once had an extent greater than that of Libya and Asia ; and , when afterward sunk by an earthquake , became an impassable barrier of mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the history will unfold the various tribes of barbarians and Hellenes which then existed , as they successively appear on the scene ; but I must begin by describing , first of all , the Athenians as they were in that day , and their enemies who fought with them ; and I shall have to tell of the power and form of government of both of them . Let us give the precedence to Athens . . . . " Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years , for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking ; and in all the ages and changes of things there has never been any settlement of the earth flowing down from the mountains , as in other places , which is worth speaking of ; it has always been carried round in a circle , and disappeared in the depths below . The consequence is that , in comparison of what then was , there are remaining in small islets only the bones of the wasted body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softer parts of the soil having fallen away , and the mere skeleton of the country being left . . . . " And next , if I have not forgotten what I heard when I was a child , I will impart to you the character and origin of their adversaries ; for friends should not keep their stories to themselves , but have them in common . Yet , before proceeding farther in the narrative , I ought to warn you that you must not be surprised if you should bear Hellenic names given to foreigners . I will tell you the reason of this : Solon , who was intending to use the tale for his poem , made an investigation into the meaning of the names , and found that the early Egyptians , in writing them down , had translated them into their own language , and he recovered the meaning of the several names and retranslated them , and copied them out again in our language . My great-grandfather , Dropidas , had the original writing , which is still in my possession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Therefore , if you bear names such as are used in this country , you must not be surprised , for I have told you the reason of them . " The tale , which was of great length , began as follows : I have before remarked , in speaking of the allotments of the gods , that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in extent , and made themselves temples and sacrifices . And Poseidon , receiving for his lot the island of Atlantis , begat children by a mortal woman , and settled them in a part of the island which I will proceed to describe . On the side toward the sea , and in the centre of the whole island , there was a plain which is said to have been the fairest of all plains , and very fertile . Near the plain again , and also in the centre of the island , at a distance of about fifty stadia , there was a mountain , not very high on any side . In this mountain there dwelt one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Evenor , and he had a wife named Leucippe , and they had an only daughter , who was named Cleito . The maiden was growing up to womanhood when her father and mother died ; Poseidon fell in love with her , and had intercourse with her ; and , breaking the ground , enclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round , making alternate zones of sea and land , larger and smaller , encircling one another ; there were two of land and three of water , which he turned as with a lathe out of the centre of the island , equidistant every way , so that no man could get to the island , for ships and voyages were not yet heard of . He himself , as he was a god , found no difficulty in making special arrangements for the centre island , bringing two streams of water under the earth , which he caused to ascend as springs , one of warm water and the other of cold , and making every variety of food to spring up abundantly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of male children , dividing the island of Atlantis into ten portions : he gave to the first-born of the eldest pair his mother 's dwelling and the surrounding allotment , which was the largest and best , and made him king over the rest ; the others he made princes , and gave them rule over many men and a large territory . And he named them all : the eldest , who was king , he named Atlas , and from him the whole island and the ocean received the name of Atlantic . To his twin-brother , who was born after him , and obtained as his lot the extremity of the island toward the Pillars of Heracles , as far as the country which is still called the region of Gades in that part of the world , he gave the name which in the Hellenic language is Eumelus , in the language of the country which is named after him , Gadeirus . Of the second pair of twins , he called one Ampheres and the other Evaemon . To the third pair of twins he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one who followed him . Of the fourth pair of twins he called the elder Elasippus and the younger Mestor . And of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name of Azaes , and to the younger Diaprepes . All these and their descendants were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea ; and also , as has been already said , they held sway in the other direction over the country within the Pillars as far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia . Now Atlas had a numerous and honorable family , and his eldest branch always retained the kingdom , which the eldest son handed on to his eldest for many generations ; and they had such an amount of wealth as was never before possessed by kings and potentates , and is not likely ever to be again , and they were furnished with everything which they could have , both in city and country . For , because of the greatness of their empire , many things were brought to them from foreign countries , and the island itself provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . In the first place , they dug out of the earth whatever was to be found there , mineral as well as metal , and that which is now only a name , and was then something more than a name  --  orichalcum  --  was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island , and , with the exception of gold , was esteemed the most precious of metals among the men of those days . There was an abundance of wood for carpenters ' work , and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild animals . Moreover , there were a great number of elephants in the island , and there was provision for animals of every kind , both for those which live in lakes and marshes and rivers , and also for those which live in mountains and on plains , and therefore for the animal which is the largest and most voracious of them . Also , whatever fragrant things there are in the earth , whether roots , or herbage , or woods , or distilling drops of flowers or fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cultivated fruit of the earth , both the dry edible fruit and other species of food , which we call by the general name of legumes , and the fruits having a hard rind , affording drinks , and meats , and ointments , and good store of chestnuts and the like , which may be used to play with , and are fruits which spoil with keeping  --  and the pleasant kinds of dessert which console us after dinner , when we are full and tired of eating  --  all these that sacred island lying beneath the sun brought forth fair and wondrous in infinite abundance . All these things they received from the earth , and they employed themselves in constructing their temples , and palaces , and harbors , and docks ; and they arranged the whole country in the following manner : First of all they bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded the ancient metropolis , and made a passage into and out of they began to build the palace in the royal palace ; and then the habitation of the god and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive generations , every king surpassing the one who came before him to the utmost of his power , until they made the building a marvel to behold for size and for beauty . And , beginning from the sea , they dug a canal three hundred feet in width and one hundred feet in depth , and fifty stadia in length , which they carried through to the outermost zone , making a passage from the sea up to this , which became a harbor , and leaving an opening sufficient to enable the largest vessels to find ingress . Moreover , they divided the zones of land which parted the zones of sea , constructing bridges of such a width as would leave a passage for a single trireme to pass out of one into another , and roofed them over ; and there was a way underneath for the ships , for the banks of the zones were raised considerably above the water . Now the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was three stadia in breadth , and the zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two , as well the zone of water as of land , were two stadia , and the one which surrounded the central island was a stadium only in width . The island in which the palace was situated had a diameter of five stadia . This , and the zones and the bridge , which was the sixth part of a stadium in width , they surrounded by a stone wall , on either side placing towers , and gates on the bridges where the sea passed in . The stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath the centre island and from underneath the zones , on the outer as well as the inner side . One kind of stone was white , another black , and a third red ; and , as they quarried , they at the same time hollowed out docks double within , having roofs formed out of the native rock . Some of their buildings were simple , but in others they put together different stones , which they intermingled for the sake of ornament , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall which went round the outermost one they covered with a coating of brass , and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin , and the third , which encompassed the citadel flashed with the red light of orichalcum . The palaces in the interior of the citadel were constructed in this wise : In the centre was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon , which remained inaccessible , and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold ; this was the spot in which they originally begat the race of the ten princes , and thither they annually brought the fruits of the earth in their season from all the ten portions , and performed sacrifices to each of them . Here , too , was Poiseidon 's own temple , of a stadium in length and half a stadium in width , and of a proportionate height , having a sort of barbaric splendor . All the outside of the temple , with the exception of the pinnacles , they covered with silver , and the pinnacles with gold . In the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gold and silver and orichalcum ; all the other parts of the walls and pillars and floor they lined with orichalcum . In the temple they placed statues of gold : there was the god himself standing in a chariot  --  the charioteer of six winged horses  --  and of such a size that he touched the roof of the building with his head ; around him there were a hundred Nereids riding on dolphins , for such was thought to be the number of them in that day . There were also in the interior of the temple other images which had been dedicated by private individuals . And around the temple on the outside were placed statues of gold of all the ten kings and of their wives ; and there were many other great offerings , both of kings and of private individuals , coming both from the city itself and the foreign cities over which they held sway . There was an altar , too , which in size and workmanship corresponded to the rest of the work , and there were palaces in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of the temple . " In the next place , they used fountains both of cold and hot springs ; these were very abundant , and both kinds wonderfully adapted to use by reason of the sweetness and excellence of their waters . They constructed buildings about them , and planted suitable trees ; also cisterns , some open to the heaven , other which they roofed over , to be used in winter as warm baths , there were the king 's baths , and the baths of private persons , which were kept apart ; also separate baths for women , and others again for horses and cattle , and to them they gave as much adornment as was suitable for them . The water which ran off they carried , some to the grove of Poseidon , where were growing all manner of trees of wonderful height and beauty , owing to the excellence of the soil ; the remainder was conveyed by aqueducts which passed over the bridges to the outer circles : and there were many temples built and dedicated to many gods ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some set apart for horses , in both of the two islands formed by the zones ; and in the centre of the larger of the two there was a race-course of a stadium in width , and in length allowed to extend all round the island , for horses to race in . Also there were guard-houses at intervals for the body-guard , the more trusted of whom had their duties appointed to them in the lesser zone , which was nearer the Acropolis ; while the most trusted of all had houses given them within the citadel , and about the persons of the kings . The docks were full of triremes and naval stores , and all things were quite ready for use . Enough of the plan of the royal palace . Crossing the outer harbors , which were three in number , you would come to a wall which began at the sea and went all round : this was everywhere distant fifty stadia from the largest zone and harbor , and enclosed the whole , meeting at the mouth of the channel toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the canal and the largest of the harbors were full of vessels and merchants coming from all parts , who , from their numbers , kept up a multitudinous sound of human voices and din of all sorts night and day . I have repeated his descriptions of the city and the parts about the ancient palace nearly as he gave them , and now I must endeavor to describe the nature and arrangement of the rest of the country . The whole country was described as being very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea , but the country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain , itself surrounded by mountains which descended toward the sea ; it was smooth and even , but of an oblong shape , extending in one direction three thousand stadia , and going up the country from the sea through the centre of the island two thousand stadia ; the whole region of the island lies toward the south , and is sheltered from the north . The surrounding mountains he celebrated for their number and size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to be seen anywhere ; having in them also many wealthy inhabited villages , and rivers and lakes , and meadows supplying food enough for every animal , wild or tame , and wood of various sorts , abundant for every kind of work . I will now describe the plain , which had been cultivated during many ages by many generations of kings . It was rectangular , and for the most part straight and oblong ; and what it wanted of the straight line followed the line of the circular ditch . The depth and width and length of this ditch were incredible and gave the impression that such a work , in addition to so many other works , could hardly have been wrought by the hand of man . But I must say what I have heard . It was excavated to the depth of a hundred feet , and its breadth was a stadium everywhere ; it was carried round the whole of the plain , and was ten thousand stadia in length . It received the streams which came down from the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various points , was there let off into the sea . From above , likewise , straight canals of a hundred feet in width were cut in the plain , and again let off into the ditch , toward the sea ; these canals were at intervals of a Hundred stadia , and by them they brought , down the wood from the mountains to the city , and conveyed the fruits of the earth in ships , cutting transverse passages from one canal into another , and to the city . Twice in the year they gathered the fruits of the earth  --  in winter having the benefit of the rains , and in summer introducing the water of the canals . As to the population , each of the lots in the plain had an appointed chief of men who were fit for military service , and the size of the lot was to be a square of ten stadia each way , and the total number of all the lots was sixty thousand . " And of the inhabitants of the mountains and of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom they were assigned according to their dwellings and villages . The leader was required to furnish for the war the sixth portion of a war-chariot , so as to make up a total of ten thousand chariots ; also two horses and riders upon them , and a light chariot without a seat , accompanied by a fighting man on foot carrying a small shield , and having a charioteer mounted to guide the horses ; also , he was bound to furnish two heavy-armed men , two archers , two slingers , three stone-shooters , and three javelin men , who were skirmishers , and four sailors to make up a complement of twelve hundred ships . Such was the order of war in the royal city  --  that of the other nine governments was different in each of them , and would be wearisome to narrate . As to offices and honors , the following was the arrangement from the first : Each of the ten kings , in his own division and in his own city , had the absolute control of the citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaying whomsoever he would . " Now the relations of their governments to one another were regulated by the injunctions of Poseidon as the law had handed them down . These were inscribed by the first men on a column of orichalcum , which was situated in the middle of the island , at the temple of Poseidon , whither the people were gathered together every fifth and sixth years alternately , thus giving equal honor to the odd and to the even number . And when they were gathered together they consulted about public affairs , and inquired if any one had transgressed in anything , and passed judgment on him accordingly  --  and before they passed judgment they gave their pledges to one another in this wise : There were bulls who had the range of the temple of Poseidon ; and the ten who were left alone in the temple , after they had offered prayers to the gods that they might take the sacrifices which were acceptable to them , hunted the bulls without weapons , but with staves and nooses ; and the bull which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then struck on the head by them , and slain over the sacred inscription . Now on the column , besides the law , there was inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the disobedient . When , therefore , after offering sacrifice according to their customs , they had burnt the limbs of the bull , they mingled a cup and cast in a clot of blood for each of them ; the rest of the victim they took to the fire , after having made a purification of the column all round . Then they drew from the cup in golden vessels , and , pouring a libation on the fire , they swore t hat they would judge according to the laws on the column , and would punish any one who had previously transgressed , and that for the future they would not , if they could help , transgress any of the inscriptions , and would not command or obey any ruler who commanded them to act otherwise than according to the laws of their father Poseidon . This was the prayer which each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time drinking , and dedicating the vessel in the temple of the god ; and , after spending some necessary time at supper , when darkness came on and the fire about the sacrifice was cool , all of them put on most beautiful azure robes , and , sitting on the ground at night near the embers of the sacrifices on which they had sworn , and extinguishing all the fire about the temple , they received and gave judgement , if any of them had any accusation to bring against any one ; and , when they had given judgment , at daybreak they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet , and deposited them as memorials with their robes . There were many special laws which the several kings had inscribed about the temples , but the most important was the following : That they were not to take up arms against one another , and they were all to come to the rescue if any one in any city attempted to over . throw the royal house . Like their ancestors , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving the supremacy to the family of Atlas ; and the king was not to have the power of life and death over any of his kinsmen , unless he had the assent of the majority of the ten kings . " Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island of Atlantis ; and this he afterward directed against our land on the following pretext , as traditions tell : For many generations , as long as the divine nature lasted in them , they were obedient to the laws , and well-affectioned toward the gods , who were their kinsmen ; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits , practising gentleness and wisdom in the various chances of life , and in their intercourse with one another . They despised everything but virtue , not caring for their present state of life , and thinking lightly on the possession of gold and other property , which seemed only a burden to them ; neither were they intoxicated by luxury ; nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are increased by virtuous friendship with one another , and that by excessive zeal for them , and honor of them , the good of them is lost , and friendship perishes with them . " By such reflections , and by the continuance in them of a divine nature , all that which we have described waxed and increased in them ; but when this divine portion began to fade away in them , and became diluted too often , and with too much of the mortal admixture , and the human nature got the upper-hand , then , they being unable to bear their fortune , became unseemly , and to him who had an eye to see , they began to appear base , and had lost the fairest of their precious gifts ; but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness , they still appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were filled with unrighteous avarice and power . Zeus , the god of gods , who rules with law , and is able to see into such things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and wanting to inflict punishment on them , that they might be chastened and improved , collected all the gods into his most holy habitation , which , being placed in the centre of the world , sees all things that partake of generation . And when he had called them together he spake as follows : " Here Plato 's story abruptly ends . CHAPTER III . THE PROBABILITIES OF PLATO 'S STORY . There is nothing improbable in this narrative , so far as it describes a great , rich , cultured , and educated people . Almost every part of Plato 's story can be paralleled by descriptions of the people of Egypt or Peru ; in fact , in some respects Plato 's account of Atlantis falls short of Herodotus 's description of the grandeur of Egypt , or Prescott 's picture of the wealth and civilization of Peru . For instance , Prescott , in his " Conquest of Peru " ( vol. i. , p. 95 ) , says : " The most renowned of the Peruvian temples , the pride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuzco , where , under the munificence of successive sovereigns , it had become so enriched that it received the name of Coricancha , or ' the Place of Gold . ' . . . The interior of the temple was literally a mine of gold . On the western wall was emblazoned a representation of the Deity , consisting of a human countenance looking forth from amid innumerable rays of light , which emanated from it in every direction , in the same manner as the sun is often personified with us . The figure was engraved on a massive plate of gold , of enormous dimensions , thickly powdered with emeralds and precious stones . . . . The walls and ceilings were everywhere incrusted with golden ornaments ; every part of the interior of the temple glowed with burnished plates and studs of the precious metal ; the cornices were of the same material . " There are in Plato 's narrative no marvels ; no myths ; no tales of gods , gorgons , hobgoblins , or giants . It is a plain and reasonable history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who lived by agriculture and commerce : who in pursuit of trade , reached out to all the countries around them . The early history of most nations begins with gods and demons , while here we have nothing of the kind ; we see an immigrant enter the country , marry one of the native women , and settle down ; in time a great nation grows up around him . It reminds one of the information given by the Egyptian priests to Herodotus . " During the space of eleven thousand three hundred and fort years they assert , " says Herodotus , " that no divinity has appeared in human shape , . . . they absolutely denied the possibility of a human being 's descent from a god . " If Plato had sought to draw from his imagination a wonderful and pleasing story , we should not have had so plain and reasonable a narrative . He would have given us a history like the legends of Greek mythology , full of the adventures of gods and goddesses , nymphs , fauns , and satyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this history that Plato sought to convey in it a moral or political lesson , in the guise of a fable , as did Bacon in the " New Atlantis , " and More in the " Kingdom of Nowhere . " There is no ideal republic delineated here . It is a straightforward , reasonable history of a people ruled over by their kings , living and progressing as other nations have lived and progressed since their day . Plato says that in Atlantis there was " a great and wonderful empire , " which " aggressed wantonly against the whole of Europe and Asia , " thus testifying to the extent of its dominion . It not only subjugated Africa as far as Egypt , and Europe as far as Italy , but it ruled " as well over parts of the continent , " to wit , " the opposite continent " of America , " which surrounded the true ocean . " Those parts of America over which it ruled were , as we will show hereafter , Central America , Peru , and the Valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moreover , he tells us that " this vast power was gathered into one ; " that is to say , from Egypt to Peru it was one consolidated empire . We will see hereafter that the legends of the Hindoos as to Deva Nahusha distinctly refer to this vast empire , which covered the whole of the known world . Another corroboration of the truth of Plato 's narrative is found in the fact that upon the Azores black lava rocks , and rocks red and white in color , are now found . He says they built with white , red , and black stone . Sir C. Wyville Thomson describes a narrow neck of land between Fayal and Monte da Guia , called " Monte Queimada " ( the burnt mountain ) , as follows : " It is formed partly of stratified tufa of a dark chocolate color , and partly of lumps of black lava , porous , and each with a large cavity in the centre , which must have been ejected as volcanic bombs in a glorious display of fireworks at some period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geological annals of the island " ( " Voyage of the Challenger , " vol. ii. , p. 24 ) . He also describes immense walls of black volcanic rock in the island . The plain of Atlantis , Plato tells us , " had been cultivated during many ages by many generations of kings . " If , as we believe , agriculture , the domestication of the horse , ox , sheep , goat , and bog , and the discovery or development of wheat , oats , rye , and barley originated in this region , then this language of Plato in reference to " the many ages , and the successive generations of kings , " accords with the great periods of time which were necessary to bring man from a savage to a civilized condition . In the great ditch surrounding the whole land like a circle , and into which streams flowed down from the mountains , we probably see the original of the four rivers of Paradise , and the emblem of the cross surrounded by a circle , which , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , accepted as the emblem of the Garden of Eden . We know that Plato did not invent the name of Poseidon , for the worship of Poseidon was universal in the earliest ages of Europe ; " Poseidon-worship seems to have been a peculiarity of all the colonies previous to the time of Sidon " ( " Prehistoric Nations , " p. 148 . ) This worship " was carried to Spain , and to Northern Africa , but most abundantly to Italy , to many of the islands , and to the regions around the AEgean Sea ; also to Thrace . " ( Ibid. , p. 155 . ) Poseidon , or Neptune , is represented in Greek mythology as a sea-god ; but he is figured as standing in a war-chariot drawn by horses . The association of the horse ( a land animal ) with a sea-god is inexplicable , except with the light given by Plato . Poseidon was a sea-god because he ruled over a great land in the sea , and was the national god of a maritime people ; he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first domesticated ; and , as Plato shows , the Atlanteans had great race-courses for the development of speed in horses ; and Poseidon is represented as standing in a war-chariot , because doubtless wheeled vehicles were first invented by the same people who tamed the horse ; and they transmitted these war-chariots to their descendants from Egypt to Britain . We know that horses were the favorite objects chosen for sacrifice to Poseidon by the nations of antiquity within the Historical Period ; they were killed , and cast into the sea from high precipices . The religious horse-feasts of the pagan Scandinavians were a survival of this Poseidon-worship , which once prevailed along all the coasts of Europe ; they continued until the conversion of the people to Christianity , and were then suppressed by the Church with great difficulty . We find in Plato 's narrative the names of some of the Phoenician deities among the kings of Atlantis . Where did the Greek , Plato , get these names if the story is a fable ? Does Plato , in speaking of " the fruits having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " refer to the cocoa nut ? Again : Plato tells us that Atlantis abounded in both cold and hot springs . How did he come to hit upon the hot springs if he was drawing a picture from his imagination ? It is a singular confirmation of his story that hot springs abound in the Azores , which are the surviving fragments of Atlantis ; and an experience wider than that possessed by Plato has taught scientific men that hot springs are a common feature of regions subject to volcanic convulsions . Plato tells us , " The whole country was very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea , but the country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain , itself surrounded by mountains which descended toward the sea . " One has but to look at the profile of the " Dolphin 's Ridge , " as revealed by the deep-sea soundings of the Challenger , given as the frontispiece to this volume , to see that this is a faithful description of that precipitous elevation . " The surrounding mountains , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present towering peaks of the Azores . Plato tells us that the destruction of Atlantis filled the sea with mud , and interfered with navigation . For thousands of years the ancients believed the Atlantic Ocean to be " a muddy , shallow , dark , and misty sea , Mare tenebrosum . " ( " Cosmos , " vol. ii. , p. 151 . ) The three-pronged sceptre or trident of Poseidon reappears constantly in ancient history . We find it in the hands of Hindoo gods , and at the base of all the religious beliefs of antiquity . " Among the numerals the sacred three has ever been considered the mark of perfection , and was therefore exclusively ascribed to the Supreme Deity , or to its earthly representative  --  a king , emperor , or any sovereign . For this reason triple emblems of various shapes are found on the belts , neckties , or any encircling fixture , as can be seen on the works of ancient art in Yucatan , Guatemala , Chiapas , Mexico , etc. , whenever the object has reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smith . Rep. , " 1869 , p. 391 . ) We are reminded of the , " tiara , " and the " triple round of sovereignty . " In the same manner the ten kingdoms of Atlantis are perpetuated in all the ancient traditions . " In the number given by the Bible for the Antediluvian patriarchs we have the first instance of a striking agreement with the traditions of various nations . Ten are mentioned in the Book of Genesis . Other nations , to whatever epoch they carry back their ancestors , whether before or after the Deluge , whether the mythical or historical character prevail , they are constant to this sacred number ten , which some have vainly attempted to connect with the speculations of later religious philosophers on the mystical value of numbers . In Chaldea , Berosus enumerates ten Antediluvian kings whose fabulous reign extended to thousands of years . The legends of the Iranian race commence with the . reign of ten Peisdadien ( Poseidon ? ) kings , ' men of the ancient law , who lived on pure Homa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and who preserved their sanctity . ' In India we meet with the nine Brahmadikas , who , with Brahma , their founder , make ten , and who are called the Ten Petris , or Fathers . The Chinese count ten emperors , partakers of the divine nature , before the dawn of historical times . The Germans believed in the ten ancestors of Odin , and the Arabs in the ten mythical kings of the Adites . " ( Lenormant and Chevallier , " Anc . Hist. of the East , " vol. i. , p. 13 . ) The story of Plato finds confirmation from other sources . An extract preserved in Proclus , taken from a work now lost , which is quoted by Boeckh in his commentary on Plato , mentions islands in the exterior sea , beyond the Pillars of Hercules , and says it was known that in one of these islands " the inhabitants preserved from their ancestors a remembrance of Atlantis , all extremely large island , which for a long time held dominion over all the islands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Historia " ( book iii. , chap . xviii. ) , tells us that Theopompus ( 400 B.C. ) related the particulars of an interview between Midas , King of Phrygia , and Silenus , in which Silenus reported the existence of a great continent beyond the Atlantic , " larger than Asia , Europe , and Libya together . " He stated that a race of men called Meropes dwelt there , and had extensive cities . They were persuaded that their country alone was a continent . Out of curiosity some of them crossed the ocean and visited the Hyperboreans . " The Gauls possessed traditions upon the subject of Atlantis which were collected by the Roman historian Timagenes , who lived in the first century before Christ . He represents that three distinct people dwelt in Gaul : 1 . The indigenous population , which I suppose to be Mongoloids , who had long dwelt in Europe ; 2 . The invaders from a distant island , which I understand to be Atlantis ; 3 . The Aryan Gauls . " ( " Preadamites , " p. 380 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaks of seven islands lying in the Atlantic Ocean  --  probably the Canaries  --  and the inhabitants of these islands , he says , preserve the memory of a much greater island , Atlantis , " which had for a long time exercised dominion over the smaller ones . " ( Didot Mueller , " Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum , " vol. iv. , p. 443 . ) Diodorus Siculus relates that the Phoenicians discovered " a large island in the Atlantic Ocean , beyond the Pillars of Hercules , several days ' sail from the coast of Africa . This island abounded in all manner of riches . The soil was exceedingly fertile ; the scenery was diversified by rivers , mountains , and forests . It was the custom of the inhabitants to retire during the summer to magnificent country-houses , which stood in the midst of beautiful gardens . Fish and game were found in great abundance ; the climate was delicious , and the trees bore fruit at all seasons of the year . " Homer , Plutarch , and other ancient writers mention islands situated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hercules . " Silenus tells Midas that there was another continent besides Europe , Asia , and Africa  --  " a country where gold and silver are so plentiful that they are esteemed no more than we esteem iron . " St. Clement , in his Epistle to the Corinthians , says that there were other worlds beyond the ocean . Attention may here be called to the extraordinary number of instances in which allusion is made in the Old Testament to the " islands of the sea , " especially in Isaiah and Ezekiel . What had an inland people , like the Jews , to do with seas and islands ? Did these references grow out of vague traditions linking their race with " islands in the sea ? " The Orphic Argonaut sings of the division of the ancient Lyktonia into separate islands . He says , " When the dark-haired Poseidon , in anger with Father Kronion , struck Lyktonia with the golden trident . " Plato states that the Egyptians told Solon that the destruction of Atlantis occurred 9000 years before that date , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This looks like an extraordinarily long period of time , but it must be remembered that geologists claim that the remains of man found in the caves of Europe date back 500,000 years ; and the fossil Calaveras skull was found deep under the base of Table Mountain , California , the whole mountain having been formed since the man to whom it belonged lived and died . " M. Oppert read an essay at the Brussels Congress to show , from the astronomical observations of the Egyptians and Assyrians , that 11,542 years before our era man existed on the earth at such a stage of civilization as to be able to take note of astronomical phenomena , and to calculate with considerable accuracy the length of the year . The Egyptians , says he , calculated by cycles of 1460 years  --  zodiacal cycles , as they were called . Their year consisted of 365 days , which caused them to lose one day in every four solar years , and , consequently , they would attain their original starting-point again only after 1460 years ( 365 x 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 139 of our era commenced in the year 1322 B.C. On the other hand , the Assyrian cycle was 1805 years , or 22,325 lunations . An Assyrian cycle began 712 B.C. The Chaldeans state that between the Deluge and their first historic dynasty there was a period of 39,180 years . Now , what means , this number ? It stands for 12 Egyptian zodiacal cycles plus 12 Assyrian lunar cycles . +  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  +  --   --   --   --   --  + 12 X 1460 = 17,520 +  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  +  --   --   --   --   --  + = 39,180 +  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  +  --   --   --   --   --  + 12 X 1805 = 21,660 +  --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --   --  +  --   --   --   --   --  + " These two modes of calculating time are in agreement with each other , and were known simultaneously to one people , the Chaldeans .

" That observation was probably made in Atlantis . The wide divergence of languages which is found to exist among the Atlanteans at the beginning of the Historical Period implies a vast lapse of time . The fact that the nations of the Old World remembered so little of Atlantis , except the colossal fact of its sudden and overwhelming destruction , would also seem to remove that event into a remote past . Herodotus tells us that he learned from the Egyptians that Hercules was one of their most ancient deities , and that he was one of the twelve produced from the eight gods , 17,000 years before the reign of Amasis . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told as history , derived from the Egyptians , a people who , it is known , preserved most ancient records , and who were able to trace their existence back to a vast antiquity , should have been contemptuously set aside as a fable by Greeks , Romans , and the modern world . It can only be because our predecessors , with their limited knowledge of the geological history of the world , did not believe it possible that any large part of the earth 's surface could have been thus suddenly swallowed up by the sea . Let us then first address ourselves to that question . CHAPTER IV . WAS SUCH A CATASTROPHE POSSIBLE ? All that is needed to answer this question is to briefly refer to some of the facts revealed by the study of geology . In the first place , the earth 's surface is a record of successive risings and fallings of the land . The accompanying picture represents a section of the anthracite coal-measures of Pennsylvania . Each of the coal deposits here shown , indicated by the black lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea to maintain vegetation ; each of the strata of rock , many of them hundreds of feet in thickness , was deposited under water . Here we have twenty-three different changes of the level of the land during the formation of 2000 feet of rock and coal ; and these changes took place over vast areas , embracing thousands of square miles . All the continents which now exist were , it is well understood , once , under water , and the rocks of which they are composed were deposited beneath the water ; more than this , most of the rocks so deposited were the detritus or washings of other continents , which then stood where the oceans now roll , and whose mountains and plains were ground down by the action of volcanoes and earthquakes , and frost , ice , wind , and rain , and washed into the sea , to form the rocks upon which the nations now dwell ; so that we have changed the conditions of land and water : that which is now continent was once sea , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no question that the Australian Archipelago is simply the mountain-tops of a drowned continent , which once reached from India to South America . Science has gone so far as to even give it a name ; it is called " Lemuria , " and here , it is claimed , the human race originated . An examination of the geological formation of our Atlantic States proves beyond a doubt , from the manner in which the sedimentary rocks , the sand , gravel , and mud  --  aggregating a thickness of 45,000 feet  --  are deposited , that they came from the north and east . " They represent the detritus of pre-existing lands , the washings of rain , rivers , coast-currents , and other agencies of erosion ; and since the areas supplying the waste could scarcely have been of less extent than the new strata it formed , it is reasonably inferred that land masses of continental magnitude must have occupied the region now covered by the North Atlantic before America began to be , and onward at least through the palaeozoic ages of American history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strata of rocks are thicker the nearer we approach their source in the east : the maximum thickness of the palaeozoic rocks of the Appalachian formation is 25,000 to 35,000 feet in Pennsylvania and Virginia , while their minimum thickness in Illinois and Missouri is from 3000 to 4000 feet ; the rougher and grosser-textured rocks predominate in the east , while the farther west we go the finer the deposits were of which the rocks are composed ; the finer materials were carried farther west by the water . " ( " New Amer . Cyclop. , " art . Coal . ) DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII The history of the growth of the European Continent , as recounted by Professor Geikie , gives an instructive illustration of the relations of geology to geography . The earliest European land , he says , appears to have existed in the north and north-west , comprising Scandinavia , Finland , and the northwest of the British area , and to have extended thence through boreal and arctic latitudes into North America . Of the height and mass of this primeval land some idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material derived from its disintegration . In the Silurian formations of the British Islands alone there is a mass of rock , worn from the land , which would form a mountain-chain extending from Marseilles to the North Cape ( 1800 miles ) , with a mean breadth of over thirty-three miles , and an average height of 16,000 feet . As the great continent which stood where the Atlantic Ocean now is wore away , the continents of America and Europe were formed ; and there seems to have been from remote times a continuous rising , still going on , of the new lands , and a sinking of the old ones . Within five thousand years , or since the age of the " polished stone , " the shores of Sweden , Denmark , and Norway have risen from 200 to 600 feet . Professor Winchell says ( " The Preadamites , " p. 437 ) : " We are in the midst of great , changes , and are scarcely conscious of it . We have seen worlds in flames , and have felt a cornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South America lifted up bodily ten or fifteen feet and let down again in an hour . We have seen the Andes sink 220 feet in seventy years . . . Vast transpositions have taken place in the coast-line of China . The ancient capital , located , in all probability , in an accessible position near the centre of the empire , has now become nearly surrounded by water , and its site is on the peninsula of Corea . . . . There was a time when the rocky barriers of the Thracian Bosphorus gave way and the Black Sea subsided . It had covered a vast area in the north and east . Now this area became drained , and was known as the ancient Lectonia : it is now the prairie region of Russia , and the granary of Europe . " There is ample geological evidence that at one time the entire area of Great Britain was submerged to the depth of at least seventeen hundred feet . Over the face of the submerged land was strewn thick beds of sand , gravel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The British Islands rose again from the sea , bearing these water-deposits on their bosom . What is now Sicily once lay deep beneath the sea : A subsequently rose 3000 feet above the sea-level . The Desert of Sahara was once under water , and its now burning sands are a deposit of the sea . Geologically speaking , the submergence of Atlantis , within the historical period , was simply the last of a number of vast changes , by which the continent which once occupied the greater part of the Atlantic had gradually sunk under the ocean , while the new lands were rising on both sides of it . We come now to the second question , Is it possible that Atlantis could have been suddenly destroyed by such a convulsion of nature as is described by Plato ? The ancients regarded this part of his story as a fable . With the wider knowledge which scientific research has afforded the modern world , we can affirm that such an event is not only possible , but that the history of even the last two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now possess the record of numerous islands lifted above the waters , and others sunk beneath the waves , accompanied by storms and earthquakes similar to those which marked the destruction of Atlantis . In 1783 Iceland was visited by convulsions more tremendous than any recorded in the modern annals of that country . About a month previous to the eruption on the main-land a submarine volcano burst forth in the sea , at a distance of thirty miles from the shore . It ejected so much pumice that the sea was covered with it for a distance of 150 miles , and ships were considerably impeded in their course . A new island was thrown up , consisting of high cliffs , which was claimed by his Danish Majesty , and named " Nyoe , " or the New Island ; but before a year had elapsed it sunk beneath the sea , leaving a reef of rocks thirty fathoms under water . The earthquake of 1783 in Iceland destroyed 9000 people out of a population of 50,000 ; twenty villages were consumed by fire or inundated by water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire bulk of Mont Blanc . " On the 8th of October , 1822 , a great earthquake occurred on the island of Java , near the mountain of Galung Gung . " A loud explosion was heard , the earth shook , and immense columns of hot water and boiling mud , mixed with burning brimstone , ashes , and lapilli , of the size of nuts , were projected from the mountain like a water-spout , with such prodigious violence that large quantities fell beyond the river Tandoi , which is forty miles distant . . . . The first eruption lasted nearly five hours ; and on the following days the rain fell ill torrents , and the rivers , densely charged with mud , deluged the country far and wide . At the end of four days ( October 12th ) , a second eruption occurred , more violent than the first , in which hot water and mud were again vomited , and great blocks of basalt were thrown to the distance of seven miles from the volcano . There was at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly changed , its summits broken down , and one side , which had been covered with trees , became an enormous gulf in the form of a semicircle . Over 4000 persons were killed and 114 villages destroyed . " ( Lyell 's " Principles of Geology , " p. 430 . ) In 1831 a new island was born in the Mediterranean , near the coast of Sicily . It was called Graham 's Island . It came up with an earthquake , and " a water-spout sixty feet high and eight hundred yards in circumference rising from the sea . " In about a month the island was two hundred feet high and three miles in circumference ; it soon , however , stink beneath the sea . The Canary Islands were probably a part of the original empire of Atlantis . On the 1st of September , 1730 , the earth split open near Year , in the island of Lancerota . In one night a considerable hill of ejected matter was thrown up ; in a few days another vent opened and gave out a lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly , like water , but became afterward heavy and slow , like honey . On the 11th of September more lava flowed out , covering up a village , and precipitating itself with a horrible roar into the sea . Dead fish floated on the waters in indescribable multitudes , or were thrown dying on the shore ; the cattle throughout the country dropped lifeless to the ground , suffocated by putrid vapors , which condensed and fell down in drops . These manifestations were accompanied by a storm such as the people of the country had never known before . These dreadful commotions lasted for five years . The lavas thrown out covered one-third of the whole island of Lancerota . CALABRIAN PEASANTS INGULFED BY CREVASSES ( 1783 ) . The Gulf of Santorin , in the Grecian Archipelago , has been for two thousand years a scene of active volcanic operations . Pliny informs us that in the year 186 B.C. the island of " Old Kaimeni , " or the Sacred Isle , was lifted up from the sea ; and in A.D. 19 the island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In A.D. 1573 another island was created , called " the small sunburnt island . " In 1848 a volcanic convulsion of three months ' duration created a great shoal ; an earthquake destroyed many houses in Thera , and the sulphur and hydrogen issuing from the sea killed 50 persons and 1000 domestic animals . A recent examination of these islands shows that the whole mass of Santorin has sunk , since its projection from the sea , over 1200 feet . The fort and village of Sindree , on the eastern arm of the Indus , above Luckput , was submerged in 1819 by an earthquake , together with a tract of country 2000 square miles in extent . " In 1828 Sir A. Burnes went in a boat to the ruins of Sindree , where a single remaining tower was seen in the midst of a wide expanse of sea . The tops of the ruined walls still rose two or three feet above the level of the water ; and , standing on one of these , he could behold nothing in the horizon but water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land to the north indicated the Ullah Bund . This scene , " says Lyell ( " Principles of Geology , " p. 462 ) , " presents to the imagination a lively picture of the revolutions now in progress on the earth-a waste of waters where a few years before all was land , and the only land visible consisting of ground uplifted by a recent earthquake . " We give from Lyell 's great work the following curious pictures of the appearance of the Fort of Sindree before and after the inundation . FORT OF SINDEE , ON THE EASTERN BRANCH OF THE INDUS , BEFORE IT WAS SUBMERGED BY THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1819 . In April , 1815 , one of the most frightful eruptions recorded in history occurred in the province of Tomboro , in the island of Sumbawa , about two hundred miles from the eastern extremity of Java . It lasted from April 5th to July of that year ; but was most violent on the 11th and 12th of July . The sound of the explosions was heard for nearly one thousand miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of Tombora , only twenty-six individuals escaped . " Violent whirlwinds carried up men , horses , and cattle into the air , tore up the largest trees by the roots , and covered the whole sea with floating timber . " ( Raffles 's " History of Java , " vol. i. , p. 28 . ) The ashes darkened the air ; " the floating cinders to the westward of Sumatra formed , on the 12th of April , a mass two feet thick and several miles in extent , through which ships with difficulty forced their way . " The darkness in daytime was more profound than the blackest night . " The town called Tomboro , on the west side of Sumbawa , was overflowed by the sea , which encroached upon the shore , so that the water remained permanently eighteen feet deep in places where there was land before " . The area covered by the convulsion was 1000 English miles in circumference . " In the island of Amboyna , in the same month and year , the ground opened , threw out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " History of Java , " vol. i. , p. 25 . ) VIEW OF THE FORT OF SINDREE FROM THE WEST IN MARCH , 1839 . But it is at that point of the European coast nearest to the site of Atlantis at Lisbon that the most tremendous earthquake of modern times has occurred . On the 1st of November , 1775 , a sound of thunder was heard underground , and immediately afterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of the city . In six minutes 60,000 persons perished . A great concourse of people had collected for safety upon a new quay , built entirely of marble ; but suddenly it sunk down with all the people on it , and not one of the dead bodies ever floated to the surface . A great number of small boats and vessels anchored near it , and , full of people , were swallowed up as in a whirlpool . No fragments of these wrecks ever rose again to the surface ; the water where the quay went down is now 600 feet deep . The area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a portion of the earth 's surface , four times as great as the size of Europe , was simultaneously shaken . It extended from the Baltic to the West Indies , and from Canada to Algiers . At eight leagues from Morocco the ground opened and swallowed a village of 10,000 inhabitants , and closed again over them . It is very probable that the centre of the convulsion was in the bed of the Atlantic , at or near the buried island of Atlantis , and that it was a successor of the great earth throe which , thousands of years before , had brought destruction upon that land . ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS IN 1737 . Ireland also lies near the axis of this great volcanic area , reaching from the Canaries to Iceland , and it has been many times in the past the seat of disturbance . The ancient annals contain numerous accounts of eruptions , preceded by volcanic action . In 1490 , at the Ox Mountains , Sligo , one occurred by which one hundred persons and numbers of cattle were destroyed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill of Knocklade , Antrim , poured a stream of lava sixty yards wide for thirty-nine hours , and destroyed the village of Ballyowen and all the inhabitants , save a man and his wife and two children . ( " Amer . Cyclop. , " art . Ireland . ) While we find Lisbon and Ireland , east of Atlantis , subjected to these great earthquake shocks , the West India Islands , west of the same centre , have been repeatedly visited in a similar manner . In 1692 Jamaica suffered from a violent earthquake . The earth opened , and great quantities of water were cast out ; many people were swallowed up in these rents ; the earth caught some of them by the middle and squeezed them to death ; the heads of others only appeared above-ground . A tract of land near the town of Port Royal , about a thousand acres in extent , sunk down in less than one minute , and the sea immediately rolled in . The Azore Islands are undoubtedly the peaks of the mountains of Atlantis . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suffered severely from eruptions and earthquakes . In 1808 a volcano rose suddenly in San Jorge to the height of 3500 feet , and burnt for six days , desolating the entire island . In 1811 a volcano rose from the sea , near San Miguel , creating an island 300 feet high , which was named Sambrina , but which soon sunk beneath the sea . Similar volcanic eruptions occurred in the Azores in 1691 and 1720 . Along a great line , a mighty fracture in the surface of the globe , stretching north and south through the Atlantic , we find a continuous series of active or extinct volcanoes . In Iceland we have Oerafa , Hecla , and Rauda Kamba ; another in Pico , in the Azores ; the peak of Teneriffe ; Fogo , in one of the Cape de Verde Islands : while of extinct volcanoes we have several in Iceland , and two in Madeira ; while Fernando de Noronha , the island of Ascension , St. Helena , and Tristan d'Acunha are all of volcanic origin . ( " Cosmos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular passage we quote entire from Lyell 's Principles of Geology , " p. 436 : " In the Nautical Magazine for 1835 , p. 642 , and for 1838 , p. 361 , and in the Comptes Rendus , April , 1838 , accounts are given of a series of volcanic phenomena , earthquakes , troubled water , floating scoria , and columns of smoke , which have been observed at intervals since the middle of the last century , in a space of open sea between longitudes 20 deg. and 22 ' W. , about half a degree south of the equator . These facts , says Mr. Darwin , seem to show that an island or archipelago is in process of formation in the middle of the Atlantic . A line joining St. Helena and Ascension would , if prolonged , intersect this slowly nascent focus of volcanic action . Should land be eventually formed here , it will not be the first that has been produced by igneous action in this ocean since it was inhabited by the existing species of testacea . At Porto Praya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal , calcareous stratum occurs , containing shells of recent marine species , covered by a great sheet of basalt eighty feet thick . It would be difficult to estimate too highly the commercial and political importance which a group of islands might acquire if , in the next two or three thousand years , they should rise in mid-ocean between St. Helena and Ascension . " These facts would seem to show that the great fires which destroyed Atlantis are still smouldering in the depths of the ocean ; that the vast oscillations which carried Plato 's continent beneath the sea may again bring it , with all its buried treasures , to the light ; and that even the wild imagination of Jules Verne , when he described Captain Nemo , in his diving armor , looking down upon the temples and towers of the lost island , lit by the fires of submarine volcanoes , had some groundwork of possibility to build upon . But who will say , in the presence of all the facts here enumerated , that the submergence of Atlantis , in some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be shown hereafter , when we come to discuss the Flood legends , every particular which has come down to us of the destruction of Atlantis has been duplicated in some of the accounts just given . We conclude , therefore : 1 . That it is proven beyond question , by geological evidence , that vast masses of land once existed in the region where Atlantis is located by Plato , and that therefore such an island must have existed ; 2 . That there is nothing improbable or impossible in the statement that it was destroyed suddenly by an earthquake " in one dreadful night and day . " CHAPTER . V. THE TESTIMONY OF THE SEA . Suppose we were to find in mid-Atlantic , in front of the Mediterranean , in the neighborhood of the Azores , the remains of an immense island , sunk beneath the sea  --  one thousand miles in width , and two or three thousand miles long  --  would it not go far to confirm the statement of Plato that , " beyond the strait where you place the Pillars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minor ) and Libya combined , " called Atlantis ? And suppose we found that the Azores were the mountain peaks of this drowned island , and were torn and rent by tremendous volcanic convulsions ; while around them , descending into the sea , were found great strata of lava ; and the whole face of the sunken land was covered for thousands of miles with volcanic debris , would we not be obliged to confess that these facts furnished strong corroborative proofs of the truth of Plato 's statement , that " in one day and one fatal night there came mighty earthquakes and inundations which ingulfed that mighty people ? Atlantis disappeared beneath the sea ; and then that sea became inaccessible on account of the quantity of mud which the ingulfed island left in its place . " MAP OF ATLANTIS , WITH ITS ISLANDS AND CONNECTING RIDGES , FROM DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS And all these things recent investigation has proved conclusively . Deep-sea soundings have been made by ships of different nations ; the United States ship Dolphin , the German frigate Gazelle , and the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the Atlantic , and the result is the revelation of a great elevation , reaching from a point on the coast of the British Islands southwardly to the coast of South America , at Cape Orange , thence south-eastwardly to the coast of Africa , and thence southwardly to Tristan d'Acunha . I give one map showing the profile of this elevation in the frontispiece , and another map , showing the outlines of the submerged land , on page 47 . It rises about 9000 feet above the great Atlantic depths around it , and in the Azores , St. Paul 's Rocks , Ascension , and Tristan d'Acunha it reaches the surface of the ocean . Evidence that this elevation was once dry land is found in the fact that " the inequalities , the mountains and valleys of its surface , could never have been produced in accordance with any laws for the deposition of sediment , nor by submarine elevation ; but , on the contrary , must have been carved by agencies acting above the water level . " ( Scientific American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eminent English geologist , is of the opinion that in the Eocene Period a great extension of land existed to the west of Cornwall . Referring to the location of the " Dolphin " and " Challenger " ridges , he asserts that " a great tract of land formerly existed where the sea now is , and that Cornwall , the Scilly and Channel Islands , Ireland and Brittany , are the remains of its highest summits . " ( Popular Science Review , July , 1878 . ) Here , then , we have the backbone of the ancient continent which once occupied the whole of the Atlantic Ocean , and from whose washings Europe and America were constructed ; the deepest parts of the ocean , 3500 fathoms deep , represent those portions which sunk first , to wit , the plains to the east and west of the central mountain range ; some of the loftiest peaks of this range  --  the Azores , St. Paul 's , Ascension , Tristan d'Acunba  --  are still above the ocean level ; while the great body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these " connecting ridges " we see the pathway which once extended between the New World and the Old , and by means of which the plants and animals of one continent travelled to the other ; and by the same avenues black men found their way , as we will show hereafter , from Africa to America , and red men from America to Africa . And , as I have shown , the same great law which gradually depressed the Atlantic continent , and raised the lands east and west of it , is still at work : the coast of Greenland , which may be regarded as the northern extremity of the Atlantic continent , is still sinking " so rapidly that ancient buildings on low rock-islands are now submerged , and the Greenlander has learned by experience never to build near the water 's edge , " ( " North Amer. of Antiq. , " p. 504 . ) The same subsidence is going on along the shore of South Carolina and Georgia , while the north of Europe and the Atlantic coast of South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1180 miles long and from 100 to 1300 feet high , have been traced . When these connecting ridges extended from America to Europe and Africa , they shut off the flow of the tropical waters of the ocean to the north : there was then no " Gulf Stream ; " the land-locked ocean that laved the shores of Northern Europe was then intensely cold ; and the result was the Glacial Period . When the barriers of Atlantis sunk sufficiently to permit the natural expansion of the heated water of the tropics to the north , the ice and snow which covered Europe gradually disappeared ; the Gulf Stream flowed around Atlantis , and it still retains the circular motion first imparted to it by the presence of that island . The officers of the Challenger found the entire ridge of Atlantis covered with volcanic deposits ; these are the subsided mud which , as Plato tells us , rendered the sea impassable after the destruction of the island . It does not follow that , at the time Atlantis was finally ingulfed , the ridges connecting it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gradually subsided into the sea , or have gone down in cataclysms such as are described in the Central American books . The Atlantis of Plato may have been confined to the " Dolphin Ridge " of our map . ANCIENT ISLANDS BETWEEN ATLANTIS AND THE MEDITERRANEAN , FROM DEEP-SEA SOUNDINGS The United States sloop Gettysburg has also made some remarkable discoveries in a neighboring field . I quote from John James Wild ( in Nature , March 1st , 1877 , p. 377 ) : " The recently announced discovery by Commander Gorringe , of the United States sloop Gettysburg , of a bank of soundings bearing N. 85 deg . W. , and distant 130 miles from Cape St. Vincent , during the last voyage of the vessel across the Atlantic , taken in connection with previous soundings obtained in the same region of the North Atlantic , suggests the probable existence of a submarine ridge or plateau connecting the island of Madeira with the coast of Portugal , and the probable subaerial connection in prehistoric times of that island with the south-western extremity of Europe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a channel of an average depth of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms , extending in a northeasterly direction from its entrance between Madeira and the Canary Islands toward Cape St. Vincent . . . . Commander Gorringe , when about 150 miles from the Strait of Gibraltar , found that the soundings decreased from 2700 fathoms to 1600 fathoms in the distance of a few miles . The subsequent soundings ( five miles apart ) gave 900 , 500 , 400 , and 100 fathoms ; and eventually a depth of 32 fathoms was obtained , in which the vessel anchored . The bottom was found to consist of live pink coral , and the position of the bank in lat. 36 deg. 29 ' N. , long . 11 deg. 33 ' W. " The map on page 51 shows the position of these elevations . They must have been originally islands ;  --  stepping-stones , as it were , between Atlantis and the coast of Europe . Sir C. Wyville Thomson found that the specimens of the fauna of the coast of Brazil , brought up in his dredging-machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Europe . This is accounted for by the connecting ridges reaching from Europe to South America . A member of the Challenger staff , in a lecture delivered in London , soon after the termination of the expedition , gave it as his opinion that the great submarine plateau is the remains of " the lost Atlantis . " CHAPTER VI . THE TESTIMONY OF THE FLORA AND FAUNA . Proofs are abundant that there must have been at one time uninterrupted land communication between Europe and America . In the words of a writer upon this subject , " When the animals and plants of the Old and New World are compared , one can not but be struck with their identity ; all or nearly all belong to the same genera , while many , even of the species , are common to both continents . This is most important in its bearing on our theory , as indicating that they radiated from a common centre after the Glacial Period . . . . The hairy mammoth , woolly-haired rhinoceros , the Irish elk , the musk-ox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more or less accompanied this flora , and their remains are always found in the post-glacial deposits of Europe as low down as the South of France . In the New World beds of the same age contain similar remains , indicating that they came from a common centre , and were spread out over both continents alike . " ( Westminster Review , January , 1872 , p. 19 . ) Recent discoveries in the fossil beds of the Bad Lands of Nebraska prove that the horse originated in America . Professor Marsh , of Yale College , has identified the several preceding forms from which it was developed , rising , in the course of ages , from a creature not larger than a fox until , by successive steps , it developed into the true horse . How did the wild horse pass from America to Europe and Asia if there was not continuous land communication between the two continents ? He seems to have existed in Europe in a wild state prior to his domestication by man . The fossil remains of the camel are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . The existing alpacas and llamas of South America are but varieties of the camel family . The cave bear , whose remains are found associated with the hones of the mammoth and the bones and works of man in the caves of Europe , was identical with the grizzly bear of our Rocky Mountains . The musk-ox , whose relics are found in the same deposits , now roams the wilds of Arctic America . The glutton of Northern Europe , in the Stone Age , is identical with the wolverine of the United States . According to Rutimeyer , the ancient bison ( Bos priscus ) of Europe was identical with the existing American buffalo . " Every stage between the ancient cave bison and the European aurochs can be traced . " The Norway elk , now nearly extinct , is identical with the American moose . The Cervus Americanus found in Kentucky was as large as the Irish elk , which it greatly resembled . The lagomys , or tailless hare , of the European eaves , is now found in the colder regions of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far down as France , was the same as the reindeer of America . Remains of the cave lion of Europe ( Felix speloae ) , a larger beast than the largest of the existing species , have been found at Natchez , Mississippi . The European cave wolf was identical with the American wolf . Cattle were domesticated among the people of Switzerland during the earliest part of the Stone Period ( Darwin 's " Animals Under Domestication , " vol. i. , p. 103 ) , that is to say , before the Bronze Age and the Age of Iron . Even at that remote period they had already , by long-continued selection , been developed out of wild forms akin to the American buffalo . M. Gervais ( " Hist . Nat . des Mammifores , " vol. xi. , p. 191 ) concludes that the wild race from which our domestic sheep was derived is now extinct . The remains of domestic sheep are found in the debris of the Swiss lake-dwellings during the Stone Age . The domestic horse , ass , lion , and goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have historical records 7000 years old , and during that time no similar domestication of a wild animal has been made . This fact speaks volumes as to the vast period , of time during which man must have lived in a civilized state to effect the domestication of so many and such useful animals . And when we turn from the fauna to the flora , we find the same state of things . An examination of the fossil beds of Switzerland of the Miocene Age reveals the remains of more than eight hundred different species of flower-bearing plants , besides mosses , ferns , etc . The total number of fossil plants catalogued from those beds , cryptogamous as well as phaenogamous , is upward of three thousand . The majority of these species have migrated to America . There were others that passed into Asia , Africa , and even to Australia . The American types are , however , in the largest proportion . The analogues of the flora of the Miocene Age of Europe now grow in the forests of Virginia , North and South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnolias , tulip-trees , evergreen oaks , maples , plane-trees , robinas , sequoias , etc . It would seem to be impossible that these trees could have migrated from Switzerland to America unless there was unbroken land communication between the two continents . It is a still more remarkable fact that a comparison of the flora of the Old World and New goes to show that not only was there communication by land , over which the plants of one continent could extend to another , but that man must have existed , and have helped this transmigration , in the case of certain plants that were incapable of making the journey unaided . Otto Kuntze , a distinguished German botanist , who has spent many years in the tropics , announces his conclusion that " In America and in Asia the principal domesticated tropical plants are represented by the same species . " He instances the Manihot utilissima , whose roots yield a fine flour ; the tarro ( Colocasia esculenta ) , the Spanish or red pepper , the tomato , the bamboo , the guava , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American origin of tobacco , maize , and the cocoa-nut is proved . He refers to the Paritium tiliaceum , a malvaceous plant , hardly noticed by Europeans , but very highly prized by the natives of the tropics , and cultivated everywhere in the East and West Indies ; it supplies to the natives of these regions so far apart their ropes and cordage . It is always seedless in a cultivated state . It existed in America before the arrival of Columbus . But Professor Kuntze pays especial attention to the banana , or plantain . The banana is seedless . It is found throughout tropical Asia and Africa . Professor Kuntze asks , " In what way was this plant , which can not stand a voyage through the temperate zone , carried to America ? " And yet it was generally cultivated in America before 1492 . Says Professor Kuntze , " It must be remembered that the plantain is a tree-like , herbaceous plant , possessing no easily transportable bulbs , like the potato or the dahlia , nor propagable by cuttings , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root , which , once planted , needs hardly any care , and yet produces the most abundant crop of any known tropical plant . " He then proceeds to discuss how it could have passed from Asia to America . He admits that the roots must have been transported from one country to the other by civilized man . He argues that it could not have crossed the Pacific from Asia to America , because the Pacific is nearly thrice or four times as wide as the Atlantic . The only way he can account for the plantain reaching America is to suppose that it was carried there when the North Pole had a tropical climate ! Is there any proof that civilized man existed at the North Pole when it possessed the climate of Africa ? Is it not more reasonable to suppose that the plantain , or banana , was cultivated by the people of Atlantis , and carried by their civilized agricultural colonies to the east and the west ? Do we not find a confirmation of this view in the fact alluded to by Professor Kuntze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possess seeds must have been under culture for a very long period  --  we have not in Europe a single exclusively seedless , berry-bearing , cultivated plant  --  and hence it is perhaps fair to infer that these plants were cultivated as early as the beginning of the middle of the Diluvial Period . " Is it possible that a plant of this kind could have been cultivated for this immense period of time in both Asia and America ? Where are the two nations , agricultural and highly civilized , on those continents by whom it was so cultivated ? What has become of them ? Where are the traces of their civilization ? All the civilizations of Europe , Asia , and Africa radiated from the Mediterranean ; the Hindoo-Aryans advanced from the north-west ; they were kindred to the Persians , who were next-door neighbors to the Arabians ( cousins of the Phoenicians ) , and who lived along-side of the Egyptians , who had in turn derived their civilization from the Phoenicians . It would be a marvel of marvels if one nation , on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time until it became seedless ; the nation retaining a peaceful , continuous , agricultural civilization during all that time . But to suppose that two nations could have cultivated the same plant , under the same circumstances , on two different continents , for the same unparalleled lapse of time , is supposing an impossibility . We find just such a civilization as was necessary , according to Plato , and under just such a climate , in Atlantis and nowhere else . We have found it reaching , by its contiguous islands , within one hundred and fifty miles of the coast of Europe on the one side , and almost touching the West India Islands on the other , while , by its connecting ridges , it bound together Brazil and Africa . But it may be said these animals and plants may have passed from Asia to America across the Pacific by the continent of Lemuria ; or there may have been continuous land communication at one time at Behring 's Strait . True ; but an examination of the flora of the Pacific States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe and the Atlantic States are not to be seen west of the Rocky Mountains . The magnificent magnolias , the tulip-trees , the plane-trees , etc. , which were found existing in the Miocene Age in Switzerland , and are found at the present day in the United States , are altogether lacking on the Pacific coast . The sources of supply of that region seem to have been far inferior to the sources of supply of the Atlantic States . Professor Asa Gray tells us that , out of sixty-six genera and one hundred and fifty-five species found in the forests cast of the Rocky Mountains , only thirty-one genera and seventy-eight species are found west of the mountains . The Pacific coast possesses no papaw , no linden or basswood , no locust-trees , no cherry-tree large enough for a timber tree , no gum-trees , no sorrel-tree , nor kalmia ; no persimmon-trees , not a holly , only one ash that may be called a timber tree , no catalpa or sassafras , not a single elm or hackberry , not a mulberry , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut . These facts would seem to indicate that the forest flora of North America entered it from the east , and that the Pacific States possess only those fragments of it that were able to struggle over or around the great dividing mountain-chain . We thus see that the flora and fauna of America and Europe testify not only to the existence of Atlantis , but to the fact that in an earlier age it must have extended from the shores of one continent to those of the other ; and by this bridge of land the plants and animals of one region passed to the other . The cultivation of the cotton-plant and the manufacture of its product was known to both the Old and New World . Herodotus describes it ( 450 B.C. ) as the tree of India that bears a fleece more beautiful than that of the sheep . Columbus found the natives of the West Indies using cotton cloth . It was also found in Mexico and Peru . It is a significant fact that the cotton-plant has been found growing wild in many parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would seem to indicate that the plant was a native of America ; and this is confirmed by the superiority of American cotton , and the further fact that the plants taken from America to India constantly degenerate , while those taken from India to America as constantly improve . There is a question whether the potato , maize , and tobacco were not cultivated in China ages before Columbus discovered America . A recent traveller says , " The interior of China , along the course of the Yang-tse-Kiang , is a land full of wonders . In one place piscicultural nurseries line the banks for nearly fifty miles . All sorts of inventions , the cotton-gin included , claimed by Europeans and Americans , are to be found there forty centuries old . Plants , yielding drugs of great value , without number , the familiar tobacco and potato , maize , white and yellow corn , and other plants believed to be indigenous to America , have been cultivated there from time immemorial . " Bonafous ( " Histoire Naturelle du Mais , " Paris , 1826 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word maize , ( Indian corn ) is derived from mahiz or mahis , the name of the plant in the language of the Island of Hayti . And yet , strange to may , in the Lettish and Livonian languages , in the north of Europe , mayse signifies bread ; in Irish , maise is food , and in the Old High German , maz is meat . May not likewise the Spanish maiz have antedated the time of Columbus , and borne testimony to early intercommunication between the people of the Old and New Worlds ? It is to Atlantis we must look for the origin of nearly all our valuable plants . Darwin says ( " Animals and Plants under Domestication , " vol. i. , p. 374 ) , " It has often been remarked that we do not owe a single useful plant to Australia , or the Cape of Good Hope  --  countries abounding to an unparalleled degree with endemic species  --  or to New Zealand , or to America south of the Plata ; and , according to some authors , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the domesticated plants are only found within the limits of what I shall show hereafter was the Empire of Atlantis and its colonies ; for only here was to be found an ancient , long-continuing civilization , capable of developing from a wild state those plants which were valuable to man , including all the cereals on which to-day civilized man depends for subsistence . M. Alphonse de Candolle tells us that we owe 33 useful plants to Mexico , Peru , and Chili . According to the same high authority , of 157 valuable cultivated plants 85 can be traced back to their wild state ; as to 40 , there is doubt as to their origin ; while 32 are utterly unknown in their aboriginal condition . ( " Geograph . Botan . Raisonnee , " 1855 , pp. 810-991 . ) Certain roses  --  the imperial lily , the tuberose and the lilac  --  are said to have been cultivated from such a vast antiquity that they are not known in their wild state . ( Darwin , " Animals and Plants , " vol. i. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable because , as De Candolle has shown , all the plants historically known to have been first cultivated in Europe still exist there in the wild state . ( Ibid . ) The inference is strong that the great cereals  --  wheat , oats , barley , rye , and maize  --  must have been first domesticated in a vast antiquity , or in some continent which has since disappeared , carrying the original wild plants with it . CEREALS OF THE AGE OF STONE IN EUROPE Darwin quotes approvingly the opinion of Mr. Bentham ( " Hist . Notes Cult . Plants " ) , " as the result of all the most reliable evidence that none of the Ceralia  --  wheat , rye , barley , and oats  --  exist or have existed truly wild in their present state . " In the Stone Age of Europe five varieties of wheat and three of barley were cultivated . ( Darwin , " Animals and Plants , " vol. i. , p. 382 . ) He says that it may be inferred , from the presence in the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptian wheat , and from the nature of the weeds that grew among their crops , " that the lake inhabitants either still kept up commercial intercourse with some southern people , or had originally proceeded as colonists from the south . " I should argue that they were colonists from the land where wheat and barley were first domesticated , to wit , Atlantis . And when the Bronze Age came , we find oats and rye making their appearance with the weapons of bronze , together with a peculiar kind of pea . Darwin concludes ( Ibid. , vol. i. , p. 385 ) that wheat , barley , rye , and oats were either descended from ten or fifteen distinct species , " most of which are now unknown or extinct , " or from four or eight species closely resembling our present forms , or so " widely different as to escape identification ; " in which latter case , he says , " man must have cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period , " and at that time practised " some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vol. i. , p. 578 ) expresses the opinion that the ancient Assyrians possessed the pineapple . " The representation on the monuments is so exact that I can scarcely doubt the pineapple being intended . " ( See Layard 's " Nineveh and Babylon , " p. 338 . ) The pineapple ( Bromelia ananassa ) is supposed to be of American origin , and unknown to Europe before the time of Columbus ; and yet , apart from the revelations of the Assyrian monuments , there has been some dispute upon this point . ( " Amer . Cyclop. , " vol. xiii. , p. .528 . ) ANCIENT IRISH PIPES It is not even certain that the use of tobacco was not known to the colonists from Atlantis settled in Ireland in an age long prior to Sir Walter Raleigh . Great numbers of pipes have been found in the raths and tumuli of Ireland , which , there is every reason to believe , were placed there by men of the Prehistoric Period . The illustration on p. 63 represents some of the so-called " Danes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy . The Danes entered Ireland many centuries before the time of Columbus , and if the pipes are theirs , they must have used tobacco , or some substitute for it , at that early period . It is probable , however , that the tumuli of Ireland antedate the Danes thousands of years . ANCIENT INDIAN PIPE , NEW JERSEY Compare these pipes from the ancient mounds of Ireland with the accompanying picture of an Indian pipe of the Stone Age of New Jersey . ( " Smithsonian Rep. , " 1875 , p. 342 . ) Recent Portuguese travellers have found the most remote tribes of savage negroes in Africa , holding no commercial intercourse with Europeans , using strangely shaped pipes , in which they smoked a plant of the country . Investigations in America lead to the conclusion that tobacco was first burnt as an incense to the gods , the priest alone using the pipe ; and from this beginning the extraordinary practice spread to the people , and thence over all the world . It may have crossed the Atlantic in a remote age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonists to raise the tobacco-plant . PART II . THE DELUGE . CHAPTER I. THE DESTRUCTION OF ATLANTIS DESCRIBED IN THE DELUGE LEGENDS . Having demonstrated , as we think successfully , that there is no improbability in the statement of Plato that a large island , almost a continent , existed in the past in the Atlantic Ocean , nay , more , that it is a geological certainty that it did exist ; and having further shown that it is not improbable but very possible that it may have sunk beneath the sea in the manner described by Plato , we come now to the next question , Is the memory of this gigantic catastrophe preserved among the traditions of mankind ? We think there can be no doubt that an affirmative answer must be given to this question . An event , which in a few hours destroyed , amid horrible convulsions , an entire country , with all its vast population-that Population the ancestors of the great races of both continents , and they themselves the custodians of the civilization of their age-could not fail to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project its gloomy shadow over all human history . And hence , whether we turn to the Hebrews , the Aryans , the Phoenicians , the Greeks , the Cushites , or the inhabitants of America , we find everywhere traditions of the Deluge ; and we shall see that all these traditions point unmistakably to the destruction of Atlantis . Francois Lenormant says ( Contemp . Rev. , Nov. , 1879 ) : " The result authorizes us to affirm the story of the Deluge to be a universal tradition among all branches of the human race , with the one exception , however , of the black . Now , a recollection thus precise and concordant can not be a myth voluntarily invented . No religious or cosmogonic myth presents this character of universality . It must arise from the reminiscence of a real and terrible event , so powerfully impressing the imagination of the first ancestors of our race as never to have been forgotten by their descendants . This cataclysm must have occurred near the first cradle of mankind , and before the dispersion of the families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be at once improbable and uncritical to admit that , at as many different points of the globe as we should have to assume in order to explain the wide spread of these traditions , local phenomena so exactly alike should have occurred , their memory having assumed an identical form , and presenting circumstances that need not necessarily have occurred to the mind in such cases . " Let us observe , however , that probably the diluvian tradition is not primitive , but imported in America ; that it undoubtedly wears the aspect of an importation among the rare populations of the yellow race where it is found ; and lastly , that it is doubtful among the Polynesians of Oceania . There will still remain three great races to which it is undoubtedly peculiar , who have not borrowed it from each other , but among whom the tradition is primitive , and goes back to the most ancient times , and these three races are precisely the only ones of which the Bible speaks as being descended from Noah  --  those of which it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This observation . which I hold to be undeniable , attaches a singularly historic and exact value to the tradition as recorded by the Sacred Book , even if , on the other hand , it may lead to giving it a more limited geographical and ethnological significance . . . . " But , as the case now stands , we do not hesitate to declare that , far from being a myth , the Biblical Deluge is a real and historical fact , having , to say the least , left its impress on the ancestors of three races  --  Aryan , or Indo-European , Semitic , or Syro-Arabian , Chamitic , or Cushite  --  that is to say , on the three great civilized races of the ancient world , those which constitute the higher humanity  --  before the ancestors of those races had as yet separated , and in the part of Asia they together inhabited . " Such profound scholars and sincere Christians as M. Schwoebel ( Paris , 1858 ) , and M. Omalius d'Halloy ( Bruxelles , 1866 ) , deny the universality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the principal centre of humanity , to those who remained near its primitive cradle , without reaching the scattered tribes who had already spread themselves far away in almost desert regions . It is certain that the Bible narrative commences by relating facts common to the whole human species , confining itself subsequently to the annals of the race peculiarly chosen by the designs of Providence . " ( Lenormant and Chevallier , " Anc . Hist. of the East , " p. 44 . ) This theory is supported by that eminent authority on anthropology , M. de Quatrefages , as well as by Cuvier ; the Rev. R. p . Bellynck , S.J. , admits that it has nothing expressly opposed to orthodoxy . Plato identifies " the great deluge of all " with the destruction of Atlantis . The priest of Sais told Solon that before " the great deluge of all " Athens possessed a noble race , who performed many noble deeds , the last and greatest of which was resisting the attempts of Atlantis to subjugate them ; and after this came the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that island destroyed a number of the Greeks . So that the Egyptians , who possessed the memory of many partial deluges , regarded this as " the great deluge of all . " CHAPTER II . THE DELUGE OF THE BIBLE We give first the Bible history of the Deluge , as found in Genesis ( chap . vi . to chap . viii . ) : " And it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them , that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose . " And the Lord said , My Spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years . " There were giants in the earth in those days ; and also after that , when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men , and they bare children to them , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renown . " And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually . And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart . And the Lord said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that I have made them . But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord . " These are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God . And Noah begat three sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth . " The earth also was corrupt before God ; and the earth was filled with violence . And God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth . Make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch . And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits . A window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it . And , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and everything that is in the earth shall die . But with thee will I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee . And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female . Of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind ; two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive . And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them . " Thus did Noah ; according to all that God commanded him , so did he . " And the Lord said unto Noah , Come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation . Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male and his female . Of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth . For yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth . " And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him . And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth . " And Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood . Of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls , and of everything that creepeth upon the earth , there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female , as God had commanded Noah . " And it came to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were upon the earth . In the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights . In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ; they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort . And they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life . And they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lifted up above the earth . And the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went Upon the face of the waters . And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high bills , that were under the whole heaven , were covered . Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered . And all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man : all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died . And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ark . And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days . " And God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters assuaged . The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained . And the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated . And the ark rested in the seventh mouth , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat . And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the mouth , were the tops of the mountains seen . " And it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made : and he sent forth a raven , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried up from off the earth . Also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground . But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark ; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth . Then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark . And he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark . And the dove came in to him in the evening , and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth . And he stayed yet other seven days , and sent forth the dove , which returned not again unto him any more . " And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth : and Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry . And in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried . " And God spake unto Noah , saying , Go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ' wives with thee . Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth . " And Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him : every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark . " And Noah builded an altar unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar . And the Lord smelled a sweet savour ; and the Lord said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth : neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done . While the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . " Let us briefly consider this record . It shows , taken in connection with the opening chapters of Genesis : 1 . That the land destroyed by water was the country in which the civilization of the human race originated . Adam was at first naked ( Gen. , chap . iii. , 7 ) ; then he clothed himself in leaves ; then in the skins of animals ( chap . iii. , 21 ) : he was the first that tilled the earth , having emerged from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forest ( chap . ii. , 16 ) ; his son Abel was the first of those that kept flocks of sheep ( chap . iv. , 2 ) ; his son Cain was the builder of the first city ( chap . iv. , 17 ) ; his descendant , Tubal-cain , was the first metallurgist ( chap . iv. , 22 ) ; Jabal was the first that erected tents and kept cattle ( chap . iv. , 20 ) ; Jubal was the first that made musical instruments . We have here the successive steps by which a savage race advances to civilization . We will see hereafter that the Atlanteans passed through precisely similar stages of development . 2 . The Bible agrees with Plato in the statement that these Antediluvians had reached great populousness and wickedness , and that it was on account of their wickedness God resolved to destroy them . 3 . In both cases the inhabitants of the doomed land were destroyed in a great catastrophe by the agency of water ; they were drowned . 4 . The Bible tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mankind had dwelt in a happy , peaceful , sinless condition in a Garden of Eden . Plato tells us the same thing of the earlier ages of the Atlanteans. 6 . In both the Bible history and Plato 's story the destruction of the people was largely caused by the intermarriage of the superior or divine race , " the sons of God , " with an inferior stock , " the children of men , " whereby they were degraded and rendered wicked . We will see hereafter that the Hebrews and their Flood legend are closely connected with the Phoenicians , whose connection with Atlantis is established in many ways . It is now conceded by scholars that the genealogical table given in the Bible ( Gen. , chap . x. ) is not intended to include the true negro races , or the Chinese , the Japanese , the Finns or Lapps , the Australians , or the American red men . It refers altogether to the Mediterranean races , the Aryans , the Cushites , the Phoenicians , the Hebrews , and the Egyptians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the dark-brown races . ( See Winchell 's " Preadamites , " chap . vii . ) If these races ( the Chinese , Australians , Americans , etc. ) are not descended from Noah they could not have been included in the Deluge . If neither China , Japan , America , Northern Europe , nor Australia were depopulated by the Deluge , the Deluge could not have been universal . But as it is alleged that it did destroy a country , and drowned all the people thereof except Noah and his family , the country so destroyed could not have been Europe , Asia , Africa , America , or Australia , for there has been no universal destruction of the people of those regions ; or , if there had been , how can we account for the existence to-day of people on all of those continents whose descent Genesis does not trace back to Noah , and , in fact , about whom the writer of Genesis seems to have known nothing ? We are thus driven to one of two alternative conclusions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or it relates to some land other than Europe , Asia , Africa , or Australia , some land that was destroyed by water . It is not fabulous ; and the land it refers to is not Europe , Asia , Africa , or Australia  --  but Atlantis . No other land is known to history or tradition that was overthrown in a great catastrophe by the agency of water ; that was civilized , populous , powerful , and given over to wickedness . That high and orthodox authority , Francois Lenormant , says ( " Ancient Hist. of the East , " vol. i. , p. 64 ) , " The descendants of Shem , Ham , and Japhet , so admirably catalogued by Moses , include one only of the races of humanity , the white race , whose three chief divisions he gives us as now recognized by anthropologists . The other three races  --  yellow , black , and red  --  have no place in the Bible list of nations sprung from Noah . " As , therefore , the Deluge of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have been universal . The religious world does not pretend to fix the location of the Garden of Eden . The Rev. George Leo Haydock says , " The precise situation can not be ascertained ; bow great might be its extent we do not know ; " and we will see hereafter that the unwritten traditions of the Church pointed to a region in the west , beyond the ocean which bounds Europe in that direction , as the locality in which " mankind dwelt before the Deluge . " It will be more and more evident , as we proceed in the consideration of the Flood legends of other nations , that the Antediluvian World was none other than Atlantis . CHAPTER III . THE DELUGE OF THE CHALDEANS . We have two versions of the Chaldean story  --  unequally developed , indeed , but exhibiting a remarkable agreement . The one most anciently known , and also the shorter , is that which Berosus took from the sacred books of Babylon , and introduced into the history that he wrote for the use of the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chaldean priest continues thus . " Obartes Elbaratutu being dead , his son Xisuthros ( Khasisatra ) reigned eighteen sares ( 64,800 years ) . It was under him that the Great Deluge took place , the history of which is told in the sacred documents as follows : Cronos ( Ea ) appeared to him in his sleep , and announced that on the fifteenth of the month of Daisios ( the Assyrian month Sivan  --  a little before the summer solstice ) all men should perish by a flood . He therefore commanded him to take the beginning , the middle , and the end of whatever was consigned to writing , and to bury it in the City of the Sun , at Sippara ; then to build a vessel , and to enter it with his family and dearest friends ; to place in this vessel provisions to eat and drink , and to cause animals , birds , and quadrupeds to enter it ; lastly , to prepare everything , for navigation . And when Xisuthros inquired in what direction he should steer his bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and enjoined to pray that good might come of it for men . " Xisuthros obeyed , and constructed a vessel five stadia long and five broad ; he collected all that had been prescribed to him , and embarked his wife , his children , and his intimate friends . " The Deluge having come , and soon going down , Xisuthros loosed some of the birds . These , finding no food nor place to alight on , returned to the ship . A few days later Xisuthros again let them free , but they returned again to the vessel , their feet fall of mud . Finally , loosed the third time , the birds came no more back . Then Xisuthros understood that the earth was bare . He made an opening in the roof of the ship , and saw that it had grounded on the top of a mountain . He then descended with his wife , his daughter , and his pilot , who worshipped the earth , raised an altar , and there sacrificed to the gods ; at the same moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had remained in the vessel , not seeing Xisutbros return , descended too , and began to seek him , calling him by his name . They saw Xisuthros no more ; but a voice from heaven was heard commanding them piety toward the gods ; that he , indeed , was receiving the reward of his piety in being carried away to dwell thenceforth in the midst of the gods , and that his wife , his daughter , and the pilot of the ship shared the same honor . The voice further said that they were to return to Babylon , and , conformably to the decrees of fate , disinter the writings buried at Sippara in order to transmit them to men . It added that the country in which they found themselves was Armenia . These , then , having heard the voice , sacrificed to the gods and returned on foot to Babylon . Of the vessel of Xisuthros , which had finally landed in Armenia , a portion scraped from its fragments . It is used to keep off the influence of witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Babylon , disinterred the writings left at Sippara , founded numerous cities , built temples , and restored Babylon . " " By the side of this version , " says Lenormant , " which , interesting though it be , is , after all , second-hand , we are now able to place an original Chaldeo-Babylonian edition , which the lamented George Smith was the first to decipher on the cuneiform tablets exhumed at Nineveh , and now in the British Museum . Here the narrative of the Deluge appears as an episode in the eleventh tablet , or eleventh chant of the great epic of the town of Uruk . The hero of this poem , a kind of Hercules , whose name has not as yet been made out with certainty , being attacked by disease ( a kind of leprosy ) , goes , with a view to its cure , to consult the patriarch saved from the Deluge , Khasisatra , in the distant land to which the gods have transported him , there to enjoy eternal felicity . He asks Khasisatra to reveal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of immortality , and thus the patriarch is induced to relate the cataclysm . " By a comparison of the three copies of the poem that the library of the palace of Nineveh contained , it has been possible to restore the narrative with hardly any breaks . These three copies were , by order of the King of Assyria , Asshurbanabal , made in the eighth century B.C. , from a very ancient specimen in the sacerdotal library of the town of Uruk , founded by the monarchs of the first Chaldean empire . It is difficult precisely to fix the date of the original , copied by Assyrian scribes , but it certainly goes back to the ancient empire , seventeen centuries at least before our era , and even probably beyond ; it was therefore much anterior to Moses , and nearly contemporaneous with Abraham . The variations presented by the three existing copies prove that the original was in the primitive mode of writing called the hieratic , a character which must have already become difficult to decipher in the eighth century B.C. , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain signs , and in other cases have simply reproduced exactly the forms of such as they did not understand . Finally , it results from a comparison of these variations , that the original , transcribed by order of Asshurbanabal , must itself have been a copy of some still more ancient manuscript , it , which the original text had already received interlinear comments . Some of the copyists have introduced these into their text , others have omitted them . With these preliminary observations , I proceed to give integrally the narrative ascribed ill the poem to Khasisatra : " ' I will reveal to thee , O Izdhubar , the history of my preservation-and tell to thee the decision of the gods . " ' The town of Shurippak , a town which thou knowest , is situated on the Euphrates  --  it was ancient , and in it men did not honor the gods . I alone , I was their servant , to the great gods  --  The gods took counsel on the appeal of Ann  --  a deluge was proposed by Bel  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And the god Ea , the immutable lord , repeated this command in a dream .  --  I listened to the decree of fate that he announced , and he said to me :  --  " Man of Shurippak , son of Ubaratutu  --  thou , build a vessel and finish it quickly .  --  By a deluge I will destroy substance and life .  --  Cause thou to go up into the vessel the substance of all that has life .  --  The vessel thou shall build-600 cubits shall be the measure of its length  --  and 60 cubits the amount of its breadth and of its height . Launch it thus on the ocean , and cover it with a roof . "  --  I understood , and I said to Ea , my lord :  --  " The vessel that thou commandest me to build thus  --  when I shall do it ,  --  young and old shall laugh at me. "  --  Ea opened his mouth and spoke .  --  He said to me , his servant :  --  " If they laugh at thee thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has insulted me , for the protection of the gods is over me.  --  . . . like to caverns . . .  --  . . .

At a given moment that I shall cause thee to know ,  --  enter into it , and draw the door of the ship toward thee .  --  Within it , thy grains , thy furniture , thy provisions , thy riches , thy men-servants , and thy maid-servants , and thy young people  --  the cattle of the field , and the wild beasts of the plain that I will assemble-and that I will send thee , shall be kept behind thy door . "  --  Khasisatra opened his mouth and spoke ;  --  he said to Ea , his lord :  --  " No one has made such a ship .  --  On the prow I will fix . . .  --  I shall see . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou commandest me to build thus which in . . .

" ' Shamash ( the sun ) made the moment determined , and he announced it in these terms :  --  " In the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the vessel and close the door .

"  --  They carried me away , and established me in a remote place at the mouth of the streams . ' " " This narrative , " says Lenormant , " follows with great exactness the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genesis ; and the analogies are , on both sides , striking . " When we consider these two forms of the same legend , we see many points wherein the story points directly to Atlantis. 1 . In the first place , Berosus tells us that the god who gave warning of the coming of the Deluge was Chronos . Chronos , it is well known , was the same as Saturn . Saturn was an ancient king of Italy , who , far anterior to the founding of Rome , introduced civilization from some other country to the Italians . He established industry and social order , filled the land with plenty , and created the golden age of Italy . He was suddenly removed to the abodes of the gods . His name is connected , in the mythological legends , with " a great Saturnian continent " in the Atlantic Ocean , and a great kingdom which , in the remote ages , embraced Northern Africa and the European coast of the Mediterranean as far as the peninsula of Italy , and " certain islands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the story of Plato as to the dominions of Atlantis . The Romans called the Atlantic Ocean " Chronium Mare , " the Sea of Chronos , thus identifying Chronos with that ocean . The pillars of Hercules were also called by the ancients " the pillars of Chronos . " Here , then , we have convincing testimony that the country referred to in the Chaldean legends was the land of Chronos , or Saturn  --  the ocean world , the dominion of Atlantis. 2 . Hea or Ea , the god of the Nineveh tablets , was a fish-god : he was represented in the Chaldean monuments as half man and half fish ; he was described as the god , not of the rivers and seas , but of " the abyss "  --  to wit , the ocean . He it was who was said to have brought civilization and letters to the ancestors of the Assyrians . He clearly represented an ancient , maritime , civilized nation ; he came from the ocean , and was associated with some land and people that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of the Deluge is located on the Euphrates proves nothing , for we will see hereafter that almost every nation had its especial mountain on which , according to its traditions , the ark rested ; just as every Greek tribe had its own particular mountain of Olympos . The god Bel of the legend was the Baal of the Phoenicians , who , as we shall show , were of Atlantean origin . Bel , or Baal , was worshipped on the western and northern coasts of Europe , and gave his name to the Baltic , the Great and Little Belt , Balesbaugen , Balestranden , etc. ; and to many localities , in the British Islands , as , for instance , Belan and the Baal hills in Yorkshire . 3 . In those respects wherein the Chaldean legend , evidently the older form of the tradition , differs from the Biblical record , we see that in each instance we approach nearer to Atlantis . The account given in Genesis is the form of the tradition that would be natural to an inland people . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fountains of the great deep " ( about which I shall speak more fully hereafter ) , the principal destruction seems to have been accomplished by rain ; hence the greater period allowed for the Deluge , to give time enough for the rain to fall , and subsequently drain off from the land . A people dwelling in the midst of a continent could not conceive the possibility of a whole world sinking beneath the sea ; they therefore supposed the destruction to have been , caused by a continuous down-pour of rain for forty days and forty nights . In the Chaldean legend , on the contrary , the rain lasted but seven days ; and we see that the writer had a glimpse of the fact that the destruction occurred in the midst of or near the sea . The ark of Genesis ( tebah ) was simply a chest , a coffer , a big box , such as might be imagined by an inland people . The ark of the Chaldeans was a veritable ship ; it had a prow , a helm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it navigated " the sea . " 4 . The Chaldean legend represents not a mere rain-storm , but a tremendous cataclysm . There was rain , it is true , but there was also thunder , lightning , earthquakes , wind , a water-spout , and a devastation of mountain and land by the war of the elements . All the dreadful forces of nature were fighting together over the doomed land : " the archangel of the abyss brought destruction , " " the water rose to the sky , " " the brother no longer saw his brother ; men no longer knew each other ; " the men " filled the sea like fishes ; " the sea was filled with mud , and " the corpses floated like sea-weed . " When the storm abated the land had totally disappeared-there was no longer " any continent . " Does not all this accord with " that dreadful day and night " described by Plato ? 5 . In the original it appears that Izdhubar , when he started to find the deified Khasisatra , travelled first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then secured the services of a boatman , and , entering a ship , sailed for fifteen days before finding the Chaldean Noah . This would show that Khasisatra dwelt in a far country , one only attainable by crossing the water ; and this , too , seems like a reminiscence of the real site of Atlantis . The sea which a sailing-vessel required fifteen days to cross must have been a very large body of water ; in fact , an ocean . CHAPTER IV . THE DELUGE LEGENDS OF OTHER NATIONS . A collection of the Deluge legends of other nations will throw light upon the Biblical and Chaldean records of that great event . The author of the treatise " On the Syrian Goddess " acquaints us with the diluvian tradition of the Arameans , directly derived from that of Chaldea , as it was narrated in the celebrated Sanctuary of Hierapolis , or Bambyce . " The generality of people , " he says , " tells us that the founder of the temple was Deucalion Sisythes  --  that Deucalion in whose time the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Greeks themselves of Deucalion ; the myth runs thus : The actual race of men is not the first , for there was a previous one , all the members of which perished . We belong to a second race , descended from Deucalion , and multiplied in the course of time . As to the former men , they are said to have been full of insolence and pride , committing many crimes , disregarding their oath , neglecting the rights of hospitality , unsparing to suppliants ; accordingly , they were punished by an immense disaster . All on a sudden enormous volumes of water issued from the earth , and rains of extraordinary abundance began to fall ; the rivers left their beds , and the sea overflowed its shores ; the whole earth was covered with water , and all men perished . Deucalion alone , because of his virtue and piety , was preserved alive to give birth to a new race . This is how he was saved : He placed himself , his children , and his wives in a great coffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lions , serpents , and all other terrestrial animals came to seek refuge with him . He received them all ; and while they were in the coffer Zeus inspired them with reciprocal amity , which prevented their devouring one another . In this manner , shut up within one single coffer , they floated as long as the waters remained in force . Such is the account given by the Greeks of Deucalion . " But to this , which they equally tell , the people of Hierapolis add a marvellous narrative : That in their country a great chasm opened , into which all the waters of the Deluge poured . Then Deucalion raised an altar , and dedicated a temple to Hera ( Atargatis ) close to this very chasm . I have seen it ; it is very narrow , and situated under the temple . Whether it was once large , and has now shrunk , I do not know ; but I have seen it , and it is quite small . In memory of the event the following is the rite accomplished : Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only done by the priests , but numerous pilgrims come from the whole of Syria and Arabia , and even from beyond the Euphrates , bringing water . It is poured out in the temple and goes into the cleft , which , narrow as it is , swallows up a considerable quantity . This is said to be in virtue of a religious law instituted by Deucalion to preserve the memory of the catastrophe , and of the benefits that he received from the gods . Such is the ancient tradition of the temple . " " It appears to me difficult , " says Lenormant , " not to recognize an echo of fables popular in all Semitic countries about this chasm of Hierapolis , and the part it played in the Deluge , in the enigmatic expressions of the Koran respecting the oven ( tannur ) which began to bubble and disgorge water all around at the commencement of the Deluge . We know that this tannur has been the occasion of most grotesque imaginings of Mussulman commentators , who had lost the tradition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Koran formally states that the waters of the Deluge were absorbed in the bosom of the earth . " Here the Xisuthros of Berosus becomes Deucalion-Sisythes . The animals are not collected together by Deucalion , as in the case of Noah and Khasisatra , but they crowded into the vessel of their own accord , driven by the terror with which the storm had inspired them ; as in great calamities the creatures of the forest have been known to seek refuge in the houses of men . India affords us art account of the Deluge which , by its poverty , strikingly contrasts with that of the Bible and the Chaldeans . Its most simple and ancient form is found in the Catapatha Brahmana of the Rig-Veda . It has been translated for the first time by Max Mueller . " One morning water for washing was brought to Manu , and when he had washed himself a fish remained in his hands , and it addressed these words to him : ' Protect me , and I will save thee . ' ' From what wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all creatures away ; it is from that I will save thee . ' ' How shall I protect thee ? ' The fish replied , ' While we are small we run great dangers , for fish swallow fish . Keep me at first in a vase ; when I become too large for it , dig a basin to put me into . When I shall have grown still more , throw me into the ocean ; then I shall be preserved from destruction . ' Soon it grew a large fish . It said to Mann , ' The very year I shall have reached my full growth the Deluge will happen . Then build a vessel and worship me . When the waters rise , enter the vessel , and I will save thee . ' " After keeping him thus , Mann carried the fish to the sea . In the year indicated Mann built a vessel and worshipped the fish . And when the Deluge came he entered the vessel . Then the fish came swimming up to him , and Mann fastened the cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which means the latter made it pass over the Mountain of the North . The fish said , ' I have saved thee ; fasten the vessel to a tree , that the water may not sweep it away while thou art on the mountain ; and in proportion as the waters decrease thou shalt descend . ' Manu descended with the waters , and this is what is called the descent of Manu on the Mountain of the North . The Deluge had carried away all creatures , and Mann remained alone . " There is another form of the Hindoo legend in the Puranas . Lenormant says : " We must also ' remark that in the Puranas it is no longer Manu Vaivasata that the divine fish saves from the Deluge , but a different personage , the King of the Dastas  --  i. e. , fisher  --  Satyravata , ' the man who loves justice and truth , ' strikingly corresponding to the Chaldean Khasisatra . Nor is the Puranic version of the Legend of the Deluge to be despised , though it be of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In certain aspects it is less Aryanized than that of Brahmana or than the Mahabharata ; and , above all , it gives some circumstances omitted in these earlier versions , which must yet have belonged to the original foundation , since they appear in the Babylonian legend ; a circumstance preserved , no doubt , by the oral tradition  --  popular , and not Brahmanic  --  with which the Puranas are so deeply imbued . This has already been observed by Pictet , who lays due stress on the following passage of the Bhagavata-Purana : ' In seven days , ' said Vishnu to Satyravata , ' the three worlds shall be submerged . ' There is nothing like this in the Brahmana nor the Mahabharata , but in Genesis the Lord says to Noah , ' Yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth ; ' and a little farther we read , ' After seven days the waters of the flood were upon the earth . ' . . . Nor must we pay less attention to the directions given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a safe place , in order to preserve them from Hayagriva , a marine horse dwelling in the abyss . . . . We recognize in it , under an Indian garb , the very tradition of the interment of the sacred writings at Sippara by Khasisatra , such as we have seen it in the fragment of Berosus . " The references to " the three worlds " and the " fish-god " in these legends point to Atlantis . The " three worlds " probably refers to the great empire of Atlantis , described by Plato , to wit , the western continent , America , the eastern continent , Europe and Africa , considered as one , and the island of Atlantis . As we have seen , Poseidon , the founder of the civilization of Atlantis , is identical with Neptune , who is always represented riding a dolphin , bearing a trident , or three-pronged symbol , in his hand , emblematical probably of the triple kingdom . He is thus a sea-god , or fish-god , and he comes to save the representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular form of the legend in the following . Lenormant says : " Among the Iranians , in the sacred books containing the fundamental Zoroastrian doctrines , and dating very far back , we meet with a tradition which must assuredly be looked upon as a variety of that of the Deluge , though possessing a special character , and diverging in some essential particulars from those we have been examining . It relates how Yima , who , in the original and primitive conception , was the father of the human race , was warned by Ahuramazda , the good deity , of the earth being about to be devastated by a flood . The god ordered Yima to construct a refuge , a square garden , vara , protected by an enclosure , and to cause the germs of men , beasts , and plants to enter it , in order to escape annihilation . Accordingly , when the inundation occurred , the garden of Yima , with all that it contained , was alone spared , and the message of safety was brought thither by the bird Karshipta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " vol. ii. , p. 46 . ) This clearly signifies that , prior to the destruction of Atlantis , a colony had been sent out to some neighboring country . These emigrants built a walled town , and brought to it the grains and domestic animals of the mother country ; and when the island of Atlantis sunk in the ocean , a messenger brought the terrible tidings to them in a ship . " The Greeks had two principal legends as to the cataclysm by which primitive humanity was destroyed . The first was connected with the name of Ogyges , the most ancient of the kings of Boeotia or Attica  --  a quite mythical personage , lost in the night of ages , his very name seemingly derived from one signifying deluge in Aryan idioms , in Sanscrit Angha . It is said that in his time the whole land was covered by a flood , whose waters reached the sky , and from which he , together with some companions , escaped in a vessel . " The second tradition is the Thessalian legend of Deucalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of bronze , with whose crimes he was wroth , Deucalion , by the advice of Prometheus , his father , constructed a coffer , in which he took refuge with his wife , Pyrrha . The Deluge came ; the chest , or coffer , floated at the mercy of the waves for nine days and nine nights , and was finally stranded on Mount Parnassus . Deucalion and Pyrrha leave it , offer sacrifice , and , according to the command of Zeus , repeople the world by throwing behind them ' the bones of the earth '  --  namely , stones , which change into men . This Deluge of Deucalion is , in Grecian tradition , what most resembles a universal deluge . Many authors affirm that it extended to the whole earth , and that the whole human race perished . At Athens , in memory of the event , and to appease the manes of its victims , a ceremony called Hydrophoria was observed , having so close a resemblance to that in use at Hierapolis , in Syria , that we can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result of an assimilation established in remote antiquity between the Deluge of Deucalion and that of Khasisatra , as described by the author of the treatise ' On the Syrian Goddess . ' Close to the temple of the Olympian Zeus a fissure in the soil was shown , in length but one cubit , through which it was said the waters of the Deluge had been swallowed up . Thus , every year , on the third day of the festival of the Anthesteria , a day of mourning consecrated to the dead  --  that is , on the thirteenth of the month of Anthesterion , toward the beginning of March-it was customary , as at Bambyce , to pour water into the fissure , together with flour mixed with honey , poured also into the trench dug to the west of the tomb , in the funeral sacrifices of the Athenians . " In this legend , also , there are passages which point to Atlantis . We will see hereafter that the Greek god Zeus was one of the kings of Atlantis . " The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doomed people ; they were the great metallurgists of their day , who , as we will see , were probably the source of the great number of implements and weapons of bronze found all over Europe . Here , also , while no length of time is assigned to the duration of the storm , we find that the ark floated but nine days and nights . Noah was one year and ten days in the ark , Khasisatra was not half that time , while Deucalion was afloat only nine days . At Megara , in Greece , it was the eponym of the city , Megaros , son of Zeus and one of the nymphs , Sithnides , who , warned by the cry of cranes of the imminence of the danger of the coming flood , took refuge on Mount Geranien . Again , there was the Thessalian Cerambos , who was said to have escaped the flood by rising into the air on wings given him by the nymphs ; and it was Perirrhoos , son of Eolus , that Zeus Naios had preserved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero of the Deluge was Merops , son of Hyas , who there assembled under his rule the remnant of humanity preserved with him . The traditions of Rhodes only supposed the Telchines , those of Crete Sasion , to have escaped the cataclysm . In Samothracia the same character was attributed to Saon , said to be the son of Zeus or of Hermes . It will be observed that in all these legends the name of Zeus , King of Atlantis , reappears . It would appear probable that many parties had escaped from the catastrophe , and had landed at the different points named in the traditions ; or else that colonies had already been established by the Atlanteans at those places . It would appear impossible that a maritime people could be totally destroyed ; doubtless many were on shipboard in the harbors , and others going and coming on distant voyages . " The invasion of the East , " says Baldwin ( ' Prehistoric Nations , ' p. 396 ) , " to which the story of Atlantis refers , seems to have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most splendid festivals in honor of Athena celebrated in Attica . These festivals are said to have been established by Erichthonis in the most ancient times remembered by the historical traditions of Athens . Boeckh says of them , in his ' Commentary on Plato : ' " ' In the greater Panathenae there was carried in procession a peplum of Minerva , representing the war with the giants and the victory of the gods of Olympus . In the lesser Panathenae they carried another peplum ( covered with symbolic devices ) , which showed how the Athenians , supported by Minerva , had the advantage in the war with the Atlantes . ' A scholia quoted from Proclus by Humboldt and Boeckh says : ' The historians who speak of the islands of the exterior sea tell us that in their time there were seven islands consecrated , to Proserpine , and three others of immense extent , of which the first was consecrated to Pluto , the second to Ammon , and the third to Neptune . The inhabitants of the latter had preserved a recollection ( transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantis , which was extremely large , and for a long time held sway over all the islands of the Atlantic Ocean . Atlantis was also consecrated to Neptune . " ' ( See Humboldt 's " Histoire de la Geographie du Nouveau Continent , " vol. i . ) No one can read these legends and doubt that the Flood watt an historical reality . It is impossible that in two different places in the Old World , remote from each other , religious ceremonies should have been established and perpetuated from age to age in memory of an event which never occurred . We have seen that at Athens and at Hierapolis , in Syria , pilgrims came from a distance to appease the god of the earthquake , by pouring offerings into fissures of the earth said to have been made at the time Atlantis was destroyed . More than this , we know from Plato 's history that the Athenians long preserved in their books the memory of a victory won over the Atlanteans in the early ages , and celebrated it by national festivals , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask us to believe that Biblical history , Chaldean , Iranian , and Greek legends signify nothing , and that even religious pilgrimages and national festivities were based upon a myth . I would call attention to the farther fact that in the Deluge legend of the Isle of Cos the hero of the affair was Merops . Now we have seen that , according to Theopompus , one of the names of the people of Atlantis was " Meropes . " But we have not reached the end of our Flood legends . The Persian Magi possessed a tradition in which the waters issued from the oven of an old woman . Mohammed borrowed this story , and in the Koran he refers to the Deluge as coming from an oven . " All men were drowned save Noah and his family ; and then God said , ' O earth , swallow up thy waters ; and thou , O heaven , withhold thy rain ; ' and immediately the waters abated . " In the bardic poems of Wales we have a tradition of the Deluge which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is still deserving of attention . As usual , the legend is localized in the country , and the Deluge counts among three terrible catastrophes of the island of Prydian , or Britain , the other two consisting of devastation by fire and by drought . " The first of these events , " it is said , " was the eruption of Llyn-llion , or ' the lake of waves , ' and the inundation ( bawdd ) of the whole country , by which all mankind was drowned with the exception of Dwyfam and Dwyfach , who saved themselves in a vessel without rigging , and it was by them that the island of Prydian was repeopled . " Pictet here observes : " Although the triads in their actual form hardly date farther than the thirteenth or fourteenth century , some of them are undoubtedly connected with very ancient traditions , and nothing here points to a borrowing from Genesis . " But it is not so , perhaps , with another triad , speaking of the vessel Nefyddnaf-Neifion , which at the time of the overflow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rather too much resembles the ark of Noah . The very name of the patriarch may have suggested this triple epithet , obscure as to its meaning , but evidently formed on the principle of Cymric alliteration . In the same triad we have the enigmatic story of the horned oxen ( ychain banog ) of Hu the mighty , who drew out of Llyon-llion the avanc ( beaver or crocodile ? ) , in order that the lake should not overflow . The meaning of these enigmas could only be hoped from deciphering the chaos of barbaric monuments of the Welsh middle age ; but meanwhile we can not doubt that the Cymri possessed an indigenous tradition of the Deluge . " We also find a vestige of the same tradition in the Scandinavian Ealda . Here the story is combined with a cosmogonic myth . The three sons of Borr  --  Othin , Wili , and We  --  grandsons of Buri , the first man , slay Ymir , the father of the Hrimthursar , or ice giants , and his body serves them for the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such abundance that all the race of giants is drowned in it except Bergelmir , who saves himself , with his wife , in a boat , and reproduces the race . In the Edda of Soemund , " The Vala 's Prophecy " ( stz. 48-56 , p. 9 ) , we seem to catch traditional glimpses of a terrible catastrophe , which reminds us of the Chaldean legend : " Then trembles Yggdrasil 's ash yet standing , groans that ancient tree , and the Jotun Loki is loosed . The shadows groan on the ways of Hel ( the goddess of death ) , until the fire of Surt has consumed the tree . Hyrm steers from the east , the waters rise , the mundane snake is coiled in jotun-rage . The worm beats the water and the eagle screams ; the pale of beak tears carcasses ; ( the ship ) Naglfar is loosed . Surt from the south comes with flickering flame ; shines from his sword the Valgod 's sun . The stony hills are dashed together , the giantesses totter ; men tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun darkens , earth in ocean sinks , fall from heaven the bright stars , fire 's breath assails the all-nourishing , towering fire plays against heaven itself . " Egypt does not contain a single allusion to the Flood . Lenormant says : " While the tradition of the Deluge holds so considerable a place in the legendary memories of all branches of the Aryan race , the monuments and original texts of Egypt , with their many cosmogonic speculations , have not afforded one , even distant , allusion to this cataclysm . When the Greeks told the Egyptian priests of the Deluge of Deucalion , their reply was that they had been preserved from it as well as from the conflagration produced by Phaethon ; they even added that the Hellenes were childish in attaching so much importance to that event , as there had been several other local catastrophes resembling it . According to a passage in Manetho , much suspected , however , of being an interpolation , Thoth , or Hermes Trismegistus , had himself , before the cataclysm , inscribed on stelae , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . After it the second Thoth translated into the vulgar tongue the contents of these stelae . This would be the only Egyptian mention of the Deluge , the same Manetho not speaking of it in what remains to us of his ' Dynasties , ' his only complete authentic work . The silence of all other myths of the Pharaonic religion on this head render it very likely that the above is merely a foreign tradition , recently introduced , and no doubt of Asiatic and Chaldean origin . " To my mind the explanation of this singular omission is very plain . The Egyptians had preserved in their annals the precise history of the destruction of Atlantis , out of which the Flood legends grew ; and , as they told the Greeks , there had been no universal flood , but only local catastrophes . Possessing the real history of the local catastrophe which destroyed Atlantis , they did not indulge in any myths about a universal deluge covering the mountain-tops of all the world . They had no Ararat in their neighborhood . The traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the world in which Atlantis was situated . There was a quaint old monk named Cosmos , who , about one thousand years ago , published a book , " Topographia Christiana , " accompanied by a map , in which he gives his view of the world as it was then understood . It was a body surrounded by water , and resting on nothing . " The earth , " says Cosmos , " presses downward , but the igneous parts tend upward , " and between the conflicting forces the earth hangs suspended , like Mohammed 's coffin in the old story . The accompanying illustration ( page 95 ) represents the earth surrounded by the ocean , and beyond this ocean was " the land where men dwelt before the Deluge . " He then gives us a more accurate map , in detail , of the known world of his day . I copy this map , not to show how much more we know than poor Cosmos , but because he taught that all around this habitable world there was yet another world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven . " Upon the eastern side of this transmarine land he judges man was created ; and that there the paradise of gladness was located , such as here on the eastern edge is described , where it received our first parents , driven out of Paradise to that extreme point of land on the sea-shore . Hence , upon the coming of the Deluge , Noah and his sons were borne by the ark to the earth we now inhabit . The four rivers he supposes to be gushing up the spouts of Paradise . " They are depicted on the above map : O is the Mediterranean Sea ; P , the Arabian Gulf ; L , the Caspian Sea ; Q , the Tigris ; M , the river Pison ; " and J , the land where men dwelt before the Flood . " It will be observed that , while he locates Paradise in the east , he places the scene of the Deluge in the west ; and he supposes that Noah came from the scene of the Deluge to Europe . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west as the place of the Deluge , and that after the Deluge Noah came to the shores of the Mediterranean . The fact , too , that there was land in the west beyond the ocean is recognized by Cosmos , and is probably a dim echo from Atlantean times . MAP OF EUROPE , AFTER COSMOS The following rude cut , from Cosmos , represents the high mountain in the north behind which the sun hid himself at night , thus producing the alternations of day and night . His solar majesty is just getting behind the mountain , while Luna looks calmly on at the operation . The mountain is as crooked as Culhuacan , the crooked mountain of Atzlan described by the Aztecs . THE MOUNTAIN THE SUN GOES BEHIND AT NIGHT CHAPTER V THE DELUGE LEGENDS OF AMERICA . " It is a very remarkable fact , " says Alfred Maury , " that we find in America traditions of the Deluge coming infinitely nearer to that of the Bible and the Chaldean religion than among any people of the Old World . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place from Asia into North America by the Kourile and Aleutian Islands , and still does so in our day , should have brought in these memories , since no trace is found of them among those Mongol or Siberian populations which were fused with the natives of the New World . . . . The attempts that have been made to trace the origin of Mexican civilization to Asia have not as vet led to any sufficiently conclusive facts . Besides , had Buddhism , which we doubt , made its way into America , it could not have introduced a myth not found in its own scriptures . The cause of these similarities between the diluvian traditions of the nations of the New World and that of the Bible remains therefore unexplained . " The cause of these similarities can be easily explained : the legends of the Flood did not pass into America by way of the Aleutian Islands , or through the Buddhists of Asia , but were derived from an actual knowledge of Atlantis possessed by the people of America . Atlantis and the western continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the great nations of America were simply colonies from Atlantis , sharing in its civilization , language , religion , and blood . From Mexico to the peninsula of Yucatan , from the shores of Brazil to the heights of Bolivia and Peru , from the Gulf of Mexico to the head-waters of the Mississippi River , the colonies of Atlantis extended ; and therefore it is not strange to find , as Alfred Maury says , American traditions of the Deluge coming nearer to that of the Bible and the Chaldean record than those of any people of the Old World . " The most important among the American traditions are the Mexican , for they appear to have been definitively fixed by symbolic and mnemonic paintings before any contact with Europeans . According to these documents , the Noah of the Mexican cataclysm was Coxcox , called by certain peoples Teocipactli or Tezpi . He had saved himself , together with his wife Xochiquetzal , in a bark , or , according to other traditions , on a raft made of cypress-wood ( Cupressus disticha ) . Paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aztecs , Miztecs , Zapotecs , Tlascaltecs , and Mechoacaneses . The tradition of the latter is still more strikingly in conformity with the story as we have it in Genesis , and in Chaldean sources . It tells how Tezpi embarked in a spacious vessel with his wife , his children , and several animals , and grain , whose preservation was essential to the subsistence of the human race . When the great god Tezcatlipoca decreed that the waters should retire , Tezpi sent a vulture from the bark . The bird , feeding on the carcasses with which the earth was laden , did not return . Tezpi sent out other birds , of which the humming-bird only came back with a leafy branch in its beak . Then Tezpi , seeing that the country began to vegetate , left his bark on the mountain of Colhuacan . " The document , however , that gives the most valuable information , " says Lenormant , " as to the cosmogony of the Mexicans is one known as ' Codex Vaticanus , ' from the library where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four ages of the world preceding the actual one . They were copied at Chobula from a manuscript anterior to the conquest , and accompanied by the explanatory commentary of Pedro de los Rios , a Dominican monk , who , in 1566 , less than fifty years after the arrival of Cortez , devoted himself to the research of indigenous traditions as being necessary to his missionary work . " There were , according to this document , four ages of the world . The first was an age of giants ( the great mammalia ? ) who were destroyed by famine ; the second age ended in a conflagration ; the third age was an age of monkeys . " Then comes the fourth age , Atonatiuh , ' Sun of Water , ' whose number is 10 X 400 + 8 , or 4008 . It ends by a great inundation , a veritable deluge . All mankind are changed into fish , with the exception of one man and his wife , who save themselves in a bark made of the trunk of a cypress-tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consort of Tlaloc , god of rain , as darting down toward earth . Coxcox and Xochiquetzal , the two human beings preserved , are seen seated on a tree-trunk and floating in the midst of the waters . This flood is represented as the last cataclysm that devastates the earth . " The learned Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg translates from the Aztec language of the " Codex Chimalpopoca " the following Flood legend : " This is the sun called Nahui-atl , ' 4 water . ' Now the water was tranquil for forty years , plus twelve , and men lived for the third and fourth times . When the sun Nahui-atl came there had passed away four hundred years , plus two ages , plus seventy-six years . Then all mankind was lost and drowned , and found themselves changed into fish . The sky came nearer the water . In a single day all was lost , and the day Nahui-xochitl , ' 4 flower , ' destroyed all our flesh . " And that year was that of ce-calli , ' 1 house , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk into the water , and the water remained tranquil for fifty-two springs . " Now at the end of the year the god Titlacahuan had warned Nata and his spouse Nena , saying , ' Make no more wine of Agave , but begin to hollow out a great cypress , and you will enter into it when in the month Tozontli the water approaches the sky . ' " Then they entered in , and when the god had closed the door , he said , ' Thou shalt eat but one ear of maize , and thy wife one also . ' " But as soon as they had finished they went out , and the water remained calm , for the wood no longer moved , and , on opening it , they began to see fish . " Then they lit a fire , by rubbing together pieces of wood , and they roasted fish . " The gods Citlallinicue and Citlalatonac , instantly looking down said : ' Divine Lord , what is that fire that is making there ? Why do they thus smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to chide , saying , ' Who has made this fire here ? ' And , seizing hold of the fish , he shaped their loins and heads , and they were transformed into dogs ( chichime ) . " Here we note a remarkable approximation to Plato 's account of the destruction of Atlantis . " In one day and one fatal night , " says Plato , " there came mighty earthquakes and inundations that ingulfed that warlike people . " " In a single day all was lost , " says the Aztec legend . And , instead of a rainfall of forty days and forty nights , as represented in the Bible , here we see " in a single day . . . even the mountains sunk into the water ; " not only the land on which the people dwelt who were turned into fish , but the very mountains of that land sunk into the water . Does not this describe the fate of Atlantis ? In the Chaldean legend " the great goddess Ishtar wailed like a child , " saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , like to the race of fishes , they are filling the sea . " In the account in Genesis , Noah " builded an altar unto the Lord , and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar . And the Lord smelled a sweet savor ; and the Lord said in his heart , ' I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake . ' " In the Chaldean legend we are told that Khasisatra also offered a sacrifice , a burnt offering , " and the gods assembled like flies above the master of the sacrifice . " But Bel came in a high state of indignation , just as the Aztec god did , and was about to finish the work of the Deluge , when the great god Ea took ' ' pity in his heart and interfered to save the remnant of mankind . These resemblances can not be accidental ; neither can they be the interpolations of Christian missionaries , for it will be observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble on the one hand Plato 's record , and on the other the Chaldean legend . The name of the hero of the Aztec story , Nata , pronounced with the broad sound of the a , is not far from the name of Noah or Noe . The Deluge of Genesis is a Phoenician , Semitic , or Hebraic legend , and yet , strange to say , the name of Noah , which occurs in it , bears no appropriate meaning in those tongues , but is derived from Aryan sources ; its fundamental root is Na , to which in all the Aryan language is attached the meaning of water  --  Greek na'ein , to flow ; Greek nama , water ; Nympha , Neptunus , water deities . ( Lenormant and Chevallier , " Anc . Hist. of the East , " vol. i. , p. 15 . ) We find the root Na repeated in the name of this Central American Noah , Na-ta , and probably in the word " Na-hui-atl "  --  the age of water . But still more striking analogies exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as told in the " Popul Vuh " ( the Sacred Book ) of the Central Americans : " Then the waters were agitated by the will of the Heart of Heaven ( Hurakan ) , and a great inundation came upon the heads of these creatures . . . . They were ingulfed , and a resinous thickness descended from heaven ; . . . the face of the earth was obscured , and a heavy darkening rain commenced-rain by day and rain by night . . . . There was heard a great noise above their heads , as if produced by fire . Then were men seen running , pushing each other , filled with despair ; they wished to climb upon their houses , and the houses , tumbling down , fell to the ground ; they wished to climb upon the trees , and the trees shook them off ; they wished to enter into the grottoes ( eaves ) , and the grottoes closed themselves before them . . . . Water and fire contributed to the universal ruin at the time of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the similarities here to the Chaldean legend . There is the same graphic description of a terrible event . The " black cloud " is referred to in both instances ; also the dreadful noises , the rising water , the earthquake rocking the trees , overthrowing the houses , and crushing even the mountain caverns ; " the men running and pushing each other , filled with despair , " says the " Popul Vuh ; " " the brother no longer saw his brother , " says the Assyrian legend . And here I may note that this word hurakan  --  the spirit of the abyss , the god of storm , the hurricane  --  is very suggestive , and testifies to an early intercourse between the opposite shores of the Atlantic . We find in Spanish the word huracan ; in Portuguese , furacan ; in French , ouragan ; in German , Danish , and Swedish , orcan  --  all of them signifying a storm ; while in Latin furo , or furio , means to rage . And are not the old Swedish hurra , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icelandic word hurra , to be rattled over frozen ground , all derived from the same root from which the god of the abyss , Hurakan , obtained his name ? The last thing a people forgets is the name of their god ; we retain to this day , in the names of the days of the week , the designations of four Scandinavian gods and one Roman deity . It seems to me certain the above are simply two versions of the same event ; that while ships from Atlantis carried terrified passengers to tell the story of the dreadful catastrophe to the people of the Mediterranean shores , other ships , flying from the tempest , bore similar awful tidings to the civilized races around the Gulf of Mexico . The native Mexican historian , Ixtlilxochitl , gave this as the Toltec legend of the Flood : It is found in the histories of the Toltecs that this age and first world , as they call it , lasted 1716 years ; that men were destroyed by tremendous rains and lightning from the sky , and even all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest mountains , were covered up and submerged in water fifteen cubits ( caxtolmolatli ) ; and here they added other fables of how men came to multiply from the few who escaped from this destruction in a " toptlipetlocali ; " that this word nearly signifies a close chest ; and how , after men had multiplied , they erected a very high " zacuali , " which is to-day a tower of great height , in order to take refuge in it should the second world ( age ) be destroyed . Presently their languages were confused , and , not being able to understand each other , they went to different parts of the earth . " The Toltecs , consisting of seven friends , with their wives , who understood the same language , came to these parts , having first passed great land and seas , having lived in caves , and having endured great hardships in order to reach this land ; . . . they wandered 104 years through different parts of the world before they reached Hue Hue Tlapalan , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( " Ixtlilxochitl Relaciones , " in Kingsborough 's " Mex . Ant. , " vol. ix. , pp. 321 , 322 . ) It will of course be said that this account , in those particulars where it agrees with the Bible , was derived from the teachings of the Spanish priests ; but it must be remembered that Ixtlilxochitl was an Indian , a native of Tezeuco , a son of the queen , and that his " Relaciones " were drawn from the archives of his family and the ancient writings of his nation : he had no motive to falsify documents that were probably in the hands of hundreds at that time . Here we see that the depth of the water over the earth , " fifteen cubits , " given in the Toltec legend , is precisely the same as that named in the Bible : " fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail . " ( Gen. , chap . vii. , 20 . ) In the two curious picture-histories of the Aztecs preserved in the Boturini collection , and published by Gamelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrations from their original location through various parts of the North American continent until their arrival in Mexico . In both cases their starting-point is an island , from which they pass in a boat ; and the island contains in one case a mountain , and in the other a high temple in the midst thereof . These things seem to be reminiscences of their origin in Atlantis . In each case we see the crooked mountain of the Aztec legends , the Calhuacan , looking not unlike the bent mountain of the monk , Cosmos . In the legends of the Chibchas of Bogota we seem to have distinct reminiscences of Atlantis . Bochica was their leading divinity . During two thousand years he employed himself in elevating his subjects . He lived in the sun , while his wife Chia occupied the moon . This would appear to be an allusion to the worship of the sun and moon . Beneath Bochica in their mythology was Chibchacum . In an angry mood he brought a deluge on the people of the table-land . Bochica punished him for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bear the burden of the earth on his back . Occasionally be shifts the earth from one shoulder to another , and this causes earthquakes ! Here we have allusions to an ancient people who , during thousands of years , were elevated in the scale of civilization , and were destroyed by a deluge ; and with this is associated an Atlantean god bearing the world on his back . We find even the rainbow appearing in connection with this legend . When Bochica appeared in answer to prayer to quell the deluge he is seated on a rainbow . He opened a breach in the earth at Tequendama , through which the waters of the flood escaped , precisely as we have seen them disappearing through the crevice in the earth near Bambyce , in Greece . The Toltecs traced their migrations back to a starting-point called " Aztlan , " or " Atlan . " This could be no other than , Atlantis . ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. v. , p. 221 . ) " The original home of the Nahuatlacas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of much discussion . The causes that led to their exodus from that country can only be conjectured ; but they may be supposed to have been driven out by their enemies , for Aztlan is described as a land too fair and beautiful to be left willingly in the mere hope of finding a better . " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. v. , p. .306 . ) The Aztecs also claimed to have come originally from Aztlan . ( Ibid. , p. 321 . ) Their very name , Aztecs , was derived from Aztlan . ( Ibid. , vol. ii. , p. 125 ) . They were Atlanteans . The " Popul Vuh " tells us that after the migration from Aztlan three sons of the King of the Quiches , upon the death of their father , " determined to go as their fathers had ordered to the East , on the shores of the sea whence their fathers had come , to receive the royalty , ' bidding adieu to their brothers and friends , and promising to return . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East to receive the royalty . Now this is the name of the lord , of the monarch of the people of the East where they went . And when they arrived before the lord Nacxit , the name of the great lord , the only judge , whose power was without limit , behold he granted them the sign of royalty and all that represents it . . . and the insignia of royalty . . . all the things , in fact , which they brought on their return , and which they went to receive from the other side of the sea  --  the art of painting from Tulan , a system of writing , they said , for the things recorded in their histories . " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. v. , p. 553 " Popul Vuh , " p. 294 . ) This legend not only points to the East as the place of origin of these races , but also proves that this land of the East , this Aztlan , this Atlantis , exercised dominion over the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization . How completely does this agree with the statement of Plato that the kings of Atlantis held dominion over parts of " the great opposite continent ! " Professor Valentini ( " Maya Archaeol. , " p. 23 ) describes an Aztec picture in the work of Gemelli ( " Il giro del mondo , " vol. vi. ) of the migration of the Aztecs from Aztlan : " Out of a sheet of water there projects the peak of a mountain ; on it stands a tree , and on the tree a bird spreads its . wings . At the foot of the mountain-peak there comes out of the water the heads of a man and a woman . The one wears on his head the symbol of his name , Coxcox , a pheasant . The other head bears that of a hand with a bouquet ( xochitl , a flower , and quetzal , shining in green gold ) . In the foreground is a boat , out of which a naked man stretches out his hand imploringly to heaven . Now turn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone ) . There you will find represented the Flood , and with great emphasis , by the accumulation of all those symbols with which the ancient Mexicans conveyed the idea of water : a tub of standing water , drops springing out  --  not two , as heretofore in the symbol for Atl , water  --  but four drops ; the picture for moisture , a snail ; above , a crocodile , the king of the rivers . In the midst of these symbols you notice the profile of a man with a fillet , and a smaller one of a woman . There can be doubt these are the Mexican Noah , Coxcox , and his wife , Xochiquetzal ; and at the same time it is evident ( the Calendar stone , we know , was made in A.D. , 1478 ) that the story of them , and the pictures representing the story , have not been invented by the Catholic clergy , but really existed among these nations long before the Conquest . " The above figure represents the Flood tablet on the great Calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , while we still find legends referring to the Deluge , they are , with one exception , in such garbled and uncouth forms that we can only see glimpses of the truth shining through a mass of fable . The following tradition was current among the Indians of the Great Lakes : " In former times the father of the Indian tribes dwelt toward the rising sun . Having been warned in a dream that a deluge was coming upon the earth , he built a raft , on which he saved himself , with his family and all the animals . He floated thus for several months . The animals , who at that time spoke , loudly complained and murmured against him . At last a new earth appeared , on which he landed with all the animals , who from that time lost the power of speech , as a punishment for their murmurs against their deliverer . " According to Father Charlevoix , the tribes of Canada and the valley of the Mississippi relate in their rude legends that all mankind was destroyed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , had changed animals into men . It is to J. S. Kohl we owe our acquaintance with the version of the Chippeways  --  full of grotesque and perplexing touches  --  in which the man saved from the Deluge is called Menaboshu . To know if the earth be drying , he sends a bird , the diver , out of his bark ; then becomes the restorer of the human race and the founder of existing society . A clergyman who visited the Indians north-west of the Ohio in 1764 met , at a treaty , a party of Indians from the west of the Mississippi . " They informed him that one of their most ancient traditions was that , a great while ago , they had a common father , who lived toward the rising of the sun , and governed the whole world ; that all the white people 's heads were under his feet ; that he had twelve sons , by whom he administered the government ; that the twelve sons behaved very bad , and tyrannized over the people , abusing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , suffered the white people to introduce spirituous liquors among them , made them drunk , stole the special gift of the Great Spirit from them , and by this means usurped power over them ; and ever since the Indians ' heads were under the white people 's feet . " ( Boudinot 's " Star in the West , " p. 111 . ) Here we note that they looked " toward the rising sun "  --  toward Atlantis  --  for the original home of their race ; that this region governed " the whole world ; " that it contained white people , who were at first a subject race , but who subsequently rebelled , and acquired dominion over the darker races . We will see reason hereafter to conclude that Atlantis had a composite population , and that the rebellion of the Titans in Greek mythology was the rising up of a subject population . In 1836 C. S. Rafinesque published in Philadelphia , Pa. , a work called " The American Nations , " in which he gives the historical songs or chants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that originally dwelt along , the Delaware River . After describing a time " when there was nothing but sea-water on top of the land , " and the creation of sun , moon , stars , earth , and man , the legend depicts the Golden Age and the Fall in these words : " All were willingly pleased , all were easy-thinking , and all were well-happified . But after a while a snake-priest , Powako , brings on earth secretly the snake-worship ( Initako ) of the god of the snakes , Wakon . And there came wickedness , crime , and unhappiness . And bad weather was coming , distemper was coming , with death was coming . All this happened very long ago , at the first land , Netamaki , beyond the great ocean Kitahikau . " Then follows the Song of the Flood : " There was , long ago , a powerful snake , Maskanako , when the men had become bad beings , Makowini . This strong snake had become the foe of the Jins , and they became troubled , hating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiling , both were never peaceful . And they were fighting , least man Mattapewi with dead-keeper Nihaulowit . And the strong snake readily resolved to destroy or fight the beings or the men . The dark snake he brought , the monster ( Amanyam ) he brought , snake-rushing water he brought ( it ) . Much water is rushing , much go to hills , much penetrate , much destroying . Meanwhile at Tula ( this is the same Tula referred to in the Central American legends ) , at THAT ISLAND , Nana-Bush ( the great hare Nana ) becomes the ancestor of beings and men . Being born creeping , he is ready to move and dwell at Tula . The beings and men all go forth from the flood creeping in shallow water or swimming afloat , asking which is the way to the turtle-back , Tula-pin . But there are many monsters in the way , and some men were devoured by them . But the daughter of a spirit helped them in a boat , saying , ' Come , come ; ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat or raft is Mokol . . . . Water running off , it is drying ; in the plains and the mountains , at the path of the cave , elsewhere went the powerful action or motion . " Then follows Song 3 , describing the condition of mankind after the Flood . Like the Aryans , they moved into a cold country : " It freezes was there ; it snows was there ; it is cold was there . " They move to a milder region to hunt cattle ; they divided their forces into tillers and hunters . " The good and the holy were the hunters ; " they spread themselves north , south , east , and west . " Meantime all the snakes were afraid in their huts , and the Snake-priest Nakopowa said to all , ' Let us go . ' Eastwardly they go forth at Snakeland ( Akhokink ) , and they went away earnestly grieving . " Afterward the fathers of the Delawares , who " were always boating and navigating , " find that the Snake-people have taken possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from north , south , east , and west , and attempt " to pass over the waters of the frozen sea to possess that land . " They seem to travel in the dark of an Arctic winter until they come to a gap of open sea . They can go no farther ; but some tarry at Firland , while the rest return to where they started from , " the old turtle land . " Here we find that the land that was destroyed was the " first land ; " that it was an island " beyond the great ocean . " In all early age the people were happy and peaceful ; they became wicked ; " snake worship " was introduced , and was associated , as in Genesis , with the " fall of man ; " Nana-Bush became the ancestor of the new race ; his name reminds us of the Toltec Nata and the Hebrew Noah . After the flood came a dispersing of the people , and a separation into hunters and tillers of the soil . Among the Mandan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remarkable still , we find an image of the ark preserved from generation to generation , and a religious ceremony performed which refers plainly to the destruction of Atlantis , and to the arrival of one of those who escaped from the Flood , bringing the dreadful tidings of the disaster . It must be remembered , as we will show hereafter , that many of these Mandan Indians were white men , with hazel , gray , and blue eyes , and all shades of color of the hair from black to pure white ; that they dwelt in houses in fortified towns , and manufactured earthen-ware pots in which they could boil water  --  an art unknown to the ordinary Indians , who boiled water by putting heated stones into it . I quote the very interesting account of George Catlin , who visited the Mandans nearly fifty years ago , lately republished in London in the " North American Indians , " a very curious and valuable work . He says ( vol. i. , p. 88 ) : " In the centre of the village is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter and circular in form , which is used for all public games and festivals , shows and exhibitions . The lodges around this open space front in , with their doors toward the centre ; and in the middle of this stands an object of great religious veneration , on account of the importance it has in connection with the annual religious ceremonies . This object is in the form of a large hogshead , some eight or ten feet high , made of planks and hoops , containing within it some of their choicest mysteries or medicines . They call it the ' Big Canoe . ' " This is a representation of the ark ; the ancient Jews venerated a similar image , and some of the ancient Greek States followed in processions a model of the ark of Deucalion . But it is indeed surprising to find this practice perpetuated , even to our own times , by a race of Indians in the heart of America . On page 158 of the first volume of the same work Catlin describes the great annual mysteries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre . He says : " On the day set apart for the commencement of the ceremonies a solitary figure is seen approaching the village . " During the deafening din and confusion within the pickets of the village the figure discovered on the prairie continued to approach with a dignified step , and in a right line toward the village ; all eyes were upon him , and he at length made his appearance within the pickets , and proceeded toward the centre of the village , where all the chiefs and braves stood ready to receive him , which they did in a cordial manner by shaking hands , recognizing him as an old acquaintance , and pronouncing his name , Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah ( the first or only man ) . The body of this strange personage , which was chiefly naked , was painted with white clay , so as to resemble at a distance a white man . He enters the medicine lodge , and goes through certain mysterious ceremonies . " During the whole of this day Nu-mohk-muck-a-nah ( the first or only man ) travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lodge , and crying until the owner of the lodge came out and asked who he was , and what was the matter ? To which he replied by narrating the sad catastrophe which had happened on the earth 's surface by the overflowing of the waters , saying that ' he was the only person saved from the universal calamity ; that he landed his big canoe on a high mountain in the west , where he now resides ; that he has come to open the medicine lodge , which must needs receive a present of an edged tool from the owner of every wigwam , that it may be sacrificed to the water ; for , ' he says , ' if this is not done there will be another flood , and no one will be saved , as it was with such tools that the big canoe was made . ' " Having visited every lodge in the village during the day , and having received such a present from each as a hatchet , a knife , etc. ( which is undoubtedly always prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicine lodge ; and , on the last day of the ceremony , they are thrown into a deep place in the river  --  ' sacrificed to the Spirit of the Waters . " ' Among the sacred articles kept in the great medicine lodge are four sacks of water , called Eeh-teeh-ka , sewed together , each of them in the form of a tortoise lying on its back , with a bunch of eagle feathers attached to its tail . " These four tortoises , " they told me , " contained the waters from the four quarters of the world  --  that those waters had been contained therein ever since the settling down of the waters , " " I did not , " says Catlin , who knew nothing of an Atlantis theory , " think it best to advance anything against such a ridiculous belief . " Catlin tried to purchase one of these water-sacks , but could not obtain it for any price ; he was told they were " a society property . " He then describes a dance by twelve men around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four cardinal points ; two are painted perfectly black , two are vermilion color , some were painted partially white . They dance a dance called Bel-lohck-na-pie , ' " with horns on their heads , like those used in Europe as symbolical of Bel , or Baal . Could anything be more evident than the connection of these ceremonies with the destruction of Atlantis ? Here we have the image of the ark ; here we have a white man coming with the news that " the waters had overflowed the land , " and that all the people were destroyed except himself ; here we have the sacrifice to appease the spirit that caused the Flood , just as we find the Flood terminating , in the Hebrew , Chaldean , and Central American legends , with a sacrifice . Here , too , we have the image of the tortoise , which we find in other flood legends of the Indians , and which is a very natural symbol for an island . As one of our own poets has expressed it , " Very fair and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great green turtle slumbered On the sea which it encumbered . " Here we have , too , the four quarters of Atlantis , divided by its four rivers , as we shall see a little farther on , represented in a dance , where the dancers arrange themselves according to the four cardinal points of the compass ; the dancers are painted to represent the black and red races , while " the first and only man " represents the white race ; and the name of the dance is a reminiscence of Baal , the ancient god of the races derived from Atlantis . But this is not all . The Mandans were evidently of the race of Atlantis . They have another singular legend , which we find in the account of Lewis and Clarke : " Their belief in a future state is connected with this theory of their origin : The whole nation resided in one large village , underground , near a subterranean lake . A grape-vine extended its roots down to their habitation , and gave them a view of the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were delighted with the sight of the earth , which they found covered with buffalo , and rich with every kind of fruit . Returning with the grapes they had gathered , their countrymen were so pleased with the taste of them that the whole nation resolved to leave their dull residence for the charms of the upper region . Men , women , and children ascended by means of the vine , but , when about half the nation had reached the surface of the earth , a corpulent woman , who was clambering up the vine , broke it with her weight , and closed upon herself and the rest of the nation the light of the sun . " This curious tradition means that the present nation dwelt in a large settlement underground , that is , beyond the land , in the sea ; the sea being represented by " the subterranean lake . " At one time the people had free intercourse between this " large village " and the American continent , and they founded extensive colonies on this continent ; whereupon some mishap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confirmed by the fact that in the legends of the Iowa Indians , who were a branch of the Dakotas , or Sioux Indians , and relatives of the Mandans ( according to Major James W. Lynd ) , " all the tribes of Indians were formerly one , and all dwelt together on an island , or at least across a large water toward the east or sunrise . They crossed this water in skin canoes , or by swimming ; but they know not how long they were in crossing , or whether the water was salt or fresh . " While the Dakotas , according to Major Lynd , who lived among them for nine years , possessed legends of " huge skiffs , in which the Dakotas of old floated for weeks , finally gaining dry land "  --  a reminiscence of ships and long sea-voyages . The Mandans celebrated their great religious festival above described in the season when the willow is first in leaf , and a dove is mixed up in the ceremonies ; and they further relate a legend that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , and covered with earth , and that when one day , in digging the soil , a tribe of white men , who had made holes in the earth to a great depth digging for badgers , at length pierced the shell of the tortoise , it sank , and the water covering it drowned all men with the exception of one , who saved himself in a boat ; and when the earth re-emerged , sent out a dove , who returned with a branch of willow in its beak . " The holes dug to find badgers were a savage 's recollection of mining operations ; and when the great disaster came , and the island sunk in the sea amid volcanic convulsions , doubtless men said it was due to the deep mines , which had opened the way to the central fires . But the recurrence of " white men " as the miners , and of a white man as " the last and only man , " and the presence of white blood in the veins of the people , all point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantis .

" Among the Iroquois there is a tradition that the sea and waters infringed upon the land , so that all human life was destroyed . The Chickasaws assert that the world was once destroyed by water , but that one family was saved , and two animals of every kind . The Sioux say there was a time when there was no dry land , and all men had disappeared from existence . " ( See Lynd 's " MS . History of the Dakotas , " Library of Historical Society of Minnesota . ) " The Okanagaus have a god , Skyappe , and also one called Chacha , who appear to be endowed with omniscience ; but their principal divinity is their great mythical ruler and heroine , Scomalt . Long ago , when the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled over what appears to have now become a lost island . At last the peace of the island was destroyed by war , and the noise of battle was heard , with which Scomalt was exceeding wroth , whereupon she rose up in her might and drove her rebellious subjects to one end of the island , and broke off the piece of land on which they were huddled and pushed it out to sea , to drift whither it would . This floating island was tossed to and fro and buffeted by the winds till all but two died . A man and woman escaped in a canoe , and arrived on the main-land ; and from these the Okanagaus are descended . " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii. , p. 149 . ) Here we have the Flood legend clearly connected with a lost island . The Nicaraguans believed " that ages ago the world was destroyed by a flood , in which the most part of mankind perished . Afterward the teotes , or gods , restored the earth as at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wild Apaches , " wild from their natal hour , " have a legend that " the first days of the world were happy and peaceful days ; " then came a great flood , from which Montezuma and the coyote alone escaped . Montezuma became then very wicked , and attempted to build a house that would reach to heaven , but the Great Spirit destroyed it with thunderbolts . ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii. , p. 76 . ) The Pimas , an Indian tribe allied to the Papagos , have a peculiar flood legend . The son of the Creator was called Szeu-kha ( Ze-us ? ) . An eagle prophesied the deluge to the prophet of the people three times in succession , but his warning was despised ; " then in the twinkling of an eye there came a peal of thunder and an awful crash , and a green mound of water reared itself over the plain . It seemed to stand upright for a second , then , cut incessantly by the lightning , goaded on like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut . When the morning broke there was nothing to be seen alive but one man  --  if indeed he were a man ; Szeu-kha , the son of the Creator , had saved himself by floating on a ball of gum or resin . " This instantaneous catastrophe reminds one forcibly of the destruction of Atlantis . Szeu-kha killed the eagle , restored its victims to life , and repeopled the earth with them , as Deucalion repeopled the earth with the stones . CHAPTER VI . SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE DELUGE LEGENDS . The Fountains of the Great Deep .  --  As Atlantis perished in a volcanic convulsion , it must have possessed volcanoes . This is rendered the more probable when we remember that the ridge of land of which it was a part , stretching from north to south , from Iceland to St. Helena , contains even now great volcanoes  --  as in Iceland , the Azores , the Canaries , etc.  --  and that the very sea-bed along the line of its original axis is , to this day , as we have shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mountains of Atlantis contained volcanoes , of which the peaks of the Azores are the surviving representatives , it is not improbable that the convulsion which drowned it in the sea was accompanied by great discharges of water . We have seen that such discharges occurred in the island of Java , when four thousand people perished . " Immense columns of hot water and boiling mud were thrown out " of the volcano of Galung Gung ; the water was projected from the mountain " like a water-spout . " When a volcanic island was created near Sicily in 1831 , it was accompanied by " a waterspout sixty feet high . " In the island of Dominica , one of the islands constituting the Leeward group of the West Indies , and nearest to the site of Atlantis , on the 4th of January , 1880 , occurred a series of convulsions which reminds us forcibly of the destruction of Plato 's island ; and the similarity extends to another particular : Dominica contains , like Atlantis , we are told , numerous hot and sulphur springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald of January 28th , 1880 : " A little after 11 o'clock A.M. , soon after high-mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral , and while divine service was still going on in the Anglican and Wesleyan chapels , all the indications of an approaching thunder-storm suddenly showed themselves ; the atmosphere , which just previously had been cool and pleasant  --  slight showers falling since early morning  --  became at once nearly stifling hot ; the rumbling of distant thunder was heard , and the light-blue and fleecy white of the sky turned into a heavy and lowering black . Soon the thunder-peals came near and loud , the lightning flashes , of a blue and red color , more frequent and vivid ; and the rain , first with a few heavy drops , commenced to pour as if the floodgates of heaven were open . In a moment it darkened , as if night had come ; a strong , nearly overpowering smell of sulphur announced itself ; and people who happened to be out in the streets felt the rain-drops falling on their heads , backs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was to be noted by looking at the spouts , from which the water was rushing like so many cataracts of molten lead , while the gutters below ran swollen streams of thick gray mud , looking like nothing ever seen in them before . In the mean time the Roseau River had worked itself into a state of mad fury , overflowing its banks , carrying down rocks and large trees , and threatening destruction to the bridges over it and the houses in its neighborhood . When the storm ceased  --  it lasted till twelve , mid-day  --  the roofs and walls of the buildings in town , the street pavement , the door-steps and back-yards were found covered with a deposit of volcanic debris , holding together like clay , dark-gray in color , and in some places more than an inch thick , with small , shining metallic particles on the surface , which could be easily identified as iron pyrites . Scraping up some of the stuff , it required only a slight examination to determine its main constituents  --  sandstone and magnesia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even smaller quantity . This is , in fact , the composition of the volcanic mud thrown up by the soufrieres at Watton Waven and in the Boiling Lake country , and it is found in solution as well in the lake water . The Devil 's Billiard-table , within half a mile of the Boiling Lake , is composed wholly of this substance , which there assumes the character of stone in formation . Inquiries instituted on Monday morning revealed the fact that , except on the south-east , the mud shower had not extended beyond the limits of the town . On the north-west , in the direction of Fond Colo and Morne Daniel , nothing but pure rain-water had fallen , and neither Loubiere nor Pointe Michel had seen any signs of volcanic disturbance . . . . " But what happened at Pointe Mulatre enables us to spot the locale of the eruption . Pointe Mulatre lies at the foot of the range of mountains on the top of which the Boiling Lake frets and seethes . The only outlet of the lake is a cascade which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , the color and temperature of which , at one time and another , shows the existence or otherwise of volcanic activity in the lake-country . We may observe , en passant , that the fall of the water from the lake is similar in appearance to the falls on the sides of Roairama , in the interior of British Guiana ; there , is no continuous stream , but the water overleaps its basin like a kettle boiling over , and comes down in detached cascades from the top . May there not be a boiling lake on the unapproachable summit of Roairama ? The phenomena noted at Pointe Mulatre on Sunday were similar to what we witnessed in Roseau , but with every feature more strongly marked . The fall of mud was heavier , covering all the fields ; the atmospheric disturbance was greater , and the change in the appearance of the running water about the place more surprising . The Pointe Mulatre River suddenly began to run volcanic mud and water ; then the mud predominated , and almost buried the stream under its weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively oppressive . Soon the fish in the water  --  brochet , camoo , meye , crocro , mullet , down to the eel , the crawfish , the loche , the tetar , and the dormer  --  died , and were thrown on the banks . The mud carried down by the river has formed a bank at the month which nearly dams up the stream , and threatens to throw it back over the low-lying lands of the Pointe Mulatre estate . The reports from the Laudat section of the Boiling Lake district are curious . The Bachelor and Admiral rivers , and the numerous mineral springs which arise in that part of the island , are all running a thick white flood , like cream milk . The face of the entire country , from the Admiral River to the Solfatera Plain , has undergone some portentous change , which the frightened peasants who bring the news to Roseau seem unable clearly and connectedly to describe , and the volcanic activity still continues . " From this account it appears that the rain of water and mud came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risen to a great height , " like a water-spout , " and then fallen in showers over the face of the country . We are reminded , in this Boiling Lake of Dominica , of the Welsh legend of the eruption of the Llyn-llion , " the Lake of Waves , " which " inundated the whole country . " On the top of a mountain in the county of Kerry , Ireland , called Mangerton , there is a deep lake known as Poulle-i-feron , which signifies Hell-hole ; it frequently overflows , and rolls down the mountain in frightful torrents . On Slieve-donart , in the territory of Mourne , in the county of Down , Ireland , a lake occupies the mountain-top , and its overflowings help to form rivers . If we suppose the destruction of Atlantis to have been , in like manner , accompanied by a tremendous outpour of water from one or more of its volcanoes , thrown to a great height , and deluging the land , we can understand the description in the Chaldean legend of " the terrible water-spout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and which " rose to the sky , " and which seems to have been one of the chief causes , together with the earthquake , of the destruction of the country . And in this view we are confirmed by the Aramaean legend of the Deluge , probably derived at an earlier age from the Chaldean tradition . In it we are told , " All on a sudden enormous volumes of water issued from the earth , and rains of extraordinary abundance began to fall ; the rivers left their beds , and the ocean overflowed its banks . " The disturbance in Dominica duplicates this description exactly : " In a moment " the water and mud burst from the mountains , " the floodgates of heaven were opened , " and " the river overflowed its banks . " And here , again , we are reminded of the expression in Genesis , " the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up " ( chap . vii. , 11 ) . That this does not refer to the rain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened . And the rain was upon the earth , " etc . And when the work of destruction is finished , we are told " the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped . " This is a reminiscence by an inland people , living where such tremendous volcanic disturbances were nearly unknown , of " the terrible water-spout which " rose to the sky , " of the Chaldean legend , and of " the enormous volumes of water issuing from the earth " of the Aramaean tradition . The Hindoo legend of the Flood speaks of " the marine god Hayagriva , who dwelt in the abyss , " who produced the cataclysm . This is doubtless " the archangel of the abyss " spoken of in the Chaldean tradition . The Mountains of the North .  --  We have in Plato the following reference to the mountains of Atlantis : " The whole country was described as being very lofty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole region of the island lies toward the south , and is sheltered from the north . . . . The surrounding mountains exceeded all that are to be seen now anywhere . " These mountains were the present Azores . One has but to contemplate their present elevation , and remember the depth to which they descend in the ocean , to realize their tremendous altitude and the correctness of the description given by Plato . In the Hindoo legend we find the fish-god , who represents Poseidon , father of Atlantis , helping Mann over " the Mountain of the North . " In the Chaldean legend Khasisatra 's vessel is stopped by " the Mountain of Nizir " until the sea goes down . The Mud which Stopped Navigation .  --  We are told by Plato , " Atlantis disappeared beneath the sea , and then that sea became inaccessible , so that navigation on it ceased , on account of the quantity of mud which the ingulfed island left in its place . " This is one of the points of Plato 's story which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of the modern , world . We find in the Chaldean legend something of the same kind : Khasisatra says , " I looked at the sea attentively , observing , and the whole of humanity had returned to mud . " In the " Popol Vuh " we are told that a " resinous thickness descended from heaven , " even as in Dominica the rain was full of " thick gray mud , " accompanied by an " overpowering smell of sulphur . " The explorations of the ship Challenger show that the whole of the submerged ridge of which Atlantis is a part is to this day thickly covered with volcanic debris . We have but to remember the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum , which were covered with such a mass of volcanic ashes from the eruption of A.D. 79 that for seventeen centuries they remained buried at a depth of from fifteen to thirty feet ; a new population lived and labored above them ; an aqueduct was constructed over their heads ; and it was only when a farmer , in digging for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were once more brought to the light of day and the knowledge of mankind . We have seen that , in 1783 , the volcanic eruption in Iceland covered the sea with pumice for a distance of one hundred and fifty miles , " and ships were considerably impeded in their course . " The eruption in the island of Sumbawa , in April , 1815 , threw out such masses of ashes as to darken the air . " The floating cinders to the west of Sumatra formed , on the 12th of April , a mass two feet thick and several miles in extent , through which ships with difficulty forced their way . " It thus appears that the very statement of Plato which has provoked the ridicule of scholars is in itself one of the corroborating features of his story . It is probable that the ships of the Atlanteans , when they returned after the tempest to look for their country , found the sea impassable from the masses of volcanic ashes and pumice . They returned terrified to the shores of Europe ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization of the world probably led to one of those retrograde periods in the history of our race in which they lost all intercourse with the Western continent . The Preservation of a Record .  --  There is a singular coincidence in the stories of the Deluge in another particular . The legends of the Phoenicians , preserved by Sanchoniathon , tell us that Taautos , or Taut , was the inventor of the alphabet and of the art of writing . Now , we find in the Egyptian legends a passage of Manetho , in which Thoth ( or Hermes Trismegistus ) , before the Deluge , inscribed on stelae , or tablets , in hieroglyphics , or sacred characters , the principles of all knowledge . After the Deluge the second Thoth translated the contents of these stelae into the vulgar tongue . Josephus tells us that " The patriarch Seth , in order that wisdom and astronomical knowledge should not perish , erected , in prevision of the double destruction by fire and water predicted by Adam , two columns , one of brick , the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which existed in the Siriadic country . " In the Chaldean legends the god Ea ordered Khasisatra to inscribe the divine learning , and the principles of all sciences , on tables of terra-cotta , and bury them , before the Deluge , " in the City of the Sun at Sippara . " Berosus , in his version of the Chaldean flood , says : " The deity , Chronos , appeared to him ( Xisuthros ) in a vision , and warned him that , upon the 15th day of the month Doesius , there would be a flood by which mankind would be destroyed . He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the beginning , procedure , and conclusion of all things , and to bury it in the City of the Sun at Sippara , and to build a vessel , " etc . The Hindoo Bhagavata-Purana tells us that the fish-god , who warned Satyravata of the coming of the Flood , directed him to place the sacred Scriptures in a safe place , " in order to preserve them from Hayagriva , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the original of these legends in the following passage from Plato 's history of Atlantis ? " Now , the relations of their governments to one another were regulated by the injunctions of Poseidon , as the law had handed them down . These were inscribed by the first then on a column of orichalcum , which was situated in the middle of the island , at the Temple of Poseidon , whither the people were gathered together . . . . They received and gave judgments , and at daybreak they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet , and deposited them as memorials with their robes . There were many special laws which the several kings had inscribed about the temples . " ( Critias , p. 120 . ) A Succession of Disasters .  --  The Central American books , translated by De Bourbourg , state that originally a part of the American continent extended far into the Atlantic Ocean . This tradition is strikingly confirmed by the explorations of the ship Challenger , which show that the " Dolphin 's Ridge " was connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Amazon . The Central American books tell us that this region of the continent was destroyed by a succession of frightful convulsions , probably at long intervals apart ; three of these catastrophes are constantly mentioned , and sometimes there is reference to one or two more . " The land , " in these convulsions , " was shaken by frightful earthquakes , and the waves of the sea combined with volcanic fires to overwhelm and ingulf it . . . . Each convulsion swept away portions of the land until the whole disappeared , leaving the line of coast as it now is . Most of the inhabitants , overtaken amid their regular employments , were destroyed ; but some escaped in ships , and some fled for safety to the summits of high mountains , or to portions of the land which for a time escaped immediate destruction . " ( Baldwin 's " Ancient America , " p. 176 . ) This accords precisely with the teachings of geology . We know that the land from which America and Europe were formed once covered nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the continents ; and it is reasonable to believe that it went down piecemeal , and that Atlantis was but the stump of the ancient continent , which at last perished from the same causes and in the same way . The fact that this tradition existed among the inhabitants of America is proven by the existence of festivals , " especially one in the month Izcalli , which were instituted to commemorate this frightful destruction of land and people , and in which , say the sacred books , ' princes and people humbled themselves before the divinity , and besought him to withhold a return of such terrible calamities . ' " Can we doubt the reality of events which we thus find confirmed by religious ceremonies at Athens , in Syria , and on the shores of Central America ? And we find this succession of great destructions of the Atlantic continent in the triads of Wales , where traditions are preserved of " three terrible catastrophes . " We are told by the explorations of the ship Challenger that the higher lands reach in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a part of their country once extended far out into the Atlantic , and was subsequently destroyed . And the same succession of destructions is referred to in the Greek legends , where a deluge of Ogyges  --  " the most ancient of the kings of Boeotia or Attica , a quite mythical person , lost in the night of ages "  --  preceded that of Deucalion . We will find hereafter the most ancient hymns of the Aryans praying God to hold the land firm . The people of Atlantis , having seen their country thus destroyed , section by section , and judging that their own time must inevitably come , must have lived under a great and perpetual terror , which will go far to explain the origin of primeval religion , and the hold which it took upon the minds of men ; and this condition of things may furnish us a solution of the legends which have come down to us of their efforts to perpetuate their learning on pillars , and also an explanation of that other legend of the Tower of Babel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both continents , and in which they sought to build a tower high enough to escape the Deluge . All the legends of the preservation of a record prove that the united voice of antiquity taught that the antediluvians had advanced so far in civilization as to possess an alphabet and a system of writing ; a conclusion which , as we will see hereafter , finds confirmation in the original identity of the alphabetical signs used in the old world and the new . PART III THE CIVILIZATION OF THE OLD WORLD AND NEW COMPARED . CHAPTER I. CIVILIZATION AN INHERITANCE . Material civilization might be defined to be the result of a series of inventions and discoveries , whereby man improves his condition , and controls the forces of nature for his own advantage . The savage man is a pitiable creature ; as Menabosbu says , in the Chippeway legends , he is pursued by a " perpetual hunger ; " he is exposed unprotected to the blasts of winter and the heats of summer . A great terror sits upon his soul ; for every manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder , the lightning , the cold , the heat  --  all are threatening and dangerous demons . The seasons bring him neither seed-time nor harvest ; pinched with hunger , appeasing in part the everlasting craving of his stomach with seeds , berries , and creeping things , he sees the animals of the forest dash by him , and he has no means to arrest their flight . He is powerless and miserable in the midst of plenty . Every step toward civilization is a step of conquest over nature . The invention of the bow and arrow was , in its time , a far greater stride forward for the human race than the steam-engine or the telegraph . The savage could now reach his game  --  his insatiable hunger could be satisfied ; the very eagle , " towering in its pride of place , " was not beyond the reach of this new and wonderful weapon . The discovery of fire and the art of cooking was another immense step forward . The savage , having nothing but wooden vessels in which to cook , covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The savage gradually learned that he could dispense with the wood , and thus pottery was invented . Then some one ( if we are to believe the Chippeway legends , on the shores of Lake Superior ) found fragments of the pure copper of that region , beat them into shape , and the art of metallurgy was begun ; iron was first worked in the same way by shaping meteoric iron into spear-heads . But it must not be supposed that these inventions followed one another in rapid succession . Thousands , and perhaps tens of thousands , of years intervened between each step ; many savage races have not to this day achieved some of these steps . Prof. Richard Owen says , " Unprepossessed and sober experience teaches that arts , language , literature are of slow growth , the results of gradual development . " I shall undertake to show hereafter that nearly all the arts essential to civilization which we possess date back to the time of Atlantis  --  certainly to that ancient Egyptian civilization which was coeval with , and an outgrowth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no advance on the civilization which it received from Atlantis . Phoenicia , Egypt , Chaldea , India , Greece , and Rome passed the torch of civilization from one to the other ; but in all that lapse of time they added nothing to the arts which existed at the earliest period of Egyptian history . In architecture , sculpture , painting , engraving , mining , metallurgy , navigation , pottery , glass-ware , the construction of canals , roads , and aqueducts , the arts of Phoenicia and Egypt extended , without material change or improvement , to a period but two or three hundred years ago . The present age has entered upon a new era ; it has added a series of wonderful inventions to the Atlantean list ; it has subjugated steam and electricity to the uses of man . And its work has but commenced : it will continue until it lifts man to a plane as much higher than the present as the present is above the barbaric condition ; and in the future it will be said that between the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of many thousands of years , during which mankind did not invent , but simply perpetuated . Herodotus tells us ( " Euterpe , " cxlii. ) that , according to the information he received from the Egyptian priests , their written history dated back 11,340 years before his era , or nearly 14,000 years prior to this time . They introduced him into a spacious temple , and showed him the statues of 341 high-priests who had in turn succeeded each other ; and yet the age of Columbus possessed no arts , except that of printing ( which was ancient in China ) , which was not known to the Egyptians ; and the civilization of Egypt at its first appearance was of a higher order than at any subsequent period of its history , thus testifying that it drew its greatness from a fountain higher than itself . It was in its early days that Egypt worshipped one only God ; in the later ages this simple and sublime belief was buried under the corruptions of polytheism . The greatest pyramids were built by the Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the people that the stones with which they were built retain to this day the writing of the workmen . The first king was Menes . " At the epoch of Menes , " says Winchell , " the Egyptians were already a civilized and numerous people . Manetho tells us that Athotis , the son of this first king , Menes , built the palace at Memphis ; that he was a physician , and left anatomical books . All these statements imply that even at this early period the Egyptians were in a high state of civilization . " ( Winchell 's " Preadamites , " p. 120 . ) " In the time of Menes the Egyptians had long been architects , sculptors , painters , mythologists , and theologians . " Professor Richard Owen says , " Egypt is recorded to have been a civilized and governed community before the time of Menes . The pastoral community of a group of nomad families , as portrayed in the Pentateuch , may be admitted as an early step in civilization . But how far in advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of grades of society , with divisions of labor , of which one kind , assigned to the priesthood , was to record or chronicle the names and dynasties of the kings , the duration and chief events of their reigns ! " Ernest Renan points out that " Egypt at the beginning appears mature , old , and entirely without mythical and heroic ages , as if the country had never known youth . Its civilization has no infancy , and its art no archaic period . The civilization of the Old Monarchy did not begin with infancy . It was already mature . " We shall attempt to show that it matured in Atlantis , and that the Egyptian people were unable to maintain it at the high standard at which they had received it , as depicted in the pages of Plato . What king of Assyria , or Greece , or Rome , or even of these modern nations , has ever devoted himself to the study of medicine and the writing of medical books for the benefit of mankind ? Their mission has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , at the very dawn of Mediterranean history , we find the son of the first king of Egypt recorded " as a physician , and as having left anatomical books . " I hold it to be incontestable that , in some region of the earth , primitive mankind must have existed during vast spaces of time , and under most favorable circumstances , to create , invent , and discover those arts and things which constitute civilization . When we have it before our eyes that for six thousand years mankind in Europe , Asia , and Africa , even when led by great nations , and illuminated by marvellous minds , did not advance one inch beyond the arts of Egypt , we may conceive what lapses , what aeons , of time it must have required to bring savage man to that condition of refinement and civilization possessed by Egypt when it first comes within the purview of history . That illustrious Frenchman , H. A. Taine ( " History of English Literature , " p. 23 ) , sees the unity of the Indo-European races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and argues that these pre-eminent traits are " the great marks of an original model , " and that when we meet with them " fifteen , twenty , thirty centuries before our era , in an Aryan , an Egyptian , a Chinese , they represent the work of a great many ages , perhaps of several myriads of centuries . . . . Such is the first and richest source of these master faculties from which historical events take their rise ; and one sees that if it be powerful it is because this is no simple spring , but a kind of lake , a deep reservoir , wherein other springs have , for a multitude of centuries , discharged their several streams . " In other words , the capacity of the Egyptian , Aryan , Chaldean , Chinese , Saxon , and Celt to maintain civilization is simply the result of civilized training during " myriads of centuries " in some original home of the race . I can not believe that the great inventions were duplicated spontaneously , as some would have us believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that men pressed by necessity will always hit upon the same invention to relieve their wants . If this were so , all savages would have invented the boomerang ; all savages would possess pottery , bows and arrows , slings , tents , and canoes ; in short , all races would have risen to civilization , for certainly the comforts of life are as agreeable to one people as another . Civilization is not communicable to all ; many savage tribes are incapable of it . There are two great divisions of mankind , the civilized and the savage ; and , as we shall show , every civilized race in the world has had something of civilization from the earliest ages ; and as " all roads lead to Rome , " so all the converging lines of civilization lead to Atlantis . The abyss between the civilized man and the savage is simply incalculable ; it represents not alone a difference in arts and methods of life , but in the mental constitution , the instincts , and the predispositions of the soul . The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons , and houses of cobs ; the savage boy amuses himself with bows and arrows : the one belongs to a building and creating race ; the other to a wild , hunting stock . This abyss between savagery and civilization has never been passed by any nation through its own original force , and without external influences , during the Historic Period ; those who were savages at the dawn of history are savages still ; barbarian slaves may have been taught something of the arts of their masters , and conquered races have shared some of the advantages possessed by their conquerors ; but we will seek in vain for any example of a savage people developing civilization of and among themselves . I may be reminded of the Gauls , Goths , and Britons ; but these were not savages , they possessed written languages , poetry , oratory , and history ; they were controlled by religious ideas ; they believed in God and the immortality of the soul , and in a state of rewards and punishments after death . Wherever the Romans came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they found them armed with weapons of iron . The Scots , according to Tacitus , used chariots and iron swords in the battle of the Grampians  --  " enormes gladii sine mucrone . " The Celts of Gaul are stated by Diodorus Siculus to have used iron-headed spears and coats-of-mail , and the Gauls who encountered the Roman arms in B.C. 222 were armed with soft iron swords , as well as at the time when Caesar conquered their country . Among the Gauls men would lend money to be repaid in the next world , and , we need not add , that no Christian people has yet reached that sublime height of faith ; they cultivated the ground , built houses and walled towns , wove cloth , and employed wheeled vehicles ; they possessed nearly all the cereals and domestic animals we have , and they wrought in iron , bronze , and steel . The Gauls had even invented a machine on wheels to cut their grain , thus anticipating our reapers and mowers by two thousand years . The difference between the civilization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a difference in degree and not in kind . The Roman civilization was simply a development and perfection of the civilization possessed by all the European populations ; it was drawn from the common fountain of Atlantis . If we find on both sides of the Atlantic precisely the same arts , sciences , religious beliefs , habits , customs , and traditions , it is absurd to say that the peoples of the two continents arrived separately , by precisely the same steps , at precisely the same ends . When we consider the resemblance of the civilizations of the Mediterranean nations to one another , no man is silly enough to pretend that Rome , Greece , Egypt , Assyria , Phoenicia , each spontaneously and separately invented the arts , sciences , habits , and opinions in which they agreed ; but we proceed to trace out the thread of descent or connection from one to another . Why should a rule of interpretation prevail , as between the two sides of the Atlantic , different from that which holds good as to the two sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , similarity of origin has unquestionably produced similarity of arts , customs , and condition , why , in the other , should not similarity of arts , customs , and condition prove similarity of origin ? Is there any instance in the world of two peoples , without knowledge of or intercourse with each other , happening upon the same invention , whether that invention be an arrow-head or a steam-engine ? If it required of mankind a lapse of at least six thousand years before it began anew the work of invention , and took up the thread of original thought where Atlantis dropped it , what probability is there of three or four separate nations all advancing at the same speed to precisely the same arts and opinions ? The proposition is untenable . If , then , we prove that , on both sides of the Atlantic , civilizations were found substantially identical , we have demonstrated that they must have descended one from the other , or have radiated from some common source . CHAPTER II THE IDENTITY OF THE CIVILIZATIONS OF THE OLD WORLD AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato tells us that the Atlanteans possessed architecture ; that they built walls , temples , and palaces . We need not add that this art was found in Egypt and all the civilized countries of Europe , as well as in Peru , Mexico , and Central America . Among both the Peruvians and Egyptians the walls receded inward , and the doors were narrower at , the top than at the threshold . The obelisks of Egypt , covered with hieroglyphics , are paralleled by the round columns of Central America , and both are supposed to have originated in Phallus-worship . " The usual symbol of the Phallus was an erect stone , often in its rough state , sometimes sculptured . " ( Squier , " Serpent Symbol , " p. 49 ; Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii. , p. 504 . ) The worship of Priapus was found in Asia , Egypt , along the European shore of the Mediterranean , and in the forests of Central America . The mounds of Europe and Asia were made in the same way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the burial of a Scythian king ; he says , " After this they set to work to raise a vast mound above the grave , all of them vying with each other , and seeking to make it as tall as possible . " " It must be confessed , " says Foster ( " Prehistoric Races , " p. 193 ) , " that these Scythic burial rites have a strong resemblance to those of the Mound Builders . " Homer describes the erection of a great symmetrical mound over Achilles , also one over Hector . Alexander the Great raised a great mound over his friend Hephaestion , at a cost of more than a million dollars ; and Semiramis raised a similar mound over her husband . The pyramids of Egypt , Assyria , and Phoenicia had their duplicates in Mexico and Central America . CARVING ON THE BUDDHIST TOWER , SARNATH , INDIA The grave-cists made of stone of the American mounds are exactly like the stone chests , or kistvaen for the dead , found in the British mounds . ( Fosters " Prehistoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in Yorkshire enclosing wooden coffins , precisely as in the mounds of the Mississippi Valley . ( Ibid. , p. 185 . ) The articles associated with the dead are the same in both continents : arms , trinkets , food , clothes , and funeral urns . In both the Mississippi Valley and among the Chaldeans vases were constructed around the bones , the neck of the vase being too small to permit the extraction of the skull . ( Foster 's " Prehistoric Races , " p. 200 . ) The use of cement was known alike to the European and American nations . The use of the arch was known on both sides of the Atlantic . The manufacture of bricks was known in both the Old and New Worlds . The style of ornamentation in architecture was much the same on both hemispheres , as shown in the preceding designs , pages 137 , 139 . Metallurgy.  --  The Atlanteans mined ores , and worked in metals ; they used copper , tin , bronze , gold , and silver , and probably iron . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze , or of copper combined with tin , was preceded in America , and nowhere else , by a simpler age of copper ; and , therefore , the working of metals probably originated in America , or in some region to which it was tributary . The Mexicans manufactured bronze , and the Incas mined iron near Lake Titicaca ; and the civilization of this latter region , as we will show , probably dated back to Atlantean times . The Peruvians called gold the tears of the sun : it was sacred to , the sun , as silver was to the moon . Sculpture .  --  The Atlanteans possessed this art ; so did the American and Mediterranean nations . Dr. Arthur Schott ( " Smith . Rep. , " 1869 , p. 391 ) , in describing the " Cara Gigantesca , " or gigantic face , a monument of Yzamal , in Yucatan , says , " Behind and on both sides , from under the mitre , a short veil falls upon the shoulders , so as to protect the back of the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the same feature in the symbolic adornments of Egyptian and Hindoo priests , and even those of the Hebrew hierarchy . " Dr. Schott sees in the orbicular wheel-like plates of this statue the wheel symbol of Kronos and Saturn ; and , in turn , it may be supposed that the wheel of Kronos was simply the cross of Atlantis , surrounded by its encircling ring . Painting .  --  This art was known on both sides of the Atlantic . The paintings upon the walls of some of the temples of Central America reveal a state of the art as high as that of Egypt . Engraving .  --  Plato tells us that the Atlanteans engraved upon pillars . The American nations also had this art in common with Egypt , Phoenicia , and Assyria . Agriculture .  --  The people of Atlantis were pre-eminently an agricultural people ; so were the civilized nations of America and the Egyptians . In Egypt the king put his hand to the plough at an annual festival , thus dignifying and consecrating the occupation of husbandry . In Peru precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Egypt it was drawn by oxen , and in Peru by men . It was drawn by men in the North of Europe down to a comparatively recent period . Public Works .  --  The American nations built public works as great as or greater than any known in Europe . The Peruvians had public roads , one thousand five hundred to two thousand miles long , made so thoroughly as to elicit the astonishment of the Spaniards . At every few miles taverns or hotels were established for the accommodation of travellers . Humboldt pronounced these Peruvian roads " among the most useful and stupendous works ever executed by man . " They built aqueducts for purposes of irrigation some of which were five hundred miles long . They constructed magnificent bridges of stone , and had even invented suspension bridges thousands of years before they were introduced into Europe . They had , both in Peru and Mexico , a system of posts , by means of which news was transmitted hundreds of miles in a day , precisely like those known among the Persians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stones similar to mile-stones were placed along the roads in Peru . ( See Prescott 's " Peru , " ) Navigation .  --  Sailing vessels were known to the Peruvians and the Central Americans . Columbus met , in 1502 , at an island near Honduras , a party of the Mayas in a large vessel , equipped with sails , and loaded with a variety of textile fabrics of divers colors . ANCIENT IRISH VASE OF THE BRONZE AGE Manufactures .  --  The American nations manufactured woollen and cotton goods ; they made pottery as beautiful as the wares of Egypt ; they manufactured glass ; they engraved gems and precious stones . The Peruvians had such immense numbers of vessels and ornaments of gold that the Inca paid with them a ransom for himself to Pizarro of the value of fifteen million dollars . Music .  --  It has been pointed out that there is great resemblance between the five-toned music of the Highland Scotch and that of the Chinese and other Eastern nations . ( " Anthropology , " p. 292 . ) Weapons .  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the Old World ; they consisted of bows and arrows , spears , darts , short swords , battle-axes , and slings ; and both peoples used shields or bucklers , and casques of wood or hide covered with metal . If these weapons had been derived from separate sources of invention , one country or the other would have possessed implements not known to the other , like the blow-pipe , the boomerang , etc . Absolute identity in so many weapons strongly argues identity of origin . Religion .  --  The religion of the Atlanteans , as Plato tells us , was pure and simple ; they made no regular sacrifices but fruits and flowers ; they worshipped the sun . In Peru a single deity was worshipped , and the sun , his most glorious work , was honored as his representative . Quetzalcoatl , the founder of the Aztecs , condemned all sacrifice but that of fruits and flowers . The first religion of Egypt was pure and simple ; its sacrifices were fruits and flowers ; temples were erected to the sun , Ra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was called Ra-mi . The Phoenicians worshipped Baal and Moloch ; the one represented the beneficent , and the other the injurious powers of the sun . Religious Beliefs .  --  The Guanches of the Canary Islands , who were probably a fragment of the old Atlantean population , believed in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body , and preserved their dead as mummies . The Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body , and preserved the bodies of the dead by embalming them . The Peruvians believed in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body , and they too preserved the bodies of their dead by embalming them . " A few mummies in remarkable preservation have been found among the Chinooks and Flatheads . " ( Schoolcraft , vol. v. , p. 693 . ) The embalmment of the body was also practised in Central America and among the Aztecs . The Aztecs , like the Egyptians , mummified their dead by taking out the bowels and replacing them with aromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " p. 173 . ) The bodies of the kings of the Virginia Indians were preserved by embalming . ( Beverly , p. 47 . ) Here are different races , separated by immense distances of land and ocean , uniting in the same beliefs , and in the same practical and logical application of those beliefs . The use of confession and penance was known in the religious ceremonies of some of the American nations . Baptism was a religious ceremony with them , and the bodies of the dead were sprinkled with water . Vestal virgins were found in organized communities on both sides of the Atlantic ; they were in each case pledged to celibacy , and devoted to death if they violated their vows . In both hemispheres the recreant were destroyed by being buried alive . The Peruvians , Mexicans , Central Americans , Egyptians , Phoenicians , and Hebrews each had a powerful hereditary priesthood . The Phoenicians believed in an evil spirit called Zebub ; the Peruvians had a devil called Cupay . The Peruvians burnt incense in their temples . The Peruvians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from these prognosticated the future . I need not add that all these nations preserved traditions of the Deluge ; and all of them possessed systems of writing . The Egyptian priest of Sais told Solon that the myth of Phaethon , the son of Helios , having attempted to drive the chariot of the sun , and thereby burning up the earth , referred to " a declination of the bodies moving round the earth and in the heavens " ( comets ) , which caused a " great conflagration upon the earth , " from which those only escaped who lived near rivers and seas . The " Codex Chimalpopoca "  --  a Nahua , Central American record  --  tells us that the third era of the world , or " third sun , " is called , Quia Tonatiuh , or sun of rain , " because in this age there fell a rain of fire , all which existed burned , and there fell a rain of gravel ; " the rocks " boiled with tumult , and there also arose the rocks of vermilion color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go back to a great cataclysm of fire , when the earth possibly encountered , as in the Egyptian story , one of " the bodies moving round the earth and in the heavens ; " they had also memories of " the Drift Period , " and of the outburst of Plutonic rocks . If man has existed on the earth as long as science asserts , he must have passed through many of the great catastrophes which are written upon the face of the planet ; and it is very natural that in myths and legends he should preserve some recollection of events so appalling and destructive . Among the early Greeks Pan was the ancient god ; his wife was Maia . The Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg calls attention to the fact that Pan was adored in all parts of Mexico and Central America ; and at Panuco , or Panca , literally Panopolis , the Spaniards found , upon their entrance into Mexico , superb temples and images of Pan . ( Brasseur 's Introduction in Landa 's " Relacion . " ) The names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maia being the same as Maya , the principal name of the peninsula ; and pan , added to Maya , makes the name of the ancient capital Mayapan . In the Nahua language pan , or pani , signifies " equality to that which is above , " and Pentecatl was the progenitor of all beings . ( " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 467 . ) The ancient Mexicans believed that the sun-god would destroy the world in the last night of the fifty-second year , and that he would never come back . They offered sacrifices to him at that time to propitiate him ; they extinguished all the fires in the kingdom ; they broke all their household furniture ; they bung black masks before their faces ; they prayed and fasted ; and on the evening of the last night they formed a great procession to a neighboring mountain . A human being was sacrificed exactly at midnight ; a block of wood was laid at once on the body , and fire was then produced by rapidly revolving another piece of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile , whose rising flame proclaimed to the anxious people the promise of the god not to destroy the world for another fifty-two years . Precisely the same custom obtained among the nations of Asia Minor and other parts of the continent of Asia , wherever sun-worship prevailed , at the periodical reproduction of the sacred fire , but not with the same bloody rites as in Mexico . ( Valentini , " Maya Archaeology , " p. 21 . ) To this day the Brahman of India " churns " his sacred fire out of a board by boring into it with a stick ; the Romans renewed their sacred fire in the same way ; and in Sweden even now a " need-fire is kindled in this manner when cholera or other pestilence is about . " ( Tylor 's " Anthropology , " p. 262 . ) A belief in ghosts is found on both continents . The American Indians think that the spirits of the dead retain the form and features which they wore while living ; that there is a hell and a heaven ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds ; that the souls of the wicked sometimes wander the face of the earth , appearing occasionally to mortals . The story of Tantalus is found among the Chippewayans , who believed that bad souls stand up to their chins in water in sight of the spirit-land , which they can never enter . The dead passed to heaven across a stream of water by means of a narrow and slippery bridge , from which many were lost . The Zunis set apart a day in each year which they spent among the graves of their dead , communing with their spirits , and bringing them presents  --  a kind of All-souls-day . ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 35 . ) The Stygian flood , and Scylla and Charybdis , are found among the legends of the Caribs . ( Ibid. , p. 37 . ) Even the boat of Charon reappears in the traditions of the Chippewayans . The Oriental belief in the transmigration of souls is found in every American tribe . The souls of men passed into animals or other men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The souls of the wicked passed into toads and wild beasts . ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 50 . ) Among both the Germans and the American Indians lycanthropy , or the metamorphosis of men into wolves , was believed in . In British Columbia the men-wolves have often been seen seated around a fire , with their wolf-hides hung upon sticks to dry ! The Irish legend of hunters pursuing an animal which suddenly disappears , whereupon a human being appears in its place is found among all the American tribes . That timid and harmless animal , the hare , was , singularly enough , an object of superstitious reverence and fear in Europe , Asia , and America . The ancient Irish killed all the hares they found on May-day among their cattle , believing them to be witches . Caesar gives an account of the horror in which this animal was held by the Britons . The Calmucks regarded the rabbit with fear and reverence . Divine honors were paid to the hare in Mexico . Wabasso was changed into a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull , Apis , of the Egyptians , reappears in the Sacred white buffalo of the Dakotas , which was supposed to possess supernatural power , and after death became a god . The white doe of European legend had its representative in the white deer of the Housatonic Valley , whose death brought misery to the tribe . The transmission of spirits by the laying on of hands , and the exorcism of demons , were part of the religion of the American tribes . The witches of Scandinavia , who produced tempests by their incantations , are duplicated in America . A Cree sorcerer sold three days of fair weather for one pound of tobacco ! The Indian sorcerers around Freshwater Bay kept the winds in leather bags , and disposed of them as they pleased . Among the American Indians it is believed that those who are insane or epileptic are " possessed of devils . " ( Tylor , " Prim . Cult. , " vol. ii. , pp. 123-126 . ) Sickness is caused by evil spirits entering into the sick person . ( Eastman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much feared , and their departure out of the body of the invalid is a cause of thanksgiving . Thus an Omaha , after an eructation , says , " Thank you , animal . " ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 55 . ) The confession of their sins was with a view to satisfy the evil spirit and induce him to leave them . ( Ibid. , p. 57 . ) In both continents burnt-offerings were sacrificed to the gods . In both continents the priests divined the future from the condition of the internal organs of the man or animal sacrificed . ( Ibid. , pp. 214 , 226 . ) In both continents the future was revealed by the flight of birds and by dreams . In Peru and Mexico there were colleges of augurs , as in Rome , who practised divination by watching the movements and songs of birds . ( Ibid. , p. 261 . ) Animals were worshipped in Central America and on the banks of the Nile . ( Ibid. , p. 259 . ) The Ojibbeways believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Ibid. , p. 225 ) . The peasantry of Western Europe have the same belief as to the howling of a dog . The belief in satyrs , and other creatures half man and half animal , survived in America . The Kickapoos are Darwinians . " They think their ancestors had tails , and when they lost them the impudent fox sent every morning to ask how their tails were , and the bear shook his fat sides at the joke . " ( Ibid. , p. 232 . ) Among the natives of Brazil the father cut a stick at the wedding of his daughter ; " this was done to cut off the tails of any future grandchildren . " ( Tylor , vol. i. , p. 384 . ) Jove , with the thunder-bolts in his hand , is duplicated in the Mexican god of thunder , Mixcoatl , who is represented holding a bundle of arrows . " He rode upon a tornado , and scattered the lightnings . " ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 98 . ) Dionysus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texcatzoncatl , the god of wine .

( Bollaert , pp. 12 , 13 . ) Deucalion repeopling the world is repeated in Xololt , who , after the destruction of the world , descended to Mictlan , the realm of the dead , and brought thence a bone of the perished race . This , sprinkled with blood , grew into a youth , the father of the present race . The Quiche hero-gods , Hunaphu and Xblanque , died ; their bodies were burnt , their bones ground to powder and thrown into the waters , whereupon they changed into handsome youths , with the same features as before . ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 193 . ) Witches and warlocks , mermaids and mermen , are part of the mythology of the American tribes , as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The mermaid of the Ottawas was " woman to the waist and fair ; " thence fish-like . ( Ibid. , p. 278 . ) The snake-locks of Medusa are represented in the snake-locks of At-otarho , an ancient culture-hero of the Iroquois . A belief in the incarnation of gods in men , and the physical translation of heroes to heaven , is part of the mythology of the Hindoos and the American races . Hiawatha , we are told , rose to heaven in the presence of the multitude , and vanished from sight in the midst of sweet music . The vocal statues and oracles of Egypt and Greece were duplicated in America . In Peru , in the valley of Rimac , there was an idol which answered questions and became famous as an oracle . ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 124 . ) The Peruvians believed that men were sometimes metamorphosed into stones . The Oneidas claimed descent from a stone , as the Greeks from the stones of Deucalion . ( Ibid. , p. 132 . ) Witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the Illinois Indians " they made small images to represent those whose days they have a mind to shorten , and which they stab to the heart , " whereupon the person represented is expected to die . ( Charlevoix , vol. ii. , p. 166 . ) The witches of Europe made figures of wax of their enemies , and gradually melted them at the fire , and as they diminished the victim was supposed to sicken and die . A writer in the Popular Science Monthly ( April , 1881 , p. 828 ) points out the fact that there is an absolute identity between the folk-lore of the negroes on the plantations of the South and the myths and stories of certain tribes of Indians in South America , as revealed by Mr. Herbert Smith 's " Brazil , the Amazons , and the Coast . " ( New York : Scribner , 1879 . ) Mr. Harris , the author of a work on the folk-lore of the negroes , asks this question , " When did the negro or the North American Indian come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customs .  --  Both peoples manufactured a fermented , intoxicating drink , the one deriving it from barley , the other from maize . Both drank toasts . Both had the institution of marriage , an important part of the ceremony consisting in the joining of hands ; both recognized divorce , and the Peruvians and Mexicans established special courts to decide cases of this kind . Both the Americans and Europeans erected arches , and had triumphal processions for their victorious kings , and both strewed the ground before them with leaves and flowers . Both celebrated important events with bonfires and illuminations ; both used banners , both invoked blessings . The Phoenicians , Hebrews , and Egyptians practised circumcision . Palacio relates that at Azori , in Honduras , the natives circumcised boys before an idol called Icelca . ( " Carta , " p. 84 . ) Lord Kingsborough tells us the Central Americans used the same rite , and McKenzie ( quoted by Retzius ) says he saw the ceremony performed by the Chippeways . Both had bards and minstrels , who on great festivals sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Peruvians held agricultural fairs ; both took a census of the people . Among both the land was divided per capita among the people ; in Judea a new division was made every fifty years . The Peruvians renewed every year all the fires of the kingdom from the Temple of the Sun , the new fire being kindled from concave mirrors by the sun 's rays . The Romans under Numa had precisely the same custom . The Peruvians had theatrical plays . They chewed the leaves of the coca mixed with lime , as the Hindoo to-day chews the leaves of the betel mixed with lime . Both the American and European nations were divided into castes ; both practised planet-worship ; both used scales and weights and mirrors . The Peruvians , Egyptians , and Chaldeans divided the year into twelve months , and the months into lesser divisions of weeks . Both inserted additional days , so as to give the year three hundred and sixty-five days . The Mexicans added five intercalary days ; and the Egyptians , in the time of Amunoph I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high authority can not be questioned , by an elaborate discussion ( " Vues des Cordilleras , " p. 148 et . seq. , ed. 1870 ) , has shown the relative likeness of the Nahua calendar to that of Asia . He cites the fact that the Chinese , Japanese , Calmucks , Mongols , Mantchou , and other hordes of Tartars have cycles of sixty years ' duration , divided into five brief periods of twelve years each . The method of citing a date by means of signs and numbers is quite similar with Asiatics and Mexicans . He further shows satisfactorily that the majority of the names of the twenty days employed by the Aztecs are those of a zodiac used since the most remote antiquity among the peoples of Eastern Asia . Cabera thinks he finds analogies between the Mexican and Egyptian calendars . Adopting the view of several writers that the Mexican year began on the 26th of February , he finds the date to correspond with the beginning of the Egyptian year . The American nations believed in four great primeval ages , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks of Homer , " says Volney , " I find the customs , discourse , and manners of the Iroquois , Delawares , and Miamis . The tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides paint to me almost literally the sentiments of the red men respecting necessity , fatality , the miseries of human life , and the rigor of blind destiny . " ( Volney 's " View of the United States . " ) The Mexicans represent an eclipse of the moon as the moon being devoured by a dragon ; and the Hindoos have precisely the same figure ; and both nations continued to use this expression long after they had discovered the real meaning of an eclipse . The Tartars believe that if they cut with an axe near a fire , or stick a knife into a burning stick , or touch the fire with a knife , they will " cut the top off the fire . " The Sioux Indians will not stick an awl or a needle into a stick of wood on the fire , or chop on it with an axe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World . The dead were burnt , and their ashes collected and placed in vases and urns , as in Europe . Wooden statues of the dead were made . There is a very curious and apparently inexplicable custom , called the " Couvade , " which extends from China to the Mississippi Valley ; it demands " that , when a child is born , the father must take to his bed , while the mother attends to all the duties of the household . " Marco Polo found the custom among the Chinese in the thirteenth century . The widow tells Hudibras  --  " Chineses thus are said To lie-in in their ladies ' stead . " The practice remarked by Marco Polo continues to this day among the hill-tribes of China . " The father of a new-born child , as soon as the mother has become strong enough to leave her couch , gets into bed himself , and there receives the congratulations Of his acquaintances . " ( Max Mueller 's " Chips from a German Workshop , " vol. ii. , p. 272 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions that , among the Iberians of the North of Spain , the women , after the birth of a child , tend their husbands , putting them to bed instead of going themselves . The same custom existed among the Basques only a few years ago . " In Biscay , " says M. F. Michel , " the women rise immediately after childbirth and attend to the duties of the household , while the husband goes to bed , taking the baby with him , and thus receives the neighbors ' compliments . " The same custom was found in France , and is said to exist to this day in some cantons of Bearn . Diodorus Siculus tells us that among the Corsicans the wife was neglected , and the husband put to bed and treated as the patient . Apollonius Rhodius says that among the Tibereni , at the south of the Black Sea , " when a child was born the father lay groaning , with his head tied up , while the mother tended him with food and prepared his baths . " The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Among the Caribs in the West Indies ( and the Caribs , Brasseur de Bourbourg says , were the same as the ancient Carians of the Mediterranean Sea ) the man takes to his bed as soon as a child is born , and kills no animals . And herein we find an explanation of a custom otherwise inexplicable . Among the American Indians it is believed that , if the father kills an animal during the infancy of the child , the spirit of the animal will revenge itself by inflicting some disease upon the helpless little one . " For six months the Carib father must not eat birds or fish , for what ever animals he eats will impress their likeness on the child , or produce disease by entering its body . " ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 58 . ) Among the Abipones the husband goes to bed , fasts a number of days , " and you would think , " says Dobrizboffer , " that it was he that had had the child . " The Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the child , and for fifteen days eats no meat and hunts no game . Among the Esquimaux the husbands forbear hunting during the lying-in of their wives and for some time thereafter . Here , then , we have a very extraordinary and unnatural custom , existing to this day on both sides of the Atlantic , reaching back to a vast antiquity , and finding its explanation only in the superstition of the American races . A practice so absurd could scarcely have originated separately in the two continents ; its existence is a very strong proof of unity of origin of the races on the opposite sides of the Atlantic ; and the fact that the custom and the reason for it are both found in America , while the custom remains in Europe without the reason , would imply that the American population was the older of the two . The Indian practice of depositing weapons and food with the dead was universal in ancient Europe , and in German villages nowadays a needle and thread is placed in the coffin for the dead to mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead man had a piece of money put in his hand to pay his way with . " ( " Anthropology , " p. 347 . ) The American Indian leaves food with the dead ; the Russian peasant puts crumbs of bread behind the saints ' pictures on the little iron shelf , and believes that the souls of his forefathers creep in and out and eat them . At the cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise , Paris , on All-souls-day , they " still put cakes and sweetmeats on the graves ; and in Brittany the peasants that night do not forget to make up the fire and leave the fragments of the supper on the table for the souls of the dead . " ( Ibid .. p. 351 . ) The Indian prays to the spirits of his forefathers ; the Chinese religion is largely " ancestor-worship ; " and the rites paid to the dead ancestors , or lares , held the Roman family together .

Herodotus , speaking of the wandering tribes of Northern Africa , says , " They bury their dead according to the fashion of the Greeks . . . . They bury them sitting , and are right careful , when the sick man is at the point of giving up the ghost , to make him sit , and not let him die lying down . " The dead bodies of the caciques of Bogota were protected from desecration by diverting the course of a river and making the grave in its bed , and then letting the stream return to its natural course . Alaric , the leader of the Goths , was secretly buried in the same way . ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 195 . ) Among the American tribes no man is permitted to marry a wife of the same clan-name or totem as himself . In India a Brahman is not allowed to marry a wife whose clan-name ( her " cow-stall , " as they say ) is the same as his own ; nor may a Chinaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthropology , " p. 403 . ) " Throughout India the hill-tribes are divided into septs or clans , and a man may not marry a woman belonging to his own clan . The Calmucks of Tartary are divided into hordes , and a man may not marry a girl of his own horde . The same custom prevails among the Circassians and the Samoyeds of Siberia . The Ostyaks and Yakuts regard it as a crime to marry a woman of the same family , or even of the same name . " ( Sir John Lubbock , " Smith . Rep. , " p. 347 , 1869 . ) Sutteeism  --  the burning of the widow upon the funeral-pile of the husband  --  was extensively practised in America ( West 's " Journal , " p. 141 ) ; as was also the practice of sacrificing warriors , servants , and animals at the funeral of a great chief ( Dorman , pp. 210-211 . ) Beautiful girls were sacrificed to appease the anger of the gods , as among the Mediterranean races . ( Bancroft , vol. iii. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a like purpose , as among the Carthaginians . The poisoned arrows of America had their representatives in Europe . Odysseus went to Ephyra for the man-slaying drug with which to smear his bronze-tipped arrows . ( Tylor 's " Anthropology , " p. 237 . ) " The bark canoe of America was not unknown in Asia and Africa " ( Ibid. , p. 254 ) , while the skin canoes of our Indians and the Esquimaux were found on the shores of the Thames and the Euphrates . In Peru and on the Euphrates commerce was carried on upon rafts supported by inflated skins . They are still used on the Tigris . The Indian boils his meat by dropping red-hot stones into a water-vessel made of hide ; and Linnaeus found the Both land people brewing beer in this way  --  " and to this day the rude Carinthian boor drinks such stone-beer , as it is called .

( Ibid. , p. 298 . ) The North American dog and bear dances , wherein the dancers acted the part of those animals , had their prototype in the Greek dances at the festivals of Dionysia . ( Ibid. , p. 298 . ) Tattooing was practised in both continents . Among the Indians it was fetichistic in its origin ; " every Indian had the image of an animal tattooed on his breast or arm , to charm away evil spirits . " ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 156 . ) The sailors of Europe and America preserve to this day a custom which was once universal among the ancient races . Banners , flags , and armorial bearings are supposed to be survivals of the old totemic tattooing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles . The war-paint of the American savage reappeared in the woad with which the ancient Briton stained his body ; and Tylor suggests that the painted stripes on the circus clown are a survival of a custom once universal . ( Tylor 's " Anthropology , " p. 327 . ) In America , as in the Old World , the temples of worship were built over the dead. , ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 178 . ) Says Prudentius , the Roman bard , " there were as many temples of gods as sepulchres . " The Etruscan belief that evil spirits strove for the possession of the dead was found among the Mosquito Indians . ( Bancroft , " Native Races , " vol. i. , p. 744 . ) The belief in fairies , which forms so large a part of the folklore of Western Europe , is found among the American races . The Ojibbeways see thousands of fairies dancing in a sunbeam ; during a rain myriads of them bide in the flowers . When disturbed they disappear underground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like them , they kill the domestic animals of those who offend them . The Dakotas also believe in fairies . The Otoes located the " little people " in a mound at the mouth of Whitestone River ; they were eighteen inches high , with very large heads ; they were armed with bows and arrows , and killed those who approached their residence . ( See Dorman 's " Origin of Primitive Superstitions , " p. 23 . ) " The Shoshone legends people the mountains of Montana with little imps , called Nirumbees , two feet long , naked , and with a tail . " They stole the children of the Indians , and left in their stead the young of their own baneful race , who resembled the stolen children so much that the mothers were deceived and suckled them , whereupon they died . This greatly resembles the European belief in " changelings . " ( Ibid. , p. 24 . ) In both continents we find tree-worship . In Mexico and Central America cypresses and palms were planted near the temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care , and received offerings of incense and gifts . The same custom prevailed among the Romans  --  the cypress was dedicated to Pluto , and the palm to Victory . Not only infant baptism by water was found both in the old Babylonian religion and among the Mexicans , but an offering of cakes , which is recorded by the prophet Jeremiah as part of the worship of the Babylonian goddess-mother , " the Queen of Heaven , " was also found in the ritual of the Aztecs . ( " Builders of Babel , " p. 78 . ) In Babylonia , China , and Mexico the caste at the bottom of the social scale lived upon floating islands of reeds or rafts , covered with earth , on the lakes and rivers . In Peru and Babylonia marriages were made but once a year , at a public festival . Among the Romans , the Chinese , the Abyssinians , and the Indians of Canada the singular custom prevails of lifting the bride over the door-step of her husband 's home . ( Sir John Lubbock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " The bride-cake which so invariably accompanies a wedding among ourselves , and which must always be cut by the bride , may be traced back to the old Roman form of marriage by ' conferreatio , ' or eating together . So , also , among the Iroquois the bride and bridegroom used to partake together of a cake of sagamite , which the bride always offered to her husband . " ( Ibid . ) Among many American tribes , notably in Brazil , the husband captured the wife by main force , as the men of Benjamin carried off the daughters of Shiloh at the feast , and as the Romans captured the Sabine women . " Within a few generations the same old habit was kept up in Wales , where the bridegroom and his friends , mounted and armed as for war , carried off the bride ; and in Ireland they used even to hurl spears at the bride 's people , though at such a distance that no one was hurt , except now and then by accident  --  as happened when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to this curious relic of antiquity . " ( Tylor 's " Anthropology , " p. 409 . ) Marriage in Mexico was performed by the priest . He exhorted them to maintain peace and harmony , and tied the end of the man 's mantle to the dress of the woman ; he perfumed them , and placed on each a shawl on which was painted a skeleton , " as a symbol that only death could now separate them from one another . " ( Dorman , " Prim . Superst. , " p. 379 . ) The priesthood was thoroughly organized in Mexico and Peru . They were prophets as well as priests . " They brought the newly-born infant into the religious society ; they directed their training and education ; they determined the entrance of the young men into the service of the state ; they consecrated marriage by their blessing ; they comforted the sick and assisted the dying . " ( Ibid. , p. 374 . ) There were five thousand priests in the temples of Mexico . They confessed and absolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choirs in the churches . They lived in conventual discipline , but were allowed to marry ; they practised flagellation and fasting , and prayed at regular hours . There were great preachers and exhorters among them . There were also convents into which females were admitted . The novice had her hair cut off and took vows of celibacy ; they lived holy and pious lives . ( Ibid. , pp. 375 , 376 . ) The king was the high-priest of the religious orders . A new king ascended the temple naked , except his girdle ; he was sprinkled four times with water which had been blessed ; he was then clothed in a mantle , and on his knees took an oath to maintain the ancient religion . The priests then instructed him in his royal duties . ( Ibid. , p. 378 . ) Besides the regular priesthood there were monks who were confined in cloisters . ( Ibid. , p. 390 . ) Cortes says the Mexican priests were very strict in the practice of honesty and chastity , and any deviation was punished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Dorman , " Prim .

The American doctors practised phlebotomy . They bled the sick man because they believed the evil spirit which afflicted him would come away with the blood . In Europe phlebotomy only continued to a late period , but the original superstition out of which it arose , in this case as in many others , was forgotten . There is opportunity here for the philosopher to meditate upon the perversity of human nature and the persistence of hereditary error . The superstition of one age becomes the science of another ; men were first bled to withdraw the evil spirit , then to cure the disease ; and a practice whose origin is lost in the night of ages is continued into the midst of civilization , and only overthrown after it has sent millions of human beings to untimely graves . Dr. Sangrado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red men of America . Folk-lore.  --  Says Max Mueller : " Not only do we find the same words and the same terminations in Sanscrit and Gothic ; not only do we find the same name for Zeus in Sanscrit , Latin , and German ; not only is the abstract Dame for God the same in India , Greece , and Italy ; but these very stories , these ' Maehrchen ' which nurses still tell , with almost the same words , in the Thuringian forest and in the Norwegian villages , and to which crowds of children listen under the Pippal-trees of India  --  these stories , too , belonged to the common heirloom of the Indo-European race , and their origin carries us back to the same distant past , when no Greek had set foot in Europe , no Hindoo had bathed in the sacred waters of the Ganges .

Exactly the same conception occurs in Grimm 's " Maehrchen , " when the two gold-children wish to see the world and to leave their father ; and when their father is sad , and asks them how he shall bear news of them , they tell him , " We leave you the two golden lilies ; from these you can see how we fare . If they are fresh , we are well ; if they fade , we are ill ; if they fall , we are dead . " Grimm traces the same idea in Hindoo stories .

The game of ball , which the Indians of America were in the habit of playing at the time of the discovery of the country , from California to the Atlantic , was identical with the European chueca , crosse , or hockey . One may well pause , after reading this catalogue , and ask himself , wherein do these peoples differ ? It is absurd to pretend that all these similarities could have been the result of accidental coincidences . These two peoples , separated by the great ocean , were baptized alike in infancy with blessed water ; they prayed alike to the gods ; they worshipped together the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were instructed alike by an established priesthood ; they were married in the same way and by the joining of hands ; they armed themselves with the same weapons ; when children came , the man , on both continents , went to bed and left his wife to do the honors of the household ; they tattooed and painted themselves in the same fashion ; they became intoxicated on kindred drinks ; their dresses were alike ; they cooked in the same manner ; they used the same metals ; they employed the same exorcisms and bleedings for disease ; they believed alike in ghosts , demons , and fairies ; they listened to the same stories ; they played the same games ; they used the same musical instruments ; they danced the same dances , and when they died they were embalmed in the same way and buried sitting ; while over them were erected , on both continents , the same mounds , pyramids , obelisks , and temples .

If our knowledge of Atlantis was more thorough , it would no doubt appear that , in every instance wherein the people of Europe accord with the people of America , they were both in accord with the people of Atlantis ; and that Atlantis was the common centre from which both peoples derived their arts , sciences , customs , and opinions . It will be seen that in every case where Plato gives us any information in this respect as to Atlantis , we find this agreement to exist . It existed in architecture , sculpture , navigation , engraving , writing , an established priesthood , the mode of worship , agriculture , the construction of roads and canals ; and it is reasonable to suppose that the , same correspondence extended down to all the minor details treated of in this chapter . CHAPTER III . AMERICAN EVIDENCES OF INTERCOURSE WITH EUROPE OR ATLANTIS. 1 . ON the monuments of Central America there are representations of bearded men . How could the beardless American Indians have imagined a bearded race ? 2 . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an Eastern origin . The leader and civilizer of the Nahua family was Quetzalcoatl . This is the legend respecting him : " From the distant East , from the fabulous Hue Hue Tlapalan , this mysterious person came to Tula , and became the patron god and high-priest of the ancestors of the Toltecs . He is described as having been a white man , with strong formation of body , broad forehead , large eyes , and flowing beard . He wore a mitre on his head , and was dressed in a long white robe reaching to his feet , and covered with red crosses . In his hand he held a sickle . His habits were ascetic , he never married , was most chaste and pure in life , and is said to have endured penance in a neighboring mountain , not for its effects upon himself , but as a warning to others . He condemned sacrifices , except of fruits and flowers , and was known as the god of peace ; for , when addressed on the subject of war , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( " North Amer. of Antiq. , " p. 268 . ) " He was skilled in many arts : he invented " ( that is , imported ) " gem-cutting and metal-casting ; he originated letters , and invented the Mexican calendar . He finally returned to the land in the East from which he came : leaving the American coast at Vera Cruz , he embarked in a canoe made of serpent-skins , and ' sailed away into the east . ' " ( Ibid. , p. 271 . ) Dr. Le Plongeon says of the columns at Chichen : " The base is formed by the head of Cukulcan , the shaft of the body of the serpent , with its feathers beautifully carved to the very chapiter . On the chapiters of the columns that support the portico , at the entrance of the castle in Chichen Itza , may be seen the carved figures of long-bearded men , with upraised hands , in the act of worshipping sacred trees . They forcibly recall to mind the same worship in Assyria . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a bearded figure grasping a beardless man . In the cut given below we see a face that might be duplicated among the old men of any part of Europe . The Cakchiquel MS. says : " Four persons came from Tulan , from the direction of the rising sun  --  that is one Tulan . There is another Tulan in Xibalbay , and another where the sun sets , and it is there that we came ; and in the direction of the setting sun there is another , where is the god ; so that there are four Tulans ; and it is where the sun sets that we came to Tulan , from the other side of the sea , where this Tulan is ; and it is there that we were conceived and begotten by our mothers and fathers . " That is to say , the birthplace of the race was in the East , across the sea , at a place called Tulan and when they emigrated they called their first stopping-place on the American continent Tulan also ; and besides this there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toltecs in Mexico the Olmecs and Xicalaucans were the most important . They were the forerunners of the great races that followed . According to Ixtlilxochitl , these people-which are conceded to be one occupied the world in the third age ; they came from the East in ships or barks to the land of Potonchan , which they commenced to populate. " 3 . The Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg , in one of the notes of the Introduction of the " Popol Vuh , " presents a very remarkable analogy between the kingdom of Xibalba , described in that work , and Atlantis . He says : " Both countries are magnificent , exceedingly fertile , and abound in the precious metals . The empire of Atlantis was divided into ten kingdoms , governed by five couples of twin sons of Poseidon , the eldest being supreme over the others ; and the ten constituted a tribunal that managed the affairs of the empire . Their descendants governed after them . The ten kings of Xibalba , who reigned ( in couples ) under Hun-Came and Vukub-Came ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly furnish curious points of comparison . And there is wanting neither a catastrophe  --  for Xibalba had a terrific inundation  --  nor the name of Atlas , of which the etymology is found only in the Nahuatl tongue : it comes from atl , water ; and we know that a city of Atlan ( near the water ) still existed on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama at the time of the Conquest . " " In Yucatan the traditions all point to an Eastern and foreign origin for the race . The early writers report that the natives believe their ancestors to have crossed the sea by a passage which was opened for them . " ( Landa 's " Relacion , " p. 28 . ) " It was also believed that part of the population came into the country from the West . Lizana says that the smaller portion , ' the little descent , ' came from the East , while the greater portion , ' the great descent , ' came from the West . Cogolluda considers the Eastern colony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zamna , the author of all civilization in Yucatan , is described as the teacher of letters , and the leader of the people from their ancient home . . . . He was the leader of a colony from the East . " ( " North Amer. of Antiq. , " p. 229 . ) The ancient Mexican legends say that , after the Flood , Coxcox and his wife , after wandering one hundred and four years , landed at Antlan , and passed thence to Capultepec , and thence to Culhuacan , and lastly to Mexico . Coming from Atlantis , they named their first landing-place Antlan . All the races that settled Mexico , we are told , traced their origin back to an Aztlan ( Atlan-tis ) . Duran describes Aztlan as " a most attractive land . " ( " North Amer. of Antiq. , " p. 257 . ) Same , the great name of Brazilian legend , came across the ocean from the rising sun . He had power over the elements and tempests ; the trees of the forests would recede to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the animals used to crouch before him ( domesticated animals ) ; lakes and rivers became solid for him ( boats and bridges ) ; and he taught the use of agriculture and magic . Like him , Bochica , the great law-giver of the Muyscas , and son of the sun  --  he who invented for them the calendar and regulated their festivals  --  had a white beard , a detail in which all the American culture-heroes agree . The " Same " of Brazil was probably the " Zamna " of Yucatan . ELEPHANT MOUND , WISCONSIN . 4 . We find in America numerous representations of the elephant . We are forced to one of two conclusions : either the monuments date back to the time of the mammoth in North America , or these people held intercourse at some time in the past with races who possessed the elephant , and from whom they obtained pictures of that singular animal . Plato tells us that the Atlanteans possessed great numbers of elephants . There are in Wisconsin a number of mounds of earth representing different animals-men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUNTY , IOWA . Among the latter is a mound representing an elephant , " so perfect in its proportions , and complete in its representation of an elephant , that its builders must have been well acquainted with all the physical characteristics of the animal which they delineated . " We copy the representation of this mound on page 168 . On a farm in Louisa County , Iowa , a pipe was ploughed up which also represents an elephant . We are indebted to the valuable work of John T. Short ( " The North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 530 ) for a picture of this singular object . It was found in a section where the ancient mounds were very abundant and rich in relics . The pipe is of sandstone , of the ordinary Mound-Builder 's type , and has every appearance of age and usage . There can be no doubt of its genuineness . The finder had no conception of its archaeological value . In the ruined city of Palenque we find , in one of the palaces , a stucco bass-relief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully the head of an elephant . The cut on page 169 is from a drawing made by Waldeck . The decoration known as " elephant-trunks " is found in many parts of the ancient ruins of Central America , projecting from above the door-ways of the buildings . In Tylor 's " Researches into the Early History of Mankind , " p. 313 , I find a remarkable representation of an elephant , taken from an ancient Mexican manuscript . It is as follows : MEXICAN REPRESENTATION OF ELEPHANT . CHAPTER IV . CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES . 1 . Lenormant insists that the human race issued from Ups Merou , and adds that some Greek traditions point to " this locality  --  particularly the expression me'ropes a ? ' newpoi , which can only mean ' the men sprung from Merou . ' " ( " Manual , " p.21 . ) Theopompus tells us that the people who inhabited Atlantis were the Meropes , the people of Merou. 2 . Whence comes the word Atlantic ? The dictionaries tell us that the ocean is named after the mountains of Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The words Atlas and Atlantic have no satisfactory etymology in any language known to Europe . They are not Greek , and can not be referred to any known language of the Old World . But in the Nahuatl language we find immediately the radical a , atl , which signifies water , war , and the top of the head . ( Molina , " Vocab. en lengua Mexicana y Castellana . " ) From this comes a series of words , such as atlan  --  on the border of or amid the water  --  from which we ' have the adjective Atlantic . We have also atlaca , to combat , or be in agony ; it means likewise to hurl or dart from the water , and in the preterit makes Atlaz . A city named Atlan existed when the continent was discovered by Columbus , at the entrance of the Gulf of Uraba , in Darien . With a good harbor , it is now reduced to an unimportant pueblo named Acla . " ( Baldwin 's " Ancient America , " p. 179 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were named after Atlas , the eldest son of Poseidon , the founder of the kingdom . 3 . Upon that part of the African continent nearest to the site of Atlantis we find a chain of mountains , known from the most ancient times as the Atlas Mountains . Whence this name Atlas , if it be not from the name of the great king of Atlantis ? And if this be not its origin , how comes it that we find it in the most north-western corner of Africa ? And how does it happen that in the time of Herodotus there dwelt near this mountain-chain a people called the Atlantes , probably a remnant of a colony from Solon 's island ? How comes it that the people of the Barbary States were known to the Greeks , Romans , and Carthaginians as the " Atlantes , " this name being especially applied to the inhabitants of Fezzan and Bilma ? Where did they get the name from ? There is no etymology for it east of the Atlantic Ocean . ( Lenormants " Anc . Hist. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! An " Atlas " mountain on the shore of Africa ; an " Atlan " town on the shore of America ; the " Atlantes " living along the north and west coast of Africa ; an Aztec people from Aztlan , in Central America ; an ocean rolling between the two worlds called the " Atlantic ; " a mythological deity called " Atlas " holding the world on his shoulders ; and an immemorial tradition of an island of Atlantis . Can all these things be the result of accident ? 4 . Plato says that there was a " passage west from Atlantis to the rest of the islands , as well as from these islands to the whole opposite continent that surrounds that real sea . " He calls it a real sea , as contradistinguished from the Mediterranean , which , as he says , is not a real sea ( or ocean ) but a landlocked body of water , like a harbor . Now , Plato might have created Atlantis out of his imagination ; but how could he have invented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole continent ( America ) enclosing that real sea ? If we look at the map , we see that the continent of America does " surround " the ocean in a great half-circle . Could Plato have guessed all this ? If there had been no Atlantis , and no series of voyages from it that revealed the half-circle of the continent from Newfoundland to Cape St. Roche , how could Plato have guessed it ? And how could he have known that the Mediterranean was only a harbor compared with the magnitude of the great ocean surrounding Atlantis ? Long sea-voyages were necessary to establish that fact , and the Greeks , who kept close to the shores in their short journeys , did not make such voyages . 5 . How can we , without Atlantis , explain the presence of the Basques in Europe , who have no lingual affinities with any other race on the continent of Europe , but whose language is similar to the languages of America ? Plato tells us that the dominion of Gadeirus , one of the kings of Atlantis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as far as the country which is still called the region of Gades in that part of the world . " Gades is the Cadiz of today , and the dominion of Gadeirus embraced the land of the Iberians or Basques , their chief city taking its name from a king of Atlantis , and they themselves being Atlanteans . Dr. Farrar , referring to the Basque language , says : " What is certain about it is , that its structure is polysynthetic , like the languages of America . Like them , it forms its compounds by the elimination of certain radicals in the simple words ; so that ilhun , the twilight , is contracted from hill , dead , and egun , day ; and belhaur , the knee , from belhar , front , and oin , leg . . . . The fact is indisputable , and is eminently noteworthy , that while the affinities of the Basque roots have never been conclusively elucidated , there has never been any doubt that this isolated language , preserving its identity in a western corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grammatical structure , the aboriginal languages of the vast opposite continent ( America ) , and those alone . " ( " Families of Speech , " p. 132 . ) If there was an Atlantis , forming , with its connecting ridges , a continuous bridge of land from America to Africa , we can understand how the Basques could have passed from one continent to another ; but if the wide Atlantic rolled at all times unbroken between the two continents , it is difficult to conceive of such an emigration by an uncivilized people . 6 . Without Atlantis , how can we explain the fact that the early Egyptians were depicted by themselves as red men on their own monuments ? And , on the other hand , how can we account for the representations of negroes on the monuments of Central America ? Desire Charnay , now engaged in exploring those monuments , has published in the North American Review for December , 1880 , photographs of a number of idols exhumed at San Juan de Teotihuacan , from which I select the following strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Plongeon says : " Besides the sculptures of long-bearded men seen by the explorer at Chichen Itza , there were tall figures of people with small heads , thick lips , and curly short hair or wool , regarded as negroes . ' We always see them as standard or parasol bearers , but never engaged in actual warfare . ' " ( " Maya Archaeology , " p. 62 . ) The following cut is from the court of the Palace of Palenque , figured by Stephens . The face is strongly Ethiopian . The figure below represents a gigantic granite head , found near the volcano of Tuxtla , in the Mexican State of Vera Cruz , at Caxapa . The features are unmistakably negroid . As the negroes have never been a sea-going race , the presence of these faces among the antiquities of Central America proves one of two things , either the existence of a land connection between America and Africa via Atlantis , as revealed by the deep-sea soundings of the Challenger , or commercial relations between America and Africa through the ships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes were brought to America as slaves at a very remote epoch . And we find some corroboration of the latter theory in that singular book of the Quiches , the " Popol Vuh , " in which , after describing the creation of the first men " in the region of the rising sun " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. v. , p. 548 ) , and enumerating their first generations , we are told , " All seem to have spoken one language , and to have lived in great peace , black men and white together . Here they awaited the rising of the sun , and prayed to the Heart of Heaven . " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " p. 547 . ) How did the red men of Central America know anything about " black men and white men ? " The conclusion seems inevitable that these legends of a primitive , peaceful , and happy land , an Aztlan in the East , inhabited by black and white men , to which all the civilized nations of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bridge of land where the white , dark , and red races met . The " Popol Vuh " proceeds to tell how this first home of the race became over-populous , and how the people under Balam-Quitze migrated ; how their language became " confounded , " in other words , broken up into dialects , in consequence of separation ; and how some of the people " went to the East , and many came hither to Guatemala . " ( Ibid. , p. 547 . ) M. A. de Quatrefages ( " Human Species , " p. 200 ) says , " Black populations have been found in America in very small numbers only , as isolated tribes in the midst of very different populations . Such are the Charruas , of Brazil , the Black Carribees of Saint Vincent , in the Gulf of Mexico ; the Jamassi of Florida , and the dark-complexioned Californians . . . . Such , again , is the tribe that Balboa saw some representatives of in his passage of the Isthmus of Darien in 1513 ; . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the civilizations of the Old World radiate from the shores of the Mediterranean ? The Mediterranean is a cul de sac , with Atlantis opposite its mouth . Every civilization on its shores possesses traditions that point to Atlantis . We hear of no civilization coming to the Mediterranean from Asia , Africa , or Europe  --  from north , south , or west ; but north , south , east , and west we find civilization radiating from the Mediterranean to other lands . We see the Aryans descending upon Hindostan from the direction of the Mediterranean ; and we find the Chinese borrowing inventions from Hindostan , and claiming descent from a region not far from the Mediterranean . The Mediterranean has been the centre of the modern world , because it lay in the path of the extension of an older civilization , whose ships colonized its shores , as they did also the shores . of America . Plato says , " the nations are gathered around the shores of the Mediterranean like frogs around a marsh . " Dr. McCausland says : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time previous to these migrations a people speaking a language of a superior and complicated structure broke up their society , and , under some strong impulse , poured out in different directions , and gradually established themselves in all the lands now inhabited by the Caucasian race . Their territories extend from the Atlantic to the Ganges , and from Iceland to Ceylon , and are bordered on the north and east by the Asiatic Mongols , and on the south by the negro tribes of Central Africa . They present all the appearances of a later race , expanding itself between and into the territories of two pre-existing neighboring races , and forcibly appropriating the room required for its increasing population . " ( McCausland 's " Adam and the Adamites , " p. 280 . ) Modern civilization is Atlantean . Without the thousands of years of development which were had in Atlantis modern civilization could not have existed . The inventive faculty of the present age is taking up the great delegated work of creation where Atlantis left it thousands of years ago . 8 . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe without Atlantis ? It is an intrusive race ; a race colonized on sea-coasts . Where are its Old World affinities ? 9 . Why is it that the origin of wheat , barley , oats , maize , and rye  --  the essential plants of civilization  --  is totally lost in the mists of a vast antiquity ? We have in the Greek mythology legends of the introduction of most of these by Atlantean kings or gods into Europe ; but no European nation claims to have discovered or developed them , and it has been impossible to trace them to their wild originals . Out of the whole flora of the world mankind in the last seven thousand years has not developed a single food-plant to compare in importance to the human family with these . If a wise and scientific nation should propose nowadays to add to this list , it would have to form great botanical gardens , and , by systematic and long-continued experiments , develop useful plants from the humble productions of the field and forest .

The Barbarians who are alluded to by Homer and Thucydides were a race of ancient navigators and pirates called Cares , or Carians , who occupied the isles of Greece before the Pelasgi , and antedated the Phoenicians in the control of the sea . The Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg claims that these Carians were identical with the Caribs of the West Indies , the Caras of Honduras , and the Gurani of South America . ( Landa 's " Relacion , " pp. 52-65. ) 14 . When we consider it closely , one of the most extraordinary customs ever known to mankind is that to which I have already alluded in a preceding chapter , to wit , the embalming of the body of the dead man , with a purpose that the body itself may live again in a future state . To arrive at this practice several things must coexist : a . The people must be highly religious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so troublesome a custom from age to age . b . They must believe implicitly in the immortality of the soul ; and this implies a belief in rewards and punishments after death ; in a heaven and a hell . c . They must believe in the immortality of the body , and its resurrection from the grave on some day of judgment in the distant future . d . But a belief in the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body is not enough , for all Christian nations hold to these beliefs ; they must supplement these with a determination that the body shall not perish ; that the very flesh and blood in which the man died shall rise with him on the last day , and not a merely spiritual body . Now all these four things must coexist before a people proceed to embalm their dead for religious purposes . The probability that all these four things should coexist by accident in several widely separated races is slight indeed . The doctrine of chances is all against it . There is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which so many resemblances have been explained ; the practice is a religious ceremony , growing out of religious beliefs by no means common or universal , to wit , that the man who is dead shall live again , and live again in the very body in which he died . Not even all the Jews believed in these things . If , then , it should appear that among the races which we claim were descended from Atlantis this practice of embalming the dead is found , and nowhere else , we have certainly furnished evidence which can only be explained by admitting the existence of Atlantis , and of some great religious race dwelling on Atlantis , who believed in the immortality of soul and body , and who embalmed their dead . We find , as I have shown : First . That the Guanches of the Canary Islands , supposed to be a remnant of the Atlantean population , preserved their dead as mummies . Second . That the Egyptians , the oldest colony of Atlantis , embalmed their dead in such vast multitudes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ground up into manures to grow English turnips . Third . That the Assyrians , the Ethiopians , the Persians , the Greeks , and even the Romans embalmed their dead . Fourth . On the American continents we find that the Peruvians , the Central Americans , the Mexicans , and some of the Indian tribes , followed the same practice . Is it possible to account for this singular custom , reaching through a belt of nations , and completely around the habitable world , without Atlantis ? 15 . All the traditions of the Mediterranean races look to the ocean as the source of men and gods . Homer sings of " Ocean , the origin of gods and Mother Tethys . " Orpheus says , " The fair river of Ocean was the first to marry , and he espoused his sister Tethys , who was his mothers daughter . " ( Plato 's " Dialogues , " Cratylus , p. 402 . ) The ancients always alluded to the ocean as a river encircling the earth , as in the map of Cosmos ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great canal described by Plato which surrounded the plain of Atlantis . Homer ( Iliad , book xviii. ) describes Tethys , " the mother goddess , " coming to Achilles " from the deep abysses of the main : " " The circling Nereids with their mistress weep , And all the sea-green sisters of the deep . " Plato surrounds the great statue of Poseidon in Atlantis with the images of one hundred Nereids. 16. in the Deluge legends of the Hindoos ( as given on page 87 ante ) , we have seen Manu saving a small fish , which subsequently grew to a great size , and warned him of the coming of the Flood . In this legend all the indications point to an ocean as the scene of the catastrophe . It says : " At the close of the last calpa there was a general destruction , caused by the sleep of Brahma , whence his creatures , in different worlds , were drowned in a vast ocean . . . . A holy king , named Satyavrata , then reigned , a servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poseidon ? ) , " and so devout that water was his only sustenance . . . . In seven days the three worlds " ( remember Poseidon 's trident ) " shall be plunged in an ocean of death . " . . . " ' Thou shalt enter the spacious ark , and continue in it secure from the Flood on one immense ocean . ' . . . The sea overwhelmed its shores , deluged the whole earth , augmented by showers from immense clouds . " ( " Asiatic Researches , " vol. i. , p. 230 . ) All this reminds us of " the fountains of the great deep and the flood-gates of heaven , " and seems to repeat precisely the story of Plato as to the sinking of Atlantis in the ocean . 17 . While I do not attach much weight to verbal similarities in the languages of the two continents , nevertheless there are some that are very remarkable . We have seen the Pan and Maia of the Greeks reappearing in the Pan and Maya of the Mayas of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hu the mighty , " is found in the Hu-nap-bu , the hero-god of the Quiches ; in Hu-napu , a hero-god ; and in Hu-hu-nap-hu , in Hu-ncam , in Hu-nbatz , semi-divine heroes of the Quiches . The Phoenician deity El " was subdivided into a number of hypostases called the Baalim , secondary divinities , emanating from the substance of the deity " ( " Anc . Hist . East , " vol. ii. , p. 219 ) ; and this word Baalim we find appearing in the mythology of the Central Americans , applied to the semi-divine progenitors of the human race , Balam-Quitze , Balam-Agab , and Iqui-Balam . CHAPTER V. THE QUESTION OF COMPLEXION . The tendency of scientific thought in ethnology is in the direction of giving more and more importance to the race characteristics , such as height , color of the hair , eyes and skin , and the formation of the skull and body generally , than to language . The language possessed by a people may be merely the result of conquest or migration . For instance , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , the descendants of French , Spanish , Italians , Mexicans , Irish , Germans , Scandinavians , Africans , all speak the English language , and by the test of language they are all Englishmen ; and yet none of them are connected by birth or descent with the country where that language was developed . There is a general misconception as to the color of the European and American races . Europe is supposed to be peopled exclusively by white men ; but in reality every shade of color is represented on that continent , from the fair complexion of the fairest of the Swedes to the dark-skinned inhabitants of the Mediterranean coast , only a shade lighter than the Berbers , or Moors , on the opposite side of that sea . Tacitus spoke of the " Black Celts , " and the term , so far as complexion goes , might not inappropriately be applied to some of the Italians , Spaniards , and Portuguese , while the Basques are represented as of a still darker hue . Tylor says ( " Anthropology , " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the distinction of color , from the fairest Englishman to the darkest African , has no hard and fast lines , but varies gradually from one tint to another . " And when we turn to America we find that the popular opinion that all Indians are " red men , " and of the same hue from Patagonia to Hudson 's Bay , is a gross error . Prichard says ( " Researches into the Physical History of Mankind , " vol. i. , p. 269 , 4th ed. , 1841 ) : " It will be easy to show that the American races show nearly as great a variety in this respect as the nations of the old continent ; there are among them white races with a florid complexion , and tribes black or of a very dark hue ; that their stature , figure , and countenance are almost equally diversified . " John T. Short says ( " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 189 ) : " The Menominees , sometimes called the ' White Indians , ' formerly occupied the region bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Indians , which is compared to that of white mulattoes , early attracted the attention of the Jesuit missionaries , and has often been commented on by travellers . While it is true that hybridy has done much to lighten the color of many of the tribes , still the peculiarity of the complexion of this people has been marked since the first time a European encountered them . Almost every shade , from the ash-color of the Menominees through the cinnamon-red , copper , and bronze tints , may be found among the tribes formerly occupying the territory cast of the Mississippi , until we reach the dark-skinned Kaws of Kansas , who are nearly as black as the negro . The variety of complexion is as great in South America as among the tribes of the northern part of the continent . " In foot-note of p. 107 of vol. iii . of " U. S. Explorations for a Railroad Route to the Pacific Ocean , " we are told , " Many of the Indians of Zuni ( New Mexico ) are white . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , and are quite good-looking . They claim to be full-blooded Zunians , and have no tradition of intermarriage with any foreign race . The circumstance creates no surprise among this people , for from time immemorial a similar class of people has existed among the tribe . " Winchell says : " The ancient Indians of California , in the latitude of forty-two degrees , were as black as the negroes of Guinea , while in Mexico were tribes of an olive or reddish complexion , relatively light . Among the black races of tropical regions we find , generally , some light-colored tribes interspersed . These sometimes have light hair and blue eyes . This is the case with the Tuareg of the Sahara , the Afghans of India , and the aborigines of the banks of the Oronoco and the Amazon . " ( Winchell 's " Preadamites , " p. 185 . ) William Penn said of the Indians of Pennsylvania , in his letter of August , 1683 : " The natives . . . are generally tall , straight , well-built , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly walk with a lofty chin . . . . Their eye is little and black , not unlike a straight-looked Jew . . . . I have seen among them as comely European-like faces of both sexes as on your side of the sea ; and truly an Italian complexion hath not much more of the white , and the noses of several of them have as much of the Roman . . . . For their original , I am ready to believe them to be of the Jewish race  --  I mean of the stock of the ten tribes  --  and that for the following reasons : first , in the next place , I find them to be of the like countenance , and their children of so lively a resemblance that a man would think himself in Duke 's Place or Berry Street in London when he seeth them . But this is not all : they agree in rites , they reckon by moons , they offer their first-fruits , they have a kind of feast of tabernacles , they are said to lay their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs of women , with many other things that do not now occur . " Upon this question of complexion Catlin , in his " Indians of North America , " vol. i. , p. 95 , etc. , gives us some curious information . We have already seen that the Mandans preserved an image of the ark , and possessed legends of a clearly Atlantean character . Catlin says : " A stranger in the Mandan village is first struck with the different shades of complexion and various colors of hair which he sees in a crowd about him , and is at once disposed to exclaim , ' These are not Indians . ' There are a great many of these people whose complexions appear as light as half-breeds ; and among the women particularly there are many whose skins are almost white , with the most pleasing symmetry and proportion of feature ; with hazel , with gray , and with blue eyes ; with mildness and sweetness of expression and excessive modesty of demeanor , which render them exceedingly pleasing and beautiful . Why this diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for it . Their traditions , so far as I can learn them , afford us no information of their having had any knowledge of white men before the visit of Lewis and Clarke , made to their village thirty-three years ago . Since that time until now ( 1835 ) there have been very few visits of white men to this place , and surely not enough to have changed the complexions and customs of a nation . And I recollect perfectly well that Governor Clarke told me , before I started for this place , that I would find the Mandans a strange people and half white . " Among the females may be seen every shade and color of hair that can be seen in our own country except red or auburn , which is not to be found . . . . There are very many of both sexes , and of every age , from infancy to manhood and old age , with hair of a bright silvery-gray , and in some instances almost perfectly white . This unaccountable phenomenon is not the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic which runs in families , and indicates no inequality in disposition or intellect . And by passing this hair through my hands I have found it uniformly to be as coarse and harsh as a horse 's mane , differing materially from the hair of other colors , which , among the Mandans , is generally as fine and soft as silk . " The stature of the Mandans is rather below the ordinary size of man , with beautiful symmetry of form and proportion , and wonderful suppleness and elasticity . " Catlin gives a group ( 54 ) showing this great diversity in complexion : one of the figures is painted almost pure white , and with light hair . The faces are European . GOVERNOR AND OTHER INDIANS OF THE PUEBLO OF SAN DOMINGO , NEW MEXICO . Major James W. Lynd , who lived among the Dakota Indians for nine years , and was killed by them in the great outbreak of 1862 , says ( MS . " Hist. of Dakotas , " Library , Historical Society , Minnesota , p. 47 ) , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sioux nation represent several different degrees of darkness of color : " The Dakota child is of lighter complexion than the young brave ; this one lighter than the middle-aged man , and the middle-aged man lighter than the superannuated homo , who , by smoke , paint , dirt , and a drying up of the vital juices , appears to be the true copper-colored Dakota . The color of the Dakotas varies with the nation , and also with the age and condition of the individual . It may be set down , however , as a shade lighter than olive ; yet it becomes still lighter by change of condition or mode of life , and nearly vanishes , even in the child , under constant ablutions and avoiding of exposure . Those children in the Mission at Hazlewood , who are taken very young , and not allowed to expose themselves , lose almost entirely the olive shade , and become quite as white as the American child . The Mandans are as light as the peasants of Spain , while their brothers , the Crows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the ' Universal Traveller , ' p. 154 , says that the modern Peruvians , in the warmer regions of Peru , are as fair as the people of the south of Europe . " The Aymaras , the ancient inhabitants of the mountains of Peru and Bolivia , are described as having an olive-brown complexion , with regular features , large heads , and a thoughtful and melancholy cast of countenance . They practised in early times the deformation of the skull . Professor Wilson describes the hair of the ancient Peruvians , as found upon their mummies , as " a lightish brown , and of a fineness of texture which equals that of the Anglo-Saxon race . " " The ancient Peruvians , " says Short ( " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 187 ) , " appear , from numerous examples of hair found in their tombs , to have been an auburn-haired race . " Garcilasso , who had an opportunity of seeing the body of the king , Viracocha , describes the hair of that monarch as snow-white . Haywood tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , of three mummies in a cave on the south side of the Cumberland River ( Tennessee ) , who were buried in baskets , as the Peruvians were occasionally buried , and whose skin was fair and white , and their hair auburn , and of a fine texture . ( " Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee , " p. 191 . ) CHOCTAW . Neither is the common opinion correct which asserts all the American Indians to be of the same type of features . The portraits on this page and on pages 187 and 191 , taken from the " Report of the U. S. Survey for a Route for a Pacific Railroad , " present features very much like those of Europeans ; in fact , every face here could be precisely matched among the inhabitants of the southern part of the old continent . SHAWNEES . On the other hand , look at the portrait of the great Italian orator and reformer , Savonarola , on page 193 . It looks more like the hunting Indians of North-western America than any of the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scalp-lock it would pass muster anywhere as a portrait of the " Man-afraid-of-his-horses , " or " Sitting Bull . " SAVONAROLA . Adam was , it appears , a red man . Winchell tells us that Adam is derived from the red earth . The radical letters ADaM are found in ADaMaH , " something out of which vegetation was made to germinate , " to wit , the earth . ADoM and ADOM signifies red , ruddy , bay-colored , as of a horse , the color of a red heifer . " ADaM , a man , a human being , male or female , red , ruddy . " ( " Preadamites , " p.161 . ) " The Arabs distinguished mankind into two races , one red , ruddy , the other black . " ( Ibid . ) They classed themselves among the red men . Not only was Adam a red man , but there is evidence that , from the highest antiquity , red was a sacred color ; the gods of the ancients were always painted red . The Wisdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it elegantly , and formed it by the skill of his understanding , and fashioned it to the shape of a man , or made it like some vile beast , laying it over with vermilion , and with paint , coloring it red , and covering every spot therein . " The idols of the Indians were also painted red , and red was the religious color . ( Lynd 's MS . " Hist. of Dakotas , " Library , Hist . Society , Minn . ) The Cushites and Ethiopians , early branches of the Atlantean stock , took their name from their " sunburnt " complexion ; they were red men . The name of the Phoenicians signified red . Himyar , the prefix of the Himyaritic Arabians , also means red , and the Arabs were painted red on the Egyptian monuments . The ancient Egyptians were red men . They recognized four races of men  --  the red , yellow , black , and white men . They themselves belonged to the " Rot , " or red men ; the yellow men they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black men were called " Nahsu , " and the white men " Tamhu . " The following figures are copied from Nott and Gliddon 's " Types of Mankind , " p. 85 , and were taken by them from the great works of Belzoni , Champollion , and Lepsius . In later ages so desirous were the Egyptians of preserving , the aristocratic distinction of the color of their skin , that they represented themselves on the monuments as of a crimson hue  --  an exaggeration of their original race complexion . In the same way we find that the ancient Aryan writings divided mankind into four races  --  the white , red , yellow , and black : the four castes of India were founded upon these distinctions in color ; in fact , the word for color in Sanscrit ( varna ) means caste . The red men , according to the Mahabharata , were the Kshatriyas  --  the warrior caste-who were afterward engaged in a fierce contest with the whites  --  the Brahmans  --  and were nearly exterminated , although some of them survived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the Mohammedan and Christian but the Buddhistic religion seem to be derived from branches of the Hamitic or red stock . The great Manu was also of the red race . THE RACES OF MEN ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIANS . The Egyptians , while they painted themselves red-brown , represented the nations of Palestine as yellow-brown , and the Libyans yellow-white . The present inhabitants of Egypt range from a yellow color in the north parts to a deep bronze . Tylor is of opinion ( " Anthropology , " p. 95 ) that the ancient Egyptians belonged to a brown race , which embraced the Nubian tribes and , to some extent , the Berbers of Algiers and Tunis . He groups the Assyrians , Phoenicians , Persians , Greeks , Romans , Andalusians , Bretons , dark Welshmen , and people of the Caucasus into one body , and designates them as " dark whites . " The Himyarite Arabs , as I have shown , derived their name originally from their red color , and they were constantly depicted on the Egyptian monuments as red or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation of Libyans , called the Maxyans , who claimed descent from the people of Troy ( the walls of Troy , we shall see , were built by Poseidon ; that is to say , Troy was an Atlantean colony ) . These Maxyans painted their whole bodies red . The Zavecians , the ancestors of the Zuavas of Algiers ( the tribe that gave their name to the French Zouaves ) , also painted themselves red . Some of the Ethiopians were " copper-colored . " ( " ' Amer . Cyclop. , " art . Egypt , p. 464 . ) Tylor says ( " Anthropology , " p. 160 ) : " The language of the ancient Egyptians , though it can not be classed in the Semitic family with Hebrew , has important points of correspondence , whether due to the long intercourse between the two races in Egypt or to some deeper ancestral connection ; and such analogies also appear in the Berber languages of North Africa . " These last were called by the ancients the Atlanteans . " If a congregation of twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandwich Islands , Chili , Peru , Brazil , Chickasaws , Comanches , etc. , were dressed alike , or undressed and unshaven , the most skilful anatomist could not , from their appearance , separate them . " ( Fontaine 's " How the World was Peopled , " pp. 147 , 244 . ) Ferdinand Columbus , in his relation of his father 's voyages , compares the inhabitants of Guanaani to the Canary Islanders ( an Atlantean race ) , and describes the inhabitants of San Domingo as still more beautiful and fair . In Peru the Charanzanis , studied by M. Angraud , also resemble the Canary Islanders . L'Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg imagined himself surrounded by Arabs when all his Indians of Rabinal were around him ; for they had , he said , their complexion , features , and beard . Pierre Martyr speaks of the Indians of the Parian Gulf as having fair hair . ( " The Human Species , " p. 201 . ) The same author believes that tribes belonging to the Semitic type are also found in America . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the country of a weapon entirely characteristic of the ancient Canary Islanders . " When science is able to disabuse itself of the Mortonian theory that the aborigines of America are all red men , and all belong to one race , we may hope that the confluence upon the continent of widely different races from different countries may come to be recognized and intelligently studied . There can be no doubt that red , white , black , and yellow men have united to form the original population of America . And there can be as little doubt that the entire population of Europe and the south shore of the Mediterranean is a mongrel race  --  a combination , in varying proportions , of a dark-brown or red race with a white race ; the characteristics of the different nations depending upon the proportions in which the dark and light races are mingled , for peculiar mental and moral characteristics go with these complexions . The red-haired people are a distinct variety of the white stock ; there were once whole tribes and nations with this color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races of men , from Palestine to Iceland . Everything in Europe speaks of vast periods of time and long , continued and constant interfusion of bloods , until there is not a fair-skinned man on the Continent that has not the blood of the dark-haired race in his veins ; nor scarcely a dark-skinned man that is not lighter in hue from intermixture with the white stock . CHAPTER VI . GENESIS CONTAINS A HISTORY OF ATLANTIS The Hebrews are a branch of the great family of which that powerful commercial race , the Phoenicians , who were the merchants of the world fifteen hundred years before the time of Christ , were a part . The Hebrews carried out from the common storehouse of their race a mass of traditions , many of which have come down-to us in that oldest and most venerable of human compositions , the Book of Genesis . I have shown that the story of the Deluge plainly refers to the destruction of Atlantis , and that it agrees in many important particulars with the account given by Plato . The people destroyed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created civilization ; they had formerly been in a happy and sinless condition ; they had become great and wicked ; they were destroyed for their sins  --  they were destroyed by water . But we can go farther , and it can be asserted that there is scarcely a prominent fact in the opening chapters of the Book of Genesis that can not be duplicated from the legends of the American nations , and scarcely a custom known to the Jews that does not find its counterpart among the people of the New World . Even in the history of the Creation we find these similarities : The Bible tells us ( Gen. i. , 2 ) that in the beginning the earth was without form and void , and covered with water . In the Quiche legends we are told , " at first all was sea  --  no man , animal , bird , or green herb  --  there was nothing to be seen but the sea and the heavens . " The Bible says ( Gen. i. , 2 ) , " And the Spirit of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiche legend says , " The Creator  --  the Former , the Dominator  --  the feathered serpent  --  those that give life , moved upon the waters like a glowing light . " The Bible says ( Gen. i. , 9 ) , " And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so . " The Quiche legend says , " The creative spirits cried out ' Earth ! ' and in an instant it was formed , and rose like a vapor-cloud ; immediately the plains and the mountains arose , and the cypress and pine appeared . " The Bible tells us , " And God saw that it was good . " The Quiche legend says , " Then Gucumatz was filled with joy , and cried out , ' Blessed be thy coming , O Heart of Heaven , Hurakan , thunder-bolt . ' " The order in which the vegetables , animals , and man were formed is the same in both records . In Genesis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground . " The Quiche legend says . " The first man was made of clay ; but he had no intelligence , and was consumed in the water . " In Genesis the first man is represented as naked . The Aztec legend says , " The sun was much nearer the earth then than now , and his grateful warmth rendered clothing unnecessary . " Even the temptation of Eve reappears in the American legends . Lord Kingsborough says : " The Toltecs had paintings of a garden , with a single tree standing in the midst ; round the root of the tree is entwined a serpent , whose head appearing above the foliage displays the face of a woman . Torquemada admits the existence of this tradition among them , and agrees with the Indian historians , who affirm that this was the first woman in the world , who bore children , and from whom all mankind are descended . " ( " Mexican Antiquities , " vol. viii. , p. 19 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered roses from a tree , and thereby disgraced and injured herself and all her posterity . ( " Mexican Antiquities , " vol. vi. , p. 401 . ) The legends of the Old World which underlie Genesis , and were used by Milton in the " Paradise Lost , " appear in the Mexican legends of a war of angels in heaven , and the fall of Zou-tem-que ( Soutem , Satan  --  Arabic , Shatana ? ) and the other rebellious spirits . We have seen that the Central Americans possessed striking parallels to the account of the Deluge in Genesis . There is also a clearly established legend which singularly resembles the Bible record of the Tower of Babel . Father Duran , in his MS . " Historia Antiqua de la Nueva Espana , " A.D. 1585 , quotes from the lips of a native of Cholula , over one hundred years old , a version of the legend as to the building of the great pyramid of Cholula . It is as follows : " In the beginning , before the light of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obscurity and darkness , and void of any created thing ; all was a plain , without hill or elevation , encircled in every part by water , without tree or created thing ; and immediately after the light and the sun arose in the east there appeared gigantic men of deformed stature and possessed the land , and desiring to see the nativity of the sun , as well as his occident , proposed to go and seek them . Dividing themselves into two parties , some journeyed to the west and others toward the east ; these travelled ; until the sea cut off their road , whereupon they determined to return to the place from which they started , and arriving at this place ( Cholula ) , not finding the means of reaching the sun , enamored of his light and beauty , they determined to build a tower so high that its summit should reach the sky . Having collected materials for the purpose , they found a very adhesive clay and bitumen , with which they speedily commenced to build the tower ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they say it reached to the sky , the Lord of the Heavens , enraged , said to the inhabitants of the sky , ' Have you observed how they of the earth have built a high and haughty tower to mount hither , being enamored of the light of the sun and his beauty ? Come and confound them , because it is not right that they of the earth , living in the flesh , should mingle with us . ' Immediately the inhabitants of the sky sallied forth like flashes of lightning ; they destroyed the edifice , and divided and scattered its builders to all parts of the earth . " RUINS OF THE TEMPLE OF CHOLULA . One can recognize in this legend the recollection , by a ruder race , of a highly civilized people ; for only a highly civilized people would have attempted such a vast work . Their mental superiority and command of the arts gave them the character of giants who arrived from the East ; who had divided into two great emigrations , one moving eastward ( toward Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were sun-worshippers ; for we are told " they were enamored of the light and beauty of the sun , " and they built a high place for his worship . The pyramid of Cholula is one of the greatest constructions ever erected by human hands . It is even now , in its ruined condition , 160 feet high , 1400 feet square at the base , and covers forty-five acres ; we have only to remember that the greatest pyramid of Egypt , Cheops , covers but twelve or thirteen acres , to form some conception of the magnitude of this American structure . It must not be forgotten that this legend was taken down by a Catholic priest , shortly after the conquest of Mexico , from the lips of an old Indian who was born before Columbus sailed from Spain . Observe the resemblances between this legend and the Bible account of the building of the Tower of Babel : " All was a plain without hill or elevation , " says the Indian legend . " They found a plain in the land of Shinar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They built of brick in both cases . " Let us build us a tower whose top may reach unto heaven , " says the Bible . " They determined to build a tower so high that its summit should reach the sky , " says the Indian legend . " And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men had builded . And the Lord said , Behold . . . nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do . Go to , let us go down and confound them , " says the Bible record . " The Lord of the Heavens , enraged , said to the inhabitants of the sky , ' Have you observed , ' etc . Come and confound them , " says the Indian record . " And the Lord scattered them abroad from thence on all the face of the earth , " says the Bible . " They scattered its builders to all parts of the earth , " says the Mexican legend . Can any one doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one another , or from some common source ? There are enough points of difference to show that the American is not a servile copy of the Hebrew legend . In the former the story comes from a native of Cholula : it is told under the shadow of the mighty pyramid it commemorates ; it is a local legend which he repeats . The men who built it , according to his account , were foreigners . They built it to reach the sun  --  that is to say , as a sun-temple ; while in the Bible record Babel was built to perpetuate the glory of its architects . In the Indian legend the gods stop the work by a great storm , in the Bible account by confounding the speech of the people . Both legends were probably derived from Atlantis , and referred to some gigantic structure of great height built by that people ; and when the story emigrated to the east and west , it was in the one case affixed to the tower of the Chaldeans , and in the other to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Deluge resting upon separate mountain-chains all the way from Greece to Armenia . In one form of the Tower of Babel legend , that of the Toltecs , we are told that the pyramid of Cholula was erected " as a means of escape from a second flood , should another occur . " But the resemblances between Genesis and the American legends do not stop here . We are told ( Gen. ii. , 21 ) that " the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , " and while he slept God made Eve out of one of his ribs . According to the Quiche tradition , there were four men from whom the races of the world descended ( probably a recollection of the red , black , yellow , and white races ) ; and these men were without wives , and the Creator made wives for them " while they slept . " Some wicked misanthrope referred to these traditions when he said , " And man 's first sleep became his last repose . " In Genesis ( chap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live forever : " therefore God drove him out of the garden . In the Quiche legends we are told , " The gods feared that they had made men too perfect , and they breathed a cloud of mist over their vision . " When the ancestors of the Quiches migrated to America the Divinity parted the sea for their passage , as the Red Sea was parted for the Israelites . The story of Samson is paralleled in the history of a hero named Zipanca , told of in the " Popol Vuh , " who , being captured by his enemies and placed in a pit , pulled down the building in which his captors had assembled , and killed four hundred of them . " There were giants in those days , " says the Bible . A great deal of the Central American history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giants called Quinames . This parallelism runs through a hundred particulars : Both the Jews and Mexicans worshipped toward the east . Both called the south " the right hand of the world . " Both burnt incense toward the four corners of the earth . Confession of sin and sacrifice of atonement were common to both peoples . Both were punctilious about washings and ablutions . Both believed in devils , and both were afflicted with leprosy . Both considered women who died in childbirth as worthy of honor as soldiers who fell in battle . Both punished adultery with stoning to death . As David leaped and danced before the ark of the Lord , so did the Mexican monarchs before their idols . Both had an ark , the abiding-place of an invisible god . Both had a species of serpent-worship . GREAT SERPENT MOUND , OHIO . Compare our representation of the great serpent-mound in Adams County , Ohio , with the following description of a great serpent-mound in Scotland : " Serpent-worship in the West .  --  Some additional light appears to have been thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorations of Mr. John S. Phene , F.G.S. , F.R.G.S. , in Scotland . Mr. Phene has just investigated a curious earthen mound in Glen Feechan , Argyleshire , referred to by him , at the late meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh , as being in the form of a serpent or saurian . The mound , says the Scotsman , is a most perfect one . The head is a large cairn , and the body of the earthen reptile 300 feet long ; and in the centre of the head there were evidences , when Mr. Phene first visited it , of an altar having been placed there . The position with regard to Ben Cruachan is most remarkable . The three peaks are seen over the length of the reptile when a person is standing on the head , or cairn . The shape can only be seen so as to be understood when looked down upon from an elevation , as the outline can not be understood unless the whole of it can be seen . This is most perfect when the spectator is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty rock to the west of it . This mound corresponds almost entirely with one 700 feet long in America , an account of which was lately published , after careful survey , by Mr. Squier . The altar toward the head in each case agrees . In the American mound three rivers ( also objects of worship with the ancients ) were evidently identified . The number three was a sacred number in all ancient mythologies . The sinuous winding and articulations of the vertebral spinal arrangement are anatomically perfect in the Argyleshire mound . The gentlemen present with Mr. Phene during his investigation state that beneath the cairn forming the head of the animal was found a megalithic chamber , in which was a quantity of charcoal and burnt earth and charred nutshells , a flint instrument , beautifully and minutely serrated at the edge , and burnt bones . The back or spine of the serpent , which , as already stated , is 300 feet long , was found , beneath the peat moss , to be formed by a careful adjustment of stones , the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and weather . " ( Pall Mall Gazette . ) STONE IMPLEMENTS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA We find a striking likeness between the works of the Stone Age in America and Europe , as shown in the figures here given . The same singular custom which is found among the Jews and the Hindoos , for " a man to raise up seed for his deceased brother by marrying his widow , " was found among the Central American nations . ( Las Casas , MS . " Hist . Apoloq. , " cap . ccxiii. , ccxv . Torquemada , " Monarq . Ind. , " tom . ii. , 377-8 . ) No one but the Jewish high-priest might enter the Holy of Holies . A similar custom obtained in Peru . Both ate the flesh of the sacrifices of atonement ; both poured the blood of the sacrifice on the earth ; they sprinkled it , they marked persons with it , they smeared it upon walls and stones . The Mexican temple , like the Jewish , faced the east . " As among the Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Deity was supposed to be continually present , so among the Mexicans , the Cherokees , and the Indians of Michoacan and Honduras , an ark was held in the highest veneration , and was considered an object too sacred to be touched by any but the priests . " ( Kingsborough , " Mex . Antiq. , " vol. viii. , p.258 . ) The Peruvians believed that the rainbow was a sign that the earth would not be again destroyed by a deluge . ( Ibid. , p. 25 . ) The Jewish custom of laying the sins of the people upon the head of an animal , and turning him out into the wilderness , had its counterpart among the Mexicans , who , to cure a fever , formed a dog of maize paste and left it by the roadside , saying the first passer-by would carry away the illness . ( Dorman , " Prim . Super. , " p. 59 . ) Jacob 's ladder had its duplicate in the vine or tree of the Ojibbeways , which led from the earth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ibid. , p. 67 . ) Both Jews and Mexicans offered water to a stranger that he might wash his feet ; both ate dust in token of humility ; both anointed with oil ; both sacrificed prisoners ; both periodically separated the women , and both agreed in the strong and universal idea of uncleanness connected with that period . Both believed in the occult power of water , and both practised baptism . " Then the Mexican midwife gave the child to taste of the water , putting her moistened fingers in its mouth , and said , ' Take this ; by this thou hast to live on the earth , to grow and to flourish ; through this we get all things that support existence on the earth ; receive it . ' Then with moistened fingers she touched the breast of the child , and said , ' Behold the pure water that washes and cleanses thy heart , that removes all filthiness ; receive it : may the goddess see good to purify And cleanse thine heart . ' Then the midwife poured water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O my grandson  --  my son  --  take this water of the Lord of the world , which is thy life , invigorating and refreshing , washing and cleansing . I pray that this celestial water , blue and light blue , may enter into thy body , and there live ; I pray that it may destroy in thee and put away from thee all the things evil and adverse that were given thee before the beginning of the world . . . . Wheresoever thou art in this child , O thou hurtful thing , begone ! leave it , put thyself apart ; for now does it live anew , and anew is it born ; now again is it purified and cleansed ; now again is it shaped and engendered by our mother , the goddess of water . " ( Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii. , p. 372 . ) Here we find many resemblances to the Christian ordinance of baptism : the pouring of the water on the head , the putting of the fingers in the mouth , the touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing away of the original sin . The Christian rite , we know , was not a Christian invention , but was borrowed from ancient times , from the great storehouse of Asiatic traditions and beliefs . The Mexicans hung up the heads of their sacrificed enemies ; this was also a Jewish custom : " And the Lord said unto Moses , Take all the heads of the people , and hang them up before the Lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel . And Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor . " ( Numb. , xxv. , 4 , 5 . ) The Scythians , Herodotus tells us , scalped their enemies , and carried the scalp at the pommel of their saddles ; the Jews probably scalped their enemies : " But God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses . " ( Psa. , lxviii. , 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harefoot seized his rival , Alfred , with six hundred followers , he " had them maimed , blinded , hamstrung , scalped , or embowelled . " ( Taine 's " Hist . Eng . Lit. , " p. 35 . ) Herodotus describes the Scythian mode of taking the scalp : " He makes a cut round the head near the ears , and shakes the skull out . " This is precisely the Indian custom . " The more scalps a man has , " says Herodotus , " the more highly he is esteemed among them . " The Indian scalp-lock is found on the Egyptian monuments as one of the characteristics of the Japhetic Libyans , who shaved all the head except one lock in the middle . The Mantchoos of Tartary wear a scalp-lock , as do the modern Chinese . Byron describes the heads of the dead Tartars under the walls of Corinth , devoured by the wild dogs : " Crimson and green were the shawls of their wear , And each scalp had a single long tuft of hair , All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so striking and so numerous that repeated attempts have been made to prove that the inhabitants of America are the descendants of the Jews ; some have claimed that they represented " the lost tribes " of that people . But the Jews were never a maritime or emigrating people ; they formed no colonies ; and it is impossible to believe ( as has been asserted ) that they left their flocks and herds , marched across the whole face of Asia , took ships and sailed across the greatest of the oceans to a continent of the existence of which they had no knowledge . If we seek the origin of these extraordinary coincidences in opinions and habits , we must go far back of the time of the lost tribes . We must seek it in the relationship of the Jews to the family of Noah , and in the identity of the Noachic race destroyed in the Deluge with the people of the drowned Atlantis . Nor need it surprise us to find traditions perpetuated for thousands upon thousands of years , especially among a people having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; little is invented ; nothing perishes ; change comes from without ; and even when one religion is supplanted by another its gods live on as the demons of the new faith , or they pass into the folk-lore and fairy stories of the people . We see Votan , a hero in America , become the god Odin or Woden in Scandinavia ; and when his worship as a god dies out Odin survives ( as Dr. Dasent has proved ) in the Wild Huntsman of the Hartz , and in the Robin Hood ( Oodin ) of popular legend . The Hellequin of France becomes the Harlequin of our pantomimes . William Tell never existed ; he is a myth ; a survival of the sun-god Apollo , Indra , who was worshipped on the altars of Atlantis . " Nothing here but it doth change into something rich and strange . " The rite of circumcision dates back to the first days of Phoenicia , Egypt , and the Cushites . It , too , was probably an Atlantean custom , invented in the Stone Age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age ; the ages of copper , bronze , and iron bare intervened ; and yet to this day the Hebrew rabbi performs the ceremony of circumcision with a stone knife . Frothingham says , speaking of St. Peter 's Cathedral , in Rome : " Into what depths of antiquity the ceremonies carried me back ! To the mysteries of Eleusis ; to the sacrificial rites of Phoenicia . The boys swung the censors as censors had been swung in the adoration of Bacchus . The girdle and cassock of the priests came from Persia ; the veil and tonsure were from Egypt ; the alb and chasuble were prescribed by Numa Pompilius ; the stole was borrowed from the official who used to throw it on the back of the victim that was to be sacrificed ; the white surplice was the same as described by Juvenal and Ovid . " Although it is evident that many thousands of years must have passed since the men who wrote in Sanscrit , in Northwestern India , could have dwelt in Europe , yet to this day they preserve among their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , and even of England and Ireland ; and we find among them a fuller knowledge of the vexed question of the sources of the Nile than was possessed by any nation in the world twenty-five years ago . This perpetuation of forms and beliefs is illustrated in the fact that the formulas used in the Middle Ages in Europe to exorcise evil spirits were Assyrian words , imported probably thousands of years before from the magicians of Chaldea . When the European conjurer cried out to the demon , " Hilka , hilka , besha , besha , " he had no idea that he was repeating the very words of a people who had perished ages before , and that they signified Go away , go away , evil one , evil one . ( Lenormant , " Anc . Hist . East , " vol. i. , p. 448 . ) Our circle of 360 degrees ; the division of a chord of the circle equal to the radius into 60 equal parts , called degrees : the division of these into 60 minutes , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirds ; the division of the day into 24 hours , each hour into 60 minutes , each minute into 60 seconds ; the division of the week into seven days , and the very order of the days  --  all have come down to us from the Chaldeo-Assyrians ; and these things will probably be perpetuated among our posterity " to the last syllable of recorded time . " We need not be surprised , therefore , to find the same legends and beliefs cropping out among the nations of Central America and the people of Israel . Nay , it should teach us to regard the Book of Genesis with increased veneration , as a relic dating from the most ancient days of man 's history on earth ; its roots cross the great ocean ; every line is valuable ; a word , a letter , an accent may throw light upon the gravest problems of the birth of civilization . The vital conviction which , during thousands of years , at all times pressed home upon the Israelites , was that they were a " chosen people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , to perpetuate the great truth that there was but one God  --  an illimitable , omnipotent , paternal spirit , who rewarded the good and punished the wicked  --  in contradistinction from the multifarious , subordinate , animal and bestial demi-gods of the other nations of the earth . This sublime monotheism could only have been the outgrowth of a high civilization , for man 's first religion is necessarily a worship of " stocks and stones , " and history teaches us that the gods decrease in number as man increases in intelligence . It was probably in Atlantis that monotheism was first preached . The proverbs of " Ptah-hotep , " the oldest book of the Egyptians , show that this most ancient colony from Atlantis received the pure faith from the mother-land at the very dawn of history : this book preached the doctrine of one God , " the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the wicked . " ( Reginald S. Poole , Contemporary Rev. , Aug. , 1881 , p. 38 . ) " In the early days the Egyptians worshipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without beginning and without end . To the last the priests preserved this doctrine and taught it privately to a select few . " ( " Amer . Encycl. , " vol. vi. , p. 463 . ) The Jews took up this great truth where the Egyptians dropped it , and over the beads and over the ruins of Egypt , Chaldea , Phoenicia , Greece , Rome , and India this handful of poor shepherds  --  ignorant , debased , and despised  --  have carried down to our own times a conception which could only have originated in the highest possible state of human society . And even skepticism must pause before the miracle of the continued existence of this strange people , wading through the ages , bearing on their shoulders the burden of their great trust , and pressing forward under the force of a perpetual and irresistible impulse . The speech that may be heard to-day in the synagogues of Chicago and Melbourne resounded two thousand years ago in the streets of Rome ; and , at a still earlier period , it could be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in Tyre , in Sidon , in Gades , in Palmyra , in Nineveh . How many nations have perished , how many languages have ceased to exist , how many splendid civilizations have crumbled into ruin , bow many temples and towers and towns have gone down to dust since the sublime frenzy of monotheism first seized this extraordinary people ! All their kindred nomadic tribes are gone ; their land of promise is in the hands of strangers ; but Judaism , with its offspring , Christianity , is taking possession of the habitable world ; and the continuous life of one people  --  one poor , obscure , and wretched people  --  spans the tremendous gulf between " Ptah-hotep " and this nineteenth century . If the Spirit of which the universe is but an expression  --  of whose frame the stars are the infinite molecules  --  can be supposed ever to interfere with the laws of matter and reach down into the doings of men , would it not be to save from the wreck and waste of time the most sublime fruit of the civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only , just God , the father of all life , the imposer of all moral obligations ? CHAPTER VII . THE ORIGIN OF OUR ALPHABET One of the most marvellous inventions for the advancement of mankind is the phonetic alphabet , or a system of signs representing the sounds of human speech . Without it our present civilization could scarcely have been possible . No solution of the origin of our European alphabet has yet been obtained : we can trace it back from nation to nation , and form to form , until we reach the Egyptians , and the archaic forms of the Phoenicians , Hebrews , and Cushites , but beyond this the light fails us . The Egyptians spoke of their hieroglyphic system of writing not as their own invention , but as " the language of the gods . " ( Lenormant and Cheval , " Anc . Hist. of the East , " vol. ii. , p. 208 . ) " The gods " were , doubtless , their highly civilized ancestors  --  the people of Atlantis  --  who , as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean races . " According to the Phoenicians , the art of writing was invented by Taautus , or Taut , ' whom the Egyptians call Thouth , ' and the Egyptians said it was invented by Thouth , or Thoth , otherwise called ' the first Hermes , ' in which we clearly see that both the Phoenicians and Egyptians referred the invention to a period older than their own separate political existence , and to an older nation , from which both peoples received it . " ( Baldwin 's " Prehistoric Nations , " p. 91 . ) The " first Hermes , " here referred to ( afterward called Mercury by the Romans ) , was a son of Zeus and Maia , a daughter of Atlas . This is the same Maia whom the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg identifies with the Maya of Central America . Sir William Drummond , in his " Origines , " said : " There seems to be no way of accounting either for the early use of letters among so many different nations , or for the resemblance which existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than by supposing hieroglyphical writing , if I may be allowed the term , to have been in use among the Tsabaists in the first ages after the Flood , when Tsabaisin ( planet-worship ) was the religion of almost every country that was yet inhabited . " Sir Henry Rawlinson says : " So great is the analogy between the first principles of the Science of writing , as it appears to have been pursued in Chaldea , and as we can actually trace its progress in Egypt , that we can hardly hesitate to assign the original invention to a period before the Hamitic race had broken up and divided . " It is not to be believed that such an extraordinary system of sound-signs could have been the invention of any one man or even of any one age . Like all our other acquisitions , it must have been the slow growth and accretion of ages ; it must have risen step by step from picture-writing through an intermediate condition like that of the Chinese , where each word or thing was represented by a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as the Chinese have never reached a phonetic alphabet , gives us some indication of the greatness of the people among whom it was invented , and the lapse of time before they attained to it . Humboldt says : " According to the views which , since Champollion 's great discovery , have been gradually adopted regarding the earlier condition of the development of alphabetical writing , the Phoenician as well as the Semitic characters are to be regarded as a phonetic alphabet that has originated from pictorial writing ; as one in which the ideal signification of the symbols is wholly disregarded , and the characters are regarded as mere signs for sounds . " ( " Cosmos , " vol. ii. , p. 129 . ) Baldwin says ( " Prehistoric Nations , " p. 93 ) : " The nation that became mistress of the seas , established communication with every shore , and monopolized the commerce of the known world , must have substituted a phonetic alphabet for the hieroglyphics as it gradually grew to this eminence ; while isolated Egypt , less affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hieroglyphic system , and carried it to a marvellous height of perfection . " It must be remembered that some of the letters of our alphabet are inventions of the later nations . In the oldest alphabets there was no c , the g taking its place . The Romans converted the g into c ; and then , finding the necessity for a g Sign , made one by adding a tail-piece to the c ( C , G ) . The Greeks added to the ancient alphabet the upsilon , shaped like our V or Y , the two forms being used at first indifferently : they added the X sign ; they converted the t of the Phoenicians into th , or theta ; z and s into signs for double consonants ; they turned the Phoenician y ( yod ) into i ( iota ) . The Greeks converted the Phoenician alphabet , which was partly consonantal , into one purely phonetic  --  " a perfect instrument for the expression of spoken language . " The w was also added to the Phoenician alphabet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were both indicated by the same sound ; a sign for j was afterward added . We have also , in common with other European languages , added a double U , that is , VV , or W , to represent the w sound . The letters , then , which we owe to the Phoenicians , are A , B , C , D , E , H , I , K , L , M , N , O , P , Q , R , S , T , Z. If we are to trace out resemblances with the alphabet of any other country , it must be with these signs . Is there any other country to which we can turn which possessed a phonetic alphabet in any respect kindred to this Phoenician alphabet ? It can not be the Chinese alphabet , which has more signs than words ; it can not be the cuneiform alphabet of Assyria , with its seven hundred arrow-shaped characters , none of which bear the slightest affinity to the Phoenician letters . It is a surprising fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the alphabet of the Mayas , the ancient people of the peninsula of Yucatan , who claim that their civilization came to them across the sea in ships from the east , that is , from the direction of Atlantis . The Mayas succeeded to the Colhuas , whose era terminated one thousand years before the time of Christ ; from them they received their alphabet . It has come to us through Bishop Landa , one of the early missionary bishops , who confesses to having burnt a great number of Maya books because they contained nothing but the works of the devil . He fortunately , however , preserved for posterity the alphabet of this people . We present it herewith . ### LANDA 'S ALPHABET ( From " North Amer. of Antiquity , " p. 434 . ) Diego de Landa was the first bishop of Yucatan . He wrote a history of the Mayas and their country , which was preserved in manuscript at Madrid in the library of the Royal Academy of History . . . . It contains a description and explanation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have lain neglected in the library , for little or nothing was heard of it until it was discovered by the French priest Brasseur de Bourbourg , who , by means of it , has deciphered some of the old American writings . He says , ' the alphabet and signs explained by Landa have been to me a Rosetta stone . ' " ( Baldwin 's " Ancient America , " p. 191 . ) When we observe , in the table of alphabets of different European nations which I give herewith , how greatly the forms of the Phoenician letters have been modified , it would surprise us to find any resemblance between the Maya alphabet of two or three centuries since and the ancient European forms . It must , however , be remembered that the Mayas are one of the most conservative peoples in the world . They still adhere with striking pertinacity to the language they spoke when Columbus landed on San Salvador ; and it is believed that that language is the same as the one inscribed on the most ancient monuments of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians have preserved this idiom with such tenacity that they will speak no other ; it is necessary for the whites to address them in their own language to communicate with them . " It is therefore probable , as their alphabet did not pass from nation to nation , as did the Phoenician , that it has not departed so widely from the original forms received from the Colhuas. ### The Alphabet But when we consider the vast extent of time which has elapsed , and the fact that we are probably without the intermediate stages of the alphabet which preceded the archaic Phoenician , it will be astonishing if we find resemblances between any of the Maya letters and the European forms , even though we concede that they are related . If we find decided affinities between two or three letters , we may reasonably presume that similar coincidences existed as to many others which have disappeared under the attrition of centuries . The first thought that occurs to us on examining the Landa alphabet is the complex and ornate character of the letters . Instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sound , we have here rude pictures of objects . And we find that these are themselves simplifications of older forms of a still more complex character . Take , for instance , the letter pp in Landa 's alphabet , ### : here are evidently the traces of a face . The same appear , but not so plainly , in the sign for x , which is ### . Now , if we turn to the ancient hieroglyphics upon the monuments of Central America , we will find the human face appearing in a great many of them , as in the following , which we copy from the Tablet of the Cross at Palenque . We take the hieroglyphs from the left-hand side of the inscription . Here it will be seen that , out of seven hieroglyphical figures , six contain human faces . And we find that in the whole inscription of the Tablet of the Cross there are 33 figures out of 108 that are made up in part of the human countenance . ### We can see , therefore , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we would naturally expect . When the emblems  --  which were probably first intended for religious inscriptions , where they could be slowly and carefully elaborated  --  were placed in the hands of a busy , active , commercial people , such as were the Atlanteans , and afterward the Phoenicians , men with whom time was valuable , the natural tendency would be to simplify and condense them ; and when the original meaning of the picture was lost , they would naturally slur it , as we find in the letters pp and x of the Maya alphabet , where the figure of the human face remains only in rude lines . The same tendency is plainly shown in the two forms of the letter h , as given in Landa 's alphabet ; the original form is more elaborate than the variation of it . The original form is ### The variation is given as ### . Now let us suppose this simplification to be carried a step farther : we have seen the upper and lower parts of the first form shrink into a smaller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency does away with them altogether ; we would then have the letter H of the Maya alphabet represented by this figure , ### ; now , as it takes less time to make a single stroke than a double one , this would become in time ### . We turn now to the archaic Greek and the old Hebrew , and we find the letter h indicated by this sign , ### , precisely the Maya letter h simplified . We turn to the archaic Hebrew , and we find ### . Now it is known that the Phoenicians wrote from right to left , and just as we in writing from left to right slope our letters to the right , so did the Phoenicians slope their letters to the left . Hence the Maya sign becomes in the archaic Phoenician this , ### . In some of the Phoenician alphabets we even find the letter h made with the double strokes above and below , as in the Maya h . The Egyptian hieroglyph for h is ### while ch is ### . In time the Greeks carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top lines , as we have supposed the Atlanteans to have eliminated the double strokes , and they left the letter as it has come down to us , H. Now it may be said that all this is coincidence . If it is , it is certainly remarkable . But let us go a step farther : We have seen in Landa 's alphabet that there are two forms of the letter m . The first is ### . But we find also an m combined with the letter o , a , or e , says Landa , in this form , ### . The m here is certainly indicated by the central part of this combination , the figure ### ; where does that come from ? It is clearly taken from the heart of the original figure wherein it appears . What does this prove ? That the Atlanteans , or Mayas , when they sought to simplify their letters and combine them with others , took from the centre of the ornate hieroglyphical figure some characteristic mark with which they represented the whole figure . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table of alphabets that in every language , from our own day to the time of the Phoenicians , o has been represented by a circle or a circle within a circle . Now where did the Phoenicians get it ? Clearly from the Mayas . There are two figures for o in the Maya alphabet ; they are ### and ### ; now , if we apply the rule which we have seen to exist in the case of the Maya m to these figures , the essential characteristic found in each is the circle , in the first case pendant from the hieroglyph ; in the other , in the centre of the lower part of it . And that this circle was withdrawn from the hieroglyph , and used alone , as in the case of the m , is proved by the very sign used at the foot of Landa 's alphabet , which is , ### Landa calls this ma , me , or mo ; it is probably the latter , and in it we have the circle detached from the hieroglyph . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a dot within a circle , repeated in the Phoenician forms for o , thus , ### and ### , and by exactly the same forms in the Egyptian hieroglyphics ; in the Runic we have the circle in the circle ; in one form of the Greek o the dot was placed along-side of the circle instead of below it , as in the Maya . Are these another set of coincidences ? Take another letter : The letter n of the Maya alphabet is represented by this sign , itself probably a simplification of some more ornate form , ### . This is something like our letter S , but quite unlike our N. But let us examine into the pedigree of our n . We find in the archaic Ethiopian , a language as old as the Egyptian , and which represents the Cushite branch of the Atlantean stock , the sign for n ( na ) is ### ; in archaic Phoenician it comes still closer to the S shape , thus , ### , or in this form , ### ; we have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maya n ; in Troy this form was found , ### . The Samaritan makes it ### ; the old Hebrew ### ; the Moab stone inscription gives it ### ; the later Phoenicians simplified the archaic form still further , until it became ### ; then it passed into ### : the archaic Greek form is ### ; the later Greeks made ### , from which it passed into the present form , N. All these forms seem to be representations of a serpent ; we turn to the valley of the Nile , and we find that the Egyptian hieroglyphic for n was the serpent , ### ; the Pelasgian n was ### ; the Arcadian , ### ; the Etruscan , ### . Can anything be more significant than to find the serpent the sign for n in Central America , and in all these Old World languages ? Now turn to the letter k . The Maya sign for k is ### . This does not look much like our letter K ; but let us examine it . Following the precedent established for us by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us see what is the distinguishing feature here ; it is clearly the figure of a serpent standing erect , with its tail doubled around its middle , forming a circle . It has already been remarked by Savolini that this erect serpent is very much like the Egyptian Uraeus , an erect serpent with an enlarged body  --  a sacred emblem found in the hair of their deities . We turn again to the valley of the Nile , and we find that the Egyptian hieroglyphic for k was a serpent with a convolution or protuberance in the middle , precisely as in the Maya , thus , ### ; this was transformed into the Egyptian letter ### ; the serpent and the protuberance reappear in one of the Phoenician forms of k , to wit , ### ; while in the Punic we have these forms , ### and ### . Now suppose a busy people trying to give this sign : instead of drawing the serpent in all its details they would abbreviate it into something like this , ### ; now we turn to the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ### , or the Himyaritic Arabian ### ; while in the Phoenician it becomes ### ; in the archaic Greek , ### ; and in the later Greek , when they changed the writing from left to right , ### . So that the two lines projecting from the upright stroke of our English K are a reminiscence of the convolution of the serpent in the Maya original and the Egyptian copy . Turn now to the Maya sign for t : it is ### , . What is the distinctive mark about this figure ? It is the cross composed of two curved lines , thus , ### . It is probable that in the Maya sign the cross is united at the bottom , like a figure 8 . Here again we turn to the valley of the Nile , and we find that the Egyptian hieroglyph for t is ### and ### ; and in the Syriac t it is ### . We even find the curved lines of the Maya t which give it something of the appearance of the numeral 8 , repeated accurately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maya form almost exactly as ### and ### . Now suppose a busy people compelled to make this mark every day for a thousand years , and generally in a hurry , and the cross would soon be made without curving the lines ; it would become X. But before it reached even that simplified form it had crossed the Atlantic , and appeared in the archaic Ethiopian sign for tsa , thus , ### . In the archaic Phoenician the sign for ### is ### and ### ; the oldest Greek form is ### or ### and the later Greeks gave it to the Romans ### , and modified this into ### ; the old Hebrew gave it as ### and ### ; the Moab stone as ### ; this became in time ### and ### . Take the letter a . In the Maya there are three forms given for this letter . The first is ### ; the third is ### . The first looks very much like the foot of a lion or tiger ; the third is plainly a foot or boot . If one were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , would he not represent it thus , ### ; and can we not conceive that this could have been in time modified into the Phoenician a , which was ### ? The hieratic Egyptian a was ### ; the ancient Hebrew , which was ### or ### ; the ancient Greek was the foot reversed , ### ; the later Greek became our A. Turn next to the Maya sign for q ( ku ) : it is ### . Now what is the peculiarity of this hieroglyph ? The circle below is not significant , for there are many circular figures in the Maya alphabet . Clearly , if one was called upon to simplify this , he would retain the two small circles joined side by side at the top , and would indicate the lower circle with a line or dash . And when we turn to the Egyptian q we find it in this shape , ### ; we turn to the Ethiopian q ( khua ) , and we find it ### , as qua , ### ; while the Phoenician comes still nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ### ; the Himyaritic Arabian form became ### ; the Greek form was ### , which graduated into the Roman Q. But a still more striking proof of the descent of the Phoenician alphabet from the Maya is found in the other form of the q , the Maya cu , which is ### . Now , if we apply the Maya rule to this , and discard the outside circle , we have this left , ### . In time the curved line would be made straight , and the figure would assume this form , ### ; the next step would be to make the cross on the straight line , thus , ### . One of the ancient Phoenician forms is ### . Can all this be accident ? The letter c or g ( for the two probably gave the same sound as in the Phoenician ) is given in the Maya alphabet as follows , ### . This would in time be simplified into a figure representing the two sides of a triangle with the apex upward , thus , ### . This is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy , ### . What is the Phoenician form for g as found on the Moab stone ? It is ### . The Carthaginian Phoenicians gave it more of a rounded form , thus , ### . The hieratic Egyptian figure for g was ### ; in the earlier Greek form the left limb of the figure was shortened , thus , ### ; the later Greeks reversed it , and wrote it ### ; the Romans , changed this into ### and it finally became C. In the Maya we have one sign for p , and another for pp . The first contains a curious figure , precisely like our r laid on its back ### . There is , apparently , no r in the Maya alphabet ; and the Roman r grew out of the later Phoenician r formed thus , ### ; it would appear that the earliest Phoenician alphabet did not contain the letter r . But if we now turn to the Phoenician alphabet , we will find one of the curious forms of the p given thus , ### , a very fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not another remarkable coincidence that the p , in both Maya and Phoenician , should contain this singular sign ? The form of pp in the Maya alphabet is this , ### . If we are asked , on the principle already indicated , to reduce this to its elements , we would use a figure like this , ### ; in time the tendency would be to shorten one of these perpendicular lines , thus , and this we find is very much like the Phoenician p , ### . The Greek ph is ### . The letter l in the Maya is in two forms ; one of these is ### , the other is ### . Now , if we again apply the rule which we observed to hold good with the letter m  --  that is , draw from the inside of the hieroglyph some symbol that will briefly indicate the whole letter  --  we will have one of two forms , either a right-angled figure formed thus , ### , or an acute angle formed by joining the two lines which are unconnected , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite close to the letter l of the Old World . We find l on the Moab stone thus formed , ### . The archaic Phoenician form of l was ### , or ### ; the archaic Hebrew was ### and ### ; the hieratic Egyptian was ### ; the Greek form was ###  --  the Roman L. The Maya letter b is shaped thus , ### . Now , if we turn to the Phoenician , we find that b is represented by the same crescent-like figure which we find in the middle of this hieroglyph , but reversed in the direction of the writing , thus , ### ; while in the archaic Hebrew we have the same crescent figure as in the Maya , turned in the same direction , but accompanied by a line drawn downward , and to the left , thus , ### ; a similar form is also found in the Phoenician ### , and this in the earliest Greek changed into ### , and in the later Greek into B. One of the Etruscan signs for b was ### , while the Pelasgian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ### ; the Syriac sign for b was ### ; the Illyrian b was ### . The Maya e is ### ; this became in time ### ; then ### ( we see this form on the Maya monuments ) ; the dots in time were indicated by strokes , and we reach the hieratic Egyptian form , ### : we even find in some of the ancient Phoenician inscriptions the original Maya circles preserved in making the letter e , thus , ### ; then we find the old Greek form , ### ; the old Hebrew , ### ; and the later Phoenician , ### : when the direction of the writing was changed this became ### . Dr. Schliemann found a form like this on inscriptions deep in the ruins of Troy , ### . This is exactly the form found on the American monuments . The Maya i is ### ; this became in time ### ; this developed into a still simpler form , ### ; and this passed into the Phoenician form , ### . The Samaritan i was formed thus , ### ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these the left-hand line was dropped , and we come to the figure used on the stone of Moab , ### and ### ; this in time became the old Hebrew ### , or ### ; and this developed into the Greek ### . We have seen the complicated symbol for m reduced by the Mayas themselves into this figure , ### : if we attempt to write this rapidly , we find it very difficult to always keep the base lines horizontal ; naturally we form something like this , ### : the distinctive figure within the sign for m in the Maya is ### or ### . We see this repeated in the Egyptian hieroglyphics for m , ### , and ### , and ### ; and in the Chaldaic m , ### ; and in the Ethiopic ### . We find one form of the Phoenician where the m is made thus , ### ; and in the Punic it appears thus , ### ; and this is not unlike the m on the stone of Moab , ### , or the ancient Phoenician forms ### , ### @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew ### , ### . The ### , x , of the Maya alphabet is a hand pointing downward ### , this , reduced to its elements , would be expressed some thing like this , ### or ### ; and this is very much like the x of the archaic Phoenician , ### ; or the Moab stone , ### ; or the later Phoenician ### or the Hebrew ### , ### , or the old Greek , ### : the later Greek form was ### . The Maya alphabet contains no sign for the letter s ; there is , however , a symbol called ca immediately above the letter k ; it is probable that the sign ca stands for the soft sound of c , as , in our words citron , circle , civil , circus , etc . As it is written in the Maya alphabet ca , and not k , it evidently represents a different sound . The sign ca is this , ### . A somewhat similar sign is found in the body of the symbol for k , thus , ### @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but turned downward . If now we turn to the Egyptian letters we find the sign k represented by this figure ### , simplified again into ### ; while the sign for k in the Phoenician inscription on the stone of Moab is ### . If now we turn to the s sound , indicated by the Maya sign ca , ### , we find the resemblance still more striking to kindred European letters . The Phoenician s is ### ; in the Greek this becomes ### ### ; the Hebrew is ### ### ; the Samaritan , ### . The Egyptian hieroglyph for s is ### ; the Egyptian letter s is ### ; the Ethiopic , ### ; the Chaldaic , ### ; and the Illyrian s c is ### . We have thus traced back the forms of eighteen of the ancient letters to the Maya alphabet . In some cases the pedigree , is so plain as to be indisputable . For instance , take the h : Maya , ### ; old Greek , ### ; old Hebrew , ### ; Phoenician , ### . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Greek , ### ; old Hebrew , ### ; Phoenician , ### . Or take the letter t : Maya , ### ; old Greek , ### ; old Phoenician , ### and ### . Or take the letter q : Maya , ### ; old Phoenician , ### and ### ; Greek , ### . Or take the letter k : Maya , ### ; Egyptian , ### ; Ethiopian , ### ; Phoenician , ### . Or take the letter n : Maya , ### ; Egyptian , ### ; Pelasgian ### , Arcadian , ### ; Phoenician , ### . Surely all this can not be accident ! But we find another singular proof of the truth of this theory : It will be seen that the Maya alphabet lacks the letter d and the letter r . The Mexican alphabet possessed a d . The sounds d and t were probably indicated in the Maya tongue by the same sign , called t in the Landa alphabet . The Finns and Lapps do not distinguish between these two sounds . In the oldest known form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find in the same way but one sign to express the d and t . D does not occur on the Etruscan monuments , t being used in its place . It would , therefore , appear that after the Maya alphabet passed to the Phoenicians they added two new signs for the letters d and r ; and it is a singular fact that their poverty of invention seems to have been such that they used to express both d and r , the same sign , with very little modification , which they had already obtained from the Maya alphabet as the symbol for b . To illustrate this we place the signs side by side : ### It thus appears that the very signs d and r , in the Phoenician , early Greek , and ancient Hebrew , which are lacking in the Maya , were supplied by imitating the Maya sign for b ; and it is a curious fact that while the Phoenician legends claim that Taaut invented the art of writing , yet they tell us that Taaut made records , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom one was Isiris ( Osiris , the Egyptian god ) , the inventor of the three letters . " Did these three letters include the d and r , which they did not receive from the Atlantean alphabet , as represented to us by the Maya alphabet ? In the alphabetical table which we herewith append we have represented the sign V , or vau , or f , by the Maya sign for U. " In the present so-called Hebrew , as in the Syriac , Sabaeic , Palmyrenic , and some other kindred writings , the vau takes the place of F , and indicates the sounds of v and u . F occurs in the same place also on the Idalian tablet of Cyprus , in Lycian , also in Tuarik ( Berber ) , and some other writings . " ( " American Cyclopaedia , " art . F. ) Since writing the above , I find in the " Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society " for December , 1880 , p. 154 , an interesting article pointing out other resemblances between the Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing to notice that while Landa 's first B is , according to Valentini , represented by a footprint , and that path and footprint are pronounced Be in the Maya dictionary , the Egyptian sign for B was the human leg . " Still more surprising is it that the H of Landa 's alphabet is a tie of cord , while the Egyptian H is a twisted cord . . . . But the most striking coincidence of all occurs in the coiled or curled line representing Landa 's U ; for it is absolutely identical with the Egyptian curled U. The Mayan word for to wind or bend is Uuc ; but why should Egyptians , confined as they were to the valley of the Nile , and abhorring as they did the sea and sailors , write their U precisely like Landa 's alphabet U in Central America ? There is one other remarkable coincidence between Landa 's and the Egyptian alphabets ; and , by-the-way , the English and other Teutonic dialects have a curious share in it . Landa 's D ( T ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed Mexican symbol for a day or sun . So far as sound is concerned , the English day represents it ; so far as the form is concerned , the Egyptian ' cake , ' ideograph for ( 1 ) country and ( 2 ) the sun 's orbit is essentially the same . " It would appear as if both the Phoenicians and Egyptians drew their alphabet from a common source , of which the Maya is a survival , but did not borrow from one another . They followed out different characteristics in the same original hieroglyph , as , for instance , in the letter b . And yet I have shown that the closest resemblances exist between the Maya alphabet and the Egyptian signs  --  in the c , h , t , i , k , m , n , o , q , and s  --  eleven letters in all ; in some cases , as in the n and k , the signs are identical ; the k , in both alphabets , is not only a serpent , but a serpent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to the above the b and u , referred to in the " Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society , " we have thirteen letters out of sixteen in the Maya and Egyptian related to each other . Can any theory of accidental coincidences account for all this ? And it must be remembered that these resemblances are found between the only two phonetic systems of alphabet in the world . Let us suppose that two men agree that each shall construct apart from the other a phonetic alphabet of sixteen letters ; that they shall employ only simple forms  --  combinations of straight or curved lines  --  and that their signs shall not in anywise resemble the letters now in use . They go to work apart ; they have a multitudinous array of forms to draw from the thousand possible combinations of lines , angles , circles , and curves ; when they have finished , they bring their alphabets together for comparison . Under such circumstances it is possible that out of the sixteen signs one sign might appear in both alphabets ; there is one chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is not one chance in five hundred that this sign should in both cases represent the same sound . It is barely possible that two men working thus apart should bit upon two or three identical forms , but altogether impossible that these forms should have the same significance ; and by no stretch of the imagination can it be supposed that in these alphabets so created , without correspondence , thirteen out of sixteen signs should be the same in form and the same in meaning . It is probable that a full study of the Central American monuments may throw stronger light upon the connection between the Maya and the European alphabets , and that further discoveries of inscriptions in Europe may approximate the alphabets of the New and Old World still more closely by supplying intermediate forms . We find in the American hieroglyphs peculiar signs which take the place of pictures , and which probably , like the hieratic symbols mingled with the hieroglyphics of Egypt , represent alphabetical sounds . For instance , we find this sign on the walls of the palace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Phoenician t used in writing , ### and ### ; we find also upon these monuments the letter o represented by a small circle , and entering into many of the hieroglyphs ; we also find the tau sign ( thus ### ) often repeated ; also the sign which we have supposed to represent b , ### ; also this sign , ### , which we think is the simplification of the letter k ; also this sign , which we suppose to represent e , ### ; also this figure , ### ; and this ### . There is an evident tendency to reduce the complex figures to simple signs whenever the writers proceed to form words . Although it has so far been found difficult , if not impossible , to translate the compound words formed from the Maya alphabet , yet we can go far enough to see that they used the system of simpler sounds for the whole hieroglyph to which we have referred . Bishop Landa gives us , in addition to the alphabet , the signs which represent the days and months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , we have this figure as the representative of the month Mol ### . Here we see very plainly the letter ### for m , the sign ### for o ; and we will possibly find the sign for l in the right angle to the right of the m sign , and which is derived from the figure in the second sign for l in the Maya alphabet . One of the most ancient races of Central America is //
