txt A hall has been hired and a meeting called by a number of Democrats of this city for the purpose of denouncing the volley of the refc ; rm Mayor , Mr. William Means . The meeting will be held on Saturday night next , and is called by some of the most prominent Democrats , who are accustomed to mix in local politics . The complaint against Mayor Means is that he is untrue to the party who elected him , and it is proposed formally to announce his disloyalty at a public meeting called for that purpose and to give him hack to the easy-going and wealthy clique from whom he came . The Mayor was elected six weeks ago by a combination of the Democratic Party and a considerable class of Republicans who were anxious to see certain reforms carried out touching liquor-selling and the observance of Sunday . Mr. Means . it was thought by the Democrats , could be easily handled , and half a dozen of the old party leaders flattered themselves that they would be the new Mayor 's confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Mr. Means announced that he wanted no advice from anybody , and though supported by the whole Democratic Party , would give none of its leaders a hearing as to how the patronage should be distributed . A few Democratic policemen secured appointments , but it was entirely through their own efforts . Those who depended upon the leaders of the party for recommendation and assistance had no attention paid to their applications . The same was true of applicants for other offices , and the rank and file of the party , as well as its leaders , have naturally become very Bore . and the step which they have now resolved to take has been talked of for some time . The reform Republicans have been better satisfied with the Mayor 's course , for the reason that there has been some effort at reform , although the results are hardly appreciable . The Mayor is a life-long Democrat , but knows nothing about politics , and being of an obstinate disposition ho got his party by the ears at the very outset . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans . The Democratic victory at the Spring election , unexpectedly to everybody , is proving to be one of the best things for the Republican Party that could have happened .
