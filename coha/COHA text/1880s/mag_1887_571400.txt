ARTICLE 11. - THE BIBLE : SHALL WE TAKE IT AS WE FIND IT , OR AS WE LIKE IT ? AMoNG Christian people this is the burning question of the day . Upon its answer turns the value of the Bible as a rule of faith and practice . If we are to take the Bible as we find it , the discussion is narrowed down to the simple question , what does the Bible teach in the light of the best scholarship ? in other words , what are its contents ? But if we are to take it as we like it , it shifts the whole ground and drift and issue of the discussion . These two views are radically opposed to each other , having little or nothing in common . Is the Bible God 's book in such a sense that it is to be received under the light of a fair interpretation-of course making allowance for all errors in the canon and in translationsor is it God 's book , to be received in whole or in part , with certain reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is a fair question and should be met in a candid and Christian spirit . I do not flatter myself that I shall contribute very much to its solution , and yet every ray of light , however feeble , will help . On the threshold of this question , there are two facts that will be at once admitted by those who accept the Bible , with or without qualifications as a divine book ,  --  one that it is as Dr. ilarris shows in his recent able work , a " Self-Revelation of God " to man , the other that it is God 's revelation of man to man . These are two facts that lie upon every page of the Bible and so clearly that he who runneth may read . They are the two foci of the Book  --  the vital centers , from which all discussions must proceed and to which all discussions must return . God and man are the actors upon the scene , neither giving way to anything else-neither crowding the other out of view-both standing at the front-both lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a marvelous disclosure of the divine character , not indeed complete , like Minerva from the brain of Jove , but // to an extent which man unaided could never have reached . It has grown , and with every fresh stage of growth , it has made a fresh revelation of God . The Bible is also a marvelous disclosure of man to himself , and with a fidelity and thoroughness which man could never have reached with his eyes bandaged by sin . Here is common ground on which all believers in the divine origin of the Bible can stand , however much they may differ in regard to the method and extent of its inspiration  --  the rules of its interpretation , and the relative proportion of the divine and human elements in it . Now it is obvious that such a revelation as this of God to man and of man to himself , must in the nature of the case contain some truth that would surprise man-truth that he could not have anticipated-truth that has the color of mystery about it-truth , on the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not fathom-truth , before which his eye dims and his arm palsies , in a word , truth that can be measnred only by the infinities and eternities of God himself . God can reveal some things to man but not everything . The limitation is not in God 's power to reveal  --  but in man 's power to receive . When the infinite holds converse with the finite , so great is the disparity between them , that there can be no end of surprises . Every fresh revelation will be a fresh surprise , while those things which could not be fully revealed but which we see only in dim outline through hints and gleams , will keep us on the perpetual tiptoe and stretch of desire . Touching the Bible as a revelation from God concerning man , it will of necessity contain also some truth distasteful to man . Let it be carefully noted that the Bible has a distinctively moral aim and purpose . It is the revelation of ethics to an ethical nature , of spiritualities to a spiritual nature , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything made clear in the Bible , it is the immaculate holiness of God . How will such a being as man , fallen , his moral nature wrenched out of harmony with God and with its whole drift in the opposite direction , look upon such holiness ? Certainly not with com* placency . It will not win him . In the nature of the case it will be distasteful to him . His eyes can not look upon it . He // will recoil from it . Its demands are too exacting for him readily to comply with . There is a manifest incongruity between it and the controlling purpose of his life , until perchance that purpose shall be changed through the obedience of faith . We do not say that man 's soul even in its sin , makes no responses to God-it does  --  and they are often strong and with unutterable yearnings - this is a fact of spiritual psychology too well settled to admit of doubt . But we do say that the natural effect of bringing man under the glare of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the repellant force will vary in proportion to the relative dominancy of sin and grace in his heart . Not until man himself is made perfect in holiness , will these repellant forces entirely cease to act . Still again , when the light of the Bible is turned upon man 's own heart , it makes disclosures that are both surprising and distasteful to him . He is surprised to find what a wonderful moral nature he possesses , how divine in its composition , how angelic in its aspirations , how deep in its needs , how comprehensive in its out-reach . Surprise follows surprise , as revelation after revelation breaks upon his view with the lifted veil , and he is lead to exclaim with the Psalmist , " Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty . " " Thou hast made man a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor . " But there are some things about this revelation which displease as well as surprise man . He is taken by a divine guide into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthroned , swaying a cruel scepter over his better nature , over his loyalty to God , and over all that would draw him into eternal friendship with him . And now and then this divine guide whispers in his ear " thou art a sinner , thou art guilty . thou art condemned , thou art responsible . " This is hard truth for a proud soul to hear . It becomes distasteful . It is secretly if not openly denied . Man will not accept the disclosures which the Bible makes concerning himself . He is in controversy with it , and presently he begins to modify it , or to cast about for some other standard of morality by which to try both God and himself . Such for substance is the revelation of the Bible , and such the attitude of man towards it . We are now prepared to meet the question : Is man and such // a man as I have described , competent to sit in judgment upon the Bible , and such a Bible as I have described ? in other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous question , " Shall we take the Bible as we find it , or as we like it ? " To the question , is man competent to decide what the Bible means ? we unhesitatingly reply , yes . His competency reaches quoad hoc , to just this extent . He must himself settle the question as to its meaning and scope . Along with the gift of the Bible , God has not sent an interpreter to tell us that this is his book and to explain it to us , except so far as the Holy Spirit may be considered such an interpreter . Man himself is the interpreter of the Bible . He is the other party in the transaction . But what sort of an interpreter is he , in the nature of the case ? How well fitted is he for such a work ? Will he be likely to give an unbiased judgment in regard to all its utterances ? We have just looked at his attitude towards the Bible , and found it to be one of surprise , and as respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , the very person who finds many things in the Bible beyond his comprehension , and many things positively displeasing to him , is the interpreter of the book . What will be the product of his interpretation . I mean in view of the fact of his finiteness and his sin-beclouded vision ? Certainly it will not be a pure product . It will be variously mixed , as well as only approximately complete . Will not such an interpreter of such a book be under perpetual temptation to speculate concerning truth too high for him , and to torture into favorite forms or to eliminate entirely from the record truth that is distasteful to him ? On the well-known principles of psychology , no other result would be natural or even possible . But if man is clearly incompetent by reason of his finiteness and moral bias to judge what the Bible ought to be , then the question is pertinent , how shall we know that the Bible is the word of God ? If one party in the transaction is laboring under such serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full benefits of the transaction ? We here touch the vital point in this discussion . Is there a limit to man 's competency to know the Bible ? If so , what is it ? // June , Let it be distinctly understood , and as a point that admits of no doubt among thoughtful and candid people , that man is fully competent to determine what the Bible is , but not what it ought to be . His competency touches the question of fact , but not the question of obligation on the part of God , the contents , but not the justice or the wisdom of the contents . To be sure , the revelation so far as it goes must not conflict with the sense of ought or of justice which God himself has implanted within us . At the same time , we have no right ti* demand that the revelation shall fully satisfy or exhaust our sense of ought or of justice . It is readily conceded that man has all the equipment , mental and moral , necessary to decide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact . Beyond this , we claim that he can not go by reason of the limitations of his finiteness and moral bias . The evidence that the Bible is from God , comes mainly from itself . It testifies in its own behalf . This evidence is two-fold , external and internal . The external evidence has to do with the genuineness and authenticity of the writings that go to make up the Bible . Were they the work of the men whose names they bear and are they a record of facts ? This question can only be settled at the bar of human reason . And it has been so well settled in the affirmative that those who have re-open&amp;d it have found , to say the least , a heavy task on their hands . The internal evidence that the Bible is from God , has to do with the character of the writings . Do they give us a correct view of God and a correct view of man ? Do they tell us what God is doing in this world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do they show us man 's relation to this kingdom , as a divinely chosen and commissioned helper in its work ? In other words , have we good reason to expect that such writings as these would come from such a being as God ? Clearly , yes . We find nothing in the Bible that conflicts with our ideas of what God might properly do . Indeed , we are surprised to find that he could do so much and in the direct line of truth and righteousness on which our own minds are working . We readily allow that the presumption is wholly in favor of such a book , and most especially in view of the fact that hitherto the ingenuity of man has shown // 1887. find it , or as we hid it ? itself quite unequal to the production of a different book that bears any comparison with this . The internal evidence appeals both to the reason and the moral sense . This brings ns face to face with the function of Christian consciousness concerning which so much is said in these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penetrate the secrets of Jehovah , has been greatly enlarged . What is this faculty called consciousness ? What is its legitimate sphere ? What can it do and what can it not do ? The Germans attach to it a much broader meaning than has been customary among us . Indeed the enlargement of its function began in Germany and with many other German notions has found a foothold in America . They call it " the light of all our seeing , " and I think that Dr. Harris , in his " Self-revelation of God , " takes it in this sense . If this means anything it must mean that consciousness covers the whole field of man 's intellectual , moral , and spiritual nature-all knowledge , intuitional and experimental , natural and snpernatural-of the ego and of the non-ego . If it is the light of all our seeing , then we have but one eye with which to see ourselves , God , and his universe . But it is commonly held that man has at least three eyes , whose ranges of visioft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do yet cover three distinct fields of observation , namely , the intellectual , the moral , and the spiritual . The intellectual eye sees the reason of things  --  the moral eye sees the right and wrong of things , and the spiritual eye sees God in everything . This gives a complete man with a trinity of powers to meet all the conceivable necessities of his being . But when we merge these three faculties into one and cover the whole with the word consciousness , we introduce confusion and blend things that should be kept apart . Is not this giving too much breadth to the function of consciousness ? Is it not a new departure in psychology which careful men will be slow to accept until established by incontrovertible facts ? A correct theology must be rooted in a correct philosophy . The commonly received view of the human mind , which gives it a triple function , represented by the Greek words v6o* , * and 2r*eu*ua has been exceedingly helpful to a correct understanding // of the Bible . It has given us a theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if this new view of consciousness shall become the accepted philosophy of the human mind , it will necessitate a new theology from foundation to summit . But what is consciousness ? Let us be simple in our definitions when simplicity is in order . It is self-knowledge-this and nothing else  --  the mind taking cognizance of its own operations , the thought turned inward upon itself , the knowledge of what passes in the mind and not outside of it . Consciousness never oversteps the horizon of the thinker , I myself . It has to do with the ego , but not with the non-ego . For example , I am conscious that I exist and think and feel ; more , I am conscious of the contents of my existence and of my thinking and of my feeling ; but I am not conscious that I see a man or a tree . These are external facts , the knowledge of which comes to me through the faculties of sense and observation . Why then enlarge consciousness to take in these external facts , since the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What now is Christian consciousness ? We answer , consciousness enlightened and guided by the Spirit of God . It is not easy to see that it properly means anything else . But those who have pushed this phrase into such prominence in these days attach to it a much larger meaning than this . With them , it is the one infallible and ultimate standard by which to judge God and his revelation to man . Professor Henry M. Goodwin , a writer in the New Englander May , 1885 , page 370 , says : " The Christian consciousness includes not only the moral sense and its intuitions , but reason , the intellectual organ and test of truth , and faith or spiritual perception , and all these enlightened , informed , quickened , and inspired by the Word and Spirit of God , by all the progressive light and knowledge which Christianity has poured into the world and wrought into human experience since the New Testament was written . To say that this is not an authority in the things of faith , or of Christian truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of duty , is to affirm that the light of // nature is superior to that of Christian revelation , that the law of morality is a more certain guide than the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus . The ultimate standard or criterion of truth must be internal and not external . " In regard to the relation of the Christian consciousness to the Holy Scriptures , this same writer says , ( page 372 ) : " Their divine authority is not independent of the Christian consciousness , but one with it . " This is the view advocated by Dr. Newman Smyth and by the Andover professors . No doubt there are some grains of truth in these views , butt I submit it as a fair question , is there as much truth in them as their representatives would have us believe ? is the Christian consciousness as broad as this ? is it able to do all this ? If so , will it not lead to consequences which must sooner or later undermine the Bible as an authoritative revelation from God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human standard , and one therefore imperfect and in perpetual oscillation ? We admit that the Christian consciousness is the inshining of God 's light into the soul , and in this respect it is differentiated from the unchristian consciousness . He who has it , sees God in nature and in revelation when other men can not see him , and sees more of him too . This is clear . This we allow . But this is a very different thing from saying that consciousness is competent to determine what the revelation ought to be and to supply supposed defects by reading between the lines . That we may see how the Christian consciousness and the Bible stand related to each other , let us bring them face to face . The Bible is the thing to be known , that is , the contents of it . It is the thought of God for man . It is the mind of the Spirit . That man may know it to be such , it must be imparted to him , he must have the faculty to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We answer , yes ; for the specific purpose of knowing the mind of the Spirit within certain limitations . What are those limitations ? We reply , the written word itself . And here let me not be misunderstood . The Christian consciousness has a two-fold function , namely , to di8cern the mind of the Spirit in the Bible and also out of the Bible , for God is both in and out of the Bible . There can be no doubt that God does sometimes reveal himself to his people // June , directly and in large measure , not so much for the general purposes of his kingdom in the world , as for their individual work and comfort and growth in holiness . Such revelations are made directly by the Spirit to the consciousness , and the consciousness recognizes and appropriates them to the personal uses of the soul . Such revelations were made to Abraham , to Jacob , to Paul , and no doubt have been made to multitudes in all ages . They are individual and special . While the revelations contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , namely , the enlargement and triumph of the Redeemer 's Kingdom on earth . This distinction is largely lost sight of in the recent discussions of this question . And here is where the confnsion comes in . The Christian consciousness is made the one standard by which to judge the Bible , and with remorseless logic even to the utter exhaustion of itself , it is held to the discharge of this duty , subordinating to its uses , intuition , reason , judgment , and faith . I submit that the demaad is too great , the burden too heavy for its strength . But what has the Christian consciousness to do with the Bible ? Much every way . As we have already said , the integrity and contents of the Bible are to be determined a we determine those of any other book , in the light of sufficient evidence at the bar of human judgment . Consciousness can not answer the question , is the Bible a genuine book ? any more than it can answer the question , is Bancroft 's History of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of external fact . It belongs neither to the content nor to the purview of consciousness . It is to be answered as we answer other historical questions . But the Christian consciousness has everything to do with the character of the Bible  --  the quality of its contents . Here is its jurisdiction and here alone . It is able to say authoritatively , that the Bible is a different book from the writings of Shakespeare , or Socrates , or Confucius even , that it contains a code of morals which in purity and elevation surpasses anything ever known ; more , that there is that in its teachings to which the human soul in its loftiest moods quickly and gladly responds , still more , that its teachings bear the marks of a divine genesis and of a human aim and purpose . // This , if I mistake not , is the tangent point , and the only tangent point between consciousness and the Bible . This is the nexus or bond that unites them in indissoluble union . And why ? Because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . It is simply an illustration of the law of correspondencies in the kingdom of grace , of which so much is made by the writers on Swedenborgianism . The Christian consciousness is a spiritual faculty set for the discovery of that which is spiritual in the Bible . This explains what the apostle means when he says , " the natural man can not know the things of the Spirit of God , because they are spiritually discerned . " This view of consciousness does by no means give the right to read between the lines or into the lines anything that is not found there in the light of the generally accepted principles of Biblical interpretation . This , it seems to me , is the mistake of the advocates of the new view . They load the Bible with enlarged , irrelevant , non-sequitur meanings , and thus require it to do duty which the inspiring Spirit never intended it to do ; and then they enlarge the function of consciousness to cover the needs of this new interpretation . And how do they propose to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness into a tribunal of judgment , instead of making it simply God 's witness in the soul , testifying for his truth . It can not be safely made such a court of final appeal . To allow it is to make man the judge of God . Lest I be misunderstood , let us look at the subject from still another point of view . The bottom truth of Christian consciousness is God . We see and feel Him in nature , in the Bible and in our own souls . We apprehend His presence everywhere . The power to apprehend Him is a fact in spiritual psychology . But we can not go behind this fact and say how He shall reveal himself and in what degree He shall reveal himself . The method and the measure are among the secret things that belong alone to Him . The Bible is God 's method of special revelation . Its contents are the measure of that special revelation . It is a revelation from God , of God and man , and to man . We readily accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need and nothing else does . How do we know that it fits our need ? The Christian consciousness says so and this // declaration is an ultimate fact in psychology . But this does not make consciousness the judge of the Bible , it rather makes it the receptacle of its spiritual truth . The Bible is self-evidencing . God in the Bible is the judge of the Bible . Thus it is that the Bible furnishes its own standard of judgment . It contemplates no external standard . It is constantly appealing to itself . When Moses lifting the brazen serpent told the bitten Israelites " to look and live , " his words were prophetic of what the Baptist said to his disciples , " Behold the Lamb of God , " and what Christ himself was constantly saying to the people , " Look unto me , " " Come unto me . " He tells Thomas , " because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed . " And on another occasion he says , " If ye had known me , you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself as the all-sufficient proof of the truth of what it says . Now the Christian consciousness apprehends and accepts this fact on the ground of the divine harmonies that sweep alike through the contents of the one and the needs of the other . When the Bible says , " Child , thy Father speaks to thee . " Consciousness replies , " Yes , Father , I hear thy voice , and will obey . " It is the soul 's response to the Father 's call . Hence consciousness is that faculty which discerns the soul 's need and the divine adaptation of the Bible to meet that need . Beyond this it can not go , nor is there any occasion for it to go . Here we have the all-sufficient and unanswerable proof that the Bible is from God . The proof is internal and spirituaL It is not the result of a process of reasoning , that moves on by the slow and measured steps of logic . It is intuitional and immediate , satisfactory , and final . But when we erect the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial , it implies that the question is still open for consideration and that crosstestimony is admissible . This conflicts with the very idea of the Christian consciousness , which declares , first , middle , and always , that the question is once and forever settled . It leaves no room for doubt . The Spirit speaks the same word in the Bible and in the consciousness , and this is what stamps a Christian character upon both . Moreover , if the Bible must answer the summons of such a tribunal it opens the door to inferences // and enlargements without limit , with the right to add to or substract from the record , as any one may list . It makes it a court of enquiry on a case already adjudicated by its own deliverances , and so keeps the truth of the Bible a perpetually open question . The weakness of this view is still further seen when we consider , that it makes consciousness witness , jury , and judge in its own case . What shall be the result of that trial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is the accused party . The Bible is the accuser . Can there be any doubt about the verdict ? It would seem to be more in harmony with the well-known principles of human nature to let the accuser try the case . This view is fatal to the jurisdiction of consciousness in an enquiry of this kind . There is another objection equally fatal , namely : the lack of uniformity in the deliverauces of the Christian consciousness . Much is said in these days about the universal Christian consciousness , or better perhaps the consensus of the Christian church . What does this mean ? Is there any such thing ? Yes , concerning a few leading truths of the Christian faith , such as are held to be essential to salvation . Here there has been and is a consensus in the church , but beyond this , there is none . It is confusion of tongues . OFle says lo ! here , and another lo ! there , and whose lo ! shall we follow ? And even though there has been substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been brought to their interpretation has been almost infinitely diversified . The declaration that Christ is a IDivine Saviour , able and willing to save unto the uttermost all that come unto God by him , expresses about all the consensus there is , or ever has been in Christian doctrine . What other result is possible , if we make man to_the e judge and divider on such a question ? Take the case now so prominently before the public . It is claimed that in order to vindicate the justice of God , those who have not heard of the historic Christ in this world , must have another chance in the next . Who claims this ? Not everybody . Not the universal consciousness of the Christian church . But the favored few who would have us believe that they enjoy a higher illumination and hence can see deeper into the ways of God than others . // Where then is the consensus ? The inference plainly is that the Christian consciousness does not give forth any such deliverance , but that its supposed deliverance is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " larger hope . " Clearly such a question must be tried before some other tribunal . Moreover , is it to be presumed that God would submit the wisdom and justice of his moral administration to the adjudication of such a court ? It is incompetent . Its verdict would neither exalt God , nor conseive the interests of the universe . God does not ask us to sit in judgment on his ways . He does not expect it . The highest and I may add the only appropriate deliverance of the Christian consciousness , is a deliverance of faith , of acquiescence , and of childlike trust , and upon that plane there is no occasion for the formal deliverance of the judge . Dr. Gregg , in his creed read before the recent installing council at Park Street Church , Boston , puts the point with telling force , when he says , " God speaks to man in his word . In his creed , man should say to God , I believe the declar*ations of thy word . There should be nothing in his creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe nothing beyond the word , for nothing beyond is necessary to the glory of God in this life , or to the interests of the soul . I believe in the sufficiency and in the efficiency of the word of God . Everything beyond is divisive to the Christian brotherhood and perplexing to the individual . When men go beyond the word of God and speculate that by their speculations they may defend the character of God and demonstrate the consistency of revealed truth with itself , they originate more difficulties than they solve . " There is also much said and well said in these days concerning the Bible as a progressive revelation . No one can for a moment doubt this . The Bible is not only a self-revelation of God as Dr. Harris shows with masterly ability ; but it is a progressive self-revelation . Read concerning the God that Adam and Abel knew , and the God that Peter and Paul knew , or concerning the God that Jacob at Bethel knew , and the God that St. John at Patmos knew , and the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God to the minds of men has been like the dawning light marching on to the perfect day . // This point is not in controversy . The only question is , how far shall this principle of progress in revelation be carried ? Has it any limits ? Tf so , what are they ? We chafe under limitations . The idea of progress is fascinating , and especially so in theology , and that for two reasons : one , because the Bible contains some things from which we desire to escape ; the other , because over the path that opens into the future there broods much of mystery . Put these two facts together and we have a problem with which the human mind likes to wrestle . If it can get rid of the disagreeable things in the Bible and dispel the mystery towards which it looks , it most certainly will . It has never ceased to try , and never will , until all these things are made clear in the clearer light of the hereafter . All the theological controversies that have agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do more or less directly with these two points  --  the things that man 's heart dislikes and the things that his curiosity wants to know . If we apply these tendencies of the human mind to the doctrine of progressive revelation we shall see at once what a charm there is in the idea . What then are the proper limitations of a progressive Biblical revelation ? I answer , the writ . ten record , itself unfolded and illumined under the light which an ever advancing scholarship shall pour upon it . In regard to truth vital and saving , the Bible of Wickliffe and Luther was substantially the same as the Bible of to-day , while in regard to the knowledge of many things local , historical , and practical it was a very different book . As compared with former times , it may be said that doctrine and life have exchanged places . Not that we think less of doctrine , but more of life . Not that we have chipped away any of the solid and enduring parts of the foundation stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . Applied doctrine is both the watchword and the glory of our modern Christianity . We say that the Bible changes not , and then again we say that it is continually changing ; and there is truth in this apparently contradictory statement . What do we mean by it ? It will contribute to clearness to remember that Revelation and Orthodoxy are very different things . Revelation is God 's work ; // Orthodoxy man 's . Revelation , the attempt of God to lodge truth in the minds of men ; Orthodoxy , the measure in which the minds of men receive His truth . Revelation , the method of the Father for reaching the child ; Orthodoxy , the going out of the child to meet the Father . We do not use the word Orthodoxy here in any narrow or offensive sense . Without applying it to any particular persons or parties , we simply mean by it that he who gets the most of God 's revealed truth into his soul and comes the nearest the Father 's heart , is the most orthodox man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most nearly correct . We can now see what is meant by progressive revelation . It is God 's plan of mercy set forth in the Bible and litfle by little unfolded through the long and weary centuries that stretch from the first recorded utterance of Moses to the last Amen of St. John . Here , the revelation was forever closed . He who should add to or take from it , should have his part stricken from the book of life and from the Holy City . We can also see what is meant by progressive Orthodoxy . This , a continually better understanding of the truths of progressive revelation . The revelation has closed , while the orthodoxy is ever moving on , and will , until the last ray of light from the perfected scholarship of the world , under the guiding Spirit , shall have disclosed the last side of God 's many-sided revelation . Then orthodoxy will harmonize with revelation , because both will be perfect . It is often assumed in the discussion of this subject that revelation is progressive beyond and outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferred upon man to extend the revelation . A little work of four chapters by Dr. Newman Smyth , entitled " The Morality of the Old Testament , " has just been published . As is true of all his writings , his thoughts are stated with clearness and ability . We most heartily accept nearly all he says concerning the moral defects of the Mosaic legislation , the *necessity in accordance with the divine plan of lifting the people by slow stages to a higher standard of morality , and the apparent injustice of the exterminating wars against the Canaanites , involving the sacrifice of individuals , families , and tribesbut // we entirely dissent from his conclusions . He finds the solution of these difficulties in the evening up of the scales of divine justice in the future life . He says : " We can admit the rightfulness of temporary sacrifices of the individual for the general good and the justice of momentary disregard of the rights of the individual for the benefit of the whole community . But we could not accept this principle of sacrifice by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sacrifice as an eternal sacrifice . Each individual , whatever may have been his time or generation , his part or place in the great dran1a of history , shall be present to behold the end of the world , and to receive for himself his fair and proper portion in the judgment of the eternal God , with whom there is no respect of persons , and who surely , therefore , at the end of the world shall not deal with the individuals , whom at different times he has permitted to be born into this world-age , upon different and unequal planes of justice and upon diverse principles of judgmentsome by the law of nature , and others by the law of Moses , and others still by the law of the Spirit of Christ  --  but who shall deal with all alike and show himself to all in his eternal judgments to be the same just and merciful Christian God . We can not admit that any irregularities of temporal circumstances , of place or season in this world-history , shall prevent for any individual soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redemption . We may trust divine grace eventually to meet all alike in its utmost Christian revelation and power . " This is enough as a sample of Dr. Smyth 's reasoning . It will be seen that these conclusions are clearly drawn in the interest of the new theology of which Dr. Smyth is a conspicuous leader . They are supposed to be demanded in order to vindicate the divine justice in dealing with men in this world . His conclusions are extra-biblical . They belong to that vicious style of reasoning so much in vogue in these days , which assumes to be wise above what is written . His method of reasoning may be stated thus . The destruction of nations in this world for any cause is wrong . The Canaanites were destroyed . Therefore the Canaanites were wronged . But God is a being of justice . He will not allow any wrong to go unvindicated . Therefore the wrong inflicted upon the // June , Canaanites in this world , will be corrected in the next by giving them another chance for repentance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lilt assumes what can not be proved , namely , that the d*struction of individuals and of nations in this world is wrong . Is this necessarily so ? Suppose we allow that God deals unjustly with individuals , with families , and with nations here in this world , and that , in order to vindicate himself , he must tip the scales to an exact balance in the next . What sort of a God does this present to the universe ? knowingly and purposely doing wrong , or allowing it to be done here and then vindicating himself hereafter , allowing peoples and nations to be destroyed here who ought not to be destroyed and then virtually saying to them , " You can demand reparation for all this by and by . " If this doctrine is true , then all who have perished in the wars , and earthquakes , and pestilences , and other calamities that have visited the earth , can come in for a share of the Divine justice in this post-mortem settlement . Who can show with the Bible open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , that God has ever wronged a single moral being ? To be sure the world is full of wrongs . Mankind have wronged God and wronged one another . The ages have groaned under these wrongs and do to-day . The mystery of these things is absolutely appalling . All we can say is , that for wise reasons , God permits these wrongs and does not see fit to tell us why , but he is not responsible for them in any such sense that he is under obligation to make post-mortem atonement for them . This is the radical weakness of the new theology . It assumes that God , all through the history of the world has been dealing unjustly with certain portions of the human familythe antediluvians , the Gentiles , the heathen -- -that he has withheld from them a knowledge of the historic Christ , which he ought not to have done , and therefore these things must be rectified in the next world . This is judging God , not submitting to Him with that acquiescent faith which knows that He can do no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would disclose the fact that there is oftentimes far less of injustice in the // sufferings of men in this world than we are apt to imagine . A thousand things seem unjust to us , which are not really so . It has always been true that the innocent suffer with the guilty and that an inferior interest must sometimes be sacrificed for a superior . Can this be prevented ? Perhaps not . Such is the constitution of society , with its complex and ever growing complexity of interests , that very likely God himself can not interfere with the laws he has ordained , without causing greater wrongs than would be true by letting the laws work on in their natural way . The confusion , the wrongs , the injnstice that exist in this world , have been introduced by man and not by God . God , is working to untie this knot that man has tied , to straighten out these things that man has made crooked , to get out of this chaos as much of truth and righteousness and justice as he possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite Father to deal with . He will most certainly even up all these things by and by so far as they cau be evened up , but he has not told us how he will do it . We know He will do it and with this we should be satisfled . The evening up will be the rectification not of his wrongs but of man 's . But we must arrest this discussion . The further we pursue it , the clearer is our conviction , that the only safe course is to take the Bible substantially as we find it and not as we like it . FREDERICK ALYORD.
