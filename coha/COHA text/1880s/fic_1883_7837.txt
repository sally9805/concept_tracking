Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : A COUNTRY SUMMER SUNDAY . from Poems , in The poets of New Hampshire ( 1883 ) Sweet season of repose ! thy influence blest Pervades creation with a calm delight ; All nature claims the bounty of thy rest , And care that held dominion takes its flight . No sounds discordant lacerate the ear  --  In tranquil beauty lies the landscape wide ;  --  " To Praise ! To Praise ! " our inmost spirits hear , As if an angel spake , from every side . The sun , abroad , o'er meadow , wood and stream , A brighter , holier radiance seems to fling ; The birds inspired with sweeter music seem , And breathless breezes wait to hear them sing . Anon , awakening with a murmuring note , The soft winds harp on instrumental trees , While perfumes from a myriad blossoms float , Borne on the pinions of the joyous breeze . The cattle in the field , released from stall , Graze gratefully upon the grasses cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying in some pleasant pool . The rustling corn in tasseled pride outflings Its banners in the gleaming sun to dance , And every spire in golden triumph swings In plenitude of rich luxuriance . The farmer listless leans upon the wall , And looks with calm contentment o'er his fields , While glad emotions all his heart enthral , And thankfulness that here its tribute yields . But hark ! amid the charms that rest around , Comes to our ears the warning sabbath-bell ; The listening hills return the sacred sound , Which wakens echoes in the vales that dwell . And now , sedately from each cottage home , The village fathers , sabbathly arrayed , And village mothers , dignifiedly come , And village maidens with their " best " displayed ; The dusty chaise rolls down the dusty hill , A relic saved from generations past , A pride of station clinging to it still , And deferential looks are on it cast ! And loving pairs lag loiteringly along Beneath the shadows of the elm trees , tall , And themes are there for story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasol . All take the path to where , each holy day , The reverend pastor doth his accents raise , And strives to draw his hearers ' minds away , By urgings gentle , to a godly praise ; To where the anthem unassisted springs , And melody appalled turns pale to hear , Gathering for flight her silver-plumaged wings , To seek elsewhere some more harmonious sphere ! Yet much of soul dwells in the simple song , Where fervor takes the place of studied art , As on the air it pours itself along , Freighted with feeling of the fervent heart . Methinks that God looks more benignly down Upon the day His lovingness hath lent , When , amid scenes like this its hours we crown By offerings with joy and homage blent . Ascetic gloom should find no biding place To cloud the current of our bosom 's rest ; The sabbath sun with joy should gild the face , As in the heart its presence is confest . Shillaber , B. P. ( Benjamin Penhallow ) , 1814-1890 : PISCATAQUA. from Poems , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soul go out to thee , blue stream , Sparkling with pleasant memories of yore ,  --  Of days when youth flowed on , as flows a dream , As careless as thy wave that kissed the shore , Unheeding , and demanding nothing more Than thy fraternity and kindred joy , Mid scenes of loveliness then gloated o'er With the fond admiration of the boy , Which knew no limitation , knew no base alloy . Thou art still young and fair , Piscataqua , Thy voice as sweet and tuneful to my ear As when , in early boyhood 's holiday , It gave me fervent happiness to hear : My neighbor , playmate and companion dear , Sportive and wild with turbulent unrest , That gave no ripple of obtrusive fear To check the cheerful current of my breast , When held within thine arms or by thy side at rest . Thou speakst of those , who in the vortex lost Of life 's endeavor , long have lain to sleep , Or those who are upon time 's billows tost , For whose returning vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thy deep , Of boyish striving , with abandon free As thine own sparkling billows , that did leap In the glad sunshine , with exuberant glee , And thrilled me with the thought that I should sometime be . Oh , rushing river , fierce , resistless , strong !  --  Staying no moment welcome to extend To him who 's loved and treasured thee so long With more than the affection of a friend ; But yet thou dost thy dimpling eddies send , That , swirling at my feet , smile back the sun , Loitering where shore and water sweetly blend , While on thy mission thou keepst sternly on , Turning aside for naught until the goal is won . Yon fisher 's boat , that at her killock swings , Speaks to my consciousness most palpably How near the spectacle remembrance brings Of what was once a rare delight to me ; Can that be mine , the form which there I see In youth 's habiliments , his sinkered line Dropt neath the tide to catch what there may be That to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook , the struggling victim shine ! Piscataqua ! no better wish I 'd have , When life was young , than thus to idly swing Upon the buoyant bosom of thy wave , And o'er the side my line seductive fling : To hear the plover flit on hasty wing , To mark the clouds reflected on thy stream , To catch glad voices which the airs did bring From the far shore , lit by the sun 's bright beam , And swinging , listening , loafing  --  fish and fondly dream . How far , Piscataqua , thy shores expand , With beauties manifold on every side ! And all the loyal glories of the land Smile in the mirror of thy glassy tide . There Agamenticus , in solemn pride , Lifts his grand dome above the distant pines , There groves sweep downward to thy loving side , And fair Cocheco in the distance twines , Amid the winding banks , till with thee she combines . The curving shore , the orchard and the field Yet hold their places , and the river road Winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace has its beneficent abode ; Beyond , the white church , on the upland showed , Lifts its fair turret , and each sylvan nook Glows in the landscape as it e'er has glowed Since memory its fond departure took , To dwell upon the past as ' t were an open book . Unchanged , unchanging , shore and rock and wave ; But I , alas ! what changes dwell in me , As here I sit , where youth 's bright seasons gave Their choicest keepsakes to my custody ! Nor faithless I , though my dim eyes may see But faintly what is in my heart retained , With rare distinctness of that by-gone day , Which its beatitudes about me rained , Within that temple new , by care yet unprofaned . Farewell , bright stream ! my eyes may ne'er again Behold thy beauties , but I bear from thee A love renewed , which , like some heavenly strain Amid earth 's discords , will give ecstasy In hours remaining of the yet to be , And I shall fancy often that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Speaking in parting tones of love and cheer , And giving gladsomeness unto my failing ear . Newington on Piscataqua , Aug. 31 , 1879.
