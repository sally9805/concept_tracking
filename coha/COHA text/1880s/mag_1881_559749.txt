" If we intend to remain honest , and to pay the public debt , as good people of all parties do , and if we mean to administer the functions of government , then we must raise revenue in some way or other . With a reunited and harmonious country , we shall certainly in time pay off the public debt , but the necessity of raising money for the administration of the Government will continue as long as human nature lasts . All parties agree that the best way for us to raise revenue is largely by the tariff . So far as we are concerned , therefore , all talk about free trade'is folly . " - GENERAL HANCOCK . FOR many years there will remain among the statutes a law for the collection of import duties . It will certainly continue in force until after the payment of the public debt , and probably for a period in the future much more remote . The collection is so distant from the people by whom , as a part of the price , the tax is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct tax , and is , therefore , likely to continue in public favor as a mode of collecting revenue . Assuming that the tariff will be , then how shall it be , and what will be its effect upon party politics* The important incident in the political contest of 1880 was the abrupt change in the issue joined between the parties . That change was made shortly before the election . It was universal in the North , and almost immediate . The war had been fought over again during the preceding months , and its causes and consequences had been considered . But it was found that the war issue would not do . The people refused to respond in the passion addressed . The embroilment of the sections was abandoned . The eloquent champions of the cause that had been won and settled fifteen years before disappeared from the field . Men of business came to the front . They presided at the meetings . They addressed the people . To the working-men their assurances were positive and confident that , with Democratic success , employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The Republican party at once sprang from a sinking upon a buoyant platform . It was a feat of the greatest hazard , yet it was successful , and probably saved the result . It was possible only in an organization under perfect drill , and occupying a favorable position , and with an opponent badly located . At Cincinnati , as at St. Louis , the Democracy declared in favor of a tariff for revenue only . The force of the declaration was probably not considered at Cincinnati . Certainly it was not immediately appreciated by the people . But it came to be understood what it was to signify when , everywhere and at the same time , it was assailed as a free-trade sentiment , and opposed to American capital and labor . The impression made upon the public mind by the assault was a strong one , and the Democratic party was driven upon the defensive . It was in October , and there was no time for vindication ; the party was put upon explanation and apology . It was curious , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible to make of this question in the campaign of that year . Men engaged in the manufacture of wagons in one city , and of plows and reapers in another , were made to believe , and to believe with anxiety and fear , that a reduction of the tariff would close the shops and terminate employment . The fate of the tramp was before them , and the cry of starving children was in their ears . This was in shops where the hard woods of Indiana and Michigan were used , and in which iron alone , of all the material worked , was possibly influenced in its cost by the custom-house duties , and that to the prejudice of the particular industries . Almost a generation had passed since the tariff had been made the subject of thorough discussion before the people . During that period manufactures had vastly increased , giving the artisan class greater consequence in the politics of the country ; and , toward the close of that period , agricultural productions had found a large and remunerative market abroad , bringing contentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a system of duties highly protective . The opportunity was singularly favorable to the attack upon free trade , and upon the Democracy as its champion . In future declarations of principles and purposes , political parties will need to be so distinct and clear , in relation to the tariff , that they can not be misunderstood nor misrepresented. // The adjustment of the tariff has now so prodigious an influence upon the great business interests of the country that uncertainty in respect to it will not be tolerated . It was not unreasonable that the country should understand the expression , " a tariff for revenue only , " as excluding ali consideration of the wants and interests of business in the arrangement of the rates of duty . It was so understood , and was very damaging to the party that made it . So understood , it was a declaration that , in fixing the rates of taxation , revenue only should be regarded , and that special rates should not be made in accordance with the wants and welfare of particular classes of business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of the Government in important revenue legislation . If tea and coffee should come in free of duty , why ? Revenue only being considered , surely a large revenue could be collected from those articles . The protectionist will assign them to the free list because , not being produced in the country , they do not come in competition with any of our products . Because of the same fact , the free-trader will tax them only short of exclusion , because the entire tax goes into the treasury , anJ no home producer shares in the profits of an advanced price . The better reason for the discrimination is that tea and coffee are food , and very important to large classes that ought not to be taxed upon their food . The exemption is sustained by the same broad and liberal policy that repealed the English corn-laws . But , whatever reason may be given , it is but an exemption , and is a departure from the idea that taxation shall regard no consideration but revenue . Does the declaration also forbid the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion and art ? It is a reproach to the country that its commercial marine has disappeared from the ocean , and that our great productions are carried to distant markets under foreign flags . If , to encourage ship-building and the restoration of our commercial navy , it shall be expedient and wise to admit ship-material free , or at modified rates , is the inexorable dogma to hinder ? Shali the legislative judgment not consider an interest so important to the welfare and honor of the country , in adjusting the tariff ? In his last annual report , the Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that the increased receipts from taxes , and the decreased demands upon the treasury , would enable Congress to relieve the people from some of the internal revenue taxes , and // he also suggested that the reduction should be made from a list , as follows : Bank Checks , Friction Matches , Patent Medicines , Bank Deposits , Bank Capital . That communication presented to Congress a question of judgment and discretion . In reducing the direct taxes , should that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten million dollars , and leaving the burden almost altogether upon whisky , beer , and tobacco ; or should but a part of the list be dropped , and if so , what part of it , and upon what considerations of policy ? Should the bank checks be dropped ? Upon each check the tax is very light , yet it amounts aunually to more than two and a quarter million dollars . It is often inconvenient in payment , yet it is usually paid by those upon whom it is no burden . It is an unequal tax . The ten dollar and the ten thousand dollar checks require the same stamps . Should friction matches be dropped ? That , too , is but a light tax , yet its sum exceeds three and a half million dollars . It is an exceptional tax upon a useful industry , and it falls upon the entire people . Shall patent medicines be dropped ? They bring nearly two millions into the treasury . It may seem to be a tax upon health , yet it is doubtful if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is given as an illustration that , in the adjustment of taxes , Congress can not look to revenue only , but must exercise judgment and discretion , and that , in the exercise thereof , regard must be had to the interest and welfare of each particular object of taxation , and to its comparative importance in the country . The effect of internal revenue taxes upon the cost and marketable character of the articles taxed is direct and immediate , whilst the effect of custom-house duties upon the prices of domestic products is incidental and remote , but hardly less positive and certain . If the demand be equal to the domestic product , and to a like quantity from abroad , the certain and almost immediate effect of the import duty is to add that , or nearly as much , to the cost of the entire supply . The quality being the same , the cost of the imported article , after paying the tax , becomes the market price of the domestic supply . Otherwise they could not occupy the same market field at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , in fixing the rates of direct taxes , to consider the effect thereof upon the interests taxed , why is it not equally and plainly its duty , in establishing rates of // custom-house taxation , to consider the effect upon all important domestic interests , although incidental , yet being positive and certain ? The revenues from taxes and duties are increasing , whilst , by the reduction of the public debt and the rates of interest , the expenditures should be decreased , so that at an early day Congress will be able largely to reduce the list of taxed imports . The most extreme and selfish protectionist will not ask that classes of imported goods shall be taxed after such taxation has ceased to be necessary for revenue . What classes shall then be dropped , and assigned to the free list ? And what rates shall be fixed upon the retained classes ? The rates can not be uniform . A horizontal tariff is impossible . Both revenue and business would protest . The inquiries made above can not be answered by theorists . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire list , without indicating the domestic productions that must carry the burden if a deficit should appear after whisky , beer , and tobacco shall have yielded their largest possible supply . Nor by the protectionist , who overlooks revenue in his search after speculative profit . Nor , indeed , by the advocate of a tariff for revenue oniy , if he is again to be understood as he was in 1880 ; for in his eager pursuit of revenue he overlooks the manifest wants of business . In reconstructing the tariff , the wants of revenue and the welfare of business should be harmonized . Of necessity , it will first have to be decided what proportion of the revenue shall be collected through the instrumentality of the tariff ; and in the second place , what classes of imports shall be included in the tax lists and what shall be left in the free schedules . When these primary questions shall have been settled , there will remain but little of political principle applicable to the unfinished work . Thereafter it will be almost wholly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxes among the taxable imports . That work will require the aid of the merchant , the manufacturer , the machinist , the chemist , the best business skill and judgment of the country-men capable of understanding the effect of proposed legislation upon all the important interests . The ordinary partisan politician is not prepared for so important and delicate a duty ; nor , indeed , is the Congressional committee likely to be . The committees are chosen under an administration of the House of Representatives somewhat personal , and with a // reference to the wishes and ambition of the Speaker and his friends , rather than to any special fitness for the service . A committee organized under such influences can not be master of the situation . They are liable to fall under influences unfavorable to fair and impartial legislation . Shrewd and selfish men beset the committee-room . Plausibly they urge peculiar and sinister policies . Special and partial interests are likely to receive favor , to the hurt of more meritorious enterprises . The effect of such a condition of the public business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at any movement in Congress for any important modification of the tariff . Two things are desirable , and should be sought after : First . To take the tariff out of politics , or , perhaps , speaking more correctly , to take politics out of the tariff . Second . To establish the tariff as a business interest of the country . In its enormous detail , the tariff is not politics ; it is essentialiy business . It is folly longer to pretend that there are any political agreements about it . In Pennsylvania , iron is business ; in southern Indiana , plate-glass is politics . In the details , each wants the advantage ; and the pretended politics of either sparkles like the iron when hot , and is hollow like the glass when blown . Either one should blush to talk about its principles . It is only selfish and determined , like any other pursuit of money . It is folly , also , to claim absolute uniformity of opinion in respect to the tariff , on the part of the leaders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures were young and feeble , the powerful men of both parties may be quoted in favor of their encouragement ; but now the conditions are changed , and the views then expressed are no longer applicable . Manufactures are now strong and firmly established , and agriculture and other interests may justly protest against any advantage to their prejudice not incident to a wise and expedient revenue system . In the winter of 1879-80 , Mr. Senator Eaton , of Connecticut , introduced into the Senate a bili " to provide for the appointment of a commission to investigate the question of the tariff . " The bill received the prompt and favorable consideration of that body . The measure attracted much attention , because its distinguished author represented in the Senate an enormous investment in manufactures , and because it subsequently received the // approval of the Democratic candidate for the presidency , and , perhaps , thereby became the Democratic sentiment rather than the Cincinnati resolution . In addition to making the tariff nonpolitical , and placing it on a business foundation , the bill proposed to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail in adjusting the rates of taxation upon the various classes and qualities of articles taxed . The bill required the appointment of nine commissioners from civil life , whose duty it was made to visit the different sections of the country , and thoroughly to investigate all the various questions " relating to the agricultural , commercial , mercantile , manufacturing , mining , and industrial interests of the United States , so far as the same may be necessary to the establishment of a judicious tariff , or a revision of the existing tariff upon a scale of justice to all interests . " The testimony taken and the investigation made were to be reported to Congress . The bill proposed what a Congressional committee could not do , but what a commission of skilled men could do-that is , in a reliable and intelligent manner to investigate and report upon all the great interests of the country , so far as they could be affected by the tariff , and so that the tariff might be adjusted fairly and without partiality . The information so acquired and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its committees , justice would prevail , and neither crude , partial , nor oppressive legislation could find favor . Political controversies would cease , and the schemers for advan tage and the lobbyists for hire would find their occupations gone . From time to time modifications would be made , only as required by revenue or suggested by business . The increased reduction of the public debt , made possible by the condition of trade , will render future modifications of the tariff also possible and proper . Whenever the reduction shall go beyond the dropping of articles and classes from the schedules , and shall require important changes of rates , Congress should again avail itself of the services of the commission , and thus preserve the non-partisan and impartial character of the law . The future will probably develop conditions requiring new and greatly modified views . If the country shall become involved in no troubles now unlooked for , nor encounter periods of special and prolonged business depression , the public debt will disappear . The treasury will then be required to provide only for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Government , and the revenue system will be adjusted by the standard of that requirement . What the ordinary expenditures may be will depend so largely upon Congressional views of constitutional and legitimate appropriations , and upon the length of star routes in the executive departments , that it is quite impossible closely to estimate . It must , however , be safe to say that under no administration can the sum exceed the capabilities of the tariff , and will not probably go beyond the receipts possible from internal revenue . If so , the Government may receive its support either entirely from the tariff , or altogether from the internal revenue tax . From which shall it be ? The adlierents of incidental protection will insist that it shall be , as it was before the war , from the tariff alone . But large masses of the people will claim that whisky , beer , and tobacco are luxuries , as well done without as used , and that they should bear the burthen , rather than it should fall upon the useful and necessary articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the war the direct tax was unknown to the people , and not thought of by them as a substitute for the tariff in providing ordinary revenue . They have now become accustomed to it , and are more familiar with its operations and effects than with those of the tariff . They know that it increases the prices of domestic products directly and largely . Tobacco and beer will make their fight for exemption from the tax , upon the ground that they are products of home capital and labor . Whisky , too , will make a giant struggle for exemption , and will receive the support , not only of interested parties , but also of all those who are unwilling that its production shall appear to have the sanction of public authority . All these powerful influences will unite in favor of a tariff as the exclusive source of federal revenue . The motive of such union will be their own exemption . In the support of a tariff they are indifferent in respect to its influence upon the prices of other domestic products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . What other influences will come to the support of a tariff as the permanent system of federal taxation ? The partisan leader will need to consider this question with care , if his leadership is to be to success . It can not be answered now as it was thirty years ago . Of course you include all the interests benefited . Iron and plate-glass and woolen and cotton fabrics take their // sides at once . Capital and labor which they employ are assigned positions on election day as positively as on any day of the year . That vote alone would not be formidable , but there stands in sympathy by its side an element of great strength . It is the vote that comes from the other shops , and from the neighboring agricultural communities . Do you ask why they stand there in sympathy ? And well you may ask that question , for the enhanced price of the protected article is to their hurt . We know why these others stand together , for they have just come from the furnace where the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled . The tariff is a per cent. , not upon its cost , but upon the price of the iron , and some of that per cent . may go to the labor . But neither of us can tell why others whom we see and their comrades are there , and shouting for protection , for they come from the car-shops , where the hard woods of Indiana are made into cars , and where the iron used in binding the timbers together has been bought from the manufacturer with the custom-house duty upon the price . The car goes into the market with that additional cost upon it . It is the interest of labor that its products shall find a ready sale . The enhanced cost of the car , not expended in its construction , but in the protection of its iron , is to that extent an impediment to its sale , and so far a hurt to labor . But whether we can give the reason or not , the men from the car-shops are shouting and voting with the men from the iron-furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads the fight , had better resign before he leads to other defeats , if he can not perceive and comprehend the sympathies that control them . In the shops and at the polls the men are in sympathy , and raise their caps to what they believe to be the protecting genius of American labor . It is the sympathy of brotherhood , which a prudent leadership will recognize and respect . When almost exclusively agricultural , Indiana was easily influenced against protection ; now , in all her important towns and cities , valuable manufactures have become established , giving useful employment to labor , and sending a large and intelligent vote to the polls ; and he who aspires to partisan leadership finds the present contest very different from that which gave the State to Mr. Polk in 1844 . When the time shall come for the election between the two systems of revenue , the influences for the tariff will have grown // stronger , and liave reached and controlled the sympathies and support of additional States . Manufactures are increasing in the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is stated that " in 1870 , America had 157,310 looms at work in her cotton factories ; to-day ( 1881 ) , she has 230,232 . " That was an increase of 72,913 in the eleven years that included the four years of the panic , when all machinery and enterprise stood still . Not only increase but extension also , is the law of American enterprise . New and inviting fields are being developed . It is found better to take the loom to the cot . ton than to carry the cotton to the loom . Freight saved gives a dividend to the stockholder of the Georgia mill . His returns were regular during all of the depressed period . Assured profits invite capital . In pride and sympathy , Georgia will stand by her enterprises . Upon the Tennessee and the Cumberland , coal and iron ore , in great deposits , lie in parallel planes . Development has illustrated the cheapness of their manufacture into merchant and rairoad iron . There , also , capital is invited , and is going . Alabama and Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their wealth and influence . Their support will be given , as Pennsylvania 's support always has been given , to the furnaces and rolling-mills . The defects in the present law can not become permanent . Policy and justice unite in demanding their correction . They give to Pennsylvania and Massachusetts too greatly the advantage in the active business of the country . Two States must not rule the Union . Mr. Joseph Hatton , in his " To-day in America , " quotes the following criticisms upon our tariff , from the chainnan of the Chamber of Commerce of Bradford , England : " The duty on every kind of cloth is uniformly fifty cents per pound weight , and thirty-five per cent . of the value ; and taking the average value of mixed woolen goods at one shilling and fourpence per pound , the duty amounts to one hundred and fifty-six per cent . of the cost ; and with thirty-five per cent . added , the total of the combined duties amounts to one hundred and ninety-one per cent . ad valorem. - . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxed so highly that they are virtually excluded . Thus , a superfine black broadcloth may possibly be bought in New York at not more than double its price in // Europe ; while a good quality of black pilot , worth one shilling and eightpence per yard , can not be sold to the American laborer at less than four or five times the price at which an operative in England may procure that good , useful , and warm material for his coat . " The same author quotes from Mr. Brown , of the well-known firm of Stansfield , Brown &amp; Co. , to show that the combined tax of fifty cents per pound and thirty-five per cent . ad valorem on serge de Bern and lasting , used largely by American workmen in the manufacture of boots and shoes , is about ninety-four per cent on the English cost , rendering the price enormous , to the detriment of the customer and injury of the trade ; and that the consequence has been the destruction of a large export trade . Other illustrations might be given of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present tariff . They are not only unjust toward foreign countries with whom we have a liberal frade of enormous value , but hurtful to our own manufacturers and consumers . Imports should be taxed upon their values . To fix the value of an article by its weight is absurd ; the coarser and cheaper fabric is likely to be the heavier . Such vices in our system will disappear when submitted to the judgment of intelligent and just men . The writer believes that , in many and important lines of manufactures , American capital , labor , and improved machinery can now successfully compete with European enterprise , but he does not believe that fact will modify the popular demand for a tariff to meet the ordinary expenses of the Government . Therefore it seems to him the more important that , in the mode suggested , the tariff shall be removed from the influences of partisan and personal importunities , and established upon a basis in harmony with the necessities of revenue and the welfare of business .
