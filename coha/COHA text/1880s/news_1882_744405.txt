txt Mr. B. PLATT CARPENTER accepts the nomination for the office of LieutenantGovernor , of course . Nobody has expected him to do otherwise . But in signifying his acceptance in a formal manner to the Chairman of the late Republican convention he takes occasion to make a wholly unnecessary and useless explanation . It is devoted largely to a statement of Mr. CARPENTER 'S party characteristics and those of the Republicans of Dutchess County . Unfortunately for him and for them , these were pretty well known before . He has long been regarded by his present political associates as a peculiarly slippery and uncertain character , and no part of the State has been so notorious for sordid bargaining and petty corruption as the special field of his past political activity . Mr. CARPENTER sets out by expressing his satisfaction that criticism of the action of the convention has afforded an opportunity to elicit the truth , and immediately proceeds to show that the truth has not been elicited . He is filled with " indignation and scorn " for the " miscreant , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attempted to impose upon " an innocent committeeman and an innocent supposed proxy , " but he does not think that the act of this anonymous and inscrutable rascal ought to weaken anybody 's faith , in a " party that is not factional or backward in exposing an attempted fraud . " But the fraud seems to have been consummated , not merely " attempted , " and it does not appear to have been fully exposed even yet . It is comforting to be assured of the innocence of committeemen and proxies and the convention , but there would be real satisfaction if the deep and designing rascal who made such easy victims of them all could be brought to view , that he might receive the indignation and scorn which is so liberally poured , as it were , upon the desert air . There is a dreadful waste of righteous curses so long as they hit nobody . But , after all , it is not the miserable trick of the forged proxy , regarding which there is such a sickening pretense of innocence and ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was but a culminating incident of a series of tactics which resulted in the control of the convention by men who did not represent the Republican Party of the State . It was quite in keeping with the rest , and the miscreants and scoundrels are not all " undetected . " Mr. CARPENTER next undertakes to explain why he voted in the State Committee for Mr. MADDEN for temporary Chairman of the convention . In that also there was a wondrous amount of innocence and ignorance . Mr. MADDEN was " uncommitted " and belonged to no faction . So was Dutchess County ; SO was Mr. CARPENTER . They were neither " Stalwarts " nor " half-breeds . " Of course , Mr. CARPENTER did not know that there was any contest for the control of the convention in the interest of " any one man as a nominee ; " he was not aware that he had been reckoned , in Consequence of a presumed consistency in his course , on one side of that contest , and that Mr. MADDEN was put forward by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by everybody else that the action of the committee in selecting a man for temporary Chairman would have an important effect in determining the control of the convention . The confiding candidate proceeds to make some irrelevant explanation of how he happened to be the Chairman of the State Committee last year , and of the preferences of the Dutchess delegates in the late convention . Having stated that he never heard of any Republican faction in that virtuous county , he declares that these delegates were known it . advance to be for that " eminent jurist and statesman , CIIIRLES J. FOLGER ; " therefore he could not have influenced them in their action in the convention . Moreover , he was not a candidate for any office at the State Convention . Herein he was as innocent and as ignorant as in the preliminary proceedings . There were shrewd men at Saratoga , however , who knew well enough Mr. CARPENTER 'S hankering for office . They understood perfectly well the importance of his attitude and his action in the State Committee . They managed somehow to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they gave him the coveted nomination . No doubt he was innocent and unsuspecting all the while . It is the nature of the man . Now the good Mr. CARPENTER is for harmony , and he is perplexed to see how it can be " evolved from discord . " Stronger intellects than his would find it " too great a strain " to imagine this process of evolution , and so they do not try . But there would have been no discord if the Republicans of this State had been left to exercise their choice of delegates to the convention without interference , and those delegates had acted , untrammeled and uninfluenced by corrupt motives , as the representatives of their constituencies . Those who have produced the discord are burdened with the task of evolving harmony from it , and perhaps they may learn that the better way to secure party harmony is to allow it to work itself out from the free action of the people composing the party . Such a fight as was waged in the interest of revenge and greed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great party , is not likely to lead to paths of pleasantness and peace for candidates and managers .
