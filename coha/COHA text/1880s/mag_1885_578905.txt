GEORGE ELIOT 'S LIFE . Tnn writer of these pages has observed that the first question usually asked in relation to Mr. Cross 's long-expected biography is whether the reader has not *beeii disappointed in it . The inquirer is apt to be disappointed if the question is answered in the negative . It may as well be said , therefore , at the threshold of the following remarks , that such is not the feeling with which this particular reader laid down the book . The general feeling touching the work will depend very much on what has been looked for : there was probably , in advance , a considerable belief that we were to be treated to " revelations . " I know not , exactly , why it should have been , but certain it is that the announcement of a biography of George Eliot has been construed more or less as a promise that we were to be admitted behind the scenes , as it were , of her life . iNo such result has taken place . We look at the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the curtain is lowered whenever it suits the biographer . The most " intimate " pages in the book are those in which the great novelist notes her derangements of health and depression of spirits . This history , to my sense , is quite as interesting as it might have been ; that is , it is of the deepest interest , and can miss nothing that is characteristic or involved in the subject , except , perhaps , a few more examples of the vis comica which made half the fortune of Adam Bede and Silas Marner . There is little that is absent that it would have been in Mr. Cross 's power to give us . George Eliot 's letters and journals are only a partial expression of her spirit , but they are evidently as full an expression as it was capable of giving itself when she was not wound up to the epic pitch . They do not explain her novels ; they reflect in a singularly limited degree the process of growth of these great works ; but it must be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure one that her rich and complicated mind did not overflow in idle confidences . It was benignant and receptive in the highest degree , and nothing could have been more gracious thanthe manner of its intercourse ; but it was deeply reserved , and very far from egotistical , and nothing could have been less easy or agreeable to it , I surmise , than to attempt to tell people how , for instance , the plot of Romola got itself constructed , or the character of Grandcourt got itself observed . There are critics who refuse to the delineator of this gentleman the title of a genius ; who say that she had only a great talent , overloaded with a great store of knowledge . The label , the epithet , matters ! little , but it is certain that George Eliot had this characteristic of the mind possessed ; that the creations which brought her renown were of the incnlculable kind , shaped themselves in mystery , in some intellectual back shop or secret crucible , and were as little as possible implied in the aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking in Mr. Cross 's volumes than the absence of any indication , up to the time the Scenes from Clerical Life were published , that Miss Evans was a likely person to have written them ; unless it be the absence of any indication , after they were published , that the deeply-studious , concentrated , home-keeping Mrs. Lewes was a likely person to have produced their successes . I know very well that there is no such thing , in general , as the air of the novelist , which it behooves those who practice this art to put on , so that they may be recognized in public places ; but there is such a thing as the air of the May , // sage , the scholar , the philosopher , the votary of abstractions and of the lore of the ages , and in this pale but rich Life that is the face that is presented . The plan on which it is composed is , so far as I know , without precedent , but it is a plan that could have occurred only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture to apply this term to one who has executed a literary task with such tact and success . The regular litt6rateur , hampered by tradition , would , I think , have lacked the boldness , the artless artfulness , of conjoining in the same text selected morsels of letters and journals , so as to form a continuous and multifarious talk , on the writer 's part , punctuated only by marginal names and dates and divisions into chapters . There is something a little violent in the system , in spite of our feeling that it has been applied with a gentle hand ; but it was probably the best that 1*Ir . Cross could have adopted , and it served especially well his purpose of appearing only as an arranger , or rather of not appearing at all . The modesty , the good taste , the self-effacement , of the editorial element in the book are , in a word , complete , and the clearness and care of arrangement , the accuracy of reference , leave nothing to be desired . The form Mr. Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap plication , highly agreeable , and his rule of omission ( for we have , almost always , only parts and passages of letters ) has not prevented his volumes from being as copious as we could wish . George Eliot was not a great letter-writer , either in quantity or quality ; she had neither the spirit , the leisure , nor the lightness of mind to conjure with the epistolary pen , and after her union with George Henry Lewes her disposition to play with it was farther restricted by his quick activity in her service . Letterwriting was part of the trouble he saved her ; in this , as in other ways , he interposed between the world arid his sensi tive companion . The difference is striking between her habits in this respect and those of Madame George Sand , whose correspondence has lately been collected into six closely printed volumes , which testify afresh to her extraordinary energy arid facility . Madanie Sand , however , indefatigable producer as she was , was not a woman of study ; she lived from day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , and had no general plan of life and culture . 4Ier English compeer took work more seriously , and distilled her very substance into the things she gave the world . There was , therefore , so much the less of it left for her casual writing . It was not till Marian Evans was past thirty , indeed , that she became an author by profession , and it may accordingly be supposed that her early letters are those which take us most into her confidence . This is true of those written when she was on the threshold of womanhood , which form a very full expression of her feelings at the time . The drawback here is that the feelings themselves are rather wanting in interest - one may almost say in amiability . At the age of twenty Marian Evans was a deeply religious young woman , whose faith took the form of a narrow evangelicism . Religious , in a manner , she remained to the end of her life , in spite of her adoption of a scientific explanation of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to concerts and to read novels . She writes to her former governess that she can " only sigh " when she hears of the " marrying and giving in marriage that is constantly transacted ; " expresses enjoyment of Hannah More 's letters ( " the contemplation of so blessed a character as hers is very salutary " ) ; wishes that she " might be more useful in her own obscure and lowly station " ( " I feel myself to be a mere cumberer of the ground " ) , that she " might seek to be sanctified wholly . " These first // qwq // was not till the summer of 1854 that the connection with him began ( it was marked to the world by their going to spend together several months in Germany , where he was bent on researches for his Life of Goethe ) which was to become so much closer than many formal marriages , and to last till his death in 1878 . The episode of Miss Evans 's life in London during these three years was already tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional literary woman , and had regular work as assistant editor of the Westminster Review , to which she gave her most conscientious attention . Her accomplishments now were wide . She was a linguist , a copious reader , an earnest student of history and philosophy . She wrote much for the Westminster , as well as solicited articles from others , and several of her contributions are contained in the volume of essays published after her death , - essays of which it is fair to say that they give but a faint intimation of her latent powers . George Henry Lewes was a versatile , hard-working journalist , with a tendency , apparently , of the drifting sort ; and after having been made acquainted with each other by Mr. Herbert Spencer the pair commingled their sympathies and their work . Her letters , at this season , contain constant mention of Lewes ( one allusion to the effect that he " has quite won my regard , after having had a good deal of my vituperation " ) ; she takes an interest in his health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was impossible for Mr. Lewes to marry , as he had a wife living , from whom he was separated . He had also three children , of whom the care did not devolve upon their mother . The union Miss Evans formed with him was a deliberate step , of which she accepted all the consequences . These consequences were excellent , so far as the world is at liberty to judge , save in an important particular . This particular is the fact that her false position , as we may call it , produced upon George Eliot 's life a certain effect of sequestration , which was not favorable to social freedom , and which excited on the part of her companion a certain protecting , sheltering , fostering , precautionary attitude , - the assumption that they lived in special , in abnormal conditions . It would be too much to say that George Eliot had not the courage of the situation she had embraced , but she had , at least , not the indifference ; she wds unable , in the premises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-considering mind , of which the leading mark is the *spacity for a sort of luminous brooding , fed upon the idea of her irregularity with an intensity which doubtless only her magnificent intellectual activity and Lewes 's brilliancy and ingenuity kept from being morbid . The fault of most of her work is the absence of spontaneity , the excess of reflection ; and by her action in 1854 ( which seemed , superficially , to be of the sort usually termed reckless ) she committed herself to being nothing if not reflective , to cultivating a kind of compensatory earnestness . Her earnestness , her refined conscience , her exalted sense of responsibility , were colored by her peculiar position ; they committed her to a plan of life , of study , in which the accidental , the unexpected , were too little allowed for , and this is what I mean by speaking of her sequestration . If her relations with the world had been easier , in a word , her books would have been less difficult . Mr. Cross , very justly , merely touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of the sanction of the law ; but he gives a portion of a letter written to Mrs. Bray more than a year after it had begun , which sufficiently indicates the serenity of her resolution . Repentance , of course , she never had ,  --  the success of her experiment was too rare and complete for that ; and I do not mean that her attitude was ever for // a moment apologetic . On the contrary , it was only too superabundantly confirmatory . Her effort was to pitch her life ever in the key of the superior wisdom that made her say to Mrs. Bray , in the letter of September , 1855 , " That any unworldly , unsuperstitious person who is sufficiently acquainted with the realities of life can pronounce my relation to Mr. Lewes immoral I can only understand when I remember how subtle and complex are the influences that mould opinion . " I need not attempt to project the light of criticism on this particular case of conscience ; there remains *ver , in the mutual relations of respectable men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . One reflection , however , forces itself upon the mind : if the connection had not taken place , we should have lost the spectacle and influence of one of the most complete and tender unions presented to us in the history of literature . There has been much talk about George Eliot 's " example , " which is not to be deprecated so long as it is remembered that in speaking of the example of a woman of such rare nobleness of mind we can only mean example for good . Exemplary indeed , in her long connection with George Henry Lewes , were her sympathy , appreciation , affection , constancy . She was thirty-seven years old when the Scenes from Clerical Life were published , but this work opened wide for her the door of success , and fame and fortune came to her rapidly . Her union with Lewes had been a union of poverty : there is a sentence in her journal , of the year 1856 , which speaks of their ascending certain cliffs called the Tors , at Ilfracombe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this luxury , and we could not afford a sixpenny walk very frequently . " The incentive to writing Amos Barton seems to have been mainly pecuniary . There was an urgent need to make money , and it ap pears to have been agreed between the pair that there was at least no harm in the lady 's trying her hand at a story . Lewes professed a belief that she would really do something in this line , while she , more skeptical , reserved her judgment till after the test . The Scenes from Clerical Life were therefore preeminently an empirical work of fiction . With the sending of the first episode to the late Mr. John Blackwood for approval , there opened a relation between publisher and author which lasted to the end , and which was probably more genial and unclouded than any in the annals of literature , as well as almost unprecedentedly lucrative to both parties . This first book of George Eliot 's has little of the usual air of a first book , none of the crudity of an early attempt ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sees that the material had been long in her mind . The ripeness , the pathos , a sort of considered quality , are as striking to-day as when Amos Barton and Janet 's Repentance were published , and enable us to understand that people should have asked themselves with surprise , at that time , who it was , in the midst of them , that had been taking notes so long and so wisely without giving a sign . Adam Bede , written rapidly , appeared in 1859 , and George Eliot found herself a consummate novelist without having suspected it . The book was an immense , a brilliant success , and from this moment the author 's life took its definite and final direction . She accepted the great obligations which to her mind belonged to a person who had the ear of the public , and her whole effort thenceforth was highly to respond to them , - to respond to them by teaching , by vivid moral illustration , and even by direct exhortation . It is striking that from the first her conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the game of art . The most interesting passage in Mr. Cross 's volumes is , to my sense , a simple sentence in a short entry // in her journal in the year 1859 , just after she had finished the first volume of The Mill on the Floss ( the original title of which , by the way , had been Sister Maggie ) : " We have just finished reading aloud Pare Goriot , a hateful book . " That Balzac 's masterpiece should have elicited from her only this remark , at a time , too , when her mind might have been opened to it by her own activity of composition , is significant of so many things that the few words are , in the whole Life , those I should have been most sorry to lose . Of course they are riot all George Eliot would have had to say about Baizac , if some other occasion than a simple jotting in a diary had presented itself . Still , what even a jotting may not have said after a first perusal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's general attitude with regard to the novel , which , for her , was not primarily a picture of life , capable of deriving a high value from its form , but a moralized fable , the last word of a philosophy endeavoring to teach by example . This is a very noble and defensible view , and one must speak respectfully of any theory of work which would produce such fruit as Ilomola and Middlemarch . But it testifies to that side of George Eliot 's nature which was weakest - the absence of free aesthetic life ( I venture this remark in the face of a passage quoted from one of her letters in Mr. Cross 's third volume ) ; it gives the hand , as it were , to several other instances that may be found in the same pages . " My function is that of the esthetic , not the doctrinal teacher ; the rousing of the nobler emotions , which make mankind desire the social right , not the prescril ) ing of special measures , concerning which the artistic mind , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best judge . " That is the passage referred to in my parenthetic allusion , and it is a good general description of the manner in which George 673 Eliot may be said to have acted on her generation ; but the " artistic mind , " the possession of which it implies , existed in her with limitations remarkable in a writer whose imagination was so rich . We feel in her , always , that she pro . ceeds from the abstract to the concrete ; that her figures and situations are evolved , as the phrase is , from her moral consciousness , and are only indirectly the products of observations . They are deeply studied and elaborately justified , but they are not seen in the irresponsible plastic way . The world was , first and foremost , for George Eliot , the moral , the intellectual world ; the personal spectacle came after ; and lovingly , humanly , as she regarded it , we constantly feel that she cares for the things she finds in it only so far as they are types . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are aware that the somewhat cooling draught of ethical purpose draws across it . This constitutes half the beauty of her work ; the constant reference to ideas may be an excellent source of one kind of reality - for , after all , the secret of seeing a thing well is not necessarily that you see nothing else . Her preoccupation with the universe helped to make her characters strike you as also belonging to it ; it raised the roof , widened the area , of her resthetic structure . Nothing is finer , in her genius , than the combination of her love of general truth and love of the special case ; without this , indeed , we should not have heard of her as a novelist , for the passion of the special case is surely the basis of the storyteller 's art . All the same , that little sign of all that Baizac failed to suggest to her showed at what perils the special case got itself considered . Such dangers increased as her activity proceeded , and many judges perhaps hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( especially the latter ) , it ceased to be considered at all . Such critics assure us that Gwendolen and Grandcourt , // Deronda and Myra , are not concrete images , but disembodied types , pale abstractions , signs and symbols of a " great lesson . " I give up Deronda and Myra to the objector , but Grandcourt and Gwendolen seem to me to have a kind of superior reality ; to be , in a high degree , what one demands of a figure in a novel , planted on their legs and complete . The truth is , perception and reflection , at the outset , divided George Eliot 's great talent between them ; but , as time went on , circumstances led the latter to ( levelop itself at the expense of the former - one of these circumstances being apparently the influence of George henry Lewes . Lewes was interested in science , in cosmic problems ; and though his companion , thanks to the original bent of her versatile , powerful mind , needed no impulse from without to turn herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her further than she would otherwise have gone in the direction of scientific observation , which is but another form of what I have called reflection . Her early novels are full of natural *s distinguished from systematic observation , though even in them it is less the dominant will , I think , than the love of the " moral , " the reaction of thought in the face of the human comedy . They had observation sufficient , at any rate , to make their fortune , and it may well be said that that is enough for any novel . In Silas Marner , in Adam Bede , the quality seems gilded by a sort of autumn haze , an afternoon light , of meditation , which mitigates the sharpness of portraiture . I doubt very much whether the author herself had a clear vision , for instance , of the marriage of Dinah Morris to Adam , or of the rescue of Hetty from the scaffold at the eleventh hour . The reason of this may be , indeed , that her perception was a perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular incidents do not belong to na ture ( to my sense , at least ) ; by which I do not mean that they belong to a very happy art . I cite them , on the contrary , as an evidence of artistic weakness ; they are a very good example of the view in which a story must have marriages and rescues in the nick of time as a matter of course . I must add , in fairness to George Eliot , that the marriage of the nun - like Dinah , which shocks the reader , who sees in it a base concession , was a trouvaille of Lewes 's , and is a small sign of that same faulty judgment in literary things which led him to throw his influence on the side of her writing verse - verse which is all reflection , with direct , vivifying vision remarkably absent . It is a part of this same limitation of the pleasure she was capable of taking in the fact of representation for itself that the various journals and notes of her visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tempered enjoyment of foreign sights , which was as near as she ever came to rapture , singularly vague in expression on the subject of the general and particular spectacle - the life and manners , the works of art . She enumerates diligently all the pictures and statues she sees , and the way she does so is a proof of her active , earnest intellectual habits ; but it is rarely apparent that they have , as the phrase is , said much to her , or that what they have said is one of their deeper secrets . She is capable of writing , after coming out of the great chapel of San Lorenzo , in Florence , that " the world-famous statues of Michael Angelo on the tombs . . . remained to us as affected and exaggerated in the original as in copies and casts . " That sentence startles one , on the part of the author of Romola , and that Mr. Cross should have printed it is a commendable proof of his impartiality . It was in Romola , precisely , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that reflection began to weigh down // the scale . Romola is pre*miuently a study of the human conscience in an historical setting which is studied almost as much , and few passages in Mr. Cross 's volumes are more interesting than those relating to the production of this magnificent romance . George Eliot took all her work with a noble seriousness , but into none of it did she throw herself with more passion . It drained from her as much as she gave to it , and none of her writing ploughed into her , to use her biographer 's expression , so deeply . She told him that she began it as a young woman , and finished it as an old one . More than any of her novels , it was evolved , as I have said , from her moral consciousness - a moral consciousness encircled by a prodigious amount of literary research . Her literary ideal was at all times of the highest , but in the preparation of Romola it placed her under a control absolutely relig'ious . She read innumerable books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consulted without stint contemporary records and documents . She neglected nothing that would enable her to live , intellectually , in the period she had undertaken to describe . We know , for the most part , I think , the result . Romola is on the whole the finest thing she wrote , but its defects are almost on the scale of its beauties . The great defect is that , except in the person of Tito Melema , it does not seem positively to live . It is overladen with learning , it smells of the lamp , it tastes just perceptibly of pedantry . In spite of its incomplete animation , however , it assuredly will survive in men s remembrance , for the finest pages in it belong to the finest part of our literature . It is on the whole a failure , but such a failure as only a great talent can produce ; and one may say of it that there are many great " hits " far less interesting than such a mistake . A twentieth part of the erudition would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of the time , if there had been more of the breath of the Florentine streets , more of the faculty of optical evocation , a greater saturation of the senses with the elements of the adorable little city . The difficulty with the book , for the most part , is that it is not Italian ; it has always seemed to me the most Germanic of the author 's productions . I can not imagine a German writing ( in the way of a novel ) anything half so good ; but if I could imagine it , I should suppose Romola to be very much the sort of picture he would achieve - the sort of medium through which he would show us how , by the Arno-side , the fifteenth century came to an end . One of the sources of interest in the book is that , more than any of its companions , it indicates how much George Eliot proceeded by reflection and research ; how little important , comparatively , she thought that same breath of the streets . It carries to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , by Mr. Cross 's volumes ( by the second and third ) is that of simple success - success which had been the result of no external accidents ( unless her union with Lewes be so denominated ) , but was involved in the very faculties nature had given her . All the elements of an eventual happy fortune met in her constitution . The great foundation , to begin with , was there - the magnificent mind , vigorous , luminous , and eminently sane . To her intellectual vigor , her immense facility , her exemption from cerebral lassitude , her letters and journals bear the most copious testimony . Her daily stint of arduous reading and writing was of the largest . Her ability , as one may express it in the most general way , was astonishing , and it belonged to every season of her long and fruitful career . 1-ler passion for study encountered no impediment , but was able to make everything feed and support it . The extent and variety of her knowledge is by itself // a re'sume ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this an immense special talent , which , as soon as it tries its wings , is found to be capable of the highest , longest flights , and brings back great material rewards . George Eliot of course had drawbacks and difficulties , physical infirmities , constant liabilities to headache , dyspepsia , and other illness , to deep depression , to despair about her work ; but these jolts of the chariot were small in proportion to the impetus acquired , and were hardly greater than was necessary for reminding her of the secret of all ambitious workers in the field of art - that effort , effort , always effort , is the only key of success . Her great furtherance was that , intensely intellectual being as she was , the life of affection and emotion was also widely open to her . She had all the initiation of knowledge and none of its dryness , all the advantages of judgment and all the luxuries of feeling . She had an imagination which enabled her to sit at home with book and pen , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Warwickshire ale-houses and Florentine symposia , reconstitute conditions utterly different from her own . Toward the end she triumphed over the great impossible ; she reconciled the greatest sensibility with the highest serenity . She succeeded in guarding her pursuits from intrusion ; in carrying out her habits ; in sacrificing her work as little as possible ; in leading , in the midst of a society united in conspiracies to interrupt and demoralize , an independent , strenuously personal life . People who had the honor of penetrating into the sequestered precinct of the Priory - the house in London , in which she lived from 1863 to 1880 - remember well a kind of sanctity in the place , an atmosphere of stillness and concentration , something that suggested a literary temple . It was part of the good fortune of which I speak that in Mr. Lewes she had found the most devoted of caretakers , the most jealous of ministers , a companion through whom all business was transacted . The one drawback of this relation was that , considering what she attempted , it limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest it helped her in a hundred ways ; it saved her nerves , it fortified her privacy , it protected her leisure , it diminished the friction of living . His admiration of her work was of the largest , though not always , I think , truly discriminating , and he surrounded her with a sort of temperate zone of independence - independence of everything except him and her own standards . Nervous , sensitive , delicate in every way in which genius is delicate ( except , indeed , that she had a robust reason ) , it was a great thing for her to have accident made rare and exposure mitigated ; and to this result Lewes , as the administrator of her fame , admirably contributed . He filtered the stream , and gave her only the clearer water . The accident of reading reviews of one 's productions , especially when they are bad , is , for the artist of our day , one of the most frequent ; and Mr. Lewes , by keeping these things out of her way , enabled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success - an inaccessibility to the newspaper . " It is remarkable to me , " she writes in 1876 , " that I have entirely lost my personal melancholy . I often , of course , have melancholy thoughts about the destinies of my fellow creatures , but I am never in that mood of sadness which used to be my frequent visitant even in the midst of external happiness . " Her later years , colored by this accumulated wisdom , when she had taken her final form before the world , and had come to be regarded more and more as a teacher and philosopher , are full of suggestion to the critic , but I have exhausted my limited space . There is a certain coldness in them , perhaps - the coldness that results from most // 677 of one 's opinons being formed , one 's mind made up , on many great subjects ; from the degree , in a word , to which " culture " had taken the place of the more primitive processes of experience . " Ah , les livres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . pdrissons par les livres ! " That cry of a distinguished French novelist ( there is no harni in mentioning M. Alphonse Dandet ) , which fell upon the ear of the present writer some time ago , represents as little as possible the emotion of George Eliot b confronted with literatures and sciences . M. Alphonse Daudet went on to say that , to his mind , the personal impression , the effort of direct observation , was the most precious source of information for the novelist ; that nothing could take its place ; that the effect of books was constantly to check and pervert this effort ; that a second-hand , thirdhand , tenth-hand , impression was constantly tending to substitute itself for a fresh perception ; that we were ending by seeing everything through literature instead of through our own senses ; and that , in short , literature was rapidly killing literature . This view has immense truth on its side , but the case would be too simple if , on one side or the other , there were only one way of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , to know , or at least to see and no one , in the nature of things , can afford to be less indifferent to side-lights . Books are themselves , unfortunately , an expression of human passions . George Eliot had no doubts , at any rate ; if impressionism , before she laid down her pen , had already begun to be talked about , it would have made no difference with her - she would have had no desire to pass for an impressionist . There is one question we can not help asking ourselves as we close this record of her life ; it is impossible not to let our imagination wander in the direction of what turn her mind or her fortune might have taken if she had never met George Henry Lewes , or never cast her lot with his . It is safe to say that , in one way or another , in the long run , her novels would have got themselves written , and it is possible they would have been more ilatural , as one may call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been less systematic , more irresponsible , more personal , and should we have had more of Adam Bede and Silas Marner , and less of Romola and Middlemarch ? The question , after all , can not be answered , and 1 do not push it , being myself very grateful for Middlemarch and Romola . It is as George Eliot does actually present herself that we must judge her - a condition that will not prevent her from striking us as one of the noblest , most beautiful minds of our time . This impression bears the reader company throughout these letters and notes . It is impossible not to feel , as we close them , that she was an admirable being . They are less brilliant , less entertaining , than we might have hoped ; they contain fewer " good things , " and have even a certain grayness of tone , something measured and subdued , as of a person talking without ever raising her voice . But there rises from them a kind of fragrance of moral elevation ; a love of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of looking at things ; and a constant effort to hold high the torch in the dusky spaces of man 's conscience . That is how we see her during the latter years of her life : frail , delicate , shivering a little , much fatigued and consi(leral)ly spent , but still meditatbig on what could be acquired and imparted ; still living , in the intelligence , a freer , larger life than probably had ever been the portion of any woman . To her own sex her memory , her example , will remain of the highest value ; those of them for whom the b* development " of wonian is the hope of the future ought to erect a monument to George Eliot . She helped on the cause more than any // one , in proving how few limitations are of necessity implied in tJe feminine organism . She went so far that such a distance seems enough , and in her effort she sacrificed no tenderiiess , no grace . There is much talk to-day about things being " open to women ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . If we criticise her novels , we must remember that her nature came first and her work afterwards , and that it is not remarkable that they should not resemble the productions , say , of Alexander Dumas . What is remarkable , extraordinary - and the process remains inscrutable and mysterious - is that this quiet , anxious , sedentary , serious , invalidical English lady , without animal spirits , without adventures , without extravagance , assumption , or bravado , should have made us believe that nothing in the world was alien to her ; should have produced such rich , deep , masterly pictures of the multifold life of man . Henry James .
