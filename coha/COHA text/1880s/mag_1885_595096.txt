IN writing upon the leaders of American song , I have sought to make our various studies as comprehensive as possible within due bounds . That they might be both critical and sympathetic , and afford new illustrations of the poetic principle and the temperament of poets , it has been my effort to approach the subject of each from his own ground ,  --  to comprehend his motive and judge him at his best ; at the same time , to see where he has failed of that standard and of the true spirit of ideal expression . Such an effort requires to be taken as a whole . Isolated phrases , and even sections , at times may have been misconstrued as unfair stricture or , on the other hand , as if biased by personal considerations . Yet , in the course of each study , I have tried to draw a just portrait , and so to analyze the work of its original as to obtain at least an approximately correct resultant . For the present essay ,  --  relating to various persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animate than those which it supplements ,  --  I would ask that its parts be weighed , together , if at all . It has a distinct purpose ,  --  to glance at the existing condition of our poetry , and to speculate concerning the near future . Not to prophesywe scarcely can forecast next month 's weather from the numberless shifting currents of to-day . Yet one may hopefully surmise , for example , that a dull spell will not last beyond all reason and experience . The past teaches us what signs indicate the change ,  --  where blue sky will first appear ,  --  and that , if the wind " backs , " or proves fickle , a brightening will be temporary and delusive . In the mood of a cautious weather-sage , then , let us examine the late reports from the signal-stations that together show the probabilities . In reviewing the poetry of England , the general drift was indicated more plainly by the choir at large than by the solos of a few striking and independent voices . I. WHEN some of our elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , there soon arose a cry of foreboding . Who , it was asked , are to occupy the places of Bryant , Longfellow , Emerson ' ? What younger men can equal the work executed by those pioneers when the latter were of corresponding age ? A period of decline has been predicted . It may be noted , as we seek to determine whether the prediction is well based , that a similar cry is heard from across the sea . The work of Tennyson and the Brownings , in their prime , is contrasted with that of their juniors , and critics are not boastful as to the promise of another sangerfest . I venture to recall that ten years ago I saw the beginning of a poetic dusk , and expressed a belief in its temporary continuance . It is now generally perceived and lamented ; nevertheless it seems to me that it is near an end , and that we may begin to look for a new day . If this is to differ from the last ,  --  if we who enjoyed the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ,  --  the young will speedily interpret it for us . Their estimate of relative values will have its own gauge . The rise of Poetry in America , its first noteworthy and somewhat original endeavor , was clearly marked , and singularly coincident with that of the Victorian School abroad . Before long , our poetry took its place with standard literature ; its authors won the interest , even the affection , of an attentive public . The close of the term involved may not have been so clear to us . Literary periods shift with mingled sounds , like those of bands following one another at intervals in a procession . But , as in the case of the similar term abroad , it was defined sufficiently for us now to look back and recognize it . The influences to which was due a diversion of interest , and which brought poetic aims and methods into doubt , may be briefly recapitulated . They include all that we have seen prevailing throughout Christendom and resulting from its accelerated evolution of knowledge and energy : the radical change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science ,  --  the disturbance of tradition and convictions ,  --  the leap from romance to realism . We must allow , too , for the diversion of genius to material conquests , adventure , the creation of fortunes ; and for the growth of journalism , and of prose fiction answering to the demands of the time . All the resulting influences are fully as dynamic here as in the Old World , and some of them far more so . But other factors , peculiar to this country , must not be overlooked . The civil war was a general absorbent at the crisis when a second group of poets began to form . Their generation pledged itself to the most heroic struggle of the century . The conflict not only checked the rise of a new school , but was followed by a time of languor in which the songs // of Apollo seemed trivial to those who had listened to the shout of Mars . A manly reaction , from the taste for rhetoric and sentiment which existed before the war , degenerated into the indifferentism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct survived through all conditions , and still impelled them to sing , found themselves subject to a novel disadvantage . The favorite senior bards were still in voice ; their very longevity , fitting and beautiful as it was , restrained the zeal and postponed the opportunities of pupils who held them in honor . Our common and becoming reverence prevented both the younger writers and the people from suspecting that these veterans were running in grooves and supplying little new ; finally , when this was realized , and there was a more open field , it became evident that the public was satiated with verse and craved a change not merely of poets , but to some new form of imaginative literature . Original genius will find an outlet through all hindrances ; be the air as it may , its flight will be the eagle 's ; but it will be apt , at such a time , to take some other direction than that of its predecessors . All in all , the subsequent incitement to lyrical effort was not so effective , nor was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of Longfellow and his compeers . In the course of these studies I have referred at some length to a few poets next succeeding those veterans ,  --  some who now , but for the regard shown them by younger contestants , would scarcely realize how surely they are becoming veterans themselves . Thus age succeeds to age , and still Poesy , " blazoned as on heaven 's immortal noon , leads generations * It only remains for us to take an outlook , and make note of what poetic activity is discoverable at the present time . With respect to my near associates , and to the increasing circle of fresh recruits , whose chances are all before them , I repeat my statement that it would be out of taste and purpose for me to assume the functions of a critical censor or appraiser . The situation can be studied , and some conecture made of the future , upon a simple record of what a representative number of these have done and are doing , and I do not think our conclusions can be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Holmes , the two oldest survivors of their group , find their audience still extending with the rapid spread of culture in this land . Their eyes are scarcely dimmed , and their natural strength serves them for periodic flights of song . Lowell 's apparent retirement in favor of younger writers , though doubtless only temporary , is the one courtesy they desire him to forego . From Whitman , more picturesque than ever , we have now and then some passing , half-broken , yet harmonic strain , striving to capture the substance of things seen and unseen . I have already written of Taylor , Stoddard , Boker , and their comrades , with whom our poetry began to show less of the ethical and polemic fervor that brought their predecessors into repute . No new cause required the lifting up of hands , and they meditated the Muse from simple love of beauty and song . Stoddard , although a hard-worked man of letters , has been true to his early vows , and adds to our songs of summer in the autumn of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquil power , one of those sustained and characteristic blank-verse poems in which his faculty is at its highest . Of poets a decade younger , Hayne , Aldrich , Winter , Piatt , Howells , and a few others , still remain . It was their lot to begin at just the time when the country had forsworn peace and its pipings ; but they none the less took heart , and did good service in keeping our minstrel line unbroken through good and evil days alike . Winter 's extreme poetic temperament , and his loyalty to an ideal , have made his frequent sketches of travel very charming , and have imparted to his dramatic criticisms the grace and proportion for which they are distinguished . The melody , ease , and sincere feeling of his personal tributes and occasional pieces for delivery , render them quite unique . The poem read at the dedication of the monument to Poe is an elevated production . His best lyrics have caught the spirit of the early English muse . To Aldrich , now in his sunny prinle ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  justly is awarded a place at the head of the younger art-school . He is a poet of inborn taste , a votary of the beautiful , and many of his delicately conceived pieces , that are unexcelled by modern work , were composed in a ruder time , and thus a forecast of the present technical advance . They illustrate the American instinct which unites a Saxon honesty of feeling to that artistic subtilty in which the French surpass the world . Though successful in a few poems of a more heroic cast , his essential skill and genius are found in briefer lyrics comparable to faultless specimens of the antique graver 's art . Such pieces as the " Palabras Carifiosas andthelines " On an Intaglio Head of Minerva " have a high-bred quality that still keeps them at the // head of our vers de socidte ' ; nor is their author dependent for his effect on novel and elaborate forms . Apparently spontaneous , they are perfected with the touch of a Gautier . His quatrains and trifles expressive of fleeting moods rank with the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable contrast to the sudden wit and fancy of his speech ; as a writer , he never has stood in need of the in-junction ,  --  " 0 Poet , then forbear The loosely sandalled verse , Choose rather thou to wear The buskin straight and terse . " His shorter tales and sketches are finished like so many poems in prose , sparklingly original , and delightful for the airy by-play , the refined nuances , of a captivating literary style . Fawcett 's verse displays tendencies which class him with the art-school , and an inclination to profit by the Gallic taste and motive . The poems in his two volumes are selected , I presume , from a copious store , as he has been from youth a prolific writer . In Fantasy and Passion were many cabinet pictures in rhyme , drawn with fastidious care , and an occasional lyric , like " The Meeting , " upon a weird theme and suggestively wrought . The leading pieces in " Song and Story " have fewer mannerisms ,  --  a less fanciful , a freer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to essay almost every form of inventive , satirical , and critical literature , and as a playwright he has made not the least successful of his ventures . Two of our prominent New York authors seem , aside from their professional work as journalists , to have devoted themselves without reserve to poetry . Their characteristics are very dissimilar . Of Gilder I can not speak here . The other , Charles de Kay , is conspicuous for height of aim , and certainly for a most resolute purpose . In these days it is bracing to see a man of his ability in earnest as a poet . It would be premature to judge of the strange , affluent and broadly handled Visions , " Nimrod " and " Esther , " at this near view , or until completed by the final section of their trilogy . " Hesperus " and the " Poems of Barnaval " show his impassioned and more subjective moods , and his resources for a prodigal display of varied , uneven , but often strongly effective lyrical work . The deaths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual traits began to appear , stilled two voices of no little promise . Among our Northern poets there are some whose verse is the expression of their choicest impulses rather than the most substantial portion of their literary outcome . Lathrop 's too infrequent lyrics give token of sensitive feeling and a beautiful poetic vein . Professor Boyesen 's verse , like his prose , belongs so thoroughly to his adopted language , and is so fresh and classic , that we scarcely think of him as a Norwegian . The Oriental songs of Edward King are healthy and virile , and add variety to our recent product . Sill , Benton , Dr. Powers , Weir Mitchell , Professor Beers , Riordan , S. H. Thayer , W. S. Shurtleff , McKay , Abbey , Duffleld , Blood , Proudfit , Saltus , Tilton , the late Robert Weeks , among our well-known writers of lyrical verse , represent widely different grades of motive and execution . Of the late Henry Work , that instinctive composer of songs ( and their music ) for the people , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satire , and something like that masterhood of current styles for which we still read Frere and Aytoun . Houghton 's " St. Olaf 's Kirk " is a good romantic poem , in the Tennysonian manner , finished with much care . Maurice Thompson 's " Songs of Fair Weather " are well named ; in breezy , out-of-door feeling he is a kinsman of Walter Mitchell , who wrote " Tacking Ship off Shore . " It is chiefly chrough a close observation of nature that the influence of the elder poets , especially of Emerson , is prolonged by the new choir . " Monte Rosa , " Nichols 's long descriptive poem , is a not unworthy counterpart to " The Brook " - for which the late Dr. Wright is held in recollection . The transcendental instinct that follows upon nature 's elusive and spiritual trails , survives in the thoughtful lines of her born communicant , John Albee , whose individuality is none the less apparent . Cheney 's lyrics of nature and emotion have kindred yet distinct traits . McKnight 's volume of sonnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation . Montgomery and " Paul Hermes , " the former avowedly , are inspired by the marvels of the new learning , and find no surer tonic for the imagination than modern scientific discovery . Emerson 's song was a verification of Wordsworth 's faith in the identity of philosopher and poet . Our future imagery will shape itself unconsciously , without much need of a poet 's willful effort , and will be his adjunct and vehicle rather than the object of his aim . Montgomery 's command of rhythm is finely evident , and the young author of " Hermes " seems to have good service within his power . Boyle O'Reilly attests his Irish blood by the verve and readiness of his ballads . He may be more justly claimed as an American than the late Dr. Joyce , whose " Deirdre " fulfilled the promise of a bard who in youth wrote the " Ballads of Irish Chivalry . " Among other and recent Celtic poets of this greater // Ireland , besides Maurice Egan , a sweet and true poet , have been the gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional strains reach a larger audience than that which more studied verse is wont to gain . A Scotch critic , whose resources as our literary historian are confined mostly to periods before the civil war , repeats an old fling at " the plague of American poetesses . " This vieuxgctr*con of letters , if acquainted with their work , might beseech us , like Benedick , not to flout at him for what he had said against them . Our daughters of song outnumber those in England , and some of them , like some of their brethren , have thin voices ; but it is as just as true that much genuine poetry is composed by others , and that , while we have none whose notes equal those of at least one Englishwoman , in average merit they are not behind their fair rivals . Their lyrics , sonnets , ballads , are feminine and spontaneous , and often highly artistic . To be sure , our aspirants of either sex are attempting few works of invention ; where all are sonneteering , it is not strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in discipline and range is apparent also in novels and other prose-work ; they know more than of old , their thought is deeper , their feeling more healthy . The morale of their verse is always elevating ; in other respects it fluently adapts itself to the conventions of the day . Among these sweet-voiced singers , to some of whom I have alluded heretofore , Miss Larcom , with her orchard notes , well retains her popularity . Mrs. Cooke and Mrs. Stoddard are too seldom heard ,  --  each so original , so true in verse and prose to characteristic types . The former 's poetry always has been admired for motive and execution ; Mrs. Stoddard 's , though less in amount , has the condensed power and vivid coloring that render it difficult to mistake the source of anything from her hand . The work of Mrs. Jackson is more smoothly finished , though perhaps it sings the less for its union of intellectuality with a subtle feeling whose intenseness is realized only by degrees . Mrs. Spofford 's various lyrics are rich in cadence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests us both with her theme and its treatment . Her passion is genuine , and unusual resources of diction , color , effect , are brought to play in her poems . Mrs. Fields , the most objective of these writers , veils her personality , except as it becomes revealed by a free rhythmical method , and an obvious inclination toward the classical and antique . The zest , the enchanting glamour , of Northern coast-life are known to Celia Thaxter , our daughter of the isles . Her sprayey stanzas give us the dip of the sea-bird 's wing , the foam and tangle of ocean , soulful interpretations of clambering sunrise mists and evening 's fiery cloud above the main . Mrs. Allen , Mrs. Mapes Dodge , Mrs. Moulton , Nora Perry , Miss Coolbrith and Miss Shinn of California , are natural singers , in their several degrees . The stanzas of Mrs. Moulton and Mrs. Dodge are marked by charming fancy , and always tender and sweet . Miss Perry is an instinctive melodist , with a sure ear for the telling , original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cressid " and " Riding Down . " Our best-known Western poetess , Mrs. Piatt , though often obscure , has traits resembling those of Miss Rossetti ,  --  a vivid consciousness of the mystery of life and death , a conjuring indirectness of style , and a gift , which she shares with Mrs. Dodge , of seeing into the hearts of children . She will not , however , be rightly measured by one who reads the wrong volume of her poems , or the wrong poem . Miss Phelps 's deeply religious nature , warring with its own doubts , leads her on adventurous paths . That she is essentially a poet was evident from her prose , long before she made a collection of verse . She is the modern vine from a Puritan stock , subject to inherited tendencies , but yielding blossoms of feminine grace and aspiration . The names of the late Mrs. Hudson , of Mrs. Bradley , Marian Douglas , Mrs. Sangster , Miss Bushnell , Miss Woolsey , Mrs. Searing , Miss Bates , Mrs. Smith , Miss Bloede , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proctor , Miss Osgood , and Miss Cone , may be cited in a list of those whose notes are pleasi*ntly familiar . Miss Lazarus , to whose translations of Heine I have referred elsewhere , is on her own ground in rendering the Hebrew poets of old Spain ; her minor pieces are written with a firm hand , and her tragedy , " The Dance of Death , " is a work of much power . " Owen Innsley " has gained the favor of those who care for poetry of an artistic type , and Miss Thomas , that delightful confidante , yet betrayer , of the secrets of the nymphs and muses , has given us a volume of great beauty . The " Songs and Lyrics " of Miss Hutchinson , and even more her later pieces , striking for their melody , imagination , and unique sense of design , assure us that if she allots to poetry the devotion that has enriched her work in other fields , its very greenest wreath is at her command . There are still younger voices that give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of the Goodale sisters , artless ditties of the woods and fields , and from which maturer notes are not unlikely to be heard . In the South , we have Mrs. Preston 's works , of an ambitious cast and strengthened by dramatic purpose and expression . Like Mrs. // Webster in England , she may be called a pupil of Browning . Local color , and much suggestion of the far Southern atmosphere and sentiment , are found in the volumes of Mrs. Townsend , of Louisiana . These poets mostly sing for expression s sake , and therefore without affectation . They often excel the sterner sex in perception of the finer details of life and nature . The critic would be a renegade who , after paying his tribute to feminine genius in England , should not r*cognize with satisfaction what has been achieved by his own countrywomen . They have their shortcomings , not the least of which in some of them is that even perfection which is in itself a fault ; but a general advance is just as evident in their poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in honor throughout the English-speaking world . A phase of our verse , illustrating its present station , reflects the new London vogue , and has been mentioned in comparison with Dr. Holmes 's lighter vein . I refer to the plenitude of metrical trifles , society-verse , belles choses in the French forms that are so taking . Various new-comers make their entrance accordingly ; scarcely one but turns you off his rondeau or ballade , and very cleverly withal . Ditties written gracefully , like those of Sherman , Minturn Peck , etc. , are more agreeable than the prentice-work of sentimentalists . A sprightly Mercutio is better company than your juveniJe Harold or Werter . They serve very well , moreover , for the travesties and " satire harming not " of the boulevard press . Our young collegians , of whom Loring , who died in his adventurous youth , was the precursor , are apt at such devices . It is curious to receive the same kind of rhymes from Cambridge , Massachusetts , and Cambridge , England , and Mr. Scollard 's are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without signs of good omen . The line of advance for a poet , who is apt in this way , has been exemplified by the author of " Airs from Arcady . " Bunner s verse , whether of the gayer kind , or rising to the merit of his more ideal lyrics and sonnets , is a hopeful inscription at the parting of the ways . It already commends itself to those who look for feeling under grace , and shows that he , also , can make his standing with the muse depend upon the constancy of his devotion . Before discussing further the latest tendencies , let us see what is doing in those precincts to which we naturally turn for literature of a specific flavor . The South , once so ambitious , has been very barren of poetry during the last thirty years , either mindful of Poe 's conviction that there was no equal chance for her native writers , or feeling that they were too remote from the world to keep up with its progressive changes . I think that standard literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South than here , and oratory there is still more than a tradition . But the South has been unfortunate in the loss of promising writers . One such was Timrod , whose handiwork was skillful and often imaginative and strong . Timrod 's " Cotton Boll " was a forerunner of the method of a still finer poet than he , whose career was equally pathetic . The name of Sidney Lanier brings him clearly to recollection - as I saw him more than once in the study of our la-* mented Deukalion ; the host so buoyant and sympathetic ; the Southerner nervous and eager , with dark hair and silken beard , features delicately molded , pallid complexion , hands of the slender , white , artistic type . The final collection of his writings , with an adequate and feeling memoir by Dr. Ward , confirms me in an already expressed belief that Lanier 's difficulties were explained by the very traits which made his genius unique . His musical faculty was compulsive ; it inclined him to override Lessing 's law of the distinctions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gamut can render possible . For all this , one now sees clearly that he was a poet , and bent upon no middle flight . He magnified his office , and took a prophetic view of its restored supremacy . The juvenile pieces here first brought together , although his biographer apologizes for them , have little in common with ordinary verse of the time . " Nirvana , " " Resurrection , " and the songs for " The Jacquerie , " are such as herald a new voice ; and later efforts of the kind also show his gift unadulterated by meditations on rhythmical structure . Among these are the " Song of the Chattahoochee , " almost as haunting as " Ulalume , " - " The Revenge of Hamish , " than which there are few stronger ballads ,  --  " The Mocking Bird , ' ' " Tampa Robins , ' ' The Stirrup-Cup , ' ' The * and " The Ship of Earth . " But turn to the productions which he deemed far more significant , in view of their composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless might have wrought out something to which these would seem but preliminary experiments . The Centennial cantata was written to be sung , and when rendered accordingly no longer appeared grotesque . We may surmise that the adaptation not of melody alone , but also of harmony and counterpoint , to the uses of the poet , was Lanier 's ultimate design . Nor is it safe to gainsay the belief that he would have accomplished this more nearly , but for his early death and the hindrances of sickness and embarrassment that long preceded it . Compositions suggestive // and reverberant as " Sunrise " and " The Marshes of Glynn " go far toward vindicating his method . Yet even in these there is a surplusage , and an occasional failure to make not only outlines but impressions decidedly clear . " The Symphony , " " Corn , " and other over-praised ventures on the same plan , seem to me nebulous , and often mere recitative . The danger of too curious speculation is suggested by the strained effect of several ambitious failures , contrasted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , didacticism , creeps in by stealth when work upon a theoretical system is attempted . Let critics deduce what laws they may ; it is not for the poet deliberately to set about illustrating them . The formulas devised by Poe and others often are found to suit , designedly or not , their inventor 's personal capabilities . Lanier 's movement to enlarge the scope of verse was directly in the line of his own endowment ; he has left hints for successors who may avoid his chief mistake - that of wandering along in improvisation like some facile , dreamy master of the key-board . That remarkable piece of analysis , " The Science of English Verse , " serves little purpose except , like Coleridge 's metaphysics , to give us further respect for its author 's intellectual powers . Hayne 's vitality , courage , and native lyrical impulse have kept him in voice , and his people regard him with a tenderness which , if a commensurate largesse were added , should make him feel less solitary among his pines . Various Southern poets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , open vistas of the life of their region . Townsend 's ballads , in their sturdy , careless way , speak for the poetic side of a peculiarly American writer , true to memories of a boyhood on " the Eastern shore . " His tales , and the strongly dramatic fiction of Cable , Miss Murfree , Page , Johnston , etc. , more clearly betoken the revived imagination of a glowing clime . The great heart of the generous and lonely South , too long restrained ,  - -  of the South once so prodigal of romance , eloquence , gallant aspiration ,  --  once more has found expression . It enables us to know it , having begun at last to comprehend its true self . That the public is always on the alert for what is both good and novel was illustrated by Bret Harte 's leap into favor with his portraitures of a new and scenic world . His prose idyls of the camp and coast , even more than his ballads , were the vouchers of a poet ; familiar as the verse at once became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The serious portion of it , excepting a few dialect pieces ,  --  " Jim , " " In the Tunnel , " etc. ,  --  is much like the verse of Longfellow , Whittier , and Taylor ; the humorous poems , though never wanting in some touch of nature , are apt to be what we do not recognize as American . But of either class it may be said that it is , like the rhyming of his master , Thackeray , the overflow of a rare genius , whose w9rk must be counted among the treasures of the language . Mr. Harte may be termed the founder , and thus far has been the most brilliant exemplar , of our transcontinental school . Joaquin Miller is , first of all , a poet , if one may judge from the relative merits of his verse and prose ,  --  the latter of which does not show his spirit and invention at their best . The " Songs of the Sierras , " as a first book , was no ordinary production . Its metrical romances , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader . Here was something like the Byronic imagination , set aglow by the freedom and splendor of ( he Western ranges , or by turns creating with at least a sensuous vraisembla ; zce an ideal of the tropics which so many Northern minstrels have dreamed of and sung . Miller still has years before him , and often lyrics from his pen suggest that , if he would add a reasonable modicum of purpose to his sense of the beautiful , the world would profit by the result . Among other poets of the Pacific Slope , Warren Stoddard and Phelps seem more indifferent to local flavor , and refine their work in the usual manner of the Eastern school . Surveying the broad central region of tilth and traffic between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Range ,  --  the most fertile land on earth , and tenanted by a people whose average culture exceeds that of any race numerically equal ,  --  we find it sensitive to music and art , but not yet fruitful of that poesy which , as Sidney declared , alone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely . " The Ohio valley lost two poets ,  - -  one in battle , the other after he had lived to write our most effective ballad of the war ,  - -  Lytle and Forceythe Willson , each of whom had unquestionable lyrical talent . John Piatt , the laureate of prairie and homestead life , has won a just reputation for his reflective and idyllic verse . He has a Wordsworthian sympathy with nature , and knowledge of its forms , and a sincere purpose . He transmits with much simplicity the air and bloom of the prairie , the fire-light in the settler 's home , and the human endeavor of the great inland States he knows so well . Will Carleton struck a natural vein by instinct , in his farm-ballads , and has been rewarded for the tenacity with which he has pursued it . Others , like Venable and Harney , find their way to the households of a rural constituency ; they have the merit of presenting that to which they are wonted - they know whereof they affirm. // John Hay , whose writings are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare experience of " cities , . . . . councils , governments , " as scarcely to have done full justice to his brilliant gifts . With his taste , mental vigor and mastery of style , he may well be taken to task for neglecting a faculty exceptionally his own . The uncompromising dia .. lect-pieces , which made a hit as easily as they were thrown ofi ; are the mere excess of his pathos and humor . Such poetry as the blankverse impromptu on Liberty shows the higher worth of a man who should rise above indifference , and the hindrance of his mood , and in these spiritless times take up the lyre again , nor fitfully touch the strings . In places remote from the literary market , we often discover signs of hopeful energy . The best models are read by isolated poets , whose seclusion the capricious standards of the town oracles fail to influence . Mr. Snider 's " Delphic Days , " for example , a charming idyl in the elegiac distich , was printed in St. Louis , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Dorothy " in England ,  - -  the two being the only prolonged specimens of this measure , if I mistake not , which our language affords . " Agamemnon 's Daughter , " by the same hand , is another contrast to the narrow bounds of every-day song . Leighton 's sterling dramas , " The Sons of Godwin " and " At the Court of King Edwin , " are creditable to our literature . Their romantic themes , by inheritance and the liberties of art ; plainly are within the usufruct of an American poet . A drama of like cast , and successfully adapted to the stage , is " Pendragon , " the work of an Illinoisian , William Young . The department of translation , which ( as well as that of devotional verse ) has been noted in a former article , is at present somewhat neglected , though there are minor contributions by Lea , Peterson , Mrs. Conant , and others . Perhaps the most suggestive of the late efforts in this field are Miss Preston 's charming translations from the Proven9al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rude and elegant by turns , but of interest to those who believe with me that the English accentuate hexameter is on the whole our best instrument for literal and lineal rendering of the classical measure . The translation of Virgil 's complete works , by Wilstach , is more elaborate . It is written in flexible blank-verse , and enriched with copious and scholarly notes and a review of former English versions . This student is now translating " The Divine Comedy , " upon a metrical system hitherto unessayed . Few dialects of our tongue except those of Scotland , Lancashire and Dorset , have been more cleverly handled for metrical effect than 793 those peculiar to the United States . The Atlantic varieties have been used to good purpose , as we have seen , from the time of Fessenden 's " Country Lovers " to that wherein are recorded the exploits of Hans Breitmann . Harte 's and Hay 's successes in a corresponding line increased the popular regard for their better work . Riley 's Hoosier lyrics often are more terse and pointed than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piquant of American folk-songs are in the dialect of our African population , North and South . Stephen Foster , the pioneer of " minstrel " song-writers , whose touching or humorous ditties were wedded to genuine melody , deserves remembrance . A group , with the author of " Uncle Remus " included , has diligently cultivated the art of writing plantation-verse . Mrs. Preston , Sidney and Clifford Lanier , the late Mrs. McDowell and Irwin Russell , Miss McLean , Macon , and many others , have contributed to this quaint anthology , which - at its extremes of humor , as in " Reb'rend Quacko Strong , " or of melody and devotional pathos , as in " De Sheepfol " - certainly is an original outgrowth of the cisAtlantic muse . III . SUCH is a fairly representative list of those to whom our recent poetry owes its being . A protest against so free a range of selection may be entered by some , who fail to consider that for each name here found a score of others could be cited . Doubtless many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary having been made with no design of completeness , but as a sufficient basis for remarks on the weakness , quite as much as on the strength , of our present movement , and on the chances of the near future . At the outset it can be honestly asserted , in behalf of the writers named , that as a whole they do not show less favorably than the corresponding modern choir of Great Britain . It would be difficult to assort them in groups such as we have observed abroad : - apart from local differences of style they bear an almost monotonous relationship to one another . This common likeness , however , is an illusive something which renders their productions American . If their verse presents few absolutely novel types , itis more charged with national sentiment than that of the late English poets . It pays little regard to pseudo-classicism , middleage restorations , and to themes borrowed from other lands and languages . It is sincere and impulsive , and has a New World mode of looking at things and considering them . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both sexes included , is often as inter- // 794 esting for technical merit as that of their distant compeers , although it may be that we have fewer in number who reach a faultless standard . Granting or claiming thus much , a reviewer must put the question directly to his conscience - How does the most of this recent verse impress you ? Upon the foregoing summary , what can one honestly declare of its force and significance ? Its achievements have been noted ; the side on which it is trivial or deficient must be as plainly shown , lest the narrator be forced hereafter to regret that he withheld his convictions . Nor is it easy to gloss over the dynamic insufficiency of our present metrical literature . The belief scarcely can be resisted that there is , if not a decadence , at least a poetic interregnum , as compared with the past and measuring our advance in sundry fields of activity . As I have said , the first influence is ended ; there is a pause before the start and triumph of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation is merely correlative with that observed , ten years ago , in our look across the sea . It is none the less one on which neither our poets nor their countrymen have much reason to plume themselves . If our poetry , since the time of Longfellow , has not kept pace with our general movement , this of itself implies an interregnum . I suspect that it is of less relative importance than if it had held the point already gained . Its new leaders , at all events , are not invested with the authority of those to whom these essays chiefly have been devoted . Their volumes scarcely receive the welcome - nor have they the bearing and import as an indispensable part of literature - that appertained to the " Poems of the Seaside and Fireside , " " Evangeline , " the " Voices of Freedom , " " Snow-Bound , " " The Biglow Papers , " " Under the Willows , " " Poems of the Orient , " and the " Poems " of the Concord sage . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than were " The Raven and other Poems , " " Songs of Summer , " and " Leaves of Grass . " They do not , like some of the books here named , supply either lay or pro .. fessional classes with the most essential portion of their reading . We see that this is partly due to conditions which it is just as well should obtain for a season , and which the poets are not able to avert . Before recurring to this difficulty , let us see how far they are their own bafflers and justly to be held responsible . Some of them have given such evidence of the faculty divine as to be sure of enrolment in the Parnassian registry . Others have composed charming bits of verse ,  --  pledges , as yet unfulfilled , of something larger and more creative . We do not ask for masterpieces , but how few the recent poems which approach in breadth and interest those of the veteran school ! Do our poets really trust their calling , in defiance of temporal conditions , however discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which regards ideality as an amiable weakness , the relic of a Quixotic period , and thus feel half-ashamed of their birthright ? Few of them , at the best , cultivate the latter seriously , as their avowed means of expression ; and of these few the majority perhaps are women . There are some who will be ungracious enough to say that a time when religion and poesy are sustained by the graceful , devoted , but distinctly minor services of women , is not one of supremacy for either the pulpit or the lyre . Those who demur to this , and who refer to the authors of the " Sonnets from the Portuguese " and " Romola , " will be told that Mrs. Browning and George Eliot were forerunners , not exemplars , of a golden era when it shall be no longer true . Even if our poets are doing the best within their power , their misconception of relative values is much the same as that recently noted of the minor English school . To our predecessors the spirit of a work was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . It took years of Keats , Tennyson , and the study of their masters , to rectify this , and then the drift set quite too far in an opposite direction ; until at last a Neo-Romantic group wreaked its thoughts upon details of sound and color , placed decoration above construction , the form of verse above its motive ,  - -  thus missing the impulsive cadence , the more ethereal structure , to which the evasive spirit of poetry mysteriously inclines . Heine ' s assertion , that a poet must have natural tones in his lyrics and characters in his narrative or dramatic efforts , was sustained by the impotency of our own verse-makers before the time of Whittier and Longfellow . With them and their comrades American poetry took on at least the merit of being natural , and gained a foothold ; but this merit is less apparent in our later verse , whose forms , though neatly mastered , breed a temper as artificial as their own . In brief , our lyrics of the past had the virtue of simplicity , but were less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally in poetry 's highest attribute , and their interest is due less to simplicity than to art - the art which , being a substitute for imaginative vitality , runs into artifices and mere technique . Over-refinement , through a strict interpretation of that excellent canon* " Art for Art 's sake , " is a vice of the period . Art is a language , and a seemingly careless workman may be a truer artist than his painstaking fellow . When one has little to say , his technics are a kind of pedantry , while // a faulty poem or picture may be great because a great thought or character is in it . The best workman is he who adapts means to the noblest end , and we tire of those who , with no message to deliver , elaborate their style . The oldest races have discovered that no labor is artistic , unless strictly to the purpose ; a few sure lines , and the result may be attained . We see , however , that technical experts , though devoid of imagination , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because their skill is addressed to the profession rather than to the public , and also because the young recognize the dexterity which they must acquire , while the creative genius of true masters as yet escapes them . Hence the instant vogue of novel forms , requiring adroitness for their perfection , and so elegant as to conciliate even those they do not capture . When real additions to our English method , they will bear use and reproduction . But , after a few men of exquisite talents have employed them to advantage , the public grows weary of modes so peculiar that we are compelled to dwell upon the form and not the thought . Thus we have in view , if not precisely a mob of gentlemen who write with ease , an increased number of those writing with the profusion of ease and the pain of curious labor , and often at a loss of individual distinction . Lyrics , sonnets , canzonets , are produced on every hand . The average is so good that , despite the beauty of an occasional piece , few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Considering the accumulated wealth of English poetry , it is questionable whether more sonnets , etc. , are a real addition to it , and if a place worth having can be earned by polishing the countless facets of gems dependent on the fanciful analysis of love and other emotions . Again , some of our poets , like certain painters , avoid continued effort , and satisfy themselves with sketch.work - a facile way of keeping up expectation . Having mastered one 's vocation , why not practice it with a determined hand ? Too much assurance was the fault of our earlier period , but the ambition that went with it stimulated a few to real achievements . It is hard to account for our easy modern contentment . In older countries the mines have been so well worked that there is an excuse for resorting to the " tailings , ** but here there should be the broadest encouragement for prospectors . No doubt our reaction from the old-fashioned conceit has its effect on able men , and makes them cleave to ground of which they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of one 's limitations . A poet , most of all , should not believe in limitations ; by ignoring them , a few will reach the heights . But our aspirants seem to feel that nothing better can be done than to amuse readers who consider poetry a diversion , and they either fear to put their fate to the touch " to gain or lose it all , " or utterly fail to realize the chance at this moment existing . And so , if poetry has lost its hold , it is to this extent because no brilliant leader compels attention to it , devoting himself to the hazard of arduous and bravely ventured song . The time , then , is not one of transition , save in the sense that all periods are transitional . It is intercalary , yet as well defined as the middle ring of Saturn , gaining its light and substance from a multitude of little quantities ,  - -  notable , in fact , for the profusion and excellence of its minor verse . And here it must be borne in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their main efforts to prose composition . For example , one of the finest elegiac poems of recent years , " The North Shore Watch , " is privately printed by Mr. Woodberry , who thus far has permitted the ordinary reader to know him only as a biographer and critical essayist . Among the chief Victorian writers , we found but two or three that might be classified as novelist-poets . Hood was almost the only journalist-poet of note , a true vocalist , jaded by hackwork . Nowadays , the conditions are reversed , the rhythmic art is more frequently an avocation . Among our novelists , however , Aldrich always seems the poet ,  --  an author with whom song has the precedence . His tales are the prose of a poetic artist and owe to this fact their airy charm . Howells furnishes an instance of the apt recognition of existing tendencies . The wisdom he has displayed " in his generation " goes far to justify the diversion we are observing . His early verse , issued conjointly with that of his friend Piatt , bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the muse or ceased to hold her image in his heart . Otherwise his bent , like Mr. James 's , was that of a critic , scholar , analyst ; and the determined evolution of a masterly novel-writer , from a youth of the qualifications involved , might serve as a text for homilies on the power of the human will . His pen being his fortune , his chosen profession that of a man of letters , he manfully trained himself to the production of literature that he foresaw would be welcome and remunerative ; this , in a series of works ,  - -  at first descriptive , then inventive ,  --  constantly advancing in perception , in management of incident and character , until he now stands where we find him , in the front rank of those who impress observers with a sense of our literary progress . His poetic gift serves him well in translation , dramatic adaptation , and with respect to the feeling and artistic effect // of his tenderest episodes . Waiving discussion of Mr. Howells 's method as a novelist , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done far better for the public than if he had pursued the art that was his early choice ? By such examples more light is cast upon the reduced importance of our song-makers , and ground discovered for a belief that this is transitory and that a fresh departure will anon be made . Fancy and imagination are still rife , but their energy finds vent in new directions . Accomplished craftsmen , some of whom thirty years ago might have been numbered among the poets , now supply the public with its imaginative rations in the guise of prose fiction and romance . Through instinct or judgment , they have occupied the gap in our literature . The time has been opportune ; famous innings were made by the elder minstrels ; our school of fiction had been represented only by a few rare and exceptional names . So keen has been the new impulse , that the young neophyte of to-day , instead of shaping his vague conceptions into rhythm and imitating the poets within his knowledge , longs to emulate the foremost novelists . In the flush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative worth of prose fiction , which , at its best ,  --  as will appear on a brief consideration of the world 's literary master-pieces ,  --  is not a more vital and enduring creation than the poet 's song . Yet the movement has resulted in a decided gain to the prestige of our national authorship . With a staff of novelists and romancers well equipped in both invention and style ,  --  Howells , Aldrich , Julian Hawthorne , Eggleston , Cable , James , Harte , Crawford , Bishop , Lathrop , Mrs. Stoddard , Miss Jewett , Miss Woolson , Mrs. Jackson , Miss Murfree , Miss Howard , Mrs. Foote , and others who also are adequate to cope with the transatlantic experts ,  --  in view of the results already obtained from the field in which these popular authors are so active , none can assume that the diversion of creative energy thus exemplified has not brought with it a measurable compensation . Iv . BOTH exterior and subjective conditions having thus determined the present office of the imagination , the breathing-spell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever when its voice shall be renewed . We shall have more poets yet , and some of those who have been named will contribute , I doubt not , to the hastening of that renewal . They can derive from our fiction itself a shrewd lesson for their guidance . Their predecessors fully met the need for idyllic verse , relating to home , patriotism , religion , and the worka day life of an orderly people . They did not scrutinize , and vividly present , the coils of individual being . Our people have outgrown their juvenescence , tested their manhood , and now demand a lustier regimen . They crave the sensations of mature and cosmopolitan experience , and are bent upon what we are told is the proper study of mankind . The rise of our novelists was the answer to this craving ; they depict Life as it is , though rarely as yet in its intenser phases . Those who , besides meeting Mr. James 's requirement that " the mind of the producer shall be displayed , " do reflect life in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly , of provincial episodes , confined to sections so narrow that it is scarcely needful to linger in them throughout the narrative of a sustained work . Their welcome is partly due to the fact that their studies are bolder and more dramatic than those of the restrained Eastern school . The muster-roll of the latter has increased somewhat more rapidly than its market . We have seen poetry out of demand ; the same thing begins to be observed ofprosefictiori . Renewed attention is given to history , memoirs , travels ; but many signs declare that there never was a time when a live and glowing poet would have a better chance than now . In the multitude of ambitious novelists , distinction is less easily gained . Only the poet can excite the subtlest thrills , the most abiding sensations . The promise of his return lies in the truth that our spiritual nature does abhor a vacuum ,  --  the need insures the supply . Though our public has resorted to prose literature for its wants , it now and then still reads a poem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Asia " - the work of a scholar and enthusiast rather than of a strongly original hand - was of real significance . That production gave a sensuous and legendary idealization of the religious feeling of an impressible body of readers ; it appealed to an existing sentiment ; it focalized the rays in which the faiths of the East and the West are blending throughout the modern world . In short , it was most timely , and it was both attractive and dimensional. 1f then , the people care little for current poetry , is it not because that poetry cares little for the people and fails to assume its vantage-ground ? Busying itself with intricacies of form and sound and imagery , it scarcely deigns to reach the general heart . Your skill is admirable , say the people , and of interest to your own guild , but we ask that it shall be used to some purpose . Convey to us the intellect and passion wherewith poets are thought to be endowed , the gloom and glory of human life , the national aspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Rhythmical productions will be acceptable that compare with those of the past , as vigorous figure-paintings with the canvases of our elder artists . Even in landscape we have reached the stage where human feeling , and that American , pervades the most favored work . Nor will it be enough to depict life in aggregated and general types . Whitman has achieved this , conveying a national spirit in his symphonic echoes of the murmuring towns and forests and ocean-waves . He gives us life and movement , but the specific character , the personal movement , seldom animate his pages . Individuals , men and women , various and real , must be set before us in being and action ,  - -  above all , in that mutual play upon one another 's destinies which results from what we term the dramatic purport of life . Thus rising above mere introspection and analysis , poetry must be not so much a criticism , as the objective portrayal and illumination , of life itself ,  --  and that not only along the uneventful , quiescent flow of rural existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving for intense sensations and continuous development . In other words , the time has come for poetry , in and form , that shall be essentially drama/ic . This kind has rounded each recurring cycle in other literatures than our own . It is a symptom of maturity , and we , in our turn , approach the age when life attains fire and color and is full of experiences that give tone to art . I think that our future efforts will result in dramatic verse , and even in actual dramas for both the closet and the stage . I am aware that this belief has been entertained before , and prematurely ; it was as strong in the time of Tyler and Dunlap and Payne , nor would our own experiments be much more significant than theirs , were it not for the recent and encouraging efforts of our younger authors , several of whom are among the poets already named . Playwrights still feel compelled to offer rudimentary work to their audiences . The primary and denominative element of the actor 's art , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is all in all . The text is but an adjunct to the pantomime . Realism , also , is as conspicuous in our theaters as in the latest French and English novels . It was desirable to get beyond stale and absurd conventionality , yet certain conventions are indispensable Lo art ; there is nothing ideal in a slavish , mechanical reproduction of speech and manners . Unduly favored as the text once may have been , we now err as plainly in the opposite way . A poet turns playwright , and there begins the inevitable conflict with the stage itself . He yields to the conviction of actor and manager that the text will never regain the critical interest of audiences . I make bold to think otherwise ; to hold that belief is to overlook the recorded equipoise of text and action at every epoch when the theater has been preeminent . The sentiment of the hour may be against the production of what are termed literary plays ; yet nothing , after all , is surer to draw than some familiar tragedy or comedy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , it is the same . The people want amusement , and in all times they prefer the best offered ; when there were none but poetic dramas , they sustained them , and intelligently traversed the rendering of dialogue and phrase . On the other hand , wretched mounting and acting will make the finest text wearisome . The whole dispute turns largely upon circumstance and fashion . Notwithstanding Tennyson 's undramatic cast of genius , he has succeeded ,  --  but only , as was predicted long ago , after successive trials and by a four deforce ,  --  in producing an excellent drama . " Becket , " with respect to action , plot , and language , is greatly superior to many plays of the Knowles and Talfourd period , which still hold the stage ; and yet the public , and various theatrical critics , will have none of it . The time has been simply unpropitious . Boker 's " Francesca da Rimini " waited twenty-five years for an actor and a manager fully to utilize its possibilities . We see that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must rise accordingly . The stage reflects these ; but it also can anticipate and help to form them , through works of genius which the people in the end will appreciate . The ambitious playwright , on his part , must realize that his faculty is the greater when adaptable and inventive . Writer , actor , theater and public , must unite to give effect to any drama . Brander Matthews says that , " for a poetic play to have a success , it must be the work of one who is both poet and playwright ; who is , in fact , playwright first and poet after , " - and cites the examples of Moli*re and Shakspere and Hugo , and of lesser men . Playwrights not familiar with the stage from youth have succeeded only after failures . Our dramatists are likely to spring from those who , if not used to theatrical " business " and people , are thoroughly acquainted with town life . We know the retardant effect of society upon artists of exalted sensibility . Liszt 's rival declares that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that Bach 's seclusion and Beethoven 's deafness protected them from outside voices and made them hear the voice of God within . Yet the dramatist , whose theme is human action , must have observed that action under the excitements , and among the contrasted types of // civic life . The increase of our cities itself betokens a change from idyllic to dramatic methods in literary art . But I have allowed my faith in the need of such a change to lead me into surmises concerning the rise of the stage-drama in America . The latter certainly would give a rapid impulse to the former . As it is , a young playwright like Mr. Carleton finds it prudent to adapt his labors to the immediate requirements of the stage , after testing his literary faculty by the composition of a metrical drama , " Memnon , " a work indebted to Elizabethan models in its rhetoric and emblazonry , and not devoid of fine diction and poetic glow . Among the numerous plays offered to the managers , there probably are some of an elevated class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be long delayed . Meanwhile , under existing conditions , our few playwrights who combine tact with refinement ,  --  and Bronson Howard should have the credit due to a pioneer who still works among the foremost ,  --  probably have done the best that could be done , with a sense of what is now practicable , and a hopeful willingness to prepare the way for their successors , poetic or otherwise , in the early future . Time is all that is needed to give us the heroic temper and coadequate themes . Of the two , tradition is less essential to romance and the drama than a favoring atmosphere . The wreath must be held out by a public that delights in the Pythian games , and won by contestants worthy to receive it . v. THERE are questions that come home to one who would aid in speeding the return of " the Muse , disgusted at " the " age and clime . " Can I , he asks , be reckoned with the promoters of her new reign ? Yes , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in truth a poet . To doubt of this is almost the doubt 's own confirmation . That writer to whom rhythmic phrases come as the natural utterance of his extremest hope , regret , devotion , is a poet of some degree . At the rarest crises he finds that , without and even beyond his will , life and death , and all things dear and sacred , are made auxiliary to the compulsive purpose of **iis art ; just as in the passion for science , as if to verify the terrible irony of Balzac and Wordsworth , the alchemist will analyze his wife 's tears , the Linmean will botanize even upon his mother 's grave : " Alas , and hast thou then so soon forgot The bond that with thy gift of song did goSevere as fate , fixed and unchangeable ? Dost thou not know this is the poet 's lot ! " If , when his brain is in working humor , its chambers filled with imaged pageantry , the same form of utterance becomes his tricksy servant , then he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrical faculty , and hunts for theme and motive ,  --  or if his verse does not say what otherwise can not be said at all ,  - -  then he is a mere artisan in words , and less than those whose thought and feeling are too deep for speech . The true poet is haunted by his gift , even in hours of drudgery and enforced prosaic life . He can not escape it . After spells of dejection and weariness , when it has seemed to leave for ever , it always , always , returns again - perishable only with himself . Again he will ask , What are my opportunities ? What is the final appraisement of the time and situation ? We have noted those latter-day conditions that vex the poet 's mind . Yet art is the precious outcome of all conditions ; there are none that may not be transmuted in its crucible . Science , whose iconoclasm had to be considered , first of all , in our study of the Victorian period , has forced us to adjust ourselves to its dispensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though never so determinedly as now . But the poet and artist keep pace with it , even forestall it , so that each new wonder leads to greater things , and the so-called doom of art is a victorious transition : " If my bark sink , t is to another sea . " As to material conditions , we find that the practical eagerness of the age , and of our own people before all , has so nearly satisfied its motive as to beget the intellectual and aesthetic needs to which beauty is the purveyor . As heretofore in Venice and other commonwealths , first nationality , then riches , then the rise of poetry and the arts. - After materialism and the scientific stress , the demands of journalism have been the chief counter-sway to poetic activity . But our journals are now the adjuvants of imaginative effort in prose and verse ; the best of them are conducted by writers who have the literary spirit , and who make room for ideal literature , even if it does not swell their lists so rapidly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing ; our Chattertons need not starve in their garrets ; there never was a better market for the wares of Apollo ,  --  their tuneful venders need not hope for wealth , but if one can not make his genius something more than its own exceeding great reward , it is because he mistakes the period or scorns to address himself fitly to his readers . Finally , criticism is at once more catholic and more discriminating than of old . Can it make a poet , or teach him his mission ? // Hardly ; but it can spur him to his best , and point out the heresies from which he must free himself or address the oracle in vain . Such being our opportunities , we have seen that the personal requirements are coequal , and their summing-up may well be the conclusion of the whole matter . Warmth , action , genuine human interest , must vivify the minstrel 's art ; the world will receive him if he in truth comes into his own . Taste and adroitness can no longer win by novelty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of music ; the same faults are engendered by over-study of either art ; there is a lack of sincerity , of irresistible impulse , in both the poet and the composer . The decorative vogue has reached its lowest grade - that of assumption for burlesque and persiflage ; just as PreRaphaelitism , at first a reform in art , extended to poetry , to architecture , to wall-decoration , to stage-setting , finally to the dress of moonstruck blue-stockings and literary dandies . What has been gained in new design will survive . But henceforth the sense of beauty must have something " far more deeply interfused " : the ideal , which , though not made with hands of artificers , is eternal on the earth as in the heavens , because it is inherent in the soul . There is also one prerequisite upon which stress was laid by Dr. Storrs , in his application to modern art of Goethe 's reservation as to the worth of certain engravings ; " Still , something is wanting in all these pictures-the Manly . . . The pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have said , will make a poet draw ahead of his unstudious fellows , but the resolve born of conviction is needed to sustain the advance . The lecturer rightly declared that only " courageous work will suit America , whose race is essentially courageous and stoical . " Our key-note assuredly should be that of freshness and joy ; the sadness of declining races , only , has the beauty of natural pathos . There is no cause for morbidly introspective verse ,  --  no need , I hope , for dillettanteism ,  --  in this brave country of ours for centuries to come . I think , too , we may claim that there is no better ideal of manhood than the American ideal , derived from an aggregation of characteristic types . Our future verse should be more native than that of the past , in having a flavor more plainly distinct from the motherland . Not that our former contingent misrepresented the America of its time . Even Longfellow 's work , with so much of imported theme and treatment , conveyed a sentiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source . The reason that a decidedly autochthonous kind was not then proffered , unless by Whitman , was that a distinction between the conditions of England and America was not more strongly established . Since the war our novitiate has ended . We welcome home-productions ; our servility to foreign judgment has lessened , and we apply with considerable selfpoise our own standards of criticism to things abroad . We have outlived the greed of a childhood that depends on sustenance furnished by its elders , and are far indeed from the senile atrophy which also must borrow to recruit its wasting powers . Our debt to acute foreign critics is none the less memorable . They , in truth , were the first to counsel us that we should lean upon ourselves ; to insist that we ought at least to escape Old World limitations ,  - -  thefirst to recognize so heartily anything purely American , even our sectional humor , as to bring about our discovery that it was not necessarily " a poor thing , " although our " own . " It is agreed that sectional types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are subsidiary to the formation of one that shall be national . A character formed of mingling components must undergo the phases of defective hybridity ; our own is just beginning to assume a coherence that is the promise of a similar adjustment in art . As local types disappear there may be special losses , yet a general gain . The lifting of the Japanese embargo was harmful to the purity of the insular art , but added something to the arts of the world at large . Even now our English cousins , seeking for what they term Americanism in our literature , begin to find its flavor stealthily added to their own . Nothing will strengthen more rapidly the native bias of our literature than its increase of dramatic tone . Speech , action , and passion will be derived from life as here seen , from factors near at hand and stuff of which the writer himself is moulded . Our playwrights are now encouraged by a copyright royalty . All classes of literary workmen , however , still endure the disadvantage of a market drugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign authors , our blood is most stirred by the consequent injury to home literature ,  --  by the wrongs , the poverty , the discouragement to which the foes of International Copyright subject our own writers . The nerve and vitality of the latter can have no stronger demonstration than by the progress which they make while loaded with an almost insufferable burden . When this shall at last be lifted , their forward movement may answer to the most sanguine conjecture . Of two things they already are assured : First , the perception , the inborn taste , of their countrymen stands in need of less tutorage than that of transatlantic Saxon races . Our people have-blundered from isolation ; confront them // with the models of older lands , and they quickly learn to choose the fit and beautiful , and the time is now reached when the finest models are widely attainable . Secondly , our inheritance is a language that is relatively the greatest treasure-house of the world 's literature : at once the most laconic and the most copious of tongues ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most varied by appropriation of synonyms from all languages , new and old ; the youngest and most occidental of the great modes of speech , steadily diffusing itself about the globe , with no possible supplanter or successor except itself at further stages of maturity ; finally , elastic and copious most of all in the land which adds to it new idioms , of cisatlantic growth , or assimilated from the dialects of many races that here contribute their diction to its own . A language whose glory is that even corruptions serve to speed its growth , and whose fine achievement long has been to make the neologism , even the solecisms , of one generation the classicism of the next . This is the potent and sonorous instrument which our poet has at his command , and the genius of his country , like Ariel , bids him " - take This slave of music , for my sake . " THE twilight of the poets , succeeding to the brightness of their first diurnal course , is a favorable interval at which to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such a time public interest may set in other directions , I have adhered to a task so arduous , yet so fascinating to the critical and poetic student . When the luster of a still more auspicious day shall yield , in its turn , to the recurring dusk , a new chronicler will have the range of noble imaginations to consider , heightened in significance by comparison with the field of these prior excursions . But , if I have not wholly erred in respect to the lessons derivable from the past , he will not go far beyond them . The canons are not subject to change ; he , in turn , will deduce the same elements appertaining to the chief of arts , and test his poets and their bequests by the same unswerving laws . And concerning the dawn which may soon break upon us unawares , as we make conjecture of the future of American song , it is difficult to keep the level of restraint - to avoid " rising on the wings of prophecy . " Who can doubt that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of America now wholly free and interblending , with not one but a score of civic capitals , each an emulative center of taste and invention , a focus of energetic life , ceaseless in action , radiant with the glow of beauty and creative power ? Edmund C. Stedman.
