txt There is no reason to doubt the truth of the report from Washington that Collector REDDEN has sent his resignation to the President , and there is every reason to believe that it was asked for . While he must have long been conscious that his course was giving anything but satisfaction to - the President , he has shown so little sense of the propriety of his position that it is scarcely to be believed that his resignation is voluntary . If he had been a man of any force of character he would long ago have endeavored to administer his office in accordance with what he knew to be the policy and the desire of the President , or he would have declared his unwillingness to do so and given it up . Beyond question the President was deceived . in making the appointment of Mr. REDDEN as Collector by men-from whom he was entitled to expect honest advice . According to the old theory of-the distribution of offices Mr. HUBERT 0 . THorarsort had the highest claim.on this appointment ? and he hopedto get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President refused to give it to him , because of the very nature of his claim and of the estimation in which he was held by those who were anxious for a reform of the civil service . To have appointed . him would have been to belie the principles and professions on which Mr. CLEVELAND was raised to his great responsibility . It was out of the question for him to do it unless he was prepared at once to desert the cause of reform in the public service and fall back into the very depths of the spoils system . Neither did ho wish or intend to appoint any one who would be a dummy for Mr. THOMPSON , but his desire was to select a business man of capacity and integrity who would be efficient in directing what is the most important business ? establishment of the Government , and at the same time faithfully administer the law regulating employment in the classified grades of the service . While he doubtless knew that THOMPSON desired the appointment of Mr. REDDEN , the latter was represented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his appointment was urged by Democrats from this city in whom he felt that he had a right to repose confidence . The fact was , as we pointed out at the time , - that Mr. REDDEN had never held any important position or had any valuable experience as a business man . He was a person of mediocre capacity , little force of character , and was sure to be like clay in the hands of the politicians who exerted them- selves to get the office for him , not because they regarded him as fit - for it-but because they knew they could manage and control him . His weakness made him pliable even to the spoilsmen who hold subordinate place 's in ? he Customs Service . He was practically " run " by the small politicians who surrounded him and who were the puppets of the larger politicians outside the Custom House . It is crediting Mr. REDDEN with , too much positiveness of charactor to say that he had no sympathy with civil service reform and no desire to see it faithfully applied . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no opinions about it . He was simply the obedient tool of those who despised it and wore determined to evade its requirements . All the trouble and scandal that have been produced in the Custom House in regard to examinations and appointments have been due to the fact that the Collector was at once without convictions and without capacity . Even an able politician in his place would have had the discretion to comply to a reasonable extent with the requirements of his position , and if he had been ambitious to make a good . record as an administrative officer he would . have been forced to acknowledge the value of the civil service system in enabling him to obtain competent subordinates . The experiment with T-TTIDDEN has undoubtedly taught the lesson that there is just one way of securing at once an efficient administration of the office and a faithful application of the civil ' service law , and that is by placing the office in charge of a man of high administrative capacity who believes in the law and will have no desire to evade it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of his successor .
