txt THE NEW NAVY . The agreement reached by the conference committee on the conflicting plans of the Senate and the House respecting additions to the fleet at length allows a clear understanding of what the present session is likeiv to produce . To begin with , the general result is an adoption of the Senate 's modifications of the programme proposed by the House . That is to say , instead of the third armored cruiser of 7,500 tons displacement , larger therefore than the Maine and the Texas , which the House desired to construct at the heavy cost of 433,500,000 , the conference committee has preferred the Senate 's three uuarmored gunboats or cruisers of 2,000 tons displacement , at a cost not exceeding $700,000 each , and . the 800 tons practice vessel at $275,000 . This substitution has several merits , of which the most prominent is that instead of a single vessel , which would take many years to build , provision is made , at an aggregate cost of upward of a million dollars less , for four vessels of types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service much sooner . It had been thought by some observers that the solution adopted by the committee would be that of constructing both . the large armored cruiser voted for by the House and the four smaller vessels preferred by the Senate . But the failure to do this indicates that the true objection to the armored cruiser. lies , not in the additional expense , but in the advisability of waiting for greater progress on the Maine and . the Texas before attempting anything further in. this novel form of construction . The production of armored plates suitable for such vessels is practically a new industry in our country , and there will be time enough to arrange for a third and . a fourth armored battle ship when the first and the second are more advanced . On the other hand , at least a dozen additional steel unarmored cruisers and . gunboats of smaller displacements are needed to take the place of the vessels now rapidly going to pieces for ordinary station service . In home and foreign waters we . have six squadrons to supply  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Asiatic , and the apprentice squadron . Besides , there are always vessels needed for special service . It is evident that there must still be many additions to the ordinary cruising vessels in order to keep them up to their habitual numbers when the present wooden craft can no longer be profitably repaired . The increase of the navy , then , agreed upon by the conference committee includes two steel cruisers of about 3,000 tons displacement , to cost not more than $1,100 , - 000 each ; a steel cruiser of about 5,300 tons , costing not more than $1,800,000 ; three gunboats , each of a maximum of 2,000 tons displacement , and of $700 , - 000 in cost ; finall:v , a steel practice vessel of 800 tons for the use of the Naval Academy at $275,000 . These amounts are exclusive of armament and of the premiums provided for securing an increase of speed above the contract requirements . Looking at this array it is seen that no fewer than seven new vessels are provided for , which makes a - creditable session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for the armament of vessels . For construction and armament'together an ag gregate of nearly $6,000,000 is appropri-nearly ated in the bill . If we turn to the details . of the construction called for we see that the standard of speed is raised higher than ever before . The two 3,000-ton vessels must be guaranteed to reach a maximum of at least 19 knots , while the 5,300-ton vessel must reach a maximum of at least 20 knots . The mention of these speeds is sufficient to show that the new vessels are to be of the highest type of modern construction . No speed is specified for the three gunboats. but the Secretary of the Navy , to whose discretion the matter is left , will undoubtedly take care that this also is put on a level with the best foreign performance .
