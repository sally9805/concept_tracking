txt Mr. Blaine 's inflammatory speech at Augusta finds no approvers here , where it has been the subject of a great deal of talk to-day . Everybody critizes it as intemperate and mischievous . Even the colored people see that it is mean in spirit and full of misrepresentations . Mr. Henry C. C. Astwood , Consul of the United States at San Domingo , a Louisiana Republican , and said to be one of Kellogg 's workers , ridicules Blaine 's speech , and says he expects to see the Southern Democrats divided by Cleveland 's election into " Bourbons , " or old style , and " silk stockings , " or progressive men . " The ring men , " he says , " expect to be recognized by Cleveland . but judging from Mr. Cleveland 's action as Governor of New-York I should say they will be disappointed . The silk stockings will come to the front and the best element in the South will reign . " He said he had read Blaine 's speech , and criticised it this way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he think of all that when he voted against the Force bill ? If he had probably he would not have been defeated . No ; the statement that the colored people in the South were not allowed to vote is not true . There is some intimidation in the country districts in the South , but very little in the cities . Certainly , Mr. Blaine has no cause to complain . In the Third Louisiana District he got 5,000 majority , while Kellogg was defeated . The colored people vote as they please . Look at Bisbee 's district in Florida , for instance . I3i6bee was defeated by Republican votes . We form fusions in the South and make trade . The colored people are not generally coerced . In some of the country districts where the white people are as ignorant as the colored  --  you have no idea how ignorant they are in some places  --  there are conflicts , but they grow out of the ignorance on both sides . No , Sir ; the South was not made solid by the Democrats this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stalwarts and supporters of Conkling , Grant , and Arthur . If Cleveland , as President , acts as he did while Governor he will have the support in 1853 of most of the Northern States , but the Southern Democracy will be against him . "
