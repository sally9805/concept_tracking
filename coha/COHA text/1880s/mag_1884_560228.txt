Ip England had ever possessed a constitution in the sense in which that term has in modern times been used in other countries - meaning , that is to say , a written text of fundamental law , distributing and defining the powers of government - it would not be difficult to foretell how changes can from time to time be made in the political structure . But in this sense England has never had but one frame of government that could be called a constitution . This was the political system imposed by Cromwell in the famous instrument that established the Protectorate ; a system that was mainly the product of his own genius . The old monarchy that fell , apparently forever , when the axe descendedupon the neck of Charles I. , survived only as a possible claim in the person of his son , Charles II . While Oliver lived , the Royalists , however numerous and respectable as a party , could only conspire against one of the most vigorous rulers that ever held supreme power in the British isles . If Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his father had prepared for him , England would have gone on with a constitution deliberately framed and capable of such modifications as future circumstances might have required . But Richard , unable on the one hand to control the military chiefs of his own party , or , the soldiery either , or on the other hand to encounter the Royalists , meekly and quietly laid down the power that had descended to him . The Restoration brought back the old monarchy , in the person of Charles II. , without any change in the King 's prerogatives , and without the guarantees that ought to have been required . By a fiction that admirably answered its purpose , the Parliament , which had recalled the King and restored the monarchy , was transformed into the old legislature of the realm , consisting of the Lords spiritual and temporal as one chamber , and the Commons of 547 // England as the other coordinate branches of one supreme legislative power , with the King as supreme executive magistrate , and at the same time as an independent and codrdinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to sanction or reject till acts of legislation . The old frame of civil polity , thus restored , remained after the Restoration substantially what it had been before . It remains the same to this day ; for , notwithstanding the growth of the power of the House of Commons , the rise and function of the ministry , the denial and discontinuance of the sovereign 's power of dispensing with the laws , and all the other reforms or changes of the past two centuries , the frame of government continues to be the sovereign and the two houses of the legislature . And to this day England has no constitution save the unwritten law that has always recognized the several functions of the King , the Lords , and the Commons , as the divisions of the state , founded in and fixed by immemorial usage . As a basis of government , an unwritten constitution may be as good as a written one . In a country where regular government , accompanied by a fair increase of liberty , has existed long enough to make usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groun*l on which to rest the duty of civil obedience , an unwritten constitution is by no means an unsafe basis of a state . But the two kinds of constitutions are essentially unlike . In our sense of a constitution , England never had one before the time of Oliver Cromwell , and it has never had one since his day . It has had nothing but institutions , great and admirable institutions , the growth of more than a thousand years , adapted to the genius and habits of the people , capable of slow and safe amelioration , and affording many most valuable examples of the application of certain divisions in the framework of government , of which we in America have largely availed ourselves . All these divisions of the powers of government are in England nothing but institutions . The House of Commons is an institution ; the House of Lords is an institution ; the sovereign is an institution . Excepting , perhaps , in the initiation of money bills , or bills for raising revenue , the legislative function of the House of Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons . Upon the recognized principles of what is called the British constitution , the House of Commons has no more right to demand the assent of the Lords to a bill than the // Lords have to demand the same thing of the Commons . The House of Commons has no more right than the House of Lords to say that it speaks the will of the nation . The will of the nation is expressed through an act of legislation ; and an act of legislation can not become an expression of that will until it has passed regularly through both houses of Parliament , according to certain forms , and then received the royal assent . Even after a dissolution , when the ministry has appealed to the people on any question arising by reason of the rejection by the Lords of a measure sent up from the Commons , and a majority , however large , has been returned to the House of Commons under circumstances that show clearly that a majority of the constituencies support the ministry upon that very measure , the power and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were before . If a majority of the Lords shall think that the public welfare is really not to be promoted by their concurrence , they have the same right to refuse their concurrence that the Commons have to ask for it . This is the familiar principle that runs through all governments having a dual legislature ; it is what gives value to the distribution of the legislative authority into two chambers . If each of them is not independent of the other , if they are not co*irdinate and equal in power on all matters that are not recognized as constituting fixed exceptions ,  --  as , for example , in reference to money bills , - there is virtually but one chamber , arid the existence of the second one is a form approaching to the character of a farce . If , in any case of serious conflict between the Lords and the Coin . mons , the former think it expedient to give way , they do so ; not because they are destitute of the rightful power to act on their own convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best for them to do in the particular case - whether it is better to allow a measure that they disapprove to become a law , than to have a turmoil in which agitators and demagogues can inflame public feeling against them . When a crisis of this kind arises , it strikes an impartial foreigner as something amazingly inconsistent with the acknowledged principles of the British constitution , and with the theory of all other free governments possessing a dual legislature , to hear the House of Lords threatened with abolishment of their function in the state , because they do not concur in a measure promoted by the ministry of the day , and sent up to them from the House of // Commons . If the House of Lords , with its immemorial rights and powers , as ancient at least as the rights and powers of the Commons , and resting upon the same basis of prescription , exists for any useful purpose , it is as a check on legislation , in order to secure the benefits of wise consideration by an order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure as that by which the members of the lower house hold theirs . Surely , therefore , it can not be anything but an encroachment upon the independent right of the Lords to decide for themselves whether they will concur in a measure , to threaten them and the whole people of Great Britain with what must be a revolution , whenever and however it is brought about , unless they decide a public question in the way in which they are required to decide it by a power that has just the same and no higher function in the state than they have . When one of these conflicts arises , and we begin to hear discussions of the expediency or necessity of abolishing the House of Lords , there are some interesting facts of which all intelligent foreigners are at once reminded , although they do not materially affect the practical questions that will be before the British people whenever the idea of dispensing with the House of Lords shall be seriously entertained . If anything like a separate computation could be made ,  --  beginning with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that Magna Charta secured for their fellowsubjects as well as for their own order , and coming down to the present time ,  --  it might perhaps be found that the English aristocracy , in their capacity of hereditary legislators , have done as much for liberty as has been done by the House of Commons ; and if to their side of the account should be added the good they have done by checking unwise legislation , there would be a very respectable summary of their historical merits as a ruling order in the state . Among these reminiscences , some at least might be found of peculiar interest to us . We might be reminded of the fact that , although the measures that led to the American Revolution were concurred in by a majority of the Lords , it was in the House of Commons that that steady , unfailing , ever reliable power lay , which enabled George III . to misgovern these colonies until he drove them into rebellion . Nay , we might be reminded that for a long while the head and front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all // things relating to America , was a peer of the realm , the excellent , wise , although not very powerful Marquis of Rockingham , of the house of Wentworth . By his side , through good and evil fortune , stood more than one of the peers , heads of the great Whig families , as well as Burke and Charles James Fox . Chatham , though he thundered in the House of Commons against the arbitrary measures of the Government as long as he remained there , and continued to thunder against them in the Lords , was a new man among the peers . The strength of the opposition was in the aristocracy of older creations , followed by a few eminent men in the lower house . But these reminiscences , interesting as they might be , and such a computation of the historical merits of the Lords and the Commons , curious as it might be , would not be of much consequence now . Neither would the illustrious descent of many of the present House of Lords , or the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent creation , or the public services of those who have been created in our day , count for much when the practical question arises , What is to be done with that house ? It may be a longer or a shorter time before the peers will lose their hold upon the respect and confidence of the nation . The snobbish love 4zPf an Englishman for a lord is a good subject for laughter ali over the world ; and undoubtedly there is , among all classes of our transatlantic cousins , a deference paid to rank as rank , that seems to most Americans supremely absurd in a people who are so robust and manly , while at the same time it is not without imitation among some of our own countrymen . But , setting aside what is on the surface merely of the national manners of a people , there never has been a nobility in any country having , as a body , stronger grounds on which to rest its claims to national consideration , or with better grounds on which to rest its peculiar privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as an institution in ages when it was a rude dominant class , turbulent and tyrannical , sometimes loyal , and sometimes disloyal , but always valiant with the virtues and the vices that the feudal system engendered . In the long course of its history , it has had members who have adorned and members who have disgraced their order . This is its condition now . But from the earliest period of its history to the present day , there has been in the ranks of the peerage a progressive improvement in virtue , in public spirit , in conscientious discharge VOL . CXXXIX. - NO. 337. 40 // of all the duties of life , in cultivation and in true nobility of character , quite as marked as that which has taken place among any of the classes that are not connected with it at alL There is , therefore , aside from the mere prestige of rank , and aside from the peculiar position that the old polity of the state assigns to this order of men , a real ground for the solid respect in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . It is a respect that can be forfeited ; but it will not be likely to be seriously impaired by extravagant attacks upon the unquestionable legislative authority of the House of Lords . Still , however , the time may come when all these things will count for very little , and when the question will arise , whether the ancient polity of the realm is to be changed by abolishing or essentially modifying the upper house of Parliament . That question , let it arise when and how it *1 , is interesting and important not alone to the subjects of Queen Victoria . It may well attract not only our attention as heirs of much that is valuable in the British polity , but the attention likewise of all the nations that have the happiness of possessing any tolerable share of self-government , and to whom the science of government is a matter of living concern . Th* nations of Germanic origin owe chiefly to England the modern invention of a dual legislature in its most efficient form . It was an invention , and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin races have not copied it . The Roman Senate , which was an assembly of nobles , never , either under the Republic or under the Empire , had a co6rdiuate and independent colleague in legislation , drawn by representation from the body of the people ; and it was from the Roman Senate that the Latin nations in the Middle Ages derived the idea of a body of legislators , however that idea may have been modified among them by some of the Gothic or the Frankish institutions . At what precise period the old Witenagemote , or grand council of the Anglo-Saxon kings , became separated into two distinct houses , historians can not tell us . But at some period the separation became complete ; and when it had become so , the advantage of a legislature composed of two codrdinate branches of equal authority was attained . One of these bodies became an assembly in which men sat as representatives of shires or boroughs , by virtue of an election made by electors whose prescriptive right to he so represented was acknowledged by all the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which men sat by virtue of a patent of nobility granted by the Crown , which vested the right so to sit in their male descendants , according to seniority of birth . This is equally a right acknowledged by everybody . The hereditary principle , as a source of a right to discharge some public function of government , may be , both theoretically and practically , very poor , compared with some form of selection of the individual in which the people can have a voice . But in a country where the hereditary principle prevails in the designation of the head of the state , its extension to some other part of the government introduces nothing to which the nation is unaccustomed . In England the hereditary right of certain men and their male descendants to be summoned to and to sit in Parliament is as old as the right in one particular family to wear the crown and to sit on the throne . Both of them are fixed institutions , and just as much established in the fundamental law of England as is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the acres that he tills , or the right of any Englishman to the money in his pocket . On the merits of any particular measure on which the House of Lords has ever differed , or shall differ , with the House of Commons , it would not become a foreigner to express an opinion . It may relate to an extension of the elective franchise , orto anything else . It is of no consequence to the world at large whether the Lords are justly or unjustly treated when their opposition is imputed to selfish motives or to narrow prejudices . How far they shall carry their opposition , when and how they ought to yield , are matters on which no foreigner 's judgment is worth the paper on which it may be printed . But when the question arises , either out of vindictive feeling or in cool calculation of what is expedient , whether the House of Lords as a branch of the British legislature shall be destroyed , the whole civilized world may be said to have an interest in what is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the principle of two legislative chambers is involved in the system of English parliamentary government , and from the further fact that England possesses no means of founding a safe and efficient second legislative chamber if the House of Peers is to be done away with . The British nation , if not now , may at some time be brought face to face with the question whether they will try to get along with a single legislative body . * To this complexion must it // come at last , " if they do away with the House of Lords , unless they can find a different and a better basis on which to found a substitute that will continue to give them the advantages of a dual legislature . For this reason , what we in America have done , how we came to do it , and how we did it , are inquiries worthy of their attention . These inquiries are important to Englishmen , not because our republican model is capable of imitation in a country of monarchical and aristocratic institutions , or because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility . What has been done in America , and the ultimate reasons for it , are inquiries valuable to Englishmen , because they may help them to see how impracticable it is for them to follow our example . There is but one aspect in which our example is an important illustration of a general principle ; this is the recognition , by the Constitution of the United States and by all our State constitutions , of the supreme expediency of a dual legislature . In framing our national Constitution , which has now almost completed its first century , we were perfectly free to adopt the plan of a single legislative chamber , or to follow the English model , which , with one or two exceptions only , had been adopted in all our thirteen States before the Constitution of the United States Was made . In fact , most of our colonial and provincial governments , before the Revolution , had been framed upon the plan of two chambers . But it was not solely or chiefly because of the ancient habit , that the framers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question as an original one , as one of great consequence in the science of government , both theoretically and practically . There was but one important man among them that preferred a single chamber . Franklin , in holding this opinion , was influenced in some degree b'y the fact that Pennsylvania , of which he had long been a citizen , and of which he was then President , had until then a single legislative body . He also favored a plural executive , and was opposed to a salary for the chief executive office . But these opinions were shared by none of his colleagues in the convention . The plan of a dual legislature for the United States was adopted by a most decided predominance of the conviction that two chambers , acting as equal checks upon each other , are essential to wise and safe legislation . But when we come to consider the respective bases of our two houses of Congress , and especially when we observe the nature // and form of the representation in the Senate , we shall see , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the circumstances of our situation afforded the means of constrncting a Senate on a principle of representation very different from that which was to be given to the other house of Congress , and on the other hand how impracticable it would be in England to attempt to find a basis for a senate , if the Honse of Lords is to be abolished or materially modified . In the United States no aristocratic institutions existed , no recognized social ranks , no masses of landed or other property , that could be made the basis of peculiar representation in a Senate . The eqnality of all white men before the law was the condition of society everywhere . The pecnliar arrangement i*y which the slaves in certain States were allowed to be connted in a certain ratio , in computing the population of the States to be represented in the lower house , was not adopted for the Senate becanse the representation in that was not to be based on population . As it could not be based on property , a peculiar and , for America , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the necessity for introdncing into some part of the Government a recognition of the federative character of the proposed political system . The separate sovereignties of the States , which were to remain nnimpaired save in so far as their people were to cede to the central Government certain powers of a specific character and of national concern , afforded the means of establishing an equal representation of the States in the Senate , without regard to their extent of territory , the amount of their population , or their comparative wealth . A second legislative chamber was thns secured , the seats in which are held , not by popular election as in the ilonse of Representatives , but by appointments made by the State legislatures . Had this necessity for recognizing the federal principle in some part of our Government not existed , the Senate of the United States , * it had been formed at all , must have been founded on some other basis . But there was no practical basis but this ; and no American of any intelligence will be disposed to doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish such a mode of representation in the chamber that nearly all of them believed to be of the utmost importance , were a most fortunate and peculiar concatenation . No American would listen for one // moment to a proposition to do away with our Senate because , on any occasion or any subject wliatever , it has chosen to exercise its undoubted prerogative of independent action upon anymeasure sent to it by the other house of Congress . Disagreements between the two houses are of constant occurrence . If committees of conference can not reconcile the conflict , the measure falls quietly to the ground . No one complains that the Senate sets itself in opposition to the popubir will . Everybody knows that the Senate exists for the purpose of encountering the popular will when it deems it necessary to do so . But no suitable materials exist in England for the construction of a new chamber to take the place of the House of Lords . Let us suppose the whole people of England - or for that matter the whole people of England , Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention composed of the wisest and ablest representative men of all ranks and conditions . There is to be no violence , no public commotion , nothing but a calm and deliberate consideration of what can be done to modify the old civil polity of the realm . The question that is to be considered is twofold : flrst , whether there shall be but one house of ParI*iament ; and secondly , if there are to be two , what substitute for the House of Lords can be found ? On the first question the deliberation will not be long , if the nation or its representative men shall pay due heed to their own history and experience ; for these will teach them that a House of Commons , under the guidance and influence of any minister whatever , sometimes needs to be checked by a body of equal authority . If the day shall ever come when the people of the British isles shall seriously consider whether they will do away with the monarchy and establish a republic , the question of a double legislature will still confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchical or republican , the advantages of two legislative chambers , and the disadvantages of one , will remain the same . It may safely be assumed , therefore , that the British people will never imitate the example of those countries that have had , or those that now have , but a single legislative body . It is of the very genius of parliamentary government as it has been practiced in England for many centuries , that before any measure can become the law of the land it must be submitted to the independent judgment of two bodies differently constituted ; and considering that a law enacted by Parliament is both law // and constitution ( for such is the " omnipotence " of Parliament that its acts never have to be or can be subjected to any test of their constitutional validity ) , it is of the utmost consequence to the liberties of the people that the legislation which they must obey shall be passed upon by more than one body of legislators . Whether an aristocratic assembly is a better guardian of the liberties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract question , of no great moment . Practically , the peers of Great Britain have not , in general , been less careful of the liberties of the people than the Commons . Of what , then , shall the substitute for the House of Lords be composed ? Confining the view at present to the three kingdoms over which Queen Victoria reigns , two plans may be suggested as alternatives : first , to make a smaller body than the present House , by some mode of electing representative peers from the whole number of those now having the right to sit in Parliament ; secondly , to adopt the counties , or some other territorial divisions , as the basis of a new chamber , and let the seats be filled by popular election , distributing the seats by some fixed rule . The first of these plans would gain nothing but a reduction of the number of members of the new senate ; for , however the choice might be regulated , the persons chosen would still be members of an aristocratic order , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would remain in full force . It might , too , be a very serious question whether , if the aristocratic character of such an assembly is to be preserved , there would be any real advantage in reducing its numbers . The arrangements that were made at the union between England and Scotland , limiting the number of Scottish peers to be admitted to seats in the Parliament of Great Britain , and the corresponding limitation of Irish peers established when the Parliament of Ireland was discontinued and that kingdom was admitted to representation in the Parliament at Westminster , were made in order to adjust the representation so as to satisfy the English peers and people , and to prevent the relative weight of England from being unduly reduced . But in any new plan for constituting a chamber to be composed of English , Scottish , and Irish peers , however the relative claims of the three kingdoms might be adjusted , and whatever might be the whole number of representative peers , the assembly would still be aristocratic , founded on the principle that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is expedient to assign a distinct power in the Government by reason of their birth and social position . The second of the plans above suggested brings into view the total absence of all analogy between the English or the Scottish or the Irish counties and the States of the American Union , as a basis on which to found a second legislative chamber . In Great Britain or Ireland , a county is a territorial division in which , whl*tever rights of local self-government the inhabitants exercise , they hold and exercise at the will and pleasure of Parliament . As a territorial division of the kingdom , they hold no reserved rights under their own absolute control , and therefore it would be impossible to construct a legislative body for the whole kingdom , or for the three kingdoms , in which the principle of a federal union could be introduced . It would be a very easy matter to take the English counties , or any other territorial division arbitrarily selected , and provide for a representation of the inhabitants in a second chamber , throwing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other class of men . The same arrangement could be extended to Scotland and to Ireland . But such a chamber would Jear no resemblance to the American Senate , and could not have its advantages . It would be like the senates of our State legislatures , nothing but a double representation of the people of a certain territorial division , chosen by the same electors who choose the members of what is called the popular branch . Even if the suffrage for this kind of senate is restricted , it is still a representation merely of a certain number of people , unless property is in some way introduced into the basis . In the Senate of the United States , the representation is not a representation of numbers of inhabitants , or of property or comparative wealth . It is an equal representation of sovereign political communities , which hold an independent right of selfgovernment in all matters not comprehended in the grants of power that their people have made to the Government of the United States . No imitation of this system is possible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland rules over a vast empire extending into various quarters of the globe , and for some purposes the Parliament at Westminster governs great dominions beyond the seas that surround the isle on which it sits . Extending our hypothesis , therefore , for a moment , to a // broader view , let us consider another theory . The people of the three kingdoms , of all classes , might be very willing , for imperial purposes , to make a new second chamber in Parliament , into which should be admitted representatives of any or all of the colonies or dependencies . But what would the people of England , Scotland , or Ireland say to permitting a representative , peer or commoner , from Canada or India or Australia or the Cape Colony , to legislate on matters domestic to England or Scotland or Ireland * Of course it would be out of the question . They might be willing to allow any British subject , wherever born , to represent an English , Scottish , or Irish constituency whose votes he could gain for a seat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber that they might devise ; but his vote would be the vote of his constituents , and if he did not represent an English , Scottish , or Irish constituency , but only a distant portion of the empire , his vote could be permitted only in matters affecting his real constituency . It is only necessary to touch upon this difficulty , in order to see how vast and complicated is the problem that will be before the British people whenever they approach the question of finding a substitute for the House of Lords . As things are now and have long been constituted , the members of that House hold their seats upon the theory that the good of the state is best subserved by admitting to a distinct power in the Government a certain order of men . It is not a theory that any people would deliberately adopt in the present *ge of the world , if they were at the same time to create de novo the aristocracy that was to be admitted to hold and exercise the power . But the British aristocracy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an institution as old as anything in the condition of the English people of which we have any certain knowledge ; and whether the time has now come , or is near at hand , or is in the far distant future , when the theory of its position in the state must undergo revision and perhaps rejection , the statesmen and people of Great Britain will have to remember that , in finding a substitute for the House of Lords , they must do one of two things . They must have a parliament or supreme legislature in which , as now , the members of both houses will have the right to vote on domestic and imperial matters alike , or they must contrive some mode of introducing a distinction . At present , the law of England knows no such distinction . A peer of the realm sitting in the // upper house , and a commoner sitting in the lower , legislate for the people of Great Britain and Ireland , and for millions in other lands , without the smallest difference of power ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . The time may indeed come when all the dependencies of the British Crown in other quarters of the world will one by one be finally severed from it ; but at present the commercial greatness of England is bound up in the maintenance of its imperial interests and authority , and , so far as human speculation can penetrate the future , the time is very remote when the legislation of England will be confined within the limits of the three kingdoms . When that colossal power has shrunk to those dimensions , there will be less embarrassment in the work of constructing a frame of government that is to take the place of the one that exists today . Whenever that time comes , unless the nature of man has undergone a great change , it will still be found that a dual legislature is the best of all the forms of parliamentary government , although it may be possible to do away with the aristocratic and hereditary element . In the discussions in England during the past summer , a radical orator threw out a suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether put out of the way , which he would greatly prefer , its power in legislation might be curbed . He did not explain how , but apparently his meaning was , that the Lords might be allowed to take one vote upon a measure sent up to them from the Commons , and then if they rejected it the Commons should be authorized to give it , by a certain majority , the same force that it would have if it had been regularly enacted by both houses . This would be something like what we in America call passing a bill over a veto ; that is to say , when one of three co*5rdinate branches of the legislative power - namely , the executive - has refused assent to a measure , the other two may enact it into law by a certain majority of votes . If I have rightly guessed the orator 's meaning , he would have the sovereign and the House of Commons together make a law that the Lords have once refused to make . By what process the fundamental law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hard to say . One can understand what happened when a powerful leader , taking a file of soldiers , entered the chamber of the Parliament , and pointing to the mace on the table told his men to " take away that bauble , " then turned out the members , locked // the door , and put the key in his pocket . Short of that , however , or of some similar process , one can not understand how the peers of Great Britain , unless they adopt a most remarkably selfdenying ordinance , can be shorn of their equal authority in the enactment of laws . Whenever the question here touched upon shall arise , it will be fortunate for the nation if it comes to a solution iu the life of Queen Victoria . Her Majesty is thoroughly versed in the constitutional history of her kingdoms , and there can be no doubt that her advice upon any matter involving a radical change in the structure of the government would have great influence with her people . It can hardly be that the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council entitled to shape the ordinary measures of government , would be held to extend to changes in its fundamental structure so as to oblige the sovereign to remain passive , or to neutralize the influence of the Crown , or to entitle the ministry of the time to use that influence in promoting such a change . The theory and practice of executive administration , which has prevailed for a long time , is , that the leading men of a party that commands a majority in the House of Cpmmons are to be accepted by the sovereign as ministers . In all ordinary measures of government and legislation , the ministry is held to be entitled to shape the public business , and to assume that the assent of the Crown is or will be given to whatever the ministry propose . But this function of a ministry has never been held to extend to such a change in the structure of the government as the abolition or reconstruction of the House of Lords would obviously be . There has never been an occurrence that would stand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry were officially to undertake to promote such a change . However great might be their following in the House of Commons , they would have to act in such an undertaking as individuals , and they could not act as a ministry entitled to speak for and represent the Crown . The sovereign would be entirely at liberty to differ with her constitutional advisers , and to make the difference known . In Queen Victoria , her subjects of all classes would , on such a matter , have an adviser that would be disinterested , unless the proposed change should in some way involve the hereditary principle in relation to the Crown , as well as in relation to one of the houses of Parliament . If this should be the case , a revo // lution would be impending in which the sovereign would be forced to make common cause with the peers . But the probability of this is very remote . The nation is not likely to surrender a constitutional monarchy , or to impair the principle of the hereditary descent of the Crown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the hereditary principle shall be abolished in that branch of the legislature in which it has so long existed , it will , in all probability , arise and be treated as an independent question , in which the rights and interests of the royal family will not be otherwise affected than as the aristocratic basis of the House of Lords is supposed to be one of the great supports of the throne . But it is quite possible to conceive , if a way could be found to bring it about peaceably , that the aristocratic and hereditary basis of the House of Lords could be removed without weakening the throne ; for in England , and in a few other countries , the essential idea of a constitutional monarchy does not necessarily embrace an aristocratic or hereditary element in the legislature . In almost any conceivable form , therefore , in which the question of finding a substitute for the House of Lords can be anticipateq to arise , the nation would be likely to look to the present Queen , if the question should arise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifling dissatisfactions they may have had with her , they know her to be a patriotic and able sovereign , devoted to the welfare of her people . And throughout the civilized world , wherever there is a lover of mankind , wherever there are persons enlightened enough to know how the prosperity and happiness of the British nation affect and must affect the welfare of the human race , the hope will not cease to be entertained that they may be spared from violence , and that all useful changes in their political and social condition may be brought about peacefully .
