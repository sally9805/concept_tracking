txt The attention of Gov . Cornell was to-day directed to the reports of the meeting held in New-York Friday night to protest against his veto of Mr. Duguid 's bill exempting mutual benefit associations from the operations of the insurance laws . While the Governbr did not give the impression that he was at all alarmed at what might be the political effect of the veto , he was evidently annoyed because there was apparent in the tone of the meeting an ignorance of the provisions of the bill and of his veto message for which there could be no good excuse . In a conversation on the subject , quite free and frank on the Governor 's part , he said that he considered the mutual benefit associations organized in this State , including the brotherhoods of railroad men , telegraph operators , printers , commercial travelers , and others , who are associated together as fraternities which are honorably binding are deserving of encouragement . His opposition to the bill arose from a desire to keep out of the State organizations which were started for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are under control which they desire to avoid here . There is a strong feeling of resentment developing among the different societies in the State , and an effort is being made to induce members of the Assembly to vote to override the veto . A story in circulation , that is most effective in stimulating this desire to rebuke the Governor , is that Deputy Superintendent McCall , of the Insurance Department , prepared the bill introduced by Mr. Husted , and afterward hastily killed by him , requiring all benefit associations to comply with the Insurance law , exacting $100,000 deposit as security before a company can do business , and that he de : clared it must pass . Mr. McCall 's alleged failure is ? somehow connected with the Governor 's veto . Whether that was Mr. McCall 's purpose or not , it is a fact that the Governor knew nothing about it , but vetoed the Duguid bill , believing that if it were allowed to become a law the benefit associations , which are just as well off as they were a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irresponsible foreign associations which would seek victims in this State in perfect security that they could not be molested or punished by the authorities . A few days ago a committee of the State Board of Health , consisting of the Hon. Erastus Brooks , Dr. Elisha Harris , and Dr. J. Savage Delavan , visited New-York and made a tour of investigation to discover the causes of the much-complained-of effluvium nuisances arising from fat rendering , refining , and bone boiling and burning establishments in and near the City . The committee finished its report this week and submitted it to the Governor . Gov . Cornell , after a careful examination of the report , became satisfied that the manufacturers had neglected the possible and necessary precautions to prevent the offensive odors which are created by their processes of manufacture , and decided to exercise his authority and suppress them . The necessary authority is conferred by chapter 322 of the Laws of 1880 , section 8 of which is as follows : SECTION S. At any time the Governor of the State may require the State Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of life and health in any locality , and in such case the said board shall have all necessary powers to make such examinations , and it shall report the results thereof to the Governor within the limits of time which he shall prescribe for such examination and report . The report of such examination . when approved by the Governor , shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State , and the Governor may , in relation to the matters or things found and certified by the State Board of Health to be nuisances , declare them to be public nuisances , and order them to be changed as he shall direct or abated and removed . Any violation of such an order shall be held and punished as a misdemeanor , and thereafter the Governor may , by his order in writing , certified under his official seal , directed to the officers of the county in which the said nuisance shall be situated , require the District Attorney . the Sheriff , and the other officers of every such county to take all necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor . In sending the report of the State Board of Health to the Senate , Gov . Cornell , in order to make its recommendations effective , accompanied it by a proclamation requiring the abatement of the nuisances complained of before June 1 , 1881 . Neglect to obey the proclamation will be followed by a presentation of the complaint to the District Attorneys in the counties in which the nuisances are found , and . this complaint will have the same force as the presentation against the authors of the nuisances by a Grand Jury . The proclamation is as follows : Whereas the State Board of Health having been required by me , pursuant to law , to inquire into certain alleged nuisances dangerous to life and detrimental to public health existing , as complained , in or about New-York City , and the said State Board of Health having duly reported that such nuisances , as alleged , do exist , and that they are produced by the neglect to-control and properly convey away or destroy various offensive waste materials in the business of refining petroleum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning , and like operations , done and conducted near or upon Newton Creek , in the Counties of Kings and Queens , Long Island , or thereabouts , to the i detriment of the health and comfort of the nhabitants affected thereby ; now , therefore , all persons , companies , or corporations owning , superintending , managing , or in any manner engaged in refining petroleum , and in the movement and storage of the products thereof , or who transport , keep , or use the substance known as sludge acid , and whoever owns or manages any premises or apparatus used for mixing , manufacturing , or storing superphosphate or phosphate fertilizers in which sludge or sillphurm acid is employed , and whoever owns , carries on , or manages any of tile works or apparatus for fat rendering , bone boiling , or other process for utilizing waste or putrid animal matter , or otherwise engages in the manufacture of ammonia and its salts or other products complained of and reported by the said Board of Health to be nuisances against health by this proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1880 , takd notice that it is hereby ordered that the causes of the nuisance before mentioned and described be by each and all of them as it may belong , prevented , removed , or abated on or before the 1st day of June . 1881 , as connected with or produced by any premises or business controlled or managed by them in singular or several ; and in case of the neglect or failure so to do by the time herein specified , official action necessary for the speedy removal and prevention thereof will be taken , in pursuance of the law in such cases made and provided , in the name of the people , for the removal , abatement , or prevention of a nuisance against the public health .
