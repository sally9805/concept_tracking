txt The announcement has been made that the New-York Central Railroad is refusing to renew its contracts for special rates for the transportation of freight , which expired on the 30th of April . ? This was followed almost immediately by the report that " representative 's of the business interests " of some of the cities in the western part of the State were on the way to ' Albany for the ? purpose of opposing the passage of the Anti-discrimination bill in the Senate . These men undoubtedly represent their own business interests , which have enjoyed the advantage of special rates at the expense of other business interests which have not been so favored . Their motive for going to the capital to influence legislation is quite transparent . Their gratitude for favors past is inspired by a lively sense of favors to come , in case the bill is defeated , while , if it becomes a law , they can suffer no disadvantage except that of being put on an equal footing with their competitors . The business interests of Rochester and Syracuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profited by special rates , and the business interests of the State of New-York are still more extensive than those of any particular locality . It is for the Legislature to consider the claims of the whole people , rather than those of a favored few who desire still to be favored at the general expense . The statement that the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad is not renewing its time contracts for special rates is not true , but if it were , there would be nothing in the fact to prevent its continuance of the policy of secret discriminations , or the making of new contracts at any time and to any extent , whenever the way seems to be clear . The fact that it is continuing its efforts to defeat the pending bill shows that there is no intention of abandoning that policy unless on compulsion . The reported refusal to renew contracts at this time , and the attempt to create the impression that it is working injuriously to trade in certain localities , are plainly intended to give new vigor to the interested opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which certain Senators are only too anxious to have for voting against it . That the business interests of Rochester or Syracuse , or of Buffalo or Utica , are to be harmed by giving their merchants equal terms and facilities for the transportation of goods is too absurd for belief , unless they have been so generally favored as to enjoy substantial advantages over competing localities . In that case , the other localities have a right to consideration . For railroad managers to determine what persons or places shall have advantages for profitable business , and to take upon themselves the task of regulating the development of trade , is an interference with the working of salutary laws which can only result in a general injury . And yet , by their own confession before the Hepburn committee , that is what for a long time they have attempted to do . Having largely got rid of competition in their own operations , they have endeavored to elimnate it from the business that is dependent upon them for important facilities . The result has been that all have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pay full rates have been unable to compete with those who were charged less , localities that have had no share in the fostering policy of the New-York Central or . the Erie Road have languished while others were " built up , " and the State of New-York has been hampered in its own markets in order that Western States might flourish at its expense . The notorious facts in regard to the iniquities of discrimination and special rates have become too familiar to need reiteration , and the simple issue between the people as a whole and a combination of the railroads and their favored customers should no longer be . obscured . Argument on this subject has been wellnigh exhausted , and there is no room for doubt as to the character of the opposition to the measures for bringing the business of transportation under wholesome regulations . It is not expected that the Senate will defeat these bills out of any consideration for the public . interest . The influence of the railroad companies and the substitutes for argument which they have found to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied on . These corporations still have their continGent of members in that branch of the Legislature , whom they own , body and soul , and there are others the way to whose convictions they are quite familiar with . Public sentiment and public interest they know to be wholly on one side , and their object is to overcome the influence of these on the minds of a sufficient number of Senators . They have an advantage in the undivided possession of the head of the Railroad Committee , but a majority of that body and of the Senate are likely to remember that they have the people of the State to reckon with , and that they will be held responsible for the discharge of a duty to the public and not to the railroads . It is our belief that the ' railroads will not suffer by the passage of the bills which are the fruit of the laborious investigation of the Hepburn committee . Whatever is for the benefit ot the industrial interests of the State must be for their benefit , and those interests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound up with , those of transportation from points beyond the State to the chief commercial city of the country . But there is an important principle involved in this controversy , and the railroads have seen fit to array themselves against the public demand in regard to that . The principle is that of State control and regulation over the business of transportation which derives its privileges and opportunities from the authority of the State . It is not only the right but the duty of the State to see that the franchises which it grants are not abused and employed under its own protection to work injustice to the people . This principle is destined to triumph . Its practical assertion has been demanded by the people , and by both political parties through which the members of the Senate obtained their election . It remains to be seen whether they will . dare to disregard that demand at the dictation or the corrupt solicitation of a single corporation .                    @
