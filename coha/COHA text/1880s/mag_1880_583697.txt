JAPANESE AND CHINESE STUDENTS IN AMERICA . FOR a score of years , the Japanese government has been accustomed to send a few of its young citizens to the schools of foreign nations . The first delegation entered Holland in 1859 , and engaged in the study of law , navigation and shipbuilding . Before the year 1873 , about two hundred Japanese students had studied , under the care of the home government , in Germany , Russia , Austria , England , France , Italy , Switzerland , Belgium and Holland . At the present time the number of government students residing in European countries hardly exceeds a dozen . The majority of this number have already been graduated at college or university ; and some of them are now engaged in the study of the military arts . Several private students are connected with the schools of England , France , Italy and Germany . The first delegation of Japanese students* that entered the United States landed at Boston , in i868 . In the course of the succeeding five years , at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the schools of the Eastern States , of Pennsylvania and of the city of Washington . In the present year , about seventy are members of American schools and colleges . A third of the number are connected with institutions of the Western and Pacific States ; and the remainder are enrolled in Eastern schools . Six-sevenths* of the entire body , however , are private students , and , as such , bear no direct relation to the home government . Only nine are under the care of the educational department of the empire . The extent and the variety of the past and of the present work of the ordinary Japanese student in // American institutions are succinctly indicated in the following extract from a letter of Tanetaro Megata , the Japanese Commissioner of Education in this country , in reference to his government students : " Two of them were graduated at Boston Law School , and are studying the practice of law . One of them was graduated at Cambridge Law School , and is also studying the practice in New York . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree from the Yale Law School , where he is studying now . Three of them were graduated at Columbia School of Mines , and they are studying the branch by practical investigation there . Two of them were graduated at the Polytechnic Institute , Troy , N. Y. , and are studying now practically . " The Chinese students in America are more in number than the Japanese , and , as a body , they are under the supervision of native officers residing in this country . Near the beginning of the decade just closed , - August , 187i ,  --  the Chinese government determined to educate a corps of its young citizens for its service . In the foreigners employed in conducting its international relations , in collecting its customs , in commanding its armies and ships of war , it had failed to find public servants of that efficiency it desired . It also realized the propriety of employing its own subjects for the performance of its official work . By the persuasion , therefore , of Yung Wing , * at present the associate Chinese minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * As the head of the Chinese educational mission in the United States , a brief sketch of the life of Yung Wing should be presented . Born in Southern China , in 1828 , lie spent several years of his boyhood in the schools conducted by Christian missionaries . In 1847 , under the charge of Rev. S. R. Brown , an American missionary , he came to this country , entered an academy at Monson , Mass. , and , after two and a half years spent in preparation , was admitted to Yale College in 1850 . Repeatedly during his college course he won prizes for English composition , and also contributed several papers to the press which attracted much attention . At this time he conceived the idea of the educational mission which is now in process of realization . Soon after graduation he sailed for China . For sixteen years he was engaged in work both public and private , but throughout this time he nursed his schenie , and was constantly watching for an opportunity to forward it . This opportunity occurred in 1870 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The disadvantages under which the Chinese commissioners labored , in settling the sad affair with foreign powers whose subjects had been murdered , allowed Yung Wing to press his scheme very forcibly upon the attention of the government . At last he was successful . He was at once appointed the chief commissioner of the mission , an office which he still holds , notwithstanding his recent promotion to the position of associate minister , with Chin Lan Pin , in the United States . citizens for those pursuits which it had hitherto been obliged to intrust to Americans and Englishmen . A million and a half dollars was appropriated to the execution of the scheme . Advertisements were placed in the Chinese papers , requesting all boys who wished to go to America to spend fifteen years in study , and , on returning home , to enter the service of the government , to assemble at Shanghai . About a hundred complied with the request . For several months they pursued the study of the English and Chinese languages ; and at the conclusion of the allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance were selected . They at once embarked for America . The selection of this country was founded on the preference of Yung Wing . He could have procured the establishment of the mission in either England , France or Germany ; but his regard for America and American colleges and schools persuaded him to establish it in this country . In each of the three years succeeding the departure of the first body of students , thirty additional students embarked ; and at the close of the year 1876 , one hundred and twenty Chinese students had landed on American shores . A large mansion was erected at Hartford , Connecticut , intended to serve both as a home and as a school building ; but after a brief residence , either in this home or in families , the young students were placed in the different academies and schools of New England to prepare for college . In the last school year , one was a member of Yale College , two of its Scientific School , two of the Troy Polytechnic Institute , eight of each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammar School at New Haven , of the Norwich Academy , and the others are scattered through the schools of Massachusetts and Connecticut . Owing to sickness , lack of interest in study or similar causes , twelve have returned to China ; and at present one hundred and eight are in this countriT In the selection of his studies , great liberty is allowed each student . Intending to enter one of the five professions of law , engineering , mining , the navy , or the military , he chooses those studies which are best fitted to prepare him for that work which he designs to adopt . If he intends to become an engineer , he selects scientific studies , and enters a scientific school . If he intends to become a lawyer , he pursues the regular course preparatory for college , // and enters Yale , Harvard , or a similar institution . Comparing the Japanese and Chinese students now enrolled in American schools and colleges , several marked contrasts and likenesses are made evident . The most prominent difference in respect to external characteristics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners of the Western world . The Japanese dresses to la Eurofren , and in excellent taste ; the Chinaman still braids his cue , and wears his loose trowsers and blouse . The Japanese is more easily denationalized ; the Chinaman is constantly impressed with the duty of loving and serving the land that gave him birth and is giving him education . The latter learns the English language with greater ease , and uses it with greater facility ; the former , after a residence of even five or six years , experiences , in the case of not a few individuals , difficulty in conducting an ordinary conversation . Both manifest much deference to authority , and are models of decorum and politeness . The Japanese belong relatively to a higher caste ; the majority of the Chinese students are from the middle class of the empire . In mental characteristics , the contrasts are less marked than in physical . The excellences and the defects of the two types of mind are similar . In each the memory is developed to a degree not commonly attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and figures which they have once seen with marvelous accuracy . The superior developiN* of the memory seems to weaken the growth of the logical faculties ; and a difficulty in conducting processes of thought of ordinary intricacy is one of the first defects which a teacher notices in their mental constitution . Intellectually , both are clearsighted rather than far-sighted ; and are distinguished for exactness in thought and statement . Considered as a whole , the Chinese make more rapid progress in linguistic , and the Japanese in mathematical studies . The former are by temperament the more passive , the latter the more impulsive . Both are hard students , and , though seldom ranking first , maintain a creditable stand in their classes . In respect to moral character , also , as well as intellectual , a high degree of similarity is obvious . Neither , as a body , is addicted to the use of liquors , or of tobacco , and both are free from the vices to which American college youth are somewhat subject . In regard to their adoption of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their respective govemments . During the first years of the residence of the Chinese in America , considerable opposition was made to their coming under distinctively Christian influences ; at present , however , this opposition is removed . They attend the religious services of the church and of the school as their brother students ; and should any of them desire to adopt Christianity , as several of them have already done , the government would not refuse them the privilege . In fact , Yung Wing is recognized as a most devout Christian , and would be glad , it is said , to adopt more aggressive measures for the conversion of all his young countrymen than his government might approve . Of the Japanese students , a few are Christians ; and one , Joseph Neesima , formerly a student at Amherst and the Andover Theological Seminary , is now doing a great religious and educational work in his native island . Several of the students of both nationalities manifest a high degree of fondness for theological discussion ; their voices are frequently heard in the prayer-meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversion of their friends and nation to the religion of Christ , many of them are exceedingly eager . Numerous are the results which will flow to their native lands from the education of this large body of Japanese and Chinese youth in the United States ; but the precise nature of these results it is not easy to anticipate . It is certain , however , that they will prove to be wide and permanent . In developing the material resources of the country , and in aiding the government in the management of its various departments , its citizens thus trained will be of much service . Their influence in educational and intellectual movements will be pervasive . Japan is adopting modern methods of education with greater facility than China ; and graduates of Harvard , Yale , Bowdoin and other colleges are professors in her great university . But the presence in China of a hundred young men , educated ( luring the most susceptible period of their lives , from the age of twelve to twentyfive , in American schools and colleges , will rapidly develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence , moreover , in sustaining a high type of personal morality and in favoring or opposing Christianity will be great . The // qwq THAT gold existed in the Rocky Mountains has certainly been known since the earliest exploration of them ; it is one of the most curious facts about the whole matter , indeed , that the utilization of this wealth did not begin sooner . About 1803 , for instance , a Kentuckian named James Pursley , while traveling with a band of Indians " into the mountains which give birth to the La Platte , Arkansaw , etc. , etc. " ( the locality seems to have been near Mt . Lincoln ) , found gold there and " carried some of the virgin mineral in his shot-pouch for months . " Other wanderers at various times reported it , according to tradition , but no publicity was given to the fact , so that the real history of the mining excitement in the lofty mid-continent ranges , and the annals of Denver , their metropolis , begin with the summer of i8*8 . These early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell . This gentleman was a Georgian who had learned the delights of gold-digging where the gentle Etowah rolls its enticing sands through charming gorges of the Blue Ridge . When the gold excitement of the Pacific coast aroused the country he started West , and , taking his course up the Arkansas , passed along the eastern base of Pike 's Peak , and so northward to the emigrant trail . He observed at that time what seemed to him indications of gold-gravel , but did not pause to verify them . When , therefore , a few years later , he retraced his steps , he halted long enough in Colorado to assure himself of the richness of its bars , and then proceeded homeward to organize a party to return with him to this point . Two brothers , some friends and a few Cherokee Indians joined him. * Following up the Arkansas River , they were joined by adventurers until finally the party numbered thirty or forty ; these reached the base of the mountains early in the summer . Finding nothing in the neighborhood of Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then across to Cherry Creek , where they built a village fifty miles southeast of Denver . Their sluicing was of small consequence , however , and finally they worked down to this point , where Cherry Creek empties into the South Platte . Here , building a permanent camp , they prepared to spend the winter . Exaggerated reports of their success having gone back to the border States , recruits came steadily until , by the time cold weather really set in , three or four hundred persons ( only three of them women ) were gathered in the camp . The settlement was christened Auraria , after the mining town of that name near Dahlonega , Georgia , and the straggling immigration brought in , during the winter , many merchants and artisans as well as goldseekers . Meanwhile , the story of the new discoveries of gold in Pike 's Peak ( for all the mountain region was known by that name , though the peak itself was seventy-five miles from the diggings ) hastened eastward , gathering marvels as it ran , and was attested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distresses of *7 , thousands of men were ready for anything , and the spring of 1859 witnessed the beginning of such an emigration across the plains as had only been equaled by the The Cherokees had previously been through here , searching for a promised land for their tribe , and had themselves reported gold . They concluded to remain in the Indian Territory , but left their name attached to several springs , mountains , etc. , as a memento of their visit of inspection . // wildest hours of the rush to California a decade before . Council Bluffs , Atchison , Kansas City and all the other outposts of civilization became filled with excited crowds hastily preparing for the twomonths ' journey across the plains , and an almost continuous procession of wagons of every description filed out from their streets to undergo the hardships and perils of that eager race to be first at the gold-fields . He who could not pay for the swift stage became driver or escort of a freight wagon , or followed along with his ambulance ; while thousands rode on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcart or wheelbarroxv , or slung upon their backs . Those were the storied days when the motto " Pike 's Peak or Bust " was inscribed on many a wagon-sheet by jubilant owners , and those also the days when the same wagons , hopelessly bogged in some treacherous fording of the Arkansas , or broken down among the rocks of a stony bit of butte-road , were grimly labeled " Busted , by Thunder ! " The van-guard of this exodus reached the Platte in April , and it is estimated that nearly a hundred thousand persons followed during the summer . We are told that they were in the main from the better classes of men at home , but that nineteen-twentieths were entirely ignorant of gold-mining . Thousands were disappointed , of course , and a thin returning stream met but failed to discourage the new comers , who pressed across the weary , bone-marked plains , sure that their lot would be an exception to all the misfortunes described . As soon as the snows were sufficiently melted , the Russells and others pushed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sediment of drifted gold , the source of the riches must yet remain in the rocks whence the waters came . One party , under the leadership of J. H. Gregory , started up Clear Creek , to a point just above where Black Hawk now is , and began prospecting in the gulch . " He climbed the hill , " says a written acceunt of the incident , " where he believed the wash or golddirt would naturally come from , scraped away the grass and leaves and filled his gold-pan with dirt , and took it down to the gulch . Upon panning ( washing ) it down , there was about four dollars ' worth of gold in it ! He dropped his pan and immediately summoned all the gods of the universe to witness his astounding triumph . That night he could not sleep . " Whether any immortals obeyed the summons the record fails to inform us , but it is certain that it was a very few days only before the rugged trails , slippery with ice and gagged with snow , became thronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hope . Almost simultaneously , discoveries of rich bars and veins were made at Idaho Springs , Boulder , Golden , and elsewhere , and the mountains , from Estes Park to the Sangre de Cristo , began to be overrun with prospectors , while gold and silver ledges and placers were discovered so rapidly that no one could keep track of them , and thousands of claims were taken up on both sides and among the very summits of the Snowy Range , * under laws and regulations framed by the miners themselves . Valleys hitherto undisturbed , except by the light tread of the moccasin and the hardly timid game it followed ; cliffs that had echoed to no other sound than the noise of the elements or the voices of bird and beast , now resounded with human energy and were despoiled by the ruthless shovel and axe . The sage-brush yielded place to wagon-tracks , and the splendid spruces were felled to lie docile in the walls of log cities that sprang into shape with the startled swiftness and decision of magic . When the Georgians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Platte and Cherry Creek , they thought " Indian Row " a good enough name ; but when a settlement grew up around them and more men kept coming , they surveyed a town-site and named it " Auraria , " as already stated . At the same time , a few persons crossed to the east side of Cherry Creek and built a group of cabins , which they called " St. Charles , " and a few others " located " on a bench northward under the name of the " Highlands . " These last two were abortive attempts at city-making , however , and during the winter of 1858-9 a party with General Larimer at its head came to St. Charles , " jumped " the now deserted settlement , laid out a 960-acre town-site of their own and christened it Denver City , in honor of the Governor of Kansas , of which territory all this region soon became a county known as Arapahoe. * Fine mines of silver , which are still worked , were opened a few years later on the brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ooo feet , in the midst of perpetual snow . // This last deliberate movement was a direct recognition of the advantages which this point offered as a town-site . It lay midway between the routes of travel to the Pacific coast along the North Platte , and by the way of Santa F6 . It was at the junction of two water-courses , along which grew abundant timber and unlimited pasturage . It was a situation central to the half-dozen passes and cafions which then , as now , constituted the gateways through the mountain-barrier into the interior valleys and parks . Lastly , it had priority , and was fast getting the advertising which has ever since been so liberally accorded to it , and to which it owes , in no small degree , its present success . Each of the forty-one shareholders was required to erect a cabin at once , and General Larimer was the first man to put up his roof . Denver thus sprang at one bound into rivalry with Auraria , but the strife for supremacy was brief , and resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her name and became simply West Denver , or , when spoken of with contumely ( as , until lately , she frequently deserved to be ) , simply , " cross the creek . " Those were wild days in the young city 's history . Thousands of excited people thronged her streets , living in tents , in wagons , in dug-outs and in the rudest of log huts and shanties ,  --  the best way they could . All the provisions had to be brought across the plains , except game and some cattle that Mexicans would drive up from Santa Fi . Yet there was no great scarcity , and though prices were almost uniformly ten times as high as at present , gold-dust and coin were abundant , and wages in proportion . If a man thought ii cheap to be able to buy a sack of flour at *en dollars , he felt outraged if he was not getting fifteei or twenty dollars a day for his labor . The fall of * saw Denver very city-like and busy . Machinery poured in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distance from even the frontier of the Western States . All kinds of business enterprises were projected , and among others a newspaper . The late Hon. William N. Byers , a gentleman who has been identified with the best interests of Colorado , was the moving spirit in this latter venture , and its history is a good illustration of ways and means in " Pike 's Peak " twenty years ago . At Belleview , near Omaha , Mr. Byers and his associates heard that there was lying idle such a printing-office as they wanted ,  --  a relic of a starved-out journal . Mr. Byers went there and secured the property , leaving Omaha with it on the 8th of March , 1859 . The streams were all flooded , snow and rain storms were frequent , and the third day out the trains waded through a frozen sheet of water , three feet deep and two miles wide , breaking the ice as they progressed . The wagon carrying the press had a variety of disheartening mishaps , and at the end of the month had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond there , however , the roads were firm and faster time was made , so that on the 20th of April the precious press and types entered Denver . The name of this fair-sized and nicely printed weekly was the " Rocky Mountain News . " To-day it is an eight-page daily , and owned by a different company , but the name remains , and is widely known . Its salutatory is worth quoting as a piece of brave crowing , for that very week was the time of the remarkable stampede which carried back in a panic four-fifths of the emigrants who had set out for the promised land ,  --  scared by a cry of fraud and certain starvation : " We make our dtbut in the far West , where the snowy mountains look down upon us in the hottest summer day as well as in the winter 's cold ; here , where a few months ago the wild heasts and wilder Indians held undisturbed possession-where now surges the advancing wave of Anglo-Saxon enterprise and civilization , where soon , we proudly hope , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sisterhood of empires . " This was plucky and partook of the character of " bluff , " for the stoutest-hearted really had intelligent doubts about the truth of the boast ; but the journal can take to itself much credit for staying the stampede , and bringing capital and brains to the development of the new camp . It was not long before rivals sprang up , and , in May of the following year , a daily edition was begun , to which a second daily , " The Herald , " opposed itself within a few weeks . At first the nearest post-office was at Fort Laramie , 220 miles northward , and the mail reached there from the East only once or twice a month . About the ist of May , 1859 , a messenger was induced to go to this post-office , and through an utter wilderness he brought a mule-load of letters and newspapers , which were delivered on payment of twenty-five cents each for the former , and fifty cents for the latter . Nor did affairs speedily improve . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all mails being carried from the East // on the overland coaches , which came regularly after June , 1859 , and letters were charged for as express matter , at twenty-five cents apiece. * The war of the rebellion was raging in the East , and a general Indian war harassed the plains . In 1863 , mails were so irregular that weeks would elapse without one , and what was received came by the way of Panama and San Francisco . The freighting business was so demoralized that many a hundred pounds of paper cost a hundred dollars for its transportation alone , and wrapping , tissue and even letter paper were used to keep up the daily issues of the " News , " which often shrunk to a mere bulletin of military orders , etc. , for lack of something to print upon . In i86i , the telegraph reached Fort Kearney , where it rested two years . Then the Denver journals began taking news dispatches , which were printed here only four days after their origin in New York . This increased the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulged in through the editorial columns . It is great fun to read these old files ; it is like witnessing a battle between men of straw . Both offices established pony-express lines to the principal mining camps in the mountains , and their daily editions were delivered in Black Hawk , Central City and other neighborhoods , forty or fifty miles away , more quickly than the steam-cars now manage to do it . Under these circumstances , twenty-five dollars a year was not a high subscription rate , the retail price being twenty-five cents a copy in gold , which , at that time , was worth twice as much as currency . There was no lack of local news , of course , in so wide-awake a community , and these journals were more successful than is usual in manufacturing " items " for themselves . In 1859 , the town became overrun with gamblers and cut-throats , who thought themselves too far from authority and too strong in numbers to be interfered with ; but one night several of them were hanged , and the next night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the leading desperadoes found it to their advantage to * There is a whole book to be written some dayand a book of thrilling interest-on the overland coach lines , the pony express and the fast freight arrangement , which preceded the trans-continental railways . Their histories might properly come in here , but would take up so much space that I prefer passing them by altogether to making an unsatisfactory mention . Denver owed much in its infancy to the enterprise and pluck of its stage and express managers . " skip . " As a consequence , the reign of terror which forms a part of the early history of all the Pacific railroad towns never amounted to much in Denver . Still there were plenty of bad men , and the carrying of fire-arms was a universal custom . Gambling , too , was as open and prevalent as it is now in Leadville , Cafion City or Cheyenne , and tanglefoot whisky , at two bits a drink , was to be had on every corner , and two or three times between . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence as to excite no notice ; and when anybody was killed " they piled the stiffs outside the door , " and went on with the game under the impression that it served the dead man right for not being quick enough to " get the drop " on the other fellow . Although Auraria had long before lost its identity , yet the west side remained the business part of Denver until 1864 ; and one circumstance which caused a change of base was the memorable flood of that spring , one of the events from which Denver people date . For several days a mixture of rain and snow had fallen over the whole region in an almost continuous storm , and Cherry Creek , ordinarily an insignificant , civil stream , was full to the top of its banks . At last there came an unprecedented fall of hail , followed by an hour or two of warmth , and then by a thunder-storm . Hundreds of small reservoirs up on the divide were thus unlocked at a stroke , and in pitchy darkness , rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cherry Creek , and struck the town in a series of prodigious waves . Uprooted trees , drifting houses and barns , and floating de7#is of every sort were borne along upon the swift water , and the inhabitants of half the city , particularly on the west side , were driven from their swaying houses by this unexpected black and icy flood . It was a night of destruction of property and horror to mankind throughout the whole region , for Cherry Creek was only one of many streams that rose into majestic proportions and asserted themselves as the channels of awful power . Yet less than a score of persons lost their lives , and it was all over in a few hours . The most serious loss sustained was that of the county 's safe , wherein were deposited a large number of deeds , leases , mining records and other important documents , the destruction of which has been the source of a vast deal of litigation . Shrewd ones suspect that the safe was found long ago , and that those who prefer // it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it buried again than the public authorities offered for its production , that it never will be seen until exhumed by some future antiquary . Cherry Creek has " boomed " without warning three or four times since then , and will do so in future ; but the guards along its banks and channel are such as , it is hoped , will ward off disaster . When the water is heard and seen coming down , in a mighty flood , crested with great waves and spreading from one trembling bank to another , the fire-bells ring and the creek-side becomes thronged with spectators , and men with ropes , grapnels and hooks . As night advances they build great bonfires at the end of each street that touches the creek , and the angry , chocolate-colored , swift-racing waters run this long gauntlet of fires , that throw their rays far across the turbid waste , and lend new vividness to what is always an exciting picture . Meanwhile , Denver had grown to possess fifteen hundred or two thousand people , more and more persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the town had been preempted for ranching . The Arapahoes of the plains and the Utes of the mountains , seeing this inroad of white men , were far from pleased , and by the spring of 1864 their depredations had culminated in united war over the whole length and breadth of the plains . The transportation of merchandise from the East became impossible except in great companies under armed escort , and even then hundreds of men lost their lives . My memory teems with thrilling incidents as I write . The mail-service along the Platte became broken up , and Colorado was practically cut off from the Atlantic coast . Even the city itself was fearful of attack and massacre . Knowing this , it is not strange that so complete a panic should have occurred as happened one memorable night early in June , when the report that an army of Arapahoes were about to sack the town spread through the streets . It was a wonderfully propitious moment for the savages . Most of the ablebodied men of the town were away in the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three regiments that Colorado sent into the Union army . After a night of scouting and patrolling , waiting and watching , praying and cursing , fear and fury , morning dawned and no trace of Indians was discovered . The whole scare had originated with a nervous old couple who were surprised at milking-time by the advent of a band of horses . Never stopping to see that they were unsaddled and driven by only a Mexican boy or two , they had leaped into their wagon and rushed off to tell Denver that three thousand Arapahoes were coming . The outcome of all this excitement was the proclamation of martial law , and the sudden organization of a regiment for Indian fighting . The " Sand Creek " campaign followed , and secured instant peace to the harassed settlers and miners , over whose heads a tomahawk had been suspended for months . The flood and the Indian scares lost to West Denver its pre-eminence , and business moved to the east side , building up Blake , Holliday , Larimer and Fifteenth streets . Its expansion since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of solid blocks of salesrooms and factories exhibits at once the fact that it is as the commercial center of the mountainous interior that Denver thrives , and congratulates herself upon the promise of a continually prosperous future . Her assertion that she is to be the largest city between Chicago and San Francisco is likely to be realized . Most of her leading business men came here at the beginning , but , when every article had to be hauled six hundred miles across the plains by teams , their energies were limited . It frequently used to happen that merchants would sell their goods completely out , put up their shutters and go a-fishing for weeks before the new semi-yearly supplies arrived . Everybody therefore looked forward with good reason to railway communication as the beginning of a new era of prosperity and growth , and watched with keen interest the approach of the iron track . In i868 , the Union Pacific company was running trains to Cheyenne , directly north of Denver , and about oo miles away ; to which point the Denver Pacific railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1869 . In the following August , the Kansas Pacific 's tracks connected Denver with Kansas City and St. Louis . Thus , the young city found itself removed in a single year from total isolation to a central point on two through lines of railway east and west . Later , it was given a third line by the way of Atchison . Now followed the season of business prosperity which sagacious eyes had foreseen . When the railways were finished the town had less than four thousand inhabitants . A year from that time her population was // nearly fifteen thousand , and her tax-valuation had increased from three to ten millions of dollars . It was a time of happy investment , of incessant building and improvement , and of great speculation . Mines flourished , crops were abundant , cattle and sheep grazed in a thousand valleys hitherto tenanted only by antelopes , and everybody had plenty of money . Then came a shadow of storm in the East , and the sound of the thunder-clap of 1873 was heard in Denver , if the blow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious in loans , speculators declined to buy and sold at a sacrifice . Merchants found that trade was dull and ranchmen got less for their products . It was a " set-hack " to Denver , and two years of stagnation followed ; but she only dug the more money out of the ground to fill her depleted pockets , and survived the " hard times " with far less sacrifice of fortune and pride than did most of the eastern cities . None of her banks went under , nor even certified a check , and most of her business houses weathered the storm . The unhealthy reign of speculation was effectually checked , and business was placed upon a compact and solid foundation . Then came 1875 and 1876 , which were " grasshopper years , " when no crops of consequence were raised in the whole State , and a large amount of money was sent East to pay for flour and grain . It was a particularly hard blow just at that time , but the bountiful harvest of I877 compensated , and the export of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallow , was the largest ever made up to that time . The result of this successful year with miner , farmer and stock-ranger , yielding them more than $15,000,000 , a large proportion of which was an addition to the intrinsic wealth of the world , had an almost magical effect upon the city . Commerce revived , business was brisk , a buoyant feeling prevailed among all classes , and merchants enjoyed a remunerative trade . Money was " easy , " rents advanced , and the realestate business assumed a healthier tone . Generous patronage of the productive industries throughout the whole State was made visible in the quickened trade of the city , which rendered the year an important one in the history of Denver 's progress . So , out of the barrenness of the cactusplain , and through this turbulent history , has arisen a cultivated and attractive city of 30 ,  - -  000 people , which is truly the metropolis of the mountains . Her streets are broad , straight , and everywhere well shaded with lines of cottonwoods and maples , abundant in foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street flows a constant stream of water , often as clear and cool as a mountain brook , moistening the air and furnishing water for household use to the poor . There are said to be over 260 miles of these irrigating ditches or gutters , and 250,000 shade-trees . The source is a dozen miles northward , whence the water is conducted in an open channel , at a cost to the city of $io , ooo a year . For many miles in the southern and western quarter of the town ,  --  from Fourteenth to Thirtieth streets , and from Arapahoe to Broadway and the new suburbs beyond ,  --  you will see only elegant and comfortable houses . A city of equal size in the East would show dwellings arranged to a great extent in solid blocks ; but in Denver there are only two or three instances of this . Homes succeed one another , in endlessly varying styles of architecture , and vie in attractiveness , each surrounded by lawns and gardens abounding in flowers . All looks new and ornamental , while some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , and with porches which are well occupied during the long , cool twilight characteristic of this climate . The power which has wrought all this change in a short score of years , truly making the desert to bloom , is water ; or , more correctly , that is the great instrument used , for the power is the will and pride of the cultivated men and women who form the leading portion of the citizens . Water is pumped from the Platte by the Holly system and forced over the city with such power that , in case of fire , no steam-engine is necessary to send a strong stream through the hose . The keeping of a turf and garden , after it is once begun , is merely a matter of watering . The garden is kept moist mainly by flooding from the irrigating ditch in the street or alley , but the turf of the lawn and the shrubbery owe their greenness to almost incessant sprinkling by the handhose . Fountains are seen in nearly every yard . After dinner ( for Denver dines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of the house lights his cigar and turns hoseman for an hour , while he chats with friends ; or the small boys bribe each other to let them lay the dust in the street , to the imminent peril of passers-by . The swish and gurgle and sparkle of water are always present , and always must be ; for so Denver defies the desert and dissipates the dreaded dust . // Considering this abundance of water , the dirty and unsanitary condition of central Denver is a disgrace to her , and will presently be an alarm . Many alleys are filled with disgusting refuse , and the gutters , where there is not a swift stream , are choked with filth . It is not so bad as the same condition of things in a southern or eastern town would be , because the dryness of the air causes desiccation rather than the putrescence of decaying matter . But it is bad enough , and long ago it was understood that well-water must not he consumed inside the city limits . Now the surfacedrainage has affected even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 1879 much sickness resulted from drinking it . At this rate , Denver 's population will be changed from a race of reconstructed invalids to one of newly afflicted candidates for the hospital . It is offered in defense against these charges that the city has increased in population ahead of its accommodations-has outgrown itself ; and new works of great magnitude are being projected , which will bring the melted snows directly from their rocky reservoirs in the foot-hills and distribute the purest water in the greatest abundance . Then it is promised that sewers will be dug , proper escapepipes be arranged , and an era of sanitation begun . Hasten the day ! There is no excuse for ill-health to a sound body in this dry , clear , exhilarating atmosphere . Its climate is one of the things Denver boasts of ; but a region where the temperature will fall 48 degrees in a single hour , as it actually did one January day in 1875 , is open to criticism , to say the least . That the air is pure and invigorating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plat*eau a mile above sea-level , with a range of snow-burdened mountains within sight . From the beginning to the end of warm weather it rarely rains , except occasional thunder and hail storms in July and August . September witnesses an ugly storm , succeeded by cool , charming weather , when the haze and smoke is filtered from the bracing air , and the landscape robes itself in its most enchanting hues . The coldest weather occurs after New Year 's Day and lasts until April . Then come the May storms and floods , followed by a hot , dry summer . The barometer holds itself pretty steady throughout the year , but the thermometer goes crazy , and the anemometer is sometimes " driven almost to death . " There is a vast quantity of electricity in the air , and the displays of lightning are magnificent and often destructive . Sunshine is superabundant . Records show less than a score of days in seven years when the sun has been totally obscured . It glares down through the thin , brilliant air with burning heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can by no means judge from the brightest day in New York of the wonderful dazzle sunlight has here ; nor can he fail to notice the instant relief felt when he steps out of the direct rays into the shadow . Summer heat often reaches a hundred in the shade , and is stifling at midday ; but with sunset comes coolness , and the nights allow refreshing sleep . In winter , the mercury sometimes sinks thirty degrees below zero and stays there for long periods ,  --  the average for January is frequently more than ten degrees helow ,  --  but one does n't feel this severity as much as he would a far less degree of cold in the damp , raw climate of the coast . Snow is frequent , but not very useful for sleighing on account of the wind . This wind , in fact , is the great feature about the weather at all seasons . It does not always blow , but the pauses are so rare as to be a positive relief . In congratulating herself that Cheyenne has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she , Denver asserts no strong claim to being a calm locality . The dust , which is Denver 's bite noir , is swept in blinding clouds at the shortest notice away from before you , to be deposited in some less desirable place , while you get the full benefit of some else 's pulverulent property . Nor has this Colorado wind a decent and fixed purpose . It is a perfect Puck of a wind , dashing down from the mountains , or tearing in off the plains , at a pace that defies all preparation or caution . All the cinders resulting from kitchen fires are required by law to be put into little close domes of brick ,  --  quaint little structures , like Mexican ovens , that attract a stranger 's eye at once as he glances over the palings of the back-yard . In one breeze a family lost three wash-tubs , among numberless other things , blown miles away on the plains . A good , motherly woman , hating frivolity and camping to please her children in the mouth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to meet with . It holds still till she has made everything ready , and is just reaching out to set her frying-pan upon the nicely glowing coals ; then-piff ! and the embers are going over the top of the hill , and the whole camp devotes itself // for the rest of the evening to collecting scattered articles . There is a yarn about a miner who , being swift of foot , chased his vagrant fire and held his skillet over it as it traveled . When his bacon was done he found himself fifteen miles from camp ! Denver is not only built with the capital of her own citizens , but constructed of materials close at hand . Very substantial bricks , kilned in the suburbs , are the favorite material , and no less than twenty millions will be put into walls this year . Then there is a pinkish trachyte , almost as light as pumice , and ringing under a blow with a metallic clink , that is largely employed in trimmings . Sandstone , marble and limestone are abundant enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large buildings are made of stone which will assay eight dollars ' worth of silver to the ton ! Coarse lumber is supplied by the high pineforests , for the great cottonwoods that shade the lower streams are of no account , but all the hard wood and fine lumber is brought from the East . The fuel of the city is wholly lignite coal , which comes from the foot-hills . It is dirty stuW yielding a dense smoke , and a noticeable effect follows . A dozen years ago , it seemed some days as though the . mountains rose abruptly from the Platte , and one can almost credit the popular yarn of the Englishman who started to walk out to them before breakfast , never dreaming their nearest slopes were a dozen miles away ; now , however , close as they sometimes approach , and wonderfully as they loom up before the eye , they always seem more distant and dim . No doubt the smoke of thousands of fires and the exhalations of a crowded and somewhat dirty city have made the whole atmosphere perceptibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well after the material attractions , Denver has not forgotten the mental inducements to make her midst your dwelling-place . She is very proud of her school-buildings , constructed and managed upon the most approved plans ; of her fine churches , of her flower-bedecked State offices , her seminaries of higher learning , and her recently organized natural history and historical association . Society is cosmopolitan . Five hundred people a day , it is said , enter Denver . Nowadays " the tour " of the United States is incomplete if this mountain city is omitted . Thus , the registers of her hotels bear many foreign autographs of world-wide reputation . Surprise is often expressed by the critical among these visitors ( why , I do not understand ) at the totally unexpected degree of intelligence , culture in music and art , appreciation of the more refined methods of thought and handiwork , and the knowledge of science that greets them here . Do they think because we live on the western side of the plains that we are out of the world ? or because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do they cling to the old notion that Denver is a place where one half the population is practicing with revolvers on the other half ? Art and music , par* ticularly , find friends and cultivation among the educated and generous families who have built up society here . There are schools and societies devoted to sustaining the interest , just as there are reading circles and Shakspere clubs . And , withal , there is the most charming freedom of acquaintance and intercourse ,  --  polish and good-breeding , delivered from all chill and exclusiveness , or regard for " who was your grandfather ? " Yet , this winsome good-fellowship by no means descends to vulgarity or permits itself to be abused . After all , it is only New York and New England and Ohio , transplanted and considerably enlivened . One result of this , unfortunately for the magazinist , is that there is little distinctive character in the community . What there is is merely off-color , if not criminal , and can not be dwelt upon . There used to be plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , if not all gone , it is fast going , and Denver has become as tame and conventional as any Ohio town . I can think of only one single custom that may be regarded as altogether local . In the suburbs nearly every citizen keeps a cow ; and this requires a pasture . But about Denver there are no fenced fields ,  --  when you get away from the houses you are at once out on the open plains , and could walk to the Missouri without jumping a fence . A few men , therefore , make it their business to collect all the cows in a certain quarter of the city every morning , drive them out on the plain to feed , and bring them back at night . It is a pleasant sight to see this " townherd " come in , in the evening , and find their way lazily to their own doors , while the weary herder on his decrepit broncho lags behind , or spurs with sudden zeal and much Mexican profanity after some truant beast that refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s resources , it will readily be seen that // she stands as the supply depot and moneyreceiver of three great branches of industry and wealth , namely , mining , stock-raising and agriculture . The first of these is the most important . Many of the richest proprietors live here and spend their profits . Then , too , the machinery which the mining and reduction of the ores require , and the tools , clothing and provisions of the men , mainly come from here . About 65,000 lodes have been discovered in Colorado , and numberless placers . Only a small proportion of these , of course , were worked remuneratively , but the cash yield of the twenty years since the discovery of the precious metals has averaged nearly $5,000,000 a year , and has increased from $200,000 in 1869 to over $io , ooo , ooo in 1879 . Not half of this is gold , yet it is only since 1870 that silver has been mined at all in Colorado . These statistics show the total yield of the State in gold and silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper , iron , lead and coal . The second great means of revenue to Denver is the cattle and sheep of the State . The wonderful , worthless-looking buffalograss , growing in little tufts so scattered that the dust shows itself everywhere between , and turning sere and shriveled before the spring rains are fairly over , has proved one of Colorado 's most prolific sources of wealth . The herds now reported in the State count up 8oo , ooo , and the annual shipments amount to ioo , ooo , at an average of $22 apiece , giving $2,200,000 as the yearly yield . Add the receipts from the sales of hides , tallow and beef butchered here , and the dairy consumption , and you have a figure not far from $3,000,000 to represent the total annual income from this branch of productive industry . The whole value of the cattle investments in the State is estimated by good judges at $12,000,000 , nearly one-fourth of which is the property of citizens of Denver . Yet this sum , great as it is for a pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year ( 1878 ) , over 2,000,000 sheep were sheared , and more and more capital is being invested in this industry . Perhaps the total value of sheep-ranches in the State is not less than $6 , ooo , ooo , the annual income from which approaches $i , ooo , ooo . The third large item of prosperity to the State is agriculture , although it advances in the face of much opposition . The main planting averaging seventy cents in price . Add to this other grains , etc. , and the annual yield of the soil in Colorado is brought to over $2,000,000 in value . Farmers are learning better and better how to combat the great obstacles to agriculture in this State , and the tillage is annually wider . Nor is this the whole story . Denver is coming more and more to be a manufacturing center . The largest ore-reduction works in the West are here ; and there are rollingmills , iron-foundries , machine-shops , woolenmills , shoe factories , carriage and harness factories , breweries , and so on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly , are the fiouring-mills , representing an investment of $35o , ooo , and handling half the wheat crop of Colorado . I have dwelt upon these somewhat prosy statements in order to point out fully what rich resources Denver has behind her , and how it happens that she finds herself at twenty years of age amazingly strong commercially . Not only a large proportion of the money which gives existence to these enterprises ( nearly every householder in the city has a financial interest in one or several mines , stock-ranges or farms ) , but the current supplies that sustain them , are procured in Denver , and a very large percentage of their profits finds its way directly to this focus . Denver thus becomes to all Colorado what Paris is to France . Through all the enormous area , from Wyoming farinto New Mexico , and westward to Utah , she has no respectable rival , and she keeps pace with its rapidly thickening population and increasing needs . Every extension of the railways , every good crop , every new mineral district developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great central mart . This sound business basis being present , the opportunity to dispose pleasantly of the money made is , of course , not long in presenting itself . It thus happens that Denver shows in a wonderful measure the amenities and means of intellectual culture that make life so attractive in the old- established centers of civilization , where selected society , thoughtful study and the riches of art have ri1 ) ened to slow maturity through long time and under gracious traditions . There is an abundance here , therefore , to please the eye and touch the heart , as well as fill pockets , and year by year the city is becoming more and more a desirable place in which to dwell as well as to do business .
