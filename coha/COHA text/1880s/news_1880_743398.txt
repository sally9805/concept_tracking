txt The entire session of the Senate to-day was devoted to the Indian question . At the beginning of the morning hour , Mr. Saunders , of Nebraska , offered a resolution requiring the Committee on Indian Affairs to inquire and report as to the expediency of removing the Santee Indians from his State to the old Ponca Reservation , in Dakota . Mr. Dawes is a member of the special committee which has been hearing the story of the wrongs of the Ponces , and after the resolution had been passed he moved to reconsider , and opposed it in a manner which showed how deeply his sympathies had been aroused . He told again the story of the removal of the Ponces from their ceded lands , and their transfer to the Indian Territory , where malaria and the change of climate reduced their number one half . Deprived of their property by a blunder , Congress had provided that they should be removed after their consent , had been obtained , but they were driven out at the point of the bayonet into an exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Senator from Nebraska proposed to put another band of peaceable Indians upon the reservation from which these Poncas had been driven , while a committee were trying to decide upon the Ponces ' claim to the same reservation , where their fathers haebeen buried . Both the Senators from Nebraska declared that they had opposed the removal of the Ponces , but held that the Santees ought not to remain in their State . They would not attempt to remove them , however , without their consent , nor would they have them put upon the old Ponca reservation without the consent of the Poncas . Mr. Dawes ridiculed the idea of getting the consent of the exiled Ponces , who were under guard , and whose chief had been murdered in the house of an agent . Consent in such cases meant acquiescence at the point of the bayonet . Mr. Saunders claimed that the Santees would be benefited by the proposed removal . Mr. Kirkwood , another member of the Ponca Committee , said that Mr. Dawes had exaggerated the wrongs of the Poncas . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy , for the whites were kept out of it only by the United States Army . He could not sympathize with those who seemed to take pleasure in representing the Government as always unjust and cruel to the Indians . Mr. Dawes remarked that it was true that the Army must be used to keep Western people from lands which were the absolute property of the Indians , who seemed to have no rights which the people of the West felt bound to respect . Mr. Saunders said that there was room on the old Ponca reservation for both the Poncas and the Santees . " So there is room in your house for me , " replied Mr. Dawes . " but you would not like to be compelled to give me half of it . " Mr. Allison showed how the Government , in making a settlement with the Sioux , after the great war of 1866 , had disposed of the lands of the Ponces , and asserted that the Poncas had afterward been removed in answer to their own request , because of the depredations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had as good a right to stay in Nebraska as the whites , and they desired to stay and to have land allotted to them . The debate was interrupted by the expiration of the morning hour . The report of the Santee agent in 1879 showed that these Indians had made great progress in civilization . They dress as white men do , and conduct their farms without help . They planted 1,950 acres ; had abandoned their hereditary chiefs , and were quiet and orderly . There were six schools on the reservation , and the Indians greatly desired titles to the farms which they had improved . " Designing men , " said the agent , " are now making strong efforts to drive the Santees west to Dakota , from their present homes , in order to get their lands . " Some of these Santees went to Dakota and took homesteads because they believed they could not obtain titles on the reservation . The agent said that they desired to become law-abiding citizens , and that their farms compared favorably with those of the whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , and appeared to be good , - honest , and sober men . The Senate continued to discuss the Ute bill in the afternoon . Many speeches were made , and the Indian question was considered in all its bearings . A great part of the debate was on Mr. Kirkwood 's amendment , which provides that the White River Utes shall not receive their money until they shall have given up those who are guilty of murder and other crimes against the Meekers . Mr. Kirkwood declared that they should be compelled to deliver these culprits , and that if they failed to do so the Army should be instructed to wipe the band from the face of the earth . Others held that there was no law authorizing their punishment after they had been delivered , and claimed that it might be impossible for the Utes to get hold of them . Mr. Whyte opposed the bill , and denounced the policy which had governed the treatment of the Indians . Mr. Beck and Mr. Burnside favored the transfer of the Indians to the care of the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a carefully-prepared speech in favor of the humane treatment and civilization of the race , in order that their physical force might be utilized in our undeveloped country , on economic grounds .
