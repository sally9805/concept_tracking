AUTHORSHIP IN AMERICA . THE United States census , two or three decades ago , in its summary of persons engaged in various occupations included a poet . He lived in Arkansas , if I remember rightly , but may have perished from want , for I have looked in vain for him in later issues of the census reports . I have often thought of him , however , when speculating about the conditions of authorship in America , and have admired the courage with which he made his confession . He was the only poet in America to stand up boldly and be counted . The rest of us sheltered ourselves in the census behind such evasive titles as journalist , or editor , or professor , or , if especially courageous , literary man . Mr. Carlyle , in his celebrated petition , wrote himself down as a maker of books ; but every one feels that Mr. Carlyle 's was a case of affected humility and bluntness . If he had had the nerve of the man from Arkansas , he would have subscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world upside down . There is unquestionably a reluctance on the part of all of us , whether poets , // or American humorists , or men of general genius , - for since I am not going to sign this paper , I am as bold as Snug the joiner , - there is a reluctance , I say , on our part to be classified . A guild of authors could exist only as a mutual burial society ; though there would seem to be many interests which authors might combine to defend or resist , as a matter of fact there is , I believe , but one literary club in the country which makes the authorship of books a condition of mcmbership , and this Authors ' Club has been derided for its arrogance , as if it were another instance of the three tailors of Tooley Street . When any movement is to be made which affects the whole body of literary men , what member has the boldness to marshal his fellows into any phalanx of remonstrants or petitioners ? Even in the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by individual solicitation from publishing houses or trade journals . The truth is that this individuality of authors , which seems to some to spring from jealousy or a suspicious habit of mind , is an essential characteristic of their vocation , and a necessary result from the material conditions of their profession . There can be an association of artists , with the object to maintain a school of painters , or to conduct an exhibition of paintings ; there can be an historical society to collect materials for history , to discuss and criticise historical writings , and to print papers ; but there can not be anything more than a social basis for an authors ' league , because the individual interests of every author are vastly greater to him than the combined interests of all authors , but chiefly because there exists for him already a complement organization which no voluntary association with other authors could supply . Au author with his manuscript is an incomplete figure ; a hundred authors associated are only a hundred times more incomplete , and the various authors ' unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably proved it . The devices of authors to get along without publishers have succeeded only so far as authors have abandoned their legitimate function and become publishers , and such successes have merely registered a loss to authorship and a gain to publishing . It would seem a waste of time to demonstrate that in the organization of modern society the author needs a publisher as much as the publisher needs an author , and that each supplies the other 's defects ; but while most would concede this without dispute , there are frequent attitudes taken by one or the other of these two classes which practically deny the proposition . The publisher , for example , is often spoken of as if he were the author 's nat* ural enemy ; and I have heard people make the preposterous remark that the publisher grows rich , while the authors for whom he publishes continue to be poor . Of course he does ; if he is faithful to the interests of the authors , he must , or what would be the meaning of the rule of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off for money than each of a hundred authors with one book . Even if it should be capable of proof that he was better off than the hundred authors combined , one would be obliged next to prove that authorship was a trade , of which the prime purpose was to make money . On the other hand , publishers sometimes speak of my authors very much as they would speak of my employees , or regard every desire of an author to understand his accounts as a breach of confidence , or think and speak of his work as a mere arrangement of words , or imagine that his literary reputation has been made solely by the publisher 's advertisement . There is plenty of room for misunderstanding between a publisher and an author , but the fact remains that the interests of the two are identi // Cal ; that in the long run any injury or injustice to the one affects equally the other ; that neither party to the contract can safely ignore the other ; that , in fine , literature and the publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last analysis , is neither printer nor bookseller , but advertiser . It is his business to make the author known . He may take a book from the author after it has been printed and bound , and he may never sell a single copy directly to a reader ; but the one function which he can not rid himself of is that of making the book known to the world , - of publishing it . But to publish a book with intelligence one must know something about the book , and a great deal about the public ; he must know the various avenues by which the public eye and ear are to be reached , and he must possess that power of organization and executive ability which will bring the author face to face with a great number of persons scattered all over the land . When one adds to this that the publisher , in the highest development , includes the manufacturer and the merchant , it is easily seen how much may go to the success of a publishing house . When a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also highly sensitive to all manner of influences ; and the more complex it becomes , the more perfectly is it able to correspond to the needs of the author . It is one of the commonplaces of historical philosophy that the literature of a people is the highest expression of its character and genius . But what is a book ? In one aspect , it is a bundle of sheets of paper , stamped with little characters , sewed together , put between covers of pasteboard dressed in cloth . It can be used to build block houses with , as a missile , to raise the seat at the piano , to set off a cabinet of shelves ; but for all these purposes a block of wood or a bit of stamped leather would be more serviceable . Then it is a power , a spirit , a friend , something altogether imponderable and immeasurable . Now it is in this double property of the material and the immaterial that we are constantly compelled to consider books when we legislate about them or determine their conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite variety of industries and *organizations and a network of social order ; the fortunes of books are constantly subject to influences which extend from a machine to a solitary scholar , and in the decisions made with regard to them there is necessitated an equilibrium of the two natures involved in them . A few years ago an effort was made by some persons to change the ad valorem duty on imported books to a specific duty , of a certain rate per pound , and great was the derision at such a mechanical test ; yet it was not more arbitrary than the test of price , and much more convenient and desirable for the purposes of impost . By a comparison of fair typical cases , it was found that a measurement of books by weight would yield , at twenty-five cents a pound , just about the same revenue as the existing tariff of twenty-five per cent . ad valorem , if that duty were honestly collected ; and every one knows that where a specific duty is practicable it can not be evaded , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as illustrating in an extreme way the fact that books are capable of being treated not merely as pieces of merchandise , but upon the basis of their most material properties . Indeed , every one who deals in books is constantly confronted by the fact that the price is largely determined by the weight and size of the book , and not by its beauty , the character of its contents , or the money and labor which have been put into it . It is impossible to escape from the most gross conditions , when considering the fortune of books . As articles of commerce , as related to // mechanical industries , they are subject to the laws which govern in commerce and manufacture , and no wise student of literature can ignore these facts when he is inquiring into the influences which affect authorship or reading . The publisher and manufacturer of books does not call the author into existence , neither does the author make the publisher ; but both act upon each other by turns , for both are parts of an intricate order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which affect the market for books , but he is very quick to communicate these influences to the author . In a general way , one readily sees that in what are called good times the publisher will encourage the author to produce , and in hard times will discourage him when he brings his manuscript . There are winds and tides in human affairs which are beyond the reach either of individuals or of classes , but there are also movements which are under control ; and certainly it is the part of a wise man to forecast the effect of these movements , and to guide them if he can . An instance occurred lately which illustrates my subject . In the revision of the tariff it was proposed to remove the existing duty upon imported books . The proposition was received favorably both in and out of Congress . Knowledge was to be free , at least English knowledge was , and a relic of barbarism unworthy of an enlightened nation was to be swept away . Many publishers , however , and with them a few authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , and Congress finally declined to alter the tariff on this point . This remonstrance was characterized as a piece of selfishness on the part of the publishers , and of timidity or folly on the part of the authors , who were treated with a delicious arrogance by the censors of literature and morals . It was supposed that those persons who had given honorable thought to litera ture , and had , indeed , in the homely phrase , made it their business to write books , were quite incapable of understanding a few simple laws of economy and their effect upon literature and authors . There are always people who imagine themselves about to live in a world which they have prearranged upon a scientific basis . It is indeed base to say that imagination is lacking in America so long as there are theorists who manufacture entire systems of social life upon the foundation of a few simple principles ; but theorists in government , in finance , in economy , while they have plenty of room in America , are not the rulers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , has very long roots , and there are few people so sanguine as to think that it can be pulled up forcibly , and leave no derangement behind . What , for example , would be the effect were the tariff on books to be removed ? That is the question which any reasonable legislator might ask before he voted to remove it , and I think he would be the wisest congressman who took the widest range in his inquiry . It would be easy to show that the mercantile interests involved were pitifully small when compared with the iron or wool interests , but it would be easier to trace the connection between the lower and the higher interests than it would be in the case of those industries . I think the matter might be stated in a series of propositions ; at any rate , by choosing this form I guard myself against the temptation to fly off into generalities , and I make the way plain for any one who has already ranged himself on the other side of the question to demolish my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text of the remonstrance made by certain authors ; for I am not considering the matter from the publishers ' side , except as they have common concern with the authors . // These writers , then , based their objection to a removal of the duty on these grounds - First , that the prosperity of authors is closely connected with the prosperity of publishers , who are their agents in manufacturing , advertising , and selling the books which they write . This is a harmless-looking sentence , and as I have already treated the matter in a sufficiently elementary way , I think I need not detain the reader with any expansion of so reasonable a statement , but go on to Second , that American books demand American publishers , and whatever seriously checks the business of publishing checks the freedom of writing . The latter part of this proposition would appear to be the corollary of that with which the remonstrance led off , but the former part introduces a new member . Is it especially necessary that books written by Americans should be published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give the books the widest circulation , whether in America or England ; or why not go to the pubusher who can pay the heaviest royalty , whether in America or England ? I do not know that such questions would be seriously asked ; and yet if it should prove that American authors could gain substantially by employing English publishers for both countries , it would indicate an uneven state of affairs . The relation between author and publisher is natural and organic , not mechanical ; they are complementary to each other , as I have before said , and until one has rid himself of all relation to his country he can not separate himself from so constituent a part of the order in which he lives . It would certainly be an anomalous condition if an author , writing , as he can not help writing , mainly for readers in his own country , should employ a foreign agent to help him find these readers . I do not believe such a state of affairs will ever be brought about , because I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if it were to be , the first step would be taken when the American publisher had been divorced by his partner . Third , that the removal or essential reduction of the existing tariff on books would give the foreign publisher an advantage over the American publisher , by enabling him to occupy the American market with books written and made abroad at a lower rate than they can be made in this country . This statement looks to a simple commercial fact . It assumes books to be purely objects of merchandise , subject to the laws which govern merchandise . It assumes that the publisher who can make books cheaper than his neighbor , and at the same time deprive them of no essential value , will hold the market . It assumes that a book is a book , and it almost eliminates the element of authorship . Under these assumptions , it maintains that in the competition American publishers , unless protected by a duty of twenty-five per cent . on I*nglish goods , would suffer seriously . The whole proposition is so degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it true that a book is a book ? A clerical friend of mine , who knows books which are books , went into a bookstore one day , and asked , - " Have you a copy of Bossuet ? " " No , " was the prompt reply , " but we have Balzac . " That young man knew how to keep store . He missed his customer this time , but he answered by rule , and knew that nine out of ten chance buyers would have taken another French book by an author whose name began with B , if the one they had heard of was not to be had . The truth is that the cultivated few , who buy a book in current literature because they know about the author , do not make the great public that supports bookstores . That is made of people who want something to read , - the latest , freshest , cheapest // book , - and of people who have serious intentions towards classic authors . The very men who have most to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock with reference to its saleworthiness , and to the margin of profit between the buying and selling price ; and they know that , with the exception of a few hooks by men of worldwide note and a few that are immediately advertised in an extensive way , a pound of hooks is a pound of hooks , and the public at large buys by the pound , and wants its money 's worth . To particularize : There are two great classes of books which are bought and sold as merchandise under the common laws which affect trade . One is a class made up of a few works so individual that the author gives the entire value to the property ; the other , of a great multitude of works , where the author 's name , when known , scarcely affects the value of the property at all . The former of these classes goes by the name of standard books , and is a very important element in the publishing business . The publisher has no power to add to their number ; he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be standard : the world and time do that for him . He only looks on , and as a servant of the public sees that they are never left in want . Now the element of speculation , which is never absent from new books , need scarcely he present when books which have stood the test of time are concerned . There the problem is a simple one . Can the publisher give a better , more marketable edition of a standard book than his neighbor ? Can he bring out a peculiar excellency which will stamp his edition as the most desirable , or can he produce a cheaper hook for the size ? He has not to create a demand , but to satisfy it . The bookseller is constantly applied to by the publisher to buy from him his Shakespeare , or his Scott , or Thackeray , or Dickens , or Macaulay , or Milton . There are more than sixty editions of the Pilgrim 's Progress published in America , at prices ranging from six cents to fifteen dollars . The latter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of juvenile books , and it constitutes one of the bulkiest parts of the publishing business . There are many modest persons engaged in the writing of these books , and the proportion of anonymous or pseudonymous titles is larger , it may safely he said , than in any other order of literature . The author 's name has comparatively little to do with the fortune of juveniles . Of course , here and there an author 's name has a great significance , especially when he has already made his reputation in a higher class of literature , and then his juvenile book gets lifted out of the crowd ; but , in the main , the publisher and the bookseller know that the sales are determined by a few simple considerations . They both know that the public will buy the showiest , most attractive hooks , and those which seem to give the most for the money ; that the question of home or foreign production , whether in authorship or manufacture , scarcely weighs a feather with the public ; and that pictures and binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The publisher keeps in mind also the important fact that the bookseller will buy these goods of the person who will give him the most favorable discount . The great individuality of standard books , the absence of individuality in juvenile books , alike throw the burden of these two great classes upon the publisher , and it is the conditions which he can control that make the books successful or unsuccessful . Now tho practical effect of this state of things is that the English publisher goes to the bookseller with these two classes of books , the standard and the juvenile , and sells them to him at better rates than the American publisher can . It is a fact , and not a theory , // that for the last few years the English books in these two departments have been steadily pushing American ones to the wall , and the more far-sighted American publishers have maintained that the tariff of twenty-five per cent . is the only serious obstacle to a pretty full occupation of the American market ; that were this tariff to be removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage which distance from the market and the cost of freight would not materially lessen . Can English books , then , be made cheaper than American ? Yes . First , because the American manufacturer is already heavily taxed in all the duties laid upon the materials which enter into the production of a book . Second , because , while the American has the advantage in machinery , ninety per cent . of the cost of electrotype plates - the investment of a book - is in hand labor , and hand labor in England is much lower than in America . Third , because the plant of book manufacture in England is so extensive , so highly organized , and so wealthy , that , with a great market in addition to their own , English publishers can afford to produce books at a smaller margin of profit on each copy than is possible among manufacturers whose earnings have not yet paid for the newer plant . But granting all this , one may impatiently ask , Why not buy Shakespeare in an English edition , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books for the young , if they are prettier ? The answer , for my purposes , is suggested by the last two propositions in the authors ' remonstrance , and so I give them together - " Fourth , that the effect will be to force American publishers into the publication of those copyright books only whose reputation has already been made , or of those which serve professional uses , as reports of courts and school books . Fifth , that higher literature will be discouraged , and that the greatest volume of current literature , which is in the form of reading for the young , will be guided by foreign authors , instead of by men and women of their own nation . " That is to say , if publishers were to be crowded out of the market in the field of what is known as miscellaneous and juvenile books , from inability to make any profit in them , they would give their attention to those books in the publication of which they are protected . Such protection exists in the case of copyright books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the case of books which are not properly literature , but rather the intellectual tools required by students and professional workers , and can best be made by those who are brought into close connection with the persons who use them . But the contraction of the publishing business means the restriction of experiments in literature , and the pursuit of a conservative policy on the part of publishers toward the beginners in authorship . A broad industrial basis is requisite for successful ventures in newer fields . If the effect of legislation were to cut off from American publishers the manufacture and sale of standard uncopyright books , and of juvenile books of home origin , then , so far , such legislation would be a blow at American authorship , not of juvenile books merely , but of all new contributions to literature . As a specific illustration of this point , it is worth while to note that the rates of payment for copyright on books for the young are notoriously lower than for copyright on books in general literature . The reason is easily stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dealer than on other books , and the margin of profit is smaller . But why does he have to give larger discounts ? Because the competition is closer , owing to the impersonal character of this literature , and to the great tide of English books . // I have been drawn away somewhat from my immediate subject by this study of a special illustration , but I am not sorry if it has served to emphasize the statement that authorship in America is so closely identified with publishing enterprise as to be sensitive to the same influences . The truth is that publishing in America is more nearly allied with professional life than with trade , and it is likely that the relations between publishers and authors will grow closer , and partake more of a partnership character , than heretofore . The publisher has been the author 's servant , and he has been the author 's employer . I think that a more natural and a more honorable connection is steadily forming . As one indication of an elevation of thebusiness , I have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a collegiate education now engaged in the publishing business in America than there are in the ranks of men of letters . It is not surprising that this is so . The demands made upon publishers in this country are of a kind to test them severely , and to make the important prizes come within the grasp of those only who are capable of large and comprehensive views . There is a vast territory in which to operate ; an innumerable throng of readers ; no compact educated class ; no distinctive and authoritative organs of opinion or information ; a great number of small centres ; a scattering , and not a concentration , of forces . All these conditions , taken with the details involved in publishing , the large capital required in proportion to the business done , the speculative nature of the business , and the constant presence of a highly organized foreign competition , working indeed from a distant base , but with the distance yearly lessening under the applications of science , these conditions , I say , tend to discourage the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a matter of fact that within ten years past there has been scarcely an addition to the list of publishing houses . The effect of all this is to throw the initiative of literature more and more into the hands of the publishers . I am speaking , of course , of such literature as can be deliberately planned . In the matter of the highest literature , it can be said that , so far as publishers occupy a middle ground between commercial and professional lines , they have it in their power to perceive the presence of genius , and to give it a chance ; to detect the absence of genius and to put obstacles in the way of its encumbering literature . The main province , however , of publishing enterprise is in the field of that great body of literature which has to do with knowledge ; and here the higher organization of the publishing business means the greater opportunity for authorship . The publisher who has developed the industrial and distributing part of his business is compelled to do more than select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must shape the course of his business at its source as well as at its outlet , and invite certain books as well as judge those which come without solicitation . It is this function of the publisher which may be watched with the liveliest interest . I am inclined to think that it is destined to be largely developed in America , and that the most thoroughly equipped publishing houses are to be great centres of intellectual force ; collecting the scattered powers of literature , and redistributing them in ordered form . In this respect more is to be hoped from them than from the universities . Authorship and university life are not nearly so closely connected as authorship and publishing . The effect , indeed , of university life upon authorship is on the whole a repressive one . The university man is undermined by his disposition to perfect his work , and by the air of criticism which prevails about // him . 1-Je is too near a few readers and critics , and too remote from the many readers , to work either with freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . The very limitations of a scholastic life are unfavorable to the man of letters . lie is constantly tempted , in the routine of that life , to refine indefinitely and to lose the large purposes of literature . Yet the university might well range itself among the forces which are to stimulate and control letters in America . I can see no good reason why it should not ally itself with publishing houses in the organization of literature . It has funds for the encouragement of students ; why should it not have funds for the encouragement of learning ? It need not have its bookstore or printing office , nor need it engage in the business of publishing ; but it may fairly put its seal upon a translation of Aristotle , or a thoroughly edited and complete series of the writings of Washington . The close connection which exists between author and publisher compels us to ask what are the author 's proprietary rights , by which he is enabled to meet the publisher on even grounds ? The copyright laws give him control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to renew for fourteen years at the end of the first period . For forty-two years , then , the author has peculiar property in a hook ; after that he has no legal right , and however honorable his own publisher may be , both author and publisher are at the mercy of any rogue who may choose to publish a book , the copyright of which has expired . The period of forty-two years is too short for reasonable protection . Books published by an author when he is under thirty are taken away from him just when he most needs the income from them . For example , I published a book when I was twenty-four years old ; it continues to bring me in a yearly return . I am already looking forward to my sixty-sixth year ; but when that time comes the investment which I made in my youth will be nearly worthless to me , and I shall be grinding out work when I ought to be engaged only in writing in autograph albums . Besides , it is unreasonable to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his books comes round , with a penalty of losing his property in them if he forgets it . No ; a fairer law would be one which gave an author a hundred years ' right in his book . The valueless books would he no more valuable if they enjoyed a perpetual copyright ; but if a book has vitality enough to last fortytwo years it may fairly hope to live a hundred , and after that , if it is still alive , it ought to be everybody 's property . I am communist enough for that . In considering the material conditions of authorship in America , it is impossible to leave out of account the absence of an international copyright . It has a great deal more to do with literature than a tariff on books has ; and since , when the tariff was in danger , a few authors came forward and lent a hand to their partners , I think it would he a retort courteous if the publishers were to show a little more diligence in securing such an international copyright as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty years . Upon the plane of commerce it is clear that the conditions for free trade in literature are much sounder now than they ever have been . In the exchange of literary wares there is a closer approach to even terms . Upon the higher ground of the recognition of rights , it is to he hoped that the nation is prepared to treat its own authors with dignity , even if it he indifferent to the fortunes of foreigners . The assumption in copyright is that the nation has a final proprietorship in its literature ; it grants a monopoly for a term as an encouragement and protection to its authors . Very // well ; let it take a step in advance by extending that copyright in time to a hundred years , and by extending it in space so as to make it cover English speaking countries . But it can not do this last without reciprocity , and of all the methods proposed I know of none so simple as the change of the copyright law by which persons and not citizens may take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country ; but such priority need be no more than a day . Yet when I begin to think of international copyright , my mind always flies back to the immensely larger interests involved in national copyright . The American author who secures a hearing in England has first found his audience in this country . The English sometimes please themselves with the complacent notion that American literature exists after it has been indorsed in England . The notion does them no harm , and it amuses us . Perhaps we have sometimes imagined that we have made the reputation of English authors . Really , an author is made out of much the same stuff as his readers . I have suggested that the university may render needed help to authors engaged upon work which promises little pecuniary return , but the system of schools which prevails , with variations upon one common plan throughout the United States offk 's a more important aid to authorship in America by supplying readers . It is the absence of a class of readers which has affected the conditions of authorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers which ought to affect those conditions still more , powerfully . The immediate outlook is not especially encouraging . We have , no doubt , a vast body of people who can read , but their reading is largely confined to newspapers . rhe lever to raise this mass of indifferent readers is to be found in the system which has hitherto formed them . The introduction of a high order of lit VOL . LI . - NO. 308. 52 erature. into the common schools is a itiovement which has begun , and if it be carried forward will have more effect upon authorship in America than all other causes combined . It has not been possible hitherto , because there has been no native literature at the service of the schools . Now , the accumulation of a body of prose and poetry , with its origin iii national life , has become a substantial foundation upon which a love of literature may be built . It is difficult for the older readers in America to-day to comprehend the significance of the change which is goiiig on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from native sources . It is not so with the young people of today . They find already existing a body of American classics , and unless I misread the signs of the times these books are to have a profound influence in the education of Americans . They are to constitute the humane letters of the common school , and it is impossible to measure the power which they will exert in enlarging and lifting the mental life of the people . So far as authors are concerned , the effect , as I have said , will be to give them more readers . The gracious lives of the elder American writers will pass into the fortunes of the younger men , not only by the direct influence of their thought and art , but through the indirect service which they have rendered to noble literature . It was theirs to make this literature at home in America , and a familiarity with it is to be one of the great conservative forces in American life . There will always be more room and welcome for authors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , when one sums up the conditions of authorship in America to-day , is not the final and comprehensive one to be found in the existence of America itself ? I mean an America which stands for a distinct , resolute power in history , having its own organic // life , planted between the great , oceans , hospitable to all influences . There are not wanting signs of a conscious life which breathes through literature : the new and ardent devotion to our own history is one sign ; the disposition to make fresh examinations of foreign life and ancient literature is another . One may easily stray away from the material conditions of authorship in any such survey , and my wish has been chiefly to inquire into some of those material conditions ; but authorship has a way of trying to catch a breath of the upper air . it has indeed feet of clay , but it lifts a golden head .
