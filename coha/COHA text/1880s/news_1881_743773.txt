txt Judge WALLACE , of the Northern District of New-York , has rendered another decision involving the validity of the law under which bank shares have been assessed in this State for several years . It will perhaps be necessary to a clear understanding of the case to recall once more the unfortunate experience of the act of 1866 , which provided for the assessment of bank shares as personal property at the ordinary rate of taxation , the banks advancing the tax and recouping it from the dividends due to stockholders . The question was raised whether the stockholders were entitled to a deduction for debt as in the case of other personal property . Attorney-General HILLHOUSE gave it as his opinion that such was not the intent of the law , and Assessors accordingly allowed no deductions . The National Exchange Bank of Albany resisted the collection of the tax , litigation ensued , and the case was carried to , the Court of Appeals , which sustained the view of the law of 1866 held by the AttorneyGeneral . Then the matter was carried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tax was levied in violation of the provisions of the Federal law , which permitted the taxation of bank shares , but not at a higher rate than was imposed on other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the State . The Supreme Court accepted the interpretation of the act of 1866 put upon it by the Court of Appeals as the true one , but decided that it was in conflict with Federal law in so far as it permitted no deduction for debt , as in the case of other moneyed capital . It did not distinctly state that the law was wholly void , and it was the opinion of Attorney-General WARD that it was still valid , but that in proceeding under it deductions for debt would have to be allowed in assessing bank shares . The All  --  any bank continued its resistance , and brought suit to restrain the collection of taxes last year under this law , although deductions for debt were allowed . This was the case decided by Judge WALLACE at Syracuse last November , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1866 was wholly void . An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court . The decision just , rendered is in a suit brought to recover from the Receiver of Taxes of the city of Albany the amount paid by the National Exchange Bank from Aug. 11 , 1874 , to May 22 , 1879 , aggregating $61,991 20 . This decision is also in favor of the plaintiff , the Assignee of the President of the Albany bank , in whose name the suit was brought , and again declares the act of April 23 , 1866 , " void so far as it authorized or purported to authorize the assessment and taxation of shares in banking associations incorporated , under the laws of the United States . " This is presumed to affect only the shareholders in banks which , like that at Albany , resisted the collection of the tax and took steps for the assertion of their rights . Millions of taxes were collected , and probably can not be recovered , for which there was no legal warrant . The cases thus far referred to affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a new law last year . Now the question to be tested is whether the new law will stand a thorough judicial examination . One of the cases in which Judge WALLACE submitted decisions at Albany on Thursday was brought by the Albany City National Bank to restrain the collection of taxes assessed tinder the act of 1880 . The injunction was granted , but not on the ground that the law is invalid for conflict with the Federal statute . The assessment was declared void because it was not put upon the roll before Sept. 1 , as required by the law , but was subsequently attached in a separate schedule . The act of 1880 has yet to be put to the test , but its validity is by no means undisputed . Suits have been instituted in this City which will in time bring it under judicial scrutiny , and probably the Supreme Court of , the United States will sooner or later determine more . accurately the power of States to tax the shares of national banks . But a quicker solution of the difficulty might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the taxing power ought to be not only more clearly defined , but greatly simplified . They are national corporations , and are subject to taxation by national authority on their capital not invested in Government bonds , on their circulation , and on their deposits . Besides this , the ? States are authorized to lay a tax on the shares , if not at a higher rate than is imposed on " other moneyed capital . " This is an authority that has been exercised without mercy , and the only question even now seems to be , not what is just or expedient , but what is permitted by the Federal statute . There is no justice or expediency in the taxation of bank shares at all . Shares in other corporations are not taxed as such , but these are pounced upon because easily accessible . There may justly be a tax on capital , on business , on receipts , or on tangible property , but what are bank shares They represent capital , but they are not capital ; neither are they tangible property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deducted proportionately from the valuation of the shares as part of the property represented . The rest is in the capital , most of which is invested in Government bonds , ordinarily exempt from taxation . The actual property and capital should be subject to a fair measure of taxation , but why the certificates of stock more than those of other corporations ? And what is the " other moneyed capital , " on a level with which the Federal statute apparently intended to place that invested in bank shares , so far as State taxation is concerned ? Other corporations ate taxed on capital or receipts and on real estate and tangible personal property , but there is no assessment of their shares in . the hands of individual holders . The Federal statute gave the States the hint on which they have acted , but it is a question whether it is possible to assess bank shares by themselves , as if they were property , apart from the capital represented and in use , and at the same time conform to the restriction laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
