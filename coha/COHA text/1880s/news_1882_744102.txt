txt Buying a business is risky . To lose a few hundred dollars in purchasing a stock and good-will of a city store is nearly as easy as it is to throw away five or ten thousand in Wall-street . ? But those who lose in buying a business are more entitled to sympathy than is an amateur speculator , for they are really in search of an honest employment in which they can be useful to the community- , and spend their money to obtain . one ; and the cheats practiced upon them are often so ingenious that it is not strange they are deceived . Accordingly , we are glad to chronicle a decision lately rendered by the English Court of Appeal in favor of purchasers of good-wills . The business which was offered for sale in this instance was a law practice . The good-will of a professional man is much oftener a'subject of sale in England than in this country , and advertisements of a law or medical practice are common there . Accordingly there was naught strange or unusual in the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law Times : " An elderly solicitor of moderate practice , with extensive connections , in a very nopulous : town in a midland county , contemplates shortly retiring , and , having no successor , would first take as partner an efficient lawyer and advocate who would not object to purchase advertiser 's suburban residence , value ? 1,600 ; no premium for business and introduction , " &c.; This announcement impressed a certain lawyer desirous of establishing himself as indicating a very suitable opening . Accordingly he opened a correspondence and interviews with the " elderly solicitor . " In the law proceedings which ensued there was , of course , a dispute as to what the elderly solicitor said , but the proof on the whole showed a bargaining like this : Younger Solicitor. ? Suppose the house suits me ; what does the practice yield ? Elderly Solicitor. ? It is producing between ? 300 and R400 per year . Y. S. ? I should like some knowledge of what the actual receipts have been for , say , three years , to enable me to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. S. , ( producing files of bills of costs , &c.1?; Look through these papers ; they will show you my collections . Y. S. , ( after looking through the papers ) ? Why , these do not show more than ? 200 per year ! E. 4 , ( producing more papers ) ? Here are papers in business not yet closed up , enough to make up the amount . But the younger solicitor was not able to understand these records of unsettled business , and probably became rather weary of investigating papers . He decided to trust to what the old gentleman had told him and closed the bargain for the house , paid down a small deposit , moved in , and began practicing . Ho then found there was in truth scarcely any practice ; not enough , as one of the Judges afterward phrased the matter , " to pay clerk 's wages . " The second batch of papers , on after examination , showed scarcely worth of business , instead of enough to make up ? 300 . Result : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for it , and when he was sued he proved the misrepresentations about the business by way of defense . The courts have long had a doctrine that if a seller makes a false representation and the buyer trusts to it and is deceived , they will give him redress ; but that if he did not trust to the representation , but made an independent examination , and trusted to his own knowledge and judgment , then whether the seller 's representations were true or not may be of no consequence . The lawsuit between these solicitors turned , therefore , on the question whether , if one who offers a business produces a earcel of account-books , bills rendered , and other office records for the buyer to inspect , and the buyer tries to learn what he can from them , the seller can throw off all responsibility for exaggerating the income . This question does not seem difficult , yet the Judge who first heard the cause decided in favor of the elderly solicitor . The full bench of Judges have now reversed this judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in buying a business a man is not expected to be able to understand all the details of accounts and papers . He may , and this buyer evidently did , rely on what the seller tells him , and look into papers besides , and if he fails , even by inattention or want of skill to find out the whole truth , his lack of success will be no excuse to the seller . One who advertises a business for sale is not to tell lies as to its character and value , and throw on the buyer the entire responsibility by inviting him to inspect the books . And as the promise of the practice was the chief inducement toward buying the house , the purchaser ought to be released from the one trade since he was cheated in the other . This doctrine is a healthy one for New-York City , where there exists a class of speculators who make a specialty of concocting sham stores and offices for sale . Every few weeks a swindle of this nature is exposed . The speculator looks for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for a short time ; he puts in boxes and barrels , bottles and bundles , or whatever may be appropriate to represent a stock in trade ; he " cooks " a few account-books , and then advertises " business for sale . " Petty groceries , drug stores , cigar stores , and small variety shops are favorites of these dealers . The victim sees an appearance of trade , the swindler is ready with plausible answers to all questions , . the victim pays the $500 or $1,000 asked for stock and good-will , the swindler disappears , and the victim then gradually discovers that the lease shown him was a forgery , the accounts and records are bogus , the goodg in sight are in a drug store colored water and worthless herbs , or in a grocery a surface of fruits or vegetables on a bed of shavings , and the customers are imaginary . If the impostors who devote themselves to swindles of this kind could shield their traffic by exhibiting to their customer a parcel of half-intelligible papers , and challenge him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole City .
