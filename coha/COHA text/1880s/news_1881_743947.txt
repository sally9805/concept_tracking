txt The results of the mixed and stupid manner in which city business is , too often done are shown by the facts recently brodght to light in the history of the Brooklyn Board of Education . A few weeks since one BTUART , ex-Secretary of the board , was arrested on the charge of having embezzled some ten thousand dollars . He was discharged , but subsequent investigations have caused his arrest once more , and now the Controller of the city informs the board that he has " explored " the accounts of the board for a period of some ten years back , and that he finds that in that time over two hundred thousand dollars has been stolen . Of course , it is absurd to suppose that STUART stole any such sum as this without the knowledge and aid of other officers and , probably , of members of the board . For a long time the schools of the city of Brooklyn have been very unevenly managed . Some of them have been fairly good . Many have been ridiculously bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singularly confused , backward , and unsatisfactory . But its faults and defects have been attributed to an ultra-conservative influence in the board , to inefficiency , fussiness , and ignorance . There has been no suspicion that the board was corrupt , or that any of its active members or officers were so . Its general worthlessness and frequent folly and stupidity were pardoned on the ground that it was at least honest and respectable . But the foundation for this remnant of reputation is being cut from beneath it . The Board of Education in Brooklyn is a sort of independent corporation apart from the general Government of the city . Its appropriations are fixed , necessarily , but , once made , the money is expended according to the direction of the board , and there is no direct and efficient accountability for its transactions to the financial officers of the city . In the erection , furnishing , and maintenance of buildings , in the employment and payment of teachers , and in the supply of books , the money is controlled entirely by the board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board claims and has enjoyed , according to the Controller , the right to sue , and is liable in its independent character to be sued . It thus assumes all the responsibility for its expenditures , and if money is wasted , misappropriated , or stolen , it is the board and the board only that is accountable . But what does this accountability amount to ? The board is numerous ; it is not elective ; its members are generally obscure , and their conduct of business is practically unknown to the public . As in every other assembly of considerable size , the real work is done in committees , and is , in effect , done secretly . The direction of each school is in the hands of a committee , and its work is also done with no opportunity on the part of those most interested to know anything of what is done . The whole scheme , if it can be called a scheme , is a striking example of the division and consequent dissipation of responsibility . The officials who determine how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the real needs of the schools or of the way in which the money will be used . The Board of Education , which directs the schools , does so by piecemeal , necessarily accepting the reports , in substance , of the several committees , and is quite incapable of any complete and systematic supervision . The various school committees , again , wrestle with each other for preference , each exercising a considerable amount of arbitrary power . It is not singular that under such a system defalcations have finally followed in the track of confusion and imbecility . The opportunities for sharp practices have long existed . It seems that for some time they have been used , and when the good people of Brooklyn ask themselves who is to blame they will get a very unsatisfactory answer . There are numerous officials any one of whom , had he been both honest and shrewd , might have detected and stopped the stealing , but there is no one whom the voters can distinctly recognize as responsible and can bring to book . The insignificant STUART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a very poor attempt at justice for an offense which is not only of considerable magnitude as concerns the money involved , but which is peculiarly outrageous as directed against the schools . It may be that the theft will be- traced to individual members , and that they will be dealt with . But the system will remain , and there will be . no , security against the recurrence of similar scandals . The trouble lies not with the members of the board , but with the constitution ' of the board , and with the practice of scattering responsibility so that no one man 's share has any value or effect . If the present " unfortunate circumstances , " as the Controller calls them , should lead to a radical change in the school system  --  to a concentration of power and responsibility such as has been adopted for the rest of the City Government in Brooklyn :  --  the recent disgraceful developments may not be so " unfortunate " as they now seem .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
