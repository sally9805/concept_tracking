ARTICLE 11. - REMARKS ON THE PRECEDING ARTICLE . The foregoing article opens with complaints respecting the government of Yale College , which , in our judgment , have no just foundation . It concludes with the recommendation of a change which we deem inexpedient and not called for by the circumstances of the case . Mr. Young 's criticisms relate to a Corporation under which , to use his own language , the College has grown to be " an institution of learning with 115 instructors , divided among six different faculties , and with nearly 1100 students . " As the specific allegations in his article relate mainly to financial matters , it is fitting that they should be considered by the Treasurer of the College , whose ability and judgment Mr. Young has himself bighly praised . At the close of the following remarks from Mr. Kingsley 's pen , we shall add a few observations on Mr. Young 's proposal to alter radically the constitution of the governing body. - ED . NEW ENGLANDER . THE strictures which Mr. Young makes upon the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely of the " slackness , unconcern and inability " of the corporation . We think in the unfolding of these strictures he makes , for want of complete knowledge , some statements that are not borne out by the facts , and omits to state some facts which would materially alter the impression made by his statements . Mr. Young takes the history of the Observatory to illustrate the truth of his charges . He says , " For thirteen years the corporation held a piece of land given for an observatory , making no effort to utilize it and then reconveyed it to the donor , and that eight years after , the same land with an adjoining tract was again conveyed to the college for like purposes . " Here are some stateinents that are not borne out by the facts , and some facts are omitted which would alter the impression of what is stated . The facts are these . A family , whose attachment to the college has // been shown in many ways , conveyed to the corporation eight acres of land as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to obtain donations sufficient to erect the necessary buidings and to establish a fund for the support of an observatory , but without success , until the late Mr. Winchester , who had purchased from the same family about thirty acres of land adjoining the eight acres , proposed to devote his purchase to the establishment of such a fund , on condition that this purchase , together with the original eight acres , should be placed in the hands of special trustees to carry out his large-hearted plans . Then it was , and solely for this purpose , that the corporation at the request of the family , who had originally conveyed to them the eight acres , deeded back the land , that the family might convey thirty-eight acres instead of eight acres , for the use of an observatory . After a few years Mr. Winchester became satisfied that the special board of trustees was unnecessary and caused the whole property to be conveyed to the corporation . We say then that the statement that the corporation " made no effort " is not sustained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to obtain funds , and the very act of the corporation which Mr. Young apparently finds fault with , their deeding back the eight acres , shows that they were not negligent or slack or unable to see what the interest of the college required , but were ready to meet Mr. Winchester 's proposition promptly and aid him in his plans for the benefit of the college . To show still further the incorrectness of the statement that the Corporation made no effort , we add that a friend of the college was induced to offer to join Mr. Winchester in establishing such a fund , hy giving a large sum of money , which would bring the observatory more speedily into working order , but at that time Mr. Winchester preferred himself to accomplish the whole work . We think there was no slackness or negligence shown here . That this friend devoted his gifts to other departments of the college , and that Mr. Winchester found himself unable to carry out all he wished and hoped for should not be charged against the corporation . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise funds with only moderate success . One of the most valuable donations is an Equatorial of superior workmanship , the gift of a gentleman in New Haven , which is nightly doing good astronomical work . But it is said the corporation has borrowed money to build and equip the observatory  --  and is there any wrong in that ? The ob // servatory has paid interest on all the money borrowed for it , and it has a fund , now unproductive , the land given by Mr. Winchester , which will eventually more than pay the loan . That money has not been sooner realized by the sale of the land was a disappointment to Mr. Winchester as it has been to the corporation , but there can be no loss from the transaction . The affairs of the observatory have been entrusted by the corporation , subject to their ultimate decision upon all questions , to a board of managers , consisting of three professors of the college , who are especially interested in astronomical research and well acquainted with observatories in this country and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of New York , also interested in astronomy , of large financial experience ; and an active business man of New Haven , connected with the family of the late Mr. Winchester and fully cognizant of his views and intentions . These managers have their own secretary who keeps a complete record of all their proceedings , and a detailed statement of every receipt and expenditure , all of which are subject to the examination of the corporation . Thus far the corporation and these managers have acted in harmony . The typical case which Mr. Young selects to sustain his strictures on the corporation breaks down at every point . If he should extend his examination into other departments we think he would find no better success . A corporation which in fifteen years has increased its funds over 75 per cent. , which has , within the same period , secured the erection of buildings which have cost abont *7OO , OOO , and which has within the same period secured a much larger amount to be added to the productive funds of the college upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be justly charged with " slacknesss , negligence and inability . " Other charges which Mr. Young makes are that the members of the corporation do not personally examine the Treasurer 's accounts , that the Treasurer 's last report shows an excess of expenditures over receipts , and that until recently no yearly budget which should show the estimated receipts and expenses has been required to be presented to the corporation . We do not appreciate so highly as does Mr. Young the necessity of a yearly budget in past years . Yale College has always been so poor that the corporation has been compelled to allow no expenses that were not actually necessary , and sometimes no doubt those expenses which were actually necessary have been allowed when // the means of meeting them were uncertain . If by any good chance a budget could have shown a probable income which would justify the corporation in certain expenses which if not actually necessary would have been desirable , a budget would have done more good ; but when every expense must be pared down to the closest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true the Treasurer 's report shows that the corporation has spent more than its income , and Mr. Young complains that this excess of expenditure has not been provided for . In what way should it be provided for ? We understand Mr. Young to imply that it should l ) e deducted from the principal . We do not agree with him , if he would apply this rule rigidly . If there is a yearly deficit there is an advantage in showing it . If it is deducted from the principal it is covered up , it is out of sight and is likely to be forgotten . We agree that , if after sufficient trial , no way is found to meet the deficit a corresponding reduction from the principal should be made , and it undoubtedly would be made by the corporation . Such cases have arisen in the past . Until other means are exhausted it would seem better not to resort to a reduction of the funds . A manufacturing corporation with a capital of $2,000,000 , if it found at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made , would hardly cut down its capital but would trust to the business of another year to make good the loss . Yale College has futures in the liberality of its friends which it may rightfully discount . If a deficit is plainly stated , and not covered up , it appeals to the friends of the college to make it good . Mr. Young complains*that there is no " finance committee " and no examination , until recently , of the accounts of the Treasurer by any Committee of the Board . It is enough to say that the " Prudential Committee * is the finance committee , and has all the authQrity and power that any finance committee should have . That they have other powers and duties than those pertaining to financial matters is of no consequence . Abundant evidence exists in the records of this committee that while the accounts of the Treasurer were few and small , very close scrutiny of them was exercised by this committee . It was not until subsequent to 1830 that the college had any considerable amount of funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have knowledge , appeared . The productive funds of the college are stated in that report as follows : // Assets , $80,856.26 Debts , 18,000.00 Balance , $17,856.26 Income , 2,673.66 After the funds and the income increased the corporation appointed an auditor to do this business for them . For thirty years they had the services of a gentleman of proverbial integrity , who had had and continued to have large experience in examining the accounts of other corporations , and the present auditor , appointed by the corporation , is in no respect his inferior . We presume there is no large railroad corporation or bank of discount or savings , which does not do this work by appointed agents ; it may be by a committee of their own number . The wealthy capitalists and shrewd business men , who are the Directors of the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company , do not examine either personally or by a committee of their own number the accounts of that great corporation . They employ two auditors who do this work for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board is satisfied with this auditing . The corporation of Yale College does the same thing . To suppose that the Prudential Committee or any other committee of this corporalion will devote the necessary time , say a week , to the personal examination of the Treasurer 's account , is to suppose something which can not be expected . We could not but smile at the statement " on the authority of Mr. Kingsley himself that for one hundred and thirty years the treasurers of the college gave little time to the duties of their office . " For one hundred and thirty years the college had too small an amount of funds , as we have already shown , to require the constant services of a Treasurer . For a long time the students ' bills were collected by the instructors , as was the case in the other colleges of the country . Hon. James Hu1lhou*e was Treasurer of the college for forty-eight years . His service terminated at his death in 1832 . He was at the same time a Senator in Congress and Commissioner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time to the details of this treasurership . His services , however , in behalf of the college with the Legislature of the State and with influential men in the State were every great . During his term of office the duties were performed by an able and efficient assistant . // Mr. Young thinks that the inefficient management of the college may have led Mr. Peabody and Mr. Sheffield to place their large gifts in the hands of separate boards of trustees . Possibly this thought came into his mind from recollecting some of the things that were said at that day , that " ministers , as a class , are men of second rate ability , " " inferior men , " " inefficient in thought , " " narrow minded , " and in " the true sense of the word uncultivated . " How strange such language sounds to ns . It may have had influence on some men . In the case of Mr. Peabody , however , we think it was his want of knowledge , rather than his knowledge , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been accustomed to such trusts in England where a large part of his business life had been spent , and where such trusts are very common . He established a similar one at Harvard College , in which case Mr. Young will hardly assign the same reason , also one in Baltimore and we belieye some others . In Mr. Sheffield 's case we have good reason to believe that if the character of the corporation had influence with him , about which we know nothing , other reasons had great weight . And we may affirm without fear of contradiction that the motive which Mr. Young suggests had no weight with Mr. Sheffield 's townsmen , Henry Farnam , Augustus R. Street , E. E. Salisbury , and Philip Maret , nor with T. D. Porter , A. E. Silliman , and H. T. Morgan of the city of New York , nor with S. B. Chittenden , F. Marquand , D. T. Coit , H. Winkley , and James T. Dickinson , nor with many others , who have given valuable gifts to the college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant of the parable , becanse it has been claimed for them that they have lost none of the funds entrusted to their care ; forgetting that in a recent number of the New Englauder he himself stated that they had received a fair rate of interest on their investments , so that on his own showing their talent had not been idle . He says very justly , " that such a claim would not be made by any one who is familiar with financial matters . " We suppose this claim , which has been repeated . many times , and sometimes by persons who should have known better , has grown out of a remark made many years ago at an alumni meeting at Boston by Professor Thacher " that the college corporation could repay all the gifts that it had ever received . " This is a correct statement . // By close economy , " so close , " as Professor Thacher stated in the same speech , " as to scrimp the professors ' salaries " and by a rise in values the corporation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has never lost anything , in the nearly two hundred years of its history , can not be credited by any one " familiar with financial matters . " It is undoubtedly true that very great care and prudence have from the first been exercised in the management of its funds , and the losses have been few and small . In the language of President Gilman , " The history of Yale College is one of the wonders of the land . " HENRY C. KINGSLEY . We offer some editorial comments on certain topics touched upon in Mr. Young 's article , to which Mr. Kingsley 's observations do not directly relate . Mr. Young brings forward a new project for remodeling the Corporation . It is less than a year since a very different scheme-that of choosing a larger number of members by the graduates-was proposed . A pamphlet was circulated , advocating it , and it was announced that several classmeetings had voted in its favor . Now , as far as we can discover , that scheme , which was not received with favor by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , we have in the article before us an entirely new and very diverse plan for altering the constitution of the college . On the legal question of the meaning and intent of the charter , there is no occasion to dwell . The opinion that , since l*45 , the clerical body has simply exercised a privilege , but obeyed no requirement of law , in filling their vacancies as they have done , has been fully examined and confuted on the pages of this Review. * If there are those who still think , that , during the last one hundred and forty years , as far as the obligations imposed by the charter are concerned , laymen residing anywhere , and professing any religion , or abjuring all religion , might have been legally chosen in the room of the ministers , they must , of course , be left to entertain this view . Since , however , it is a view the opposite of that which the Corporation itself has always held , and holds now , we do not see what is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dropping the legal point , we take issue with the writer of the foregoing paper on the question of the desirableness of any such * See President Porter 's Article , Nov. , 1855 , and the Articles by Mr. William Bliss , May , 1882 , and May and July , 1884. // change as he recommends . He proposes to have no restrictions in the choice of the " life-members " of the Corporation , except that they shall be graduates of the college . In the first place , this project , if carried out , would destroy the religious constitution of the college . It would sweep away that main provision for the maintenance of the Christiau character of the institution , which the founders ordained and their successors have guarded and cherished . This safeguard we deem to be of inestimable value . Without it , the college could never have attained to its great usefulness and success . We might properly insist on the wrong that would be done by so revolutionary a step to the numerous benefactors in the past who would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yale College was established by Congregational churches , or by ministers representing them . Under these auspices , it has grown up to its present strength and distinction . The author of the article on which we are commenting is connected , we believe , with the Episcopal Church . If there existed a college like Yale , standing in the same relation to that Church as Yale stands to the Congregational body ; iF there existed such a college , founded , nurtured , and administered to the same extent for nearly two centuries , by representatives of that Church ; if , in the line of its legitimate expansion , it had built up , as a part of it , a training-school for its clergy , the largest , in point of numbers , of all their divinity schools , and possessed of property amounting to at least a half million dollars ,  --  then it would be interesting to know how the proposition to take such a college out of the hands of Episcopalians would be relished by the members of that body . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so broad and catholic a spirit , and with such entire freedom from a sectarian policy , as to give rise to the idea that it belongs to anybody and everybody , that the legal successors of its founders are actually guilty of a kind of usurpation , and that they ought to hand over their authority to another body of men . It is high time for such illusions to be dispelled . It is not , however , be it observed , on account of the legal and moral right which inheres in the members of a certain Christian body , that we attach so high an importance to the degree of control that pertains to them in the governing board . It is because , in our judgment , this feature is the best guaranty for a truly Christian influence as // 178 Futin*e Policy of Yale College . opposed to sectarianism on the one hand , and to infidelity or indifferentism on the other , in the administration of the College . In the second place , such a change in the Corporation as Mr. Young recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hope of gaining any substantial advantage by it we regard as chimerical . Ministers are not alone in respecting the Scriptural maxim , " By their fruits ye shall know them . " We challenge the production of an instance of more sagacious and successful management by the Trustees of any college than is furnished by the long history of Yale under its governing board . Considering the means at the disposal of the College , its growth and its influence have been without a parallel . This unexampled success is due , in a large degree , if we may coin a word of barbarous sound , to the levelheadedness of its clerical guardians . They have known how to select able teachers ; they have been wise enough to trust them ; they have not tried to do too much , but have exerted their authority judiciously and firmly when it was needed . With such increased unification and organization as the progress of the institution calls for , and with an efficient executive administration , there is no reason why the future career of the college should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no danger of losing ground by adhering to its religious constitution . By so doing , it will continue to command the confidence of the public . Where one giver is alienated by such a course , fifty will be retained or secured . Above all , by so doing it will accomplish the purpose for which it was established , and do best the work appropriate to a great seat of learning . There are various indications that this is the conviction of a great majority of its graduates . The alumni , as a body , while they have no sympathy with any " theological bias " which stands in the way of a truly scientific spirit and with a truly catholic management of a great university , are equally without sympathy with an anti-theological bias which , to say the least , is equally unreasonable . The idea of Mr. Young that the authorities of Yale College have shown a want of respect for the views of the graduates , seems strange when it is remembered that only fifteen years ago the Corporation , of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six members of their body . Is not this fact of itself a sufficient reply to such an imputation ? That the alumni members have been chilled or overawed by the presence of their // 179 clerical associates , is an observation not complimentary to the graduate members , and one that can hardly be seriously meant . Fault has been found in some quarters with a reference made by a writer in the New Englander to the graduates of colleges as " beneficiaries . " This term was used not in the least in an offensive implication , but as literally descriptive of the fact . We take it that Chief Justice Marshall did not make a mistake in the Dartmouth College case , when he designated colleges as " eleemosynary " institutions . What are all their large endowments for , except to enable them to furnish young men an education at a rate below its cost ? If the graduates of Yale were to give back to the College the difference between their tuition-fees and the total expense of carrying forward the College , including the interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries , etc. , the College Treasurer would have to enlarge his vaults . This is a simple matter of fact . We do not state it , however , as implying that it is the sole or the principal claim of the college to the loyalty and affection of her sons . We are all in common " beneficiaries " of Alma Mater . This does not divest us of the privilege of giving her good counsel . If we make ourselves benefactors , we acquire an additional right to make our opinions and preferences known to the respon. sible gnardians of the institution to whose support we have contributed . At the same time , our relation as graduates is no warrant for anything like dictation on our part , much less for the claim to govern in the room of the founders and their legal successors . Vague and indefinite promises of gifts to be made if this or that change takes place , are of little account . The confidence which the character of the Corporation now , as in the past , inspires among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a solid and sufficient reason for keeping Yale on its old foundations.
