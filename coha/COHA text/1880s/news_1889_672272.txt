txt The facts brought out yesterday at - the annual meeting of the American Cotton NI Trust are interesting to those who have tudied the growth of such organizations Ind instructive to investors . The defenders of Trusts have had a great deal to say Lbout the savinifin cost of producition that s assured by combination . While it is not lenied that the cost of production may be ' educed by manufacturing on a largo scale , . t does not follow that such a saving will be made by a Trust in which scores , of seemugly independent concerns are combined ; o prevent competition in the selling price ) f goods and . the buying price of raw material . The reduction of cost will depend upon the plan of the organization , the charlcter of the management of it , the aims Ind practices of its officers , and other con-ditions , The Cotton Oil Trust has a certificate capital of $42,185,200 , and its not earnings E or the last fiscal year were only $1,655,783 , or less than 4 per cent , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our memory is not at fault the holders of its certificates have received only one dividend , and that was only 1 per cent . If it wore true that by combining the 85 mills in the Trust the cost of production was considerably reduced , it would have been possible for the Trust to undersell the independent mills and still make a good profit . But it is well known that in the last two years the number of independent mills has been greatly increased . It was reported by the liffiatufact. wren ' Record on July 13 that there were then in operation , or in process of construction , 213 mills , and the Trust had less than 90 . It appears , therefore , that the establishment of new independent mills was invited rather than discouraged by the prices fixed by the Trust , and it is understood that the Trust was constrained in its own defense to buy the oil of the largest of the independent mills at a price that yielded large profits - to the independent mill while it has been a cause of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out an example of a marked reduction of the cost of production by the operations of a Trust , as compared with the cost in independent mills , they will not select the Cotton Oil Trust . And when some of our contemporaries are moved again to commend what they call " the industrial stocks " to investors , or even to suggest , as the Sun , did not long ago , that workingmen might profitably transfer their earnings from the savings banks to the certificates of " industrial Trusts , " they will give the Cotton Oil Trust a wide berth . If ' any workingman was induced to exchange his little stock of savings for a few Cotton Oil certificates at $60 , or a few Sugar Trust certificates at $125 , or a few Lead Trust certificates at $34 , he must regret his action now , when the market prices of these certificates are , respectively , $33 , $72. and $19 75 . It Is notorious that the certificates of these Trusts have been the footballs of speculation , and it is the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have operated in them are persons interested as officers or Trustees in the management of the organizations . Speculation in these certificates has been stimulated and has grown until sometimes the sales in the " unlisted " department of the Exchange have exceeded the sales of all regularly listed properties . On Thursday the sales of the certificates of the throe Trusts mentioned above equaled the sales of all the listed stocks . Yesterday the sales of the three Trusts were 208,505 out of a total of 379,557 . But so far as the buyer outside of the ring is concerned these organizations are nothing better than so many " blind pools , " for they make no reports to the public , and even the certificate holders may be surprised at an annual meeting by a reduction of promised earnings from $2,600,000 to $1,600,000 , as was shown at the Cotton Oil Trust 's annual meeting . We have heretofore directed attention to the action of the Governors of the Stock Exchange in promoting speculation in these " blind pools " by admitting the certificates to an " unlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter deserves more attention than they have given to it .
