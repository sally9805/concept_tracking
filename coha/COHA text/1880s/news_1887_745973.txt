txt The Controller of the Currency told some wholesome truths to the merchants at , the dinner on Monday evening . The chief of them was that if the national banking system were not in existence to-day , it would hardly be established by the national representatives . And the prejudice that would prevent its establishment , he said , was one to the feeling in the remoter parts of the Union that the system was a sort of monopoly of which New-York had the chief advantage . He added that from his own intimate and necessary acquaintance with the facts he was convinced that this feeling was entirely unfounded . It certainly is unfounded , but it is with equal certainty very deeply fixed in the minds of a large number of people . The origin of the prejudice is , of course , complex , but there are several facts connected with it which it is worth while to bear in mind as bearing upon the future , the more so as a just view of them will show that the prejudice is bound gradually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice was the fact that for some time after the creation of the national banking system banking capital was more plentiful in the East , and . especially in New-York , than in the West . The banks were therefore more numerous and stronger here than elsewhere . The seaboard cities , and particularly New York , were then the great distributing centres of the country , and the general relation of the East to the West was that of creditor and debtor . During this period bank circulation was very profitable , and there was much more of it in the East than in the West . When , therefore , the Democratic Party , in a , desperate . effort to raise an issue not connected with the war , started on Mr. VALLANDIGHAM 'S " new departure " and called for the payment of the bonds in greenbacks , the national banks were the most conspicuous objects of attack . They were the largest holders of bonds ; they were reaping a rich harvest from their use of these bonds as a basis of bank circulation ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the country . TO these facts must be added that under the law as it then existed note circulation was not only limited in amount , but was distributed in fixed proportions among the various States . Here , then , were the inevitable jealousy of the debtors toward the creditors , the intense prejudice aroused by long political struggles in which most of the creditors were on . the winning side , and a certain amount of real , though unintended , discrimination under the law in favor of the latter . Presently , as the hold of the Republican Party on the country relaxed , and there sprang up divisions in doubtful States and districts , the Greenbackers ' movement , embodying the intensest hostility to the banks , was coquetted with by leaders who ought to have been above it ? by Mr. SHERMAN , for instance , on the one side , and Mr. THunmAN on the other ? so that the sentiment of the majority of the country found no direct and adequate expression in. either party . These were the chief elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks . But , as we have indicated , these elements are necessarily and steadily losing in force . There is no longer any such marked distinction of debtor and creditor between the East and the West . The seaboard cities , though of course distributing more goods than ever to the trade of the country , have no such relative share in distribution as formerly , the Western cities , Chicago , - St. Louis , Cincinnati , and others in less degree , now importing directly in bond . C apital has increased at a very rapid rate in the West , more rapidly in proportion than in the East . National banking is no longer restricted , the last trace of monopoly having disappeared a dozen years since . The increase in the number of national banks is large , is away from the seaboard , and is in small banks serving local needs . The political situation has changed more in reality than the attitudes of the parties show . It is quite possible that Congress would not now consent to establish the national banking system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The development and perfecting of the system is checked by the prejudice still existing , but the system so answers great and lasting needs that , in its essential features , it is likely to be ureserved.
