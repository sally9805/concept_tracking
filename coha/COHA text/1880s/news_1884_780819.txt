txt The vicissitudes of life are well illustrated in a citizen of this city , who now makes an humble living as a barber . August Schelpert was the son of well-to-do Ger-man Barents . He was given a thorough military education , one of his classmates being Franz Sigel . On their graduation , out of a class of 50 Schelpert stood fifth and Sigel forty-seventh . They were assigned as Lieutenants to the same regiment . Then came the troublous times of 184S , when Germany was rocked in the cradle of contention . The young men of the Fatherland were longing for a Government which would represent the greatness of the German name . and were anxious to get rid of the innumerable princelings who devoured the fat of the land . This feeling spread to the army , and the younger officers , almost without exception , were ripe for revolution . Their desire was not so much to vindicate the spirit of liberty as it was to see a grand German Army , whose number and prowess should render it invincible .

The eloquence of Schurz played havoc with the discretion of the two Lieutenants , and the three found it necessary to seek flight under the cover of night . After several narrow escapes from capture the three took ship for New-York , where they had to begin the battle of life under new influences . Sigel went West , where his countrymen welcomed him , and when the war for the Union began his name became the watchword for the thousands of brave Germans who rallied to the defense of the land of their adoption . Thus fame and comfort came to him . Carl Schurz also sought the great centres of German population , went to Missouri , finally reached the Senate , and from the Senate Chamber he still advanced to a place at the council table of President Hayes . He was the only man who ever held a seat in the Cabinet as the peculiar representative of the foreign element .

Backed by no constituency of his own race , as were his two com-panions in the West , he was spoken of as the only Dutchman in the town . As a temporary expedient he resorted to the razor , and for yews shaved exSenator joshuaHill . He was alone , with no incentive to spur up his ambition , and timorous of seeking more congenial surroundings . In his solitude he indulged in his love for natural history , and never allowed a day to pass in which he did not add to his cabinet of insects . As a result he has now three large frames containing such a collection and variety of shade . size , and subject as is not to be met with elsewhere . It has cost him 30 years of toil and 30 years of such intelligence as but few men possess . He has been offered large sums for his treasures , but with childlike devotion he refuses to part with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , where the least fortunate of the three young rebels is employed .
