TARPON FISHING IN FLORiDA . By Robert Grant . is likely that to ninetynine persons out of every hundred , even though piscatonally inclined , the terms " tarpon " and " tarpon fishing " will convey no meaning . Five years ago no one could boast of having taken a tarpon with rod and reel , and although the sport is now tolerably familiar to devoted anglers , the average individual who counts on getting away for a fortnight in the course of the year to kill something in the fish line is still likely to inquire " What is a tarpon ? " The tarpon is a fish , known to naturalists as Jfiliegalops thrissoides , ranging from fifty to two hundred pounds in weight and from four and one-half to over six feet in length ; not unlike a cross between a huge herring  --  to which family it belongs  --  and a huge blue-fish in its general proportions ; with large , protuberant eyes and an ugly mouth that opens on the fish 's nose , so to speak , covered on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of a jowl . Behind , and contiguous to the dorsal fin , is a sort of bony bayonet called the " feather , " some eight or nine inches long , that protrudes into the air in the direction of the tail , forming an acute angle with the line of the back . The body is // covered with brilliant argentine scales , above the eye . Some anglers have seen which give the fish the effect of having fit to perpetuate their triumphs by haybeen laved in silver , and which have ing specimens of these monsters mounted won for it the title of the " Silver King . " on a panel , which is accomplished by These scales , which are circular and splitting the fish in two , leaving an ample slightly scolloped on the part of the edge margin at top and bottom and treating that is overlapped , vary from one inch to the necessary half with arsenic and other condiments prized by thetaxidermist . They form magnificent trophies for the hail or diningroom of a large house ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below than above the average weight of the fish , one finds difficulty in believing that it has been captnred with rod and reel .

In a book on three inches and qwq sometimes taken with a harpoon or seines . " Since this declaration was made , evidently in full sincerity , probably no less than one hundred tarpon have been killed with the rod and reel , to say nothing of the unscientific hand-line . To Mr. W. H. Wood , a New York gentleman , belongs the honor of having been the first to capture one with sportsman 's tackle ; an event to which the London Obsercer of August 25 , 1886 , refers in the following enthusiastic language : " Here , at last , there is a rival to the black bass of North America , to the Silaru.s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and possibly even to the sturgeon , were that monster capable of taking a hook and holding it in its leachlike sucker of a mouth . Sportsmen may yet go to Florida for the tarport , as they now go to the Arctic zone for reindeer , walrus , and musk-ox . " ( By the way , why does the Observer claim for Europe sole proprietary rights in the salmon ? ) lIJp to the present date the largest tarpon taken with rod and reel was one killed by Mr. John G. Hecksher , of New York , which is recorded on the score-book at St. James City as weighing one hundred and eighty - four pounds . Somewhat larger fish have been taken with the handline and in seines , but there is no authentic testimony that they exceed two hundred pounds . The field of battle is the sea-coast of southwestern Florida . The tarpon , or tarpum ( for the fish is known popularly by either name ) * has its habitat ( according to the valuable compilation " The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the Gulf of Mexico , rang-ingnorthto Cape Cod , and south at least to northern Brazil . It is somewhat abundant in the West Indies , and stragglers have been taken as far to the eastward as the Bermudas . It is the " Silver-fish " of Pensacola , the " Grande lEcaille " ( Large-scale fish ) , or " Grandy Kyc , " as it is pronounced , and sometimes spelled , and the " Savanilla " of Texas . Those interested in the fish from the angler 's stand-point have confined their attention to the waters of Charlotte Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico and southwestern coast of Florida . Here the fish are found in comparative abundance , though the same is unquestionably true of that coast still farther to the south from Punta Rassa to Whitewater Bay ; for the sport is still in its infancy , and comparatively few fishermen have made investigations on their own account , being content to try their forSaw-fish on the Pier at St. James City , Fla. // tune where others have been successful . There seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpon is known on the eastern coast of Florida , its favorite waters are the Gulf of Mexico ; and whoever wishes to catch it is likely to fare better there than if he goes to Jupiter , Lake Worth , and the otherpoints on the southeastern coast so deservedly famed for fishing of many other kinds . At present there are two recognized tarpon fishing-grounds , or rather fishingcamps-for the waters fished by the frequenters of each are adjacent-St . James City and Punta Ilassa . Looking at the map of southwestern Florida , you will notice , at some distance to the southward of Tampa , Charlotte Harbor , lying between the 26th and 27th parallels of latitude , which extends no less than thirty miles from north to south , and varies from ten to fifteen miles in Hotel at St. Jamna City .

It is protected on its westerly side by the islands or keys Gasparilla , La Costa , Captiva , and Sanibel , which form a sort of natural barrier against the storms in the Gulf of Mexico ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen miles in length and from two to four in breadth , on the southerly end of which is St. James City , so called , a village that owes its present flourishing condition to the enthusiasm of tarpon fishermen . Opposite to it , to the southeast , on the mainland , and but a few miles distant , is Punta Rassa , the other resort . Excepting yachtsmen who live on board their vessels and cruise along the coast , persons desirous to kill a tarpon have hitherto made their head-quarters at one of these two places . At St. James City , which is moderately tropicalm its vegetation  --  and which is rapidly being made more so by the transplantation of baby lime , lemon , pineapple , banana , guava , cocoanut , and other plants calculated to inspire the interest of Northerners-there is a comfortable hotel maintained by Northern proprietors . It is a delightful spot from the angler 's point of view ; the winter climate is perfect , and the fishing of all kinds is excellent , including a large variety of fish able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reel  --  to say nothing of sharks , Jew-fish , and other monsters only too ready to carry off all one 's line and disappear without showing themselves above water . Ladies can accompany their husbands and brothers without risk of being otherwise than very comfortable , or even of being bored , unless it is by the everlasting discussion as to the habits of the " Silver King " and the proper mode of capturing him , which goes on incessantly . Punta Rassa has equal advantages in the way of climate and facilities for fish , and is frequented by many of the most successful tarpon fishermen . The " Tarpon House " there is distinctly a sportsman 's resort , as the accommodations , though comfortable , are as yet primitive . To reach either of these places you take the train from Jacksonville to Punta Gorda by way of the Jacksonville , Tampa &amp; Key West , and the Florida Southern Railroads , a twelve The Cast . // qwq and our Northern winter most severe ; but , purely from the stand-point of sport , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely one is to catch tarpon . To be sure , the flies may then be disagreeable and the weather uncomfortably warm ; but , on the other hand , it will not be necessary to pass days of anxious waiting for the wind to change and the water to rise to a proper temperature . Let it be added that , though the hotel . at St. James City has hitherto been closed early in April , Mr. Schultz has his " Tarpon House " at Punta Hassa open all the year round . I found that up to my arrival , on March 14th , only nine tarpon had been taken this season at St. James City , and not quite so many , according to report , at Punta IRassa . Of these nine , five had fallen to one rod . There were about twenty fishermen in the house , several of whom had been there since early in January . One gentleman had fished for three successive seasons without landing a tarpon . The sport is still so thoroughly in its infancy that I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested . I had been advised at home to bring with me an ordinary eight and a half foot ash sea-bass rod in three pieces , but I was very shortly convinced that a rod in one piece is much more trustworthy , as the strain upon the joints while playing a tarpon is , at times , very severe . The choice of the wood is largely a matter for individual preference or caprice , though I believe that a welltested bamboo can not be excelled for this kind of fishing . Some of the rods were composed of a short butt and one long joint , which is preferable to the three-jointed rod , but less effective than a single piece . The length varies from seven to eight and a half feet ; those anglers who aim to kill their fish in the shortest possible time use as near an approach to a stick as the sportsman-like spirit of the locality will tolerate without demur ; but the ambition should now rather be to increase the length and suppleness of the rod , so as to adopt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has never yet , I believe , been successfully tried on the " Silver King . " One needs a large multiplying reel VoL . YI. - 18 that will hold comfortably two hundred yards of line , and is furnished with a click that can be turned on and off at will . Even if the socket in which it is set contains a pin , the reel should be lashed on , and a leather drag should be securely stitched to one of the inner bars of the reel , whether one uses a thumb-stall or not . It will also be found convenient to have the handle long enough to protect one 's lingers from contact with the side of the reeL I used a fifteen-thread linen line , which is strong enough-though most of tho fishermen at St. James City were supplied with eighteen and twenty-one thread ; and for a hook one can not improve on a 10/0 Dublin bend , Limerick forged and ringed . The serious point of controversy , and the one which still remains to be solved , is as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hook . The tarpon has ' a bony mouth , in which no hook will take firm hold , and it is therefore absolutely necessary to let the fish gorge the bait in order to have any chance of securing him . Moreover , although the tarpon has no teeth , its lips , or the flaps which clothe either cheek , and which at the corners become veritable " scissors , " are so excessively hard and corrugated that the ordinary line would chafe off or be snipped off in a very short time . It is necessary , therefore , to supplement the line with some sort of snood , about twenty-seven inches long , in order to al // low for the gorging of the hook . A variety of devices has been tried . It was thought that small chains would answer the purpose , until it was demonstrated that sharks and kindred pests , which are just as likely to take the bait as a tarpon , can not be got rid of without cutting the line , whereas they will immediately bite off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , that the tarpon is apt to feel the chain and to throw out the bait before it is gorged . At any rate , experienced anglers have discarded them . The present judgment is in favor of a laid cotton line that is practically a cod line of i-inch or even k-inch diameter . This , it is claimed , will endure the action of the tarpon 's lips for a long period , and yet yield instantly to the teeth of a shark . But while it has proved fairly satisfactory , I was advised by the gentleman who had landed five out of the nine tarpon taken this season , to wrap my i-inch snood with fine copper wire . This I did , although some of the other fishermen shook their heads , declaring that a shark would not be able to cut the wire ; but my adviser was of the contrary opinion , though he was inclined to believe that a *-inch cod-line , tightly laid , ought to be stout enough to render wire unnecessary . The snoods which he had of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , which being loosely laid had the effect of being soft and yielding . I was disposed to think that his were the best , in spite of the fact that they would offer more direct resistance while chafing . One or two other anglers thought they had solved the difficulty by encasing the snood with rubber , on the theory that thus there would be no chance for friction ; but there was evidence that this contrivance had not proved particularly efficacious . Indeed the whole question of snoods is in embryo . It seems desirable that the cotton snoods should be blackened a little , so as to become , when soaked , as near the color of the water as possible . As tarpon are shy fish , one can not be too careful of frightening them . I was called with the re*t , on the morning after my arrival , so as to be able to get away from the house at about seven . There is said to be no advantage in an early start , except that the first boats off obtain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flood tide than at any especial time of day . Each angler has his man and boat , an ordinary lap-streak rowboat about eight feet in length , such as is commonly used at sea-side resorts . There is , of course , a considerable choice in guides , and it is important for a novice to get a skilful boatman who knows the grounds . The hotel is about onethird of a mile from the wharf , and for the convenience of everybody a wagonet and pair makes trips perpetually for a trifling remuneration . The pier , as at Punta Gorda , juts out several hundred yards , and from the end of it sheep's-head are taken in profusion . Only a few days before my arrival a large leopard shark had been hooked and landed from the same place . The tarpon grounds lie anywhere from two to eight miles from the pier . My boatman - a white man , as most of the boatmen at St. James City areadvised our trying the nearest , Matalacha Pass , as it was called . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oyster-bed bars in the shallower water on the edge of the channeL The fish come in with the tide and follow the winding channel , which runs close to the bars . The whole harbor is intersected by these oyster-beds , and there are many sand-keys and numerous islands completely covered with mangrove bushes , which seem to spring out of the sea , so deeply are the roots immersed . The mangrove is extremely prolific , and is largely in excess of all other growths in this neighborhood . I anchored by chance not far from the gentleman who had killed the five tarpon , and very soon another angler took up a position some two hundred yards in my rear . There was good fishing for all three boats , my guide said ; but it is an unwritten law that when a tarpon is hooked the other boats on the ground shall be kept out of the way of the fortunate man . I observed that each of my rivals had two rods in use , one of which was tended by the boatman , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish takes hold . // qwq ing to sacrifice the chances of big game to the paltry satisfaction of filling one 's boat with ordinary fish . I was Spartan enough to act upon his counsel , even to the extent of eating my luncheon in the boat with my finger still on the line , without going ashore . About one o'clock , when the tide turned , I shifted my position to another ground about a mile distant , where Pierce thought we should be more likely to hook fish returning with the ebb , and there I remained until nearly five o'clock , without getting a bite of any kind . It was hardly inconsistent with good fellowship that I did not feel any keen regrets to find , on reaching the hotel , that no one of the fifteen other fishermen had fared any better than I as regards tarpon . The landing-stage at the wharf was covered with small fish , of from two to ten pounds weight , but no one could boast of having even hooked a " Silver King . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little cool for good tarpon fishing . The next morning dawned warm and beautiful . I was up betimes , with the intent of visiting a more distant ground known as the " Six-mile Rookery , " where I again found myself in company with the champion fisherman of the season , whose wife , by the by , had the ill-luck , in the course of the day , to lose a twentypound channel bass , through the clumsiness of her boatman , just as it was ready for the landing-net . When not far from the ground , we noticed numerous shoals of mullet , which is a favorable sign , and presently those in the boat ahead signed to us to be still , and pointed to the water , on which the fins of a troop of tarpon were plaiuly visible . We anchored in hope , in spite of the consciousness that fish in shoals do not take the hook as readily as when travelling alone or in small detachments . We fished diligently without the least success for some time , and then shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lured by the sight of the tarpon on the surface to make fast , at first , somewhat short of the usual place . Our new anchorage was as on the day before , rather less than a fourth of a mile from shore , and in water not more than ten or twelve feet deep . Here let me add that later in the season , when the weather has grown hot , tarpon are taken in the shallow water close to the shore as well as on the edges of the oyster-reefs . I had two rods with me on this day , so as not to throw away any chances , and suggested to my man the advisability of lashing on my reels , but he scoffed at the idea . Out went the hooks well furnished with fresh mullet , and again we abandoned ourselves to waiting . Again , too , we waited in vain ; waited in the hot sun , for it was warm at last , and I was glad to don my new shadehat . We had no bites , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every now and then a tarpon would spring out of water on one side of us or the other , and fall back with a grand splash ; never very near to us , and yet sufficiently so to fill us with hope of better things , although , as an old salmon fisherman , I knew that jumping fish are not apt to bite . Still it was a great deal to be sure that they were there . Three hours passed , and it was luncheon time again . Rather despondently , I must confess , did I masticate the sandwiches , doughnuts , hard-boiled eggs , grape-fruit , and bananas which my dinner-pail contained . Just as I had finished there was another splash . A tarpon had jumped behind us not more than two hundred yards away . My companion almost immediately pulled up his anchor , but instead of moving to where the fish had jumped , as I expected , put his boat toward the shore . " He has gone ashore to fish for mullet , " said my man . Whereupon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early part of the night on the ground , for tarpon will bite by moonlight ; then the tide would be at the flood again , for now it was beginning to ebb . His guide had a seine with him , with which he was able to snare bait from the shoals of mullet by wading knee-deep and casting it over them . However , although the outlook was not promising , we shifted our anchorage to where the last tarpon had made his splash and put out our hooks again . It was unrefreshingly hot , and just about slack water , scarcely ebbing at all ; and there we sat for another hour , until , rather wearied at the monotony of // the thing , I began to practise casting , in which I was not very proficient . The other rod lay between me and my boatman , under his supervision . Iwas reeling in my line after a short abortive cast , when suddenly Pierce made an exclamation , and I turned to see his line running out rapidly , so rapidly in fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forefinger . He reached me the rod , and just after I had seized it , taking care to exert no pressure , a large silvery mass leaped out of water straight into the air and fell back again . " A tarpon , and a big fellow , " cried Pierce . In considering any statement as to the height a fish jumps out of water , it is important to know whether the narrator has included the length of the fish in making up his figures . That is to say , if a fish is six feet long and leaps from its native element so that the tip of its tail is two feet clear of the surface , good story-tellers will claim that it has jumped eight feet out of water . Others will take oath to only two . It is sufficient to state that the tarpon in question jumped either two feet or eight , according to the individual preference of the reader . At that time he had taken out with velocity about fifty yards of line ; the leap terminated his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a fourth of the amount before he started off again . Meantime my man had hauled up the anchor and we were in process of being towed by the big fish , whose frantic efforts to escape were making the reel revolve at a famous rate . From long experience with salmon , I knew enough to keep the point of my rod as high as possible consistent with the heavy strain , and the moment the rush diminished in intensity I clapped my finger on to the leather drag and resisted stoutly , reeling in every inch of line that I could recover . But before long he was off once more in mad career , and out of water , viciously shaking his head in determined efforts to spit out the hook . His failure to do this after a series of endeavors showed that he had swallowed the bait , and that my chief concern now should be as to the strength of my tackle . His first two rushes were the fiercest , and he did not at any time during the encounter carry out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking him , while it was comparatively easy to hold him steady on a taut line , allowing him to tow us quietly along , I found serious difficulty in getting him nearer the boat . The result of bearing on him with the rod , or , in fishing parlance , giving him the butt , was to start him off in hot haste . I have since been informed that experienced tarpon fishermen force the fighting from start to finish , never allowing the victim to rest , but inducing him to exhaust himself by constant excursions . Moreover , they gain on him inch by inch by lowering the point of the rod toward the water when the line is taut , and then raising it again with energy , reeling vigorously at the same time . Such a proceeding with a salmon would be apt to snap the gut castingline , or break the tip , and I was afraid to indulge in it in this case , not knowing what my tackle would stand . Consequently my progress in gaining ground on the monster was slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction of seeing him come to the top of the water , putting up his nose at first to blow , which is a custom with them , and at last showing his fin . Within a few minutes more he was fairly on the surface in some distress , and vigorous reeling on my part brought him within ten feet of the boat , where he lay rolling his huge tail from side to side , following the channel and dragging us after him . At this time one used to tarpon fishing would probably have got him within reach of the gaff , and perhaps I should have succeeded in bringing him within reach of a long-handled one ; but unfortunately that which my man had with him was fastened to a very short handle . Straining as much as I dared , I could not force him to a spot where Pierce could get a fair thrust at him . His Silvery Highness evidently was alarmed by the boat , and avoided it as much as possible . At last Pierce , in desperation , struck at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flying out again and the point of my rod was being dragged down as the tarpon plunged into the depths again , and by another glorious rush regained all that // I had won . Then ensued a long up-hill fight , which I can compare only to a hand-to-hand tussle with a wild beast . Again and again did I get him up to within ten feet of the boat , and again and again would he thwart my efforts to draw him nearer . The thumb and forefinger of my right hand , where , owing to the shortness of the handle , they came in contact with the screws and side of the reel , were without skin and bleeding profusely . I had not realized the importance of gloves or thumb-stalls , having always fished for salmon with bare hands . Had it not been for the leather drag , I could not have held him ; and yet this , at the point where it was sewed to the bar of the reel , served to clog the line , owing to the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act freely , and only by reeling desperately hard could I wind at all the last ten yards . One should take care to have on one 's reel only so much line as will work entirely smoothly under the bars , making due allowance for the expansion caused by soaking . I tried to be very careful not to let my line become tangled , and to apportionate it evenly over the surface of the reeL I found it convenient to hold the line against the rod with my left thumb while the fish was steady , as it relieved the pressure , shifting it to the drag when he began to run . After the struggle had lasted about an hour and a half I was appalled by my reel suddenly falling from my rod to the bottom of the boat . The rings which held it in place had slipped out of position . The same misadventure had twice happened to me while playing a salmon , so that I was not so much fluttered as if it had been a virgin experience , but I must confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the reel , taking care not to twist the line , I told Pierce , who was standing behind me , to step aft and slip the rings into position after I had fitted it into the socket . Fortunately the tarpon did not make one of his rushes during this ticklish proceeding , which was successfully accomplished . My hands were now becoming very cramped and weary , owing in a measure to the stiffness of my reel caused by the clogging of the line to which I have referred . The big fish seemed to have got his second wind , and though his rushes were less frequent , he showed a disposition to keep down in the deep water about thirty feet ahead of the boat . In the first two hours he jumped eight times , I should say , in addition to a series of five or six consecutive skips along the surface  --  a very pretty performance , and one which indicated that he was growing weaker . We had made three fruitless attempts to gaff him , each of which might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was curious to note how well the creature knew the channel ; he pursued his winding way with admirable precision . My position was in the stern , on my knees , which were doubled under me , with the butt of my rod embedded between my thighs . My boatman sat at the oars in the middle of the boat , facing me , and his duty was to back water so as to keep the stern always toward the fish , in order to prevent him from pulling us sideways and thus possibly upsetting us , or from getting under the boat . In my experience with this fish , in contradistinction to the salmon , I observed that he always kept the line taut and never ran directly toward the boat so as to double on us , as a salmon always does-which is one of the most interesting phases of that exciting sport . I have since been informed by others that my experience in this respect was not the normal one , and that a tarpon will often make a bee line for his tormentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not , however , entirely convinced as to the truth of this . After another quarter of an hour I had the creature on the surface once more , wallowing in manifest distress , and having drawn him almost to a proper spot for gaffing , was induced by my own weariness to urge Pierce to try another thrust at him with the hook . This time he struck him , but the iron only slipped off the monster , who glided under the stern , giving at the same moment a swirl of his tail that drove an avalanche of water in my face and all over me . One beautiful scale lay before me on the thwart as a memorial of what had happened . I was just about to make // sure that my line was not entangled , and then handed the rod for a moment to my guide in order to recover my dazed senses . This momentary respite was a great refreshment , and when I took the rod back again I felt that I , in my turn , had got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous efforts , and I began to adopt the forcing process , of which I have written earlier , by means of which I was enabled to reel in more line and compel my victim to approach nearer the boat . We had , however , another half-hour 's earnest tussle before I could put him alongside the gunwale , where Pierce could have a deliberate blow at him . Before this moment arrived I had to undergo the disagreeable emotions resulting from getting my line wound once round his body , to free which required care and cautiousness on my part . It is necessary , when the fish is nearly exhausted , to be constantly on one 's guard that the huge swinging tail does not come in contact with and cut the line , as it readily will do . As a final horror I discerned , when my line was becoming short , what looked like a large knot midway between the reel and the ring of my tip . I realized that if it were one , unless it would pass through the ring I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It proved , however , to be only a bit of dark green sea-weed which did not become an obstacle . A few moments later Pierce plunged his gaff into the water and - brought it up into the breast of the noble fighter . " Sit still , sir , " he said to me , anticipating doubtless my anxiety as to how he could get such a mammoth creature into the boat ; then he canted the gunwale ever so little and slipped the " Silver King " over it as neatly and easily as possible . The poor fish was nearly dead , and made but a single flap with his great tail . He was six feet long and weighed one hundred an thirty-two pounds ; it had been ten minutes of three when I hooked him , and it was now seven minutes of six , and he had towed us three miles . As he lay on our way home , and that evening at the wharf , with the moonlight resting upon him , he was by far the most beautiful specimen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpon had not been landed for ten days , some interest was occasioned at St. James City by his arrival , and the gentleman who had fished for three seasons without taking one said : " I do not wish to disparage your skill , but really you were very lucky . " I quite agree with the gentleman ; I certainly was . Tarpon fishing is , in my opinion , the most magnificent fishing sport in the world . I understand that veterans at it now refuse to take up the anchor after hooking a fish , preferring to part company rather than not to bring him up to the boat by force of rod and reel only . As compared with salmon fishing , the vast difference in the size of the two fish is a vital factor on the side of the " Silver King . " Anglers with but slight experience have at least an even chance of saving a salmon , but what accomplished fisherman expects to land more than one tarpon in three ? If a salmon were equal to a tarpon in weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a more formidable antagonist ; but fortypound salmon are rare , whereas one hundred and twenty pounds is not much more than the average weight of a tarpon , which shows the futility of such an argument . The manner of fighting is practically the same as regards running and leaping ; the tarpon does not sulk as the salmon is so fond of doing , nor , so far as my experience goes , does lie double on the angler , which of course is an interesting trait in the salmon . Nor , indeed , are the surroundings of a tarpon fisherman to be compared with the The Reel . // beautiful scenery and picturesque life on a Canadian salmon river . Bait is a dirty substitute for the trig fly , and the monotony of listless waiting pails on one accustomed to repeated casting . But , all the same , anyone who has hooked and landed a tarpon can well afford to smile at the enthusiasm of any other fisherman in creation . Try it for yourself and see .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
