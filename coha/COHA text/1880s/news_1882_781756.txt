txt One day last week a brutal husband , in this City , went home while in a state of intoxication , dragged his sick wife out of her bed , and so beat and otherwise unmercifully maltreated her that she was subsequently found lying insensible on the floor by the side of her newly born , but dead , infant . ' Reading of an occurrence like this , decent people may well pause and . wonder if there is not a mistake somewhere in the scenery and situation of the doleful tale . Cruelty such as this , one might well say , could not be found in a civilized community . Perhaps it was among the savage Comanches , or the bestial Digger Indians , that this shocking barbarity was committed . But this all happened in the City of NewYork , where , to the disgrace of humanity be it said , similarly unnatural crimes are not altogether infrequent . When this unhappy wife recovered her senses and realized that she bad been dragged , with her dead babe , from her bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did she overwhelm the brute with reproaches and expostulate with his barbarity ? Not a bit of it . She poured forth a flood of passionate excuses for the abominable wife-beater , and begged that the Police world let him go free . Finding that this would not avail , she consoled herself with the declaration that , although they might take him away , nothing could induce her to make complaint or to testify against him . The poor woman , bruised and bleeding as she was , would not so much as lift a finger for the punishment of her tormentor . Rather , she was almost ready to perjure herself if only he could go unpunished . Nor Is hers I by any means a case unique and peculiar . Almost any morning , in the Police courts , the visitor may see some poor woman , bearing the marks of a husband 's violent hand , sick and sobbing , but pleading hard that the wretch may have the mercy he denied to her , and making light of the wounds that loudly proclaim her woes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind husband , save whin the drink is in him , and whin the drink is in him , it 's the very divil that 's in him , your Honor . " This is the wife 's plea for a man who has " the drink " in him nearly half of his days , and who is consequently possessed of a devil that transforms him into a torturer and a savage . As women are not usually supposed to be moved by pure reason , it is useless to account for this their natural propensity to defend and forgive the brutality of their husbands . Of course , there are women who will finally break down under ill-treatment , and will forsake the man whom they have sworn to love , cherish , and obey . But these cases are rare . They prove nothing . There are women who hate their own offspring , but there are not many such . The vast majority of women will conceal , if possible , the ill-usage that they suffer at the bands of their husbands , and will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon themselves by a most unnatural man . As women are said to be guided by instinct rather than by reason , one would suppose that the instinct of self-reservation would urge them to flee from him who daily threatens life and limb . A woman 's intuitions are notoriously worth far more than aman 's absolute knowledge . What a man mustIrrive at by long investigation and by laborious processes of ratiocination a woman exultingly swoops down upon , across lots , as it were , by the mere exercise of a spirit of divination peculiar to the feminire ( human nature . When a woman of fine intuition is asked why she believes in a certain alleged statement of fact , she simplyreplies , " Because I know it . " This is the end of all argument . That man is a fool who attempts to get beyond this conclusion of the whole matter . What becomes of a woman 's subtle intuitions when she promises the Police Magistrate that Teddy will beat her no more if his Honor will be easy on him just this once 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Honor . If this perverted idea of love and duty were shared by both sexes , the wonder of it would cease . If it were peculiar to the lower walks of life , it would be less of a pinkie . But men shake off their wives , and flee away , usually , at the slighest provocation . And the highbred and delicately reared wife will wear the martyr 's crown forced upon her , in upper circles of society , without a murmur and without giving sign of the secret horror of her home . The universal rale of woman 's devotion to an unworthy object need not be proved by husbands who use corporeal violence to assert lordship over their wives . The roofs taken from handsome and costly homes would sometimes show a barbarous state of things within . Disgusting intemperance , unfaithfulness to marriage vows , the cruelty of stinginess , and a refinement of polite ill-usage may take the place of blows and kicks . And when the roof does come off , and there is no longer the dread of public shame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defends the ruffian . , She will never , never forsake her hateful Micawber , although he be a nuisance and an object of aversion to everybody else . She will forsake everybody and everything else and will cling to him alone until death do them part . And it has come to pass that when this bad husbandhas sunk into his grave , to the relief of all others , his &seen-,; solate widow constructs from the few redeeming qualities of the departed one an ideal husband , whose shade she worships as long as she lives . There are bad women , inconstant women , heartless women ; but , so long as it is true that most wives do unreasonably love and cling to their husbands even when respect has vanished and even when others suffer on account of their devotion , it must be confessed that the average woman is far better than the average man ; and it must be admitted that woman can understand a woman 's heroic constancy.                @ @ @ @ @
