txt The Sheriff 's officers are in possession of the office of the National Underground Electric Company , of Philadelphia , and this afternoon stockholders who called to learn the fate of the once hopeful corporation had to content themselves with the information conveyed by a placard on the door : " This office will be closed for a few days . " The janitor of the buildiug , who was found by a reporter in the next office ; said : " The company 's office was seized by the city Sheriff to-day . That was not the first seizure either , for the landlord . Mr. Cope . took possession of the office on Saturday , because the rent was not forthcoming . The office is Room No. 1 in the corner building at Walnut and Dock streets , and has two windows looking out upon Walnut-street . They are dirty and grimy and have none of those bright curtains that corporations of the pretensions of the National Underground Electric Company usually affect . The furniture is of the plainest ' kind , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place an air of solid substantiality , and that was reported to be filled with millions of dollars ' worth of the stook and bonds of the company , was conspicuous by its absence . Where it went to or who removed it noboay seems to know . The National Underground Eleetrio Company , of Philadelphia , is the outgrowth of a Camden organization hearing the title of . the " National Electric Conduit Company of Camden . " which owns a large part of the capital stock of the Philadelphia company . The Camden . corporation was started in March . 1881 , with a supposititious capital of $2,500,000 . In October . 1881 , John Lucas , ex-President of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad . joined the new corporation , . the Philadelphia company , then recently organized , paying in $1,000 and receiving 2,600 shares of the stock . This company was permitted by Councils to lay conduits on Market-street , and then shares of the Camden Company , which wore listed at the Stock Exchange . and of which there were 500,000 , began to boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2 . The stock was quoted at the Exchange as " underground , " and the public , rushed in and bought under the impression that they were buying the stock of the company that owned the Market-street conduit . Vast quantities were unloaded at high figures . The true inwardness of the connection of the two companies was not understood by the buyers , and when an exposure of the facts was published by the 7inres on March 15 , 1882. there was a dropin the stock from $2 to 65 cents a share . It is now unsalable at 5 cents a share . Two weeks ago an assessment of 2 cents a share was levied , but the etoOkholders had had enough of it and refused to respond to any considerable extent . What little money was collected was returned , and the history of these concerns which put much money into the hands of a few speculator and robbed a great many poor persons out of their savings may be considered closed .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
