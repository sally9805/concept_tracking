txt At the last election for Congressmen the people of NewOrleans voted for a Mayor , 4 Administrators , 4 Wardens , and SO Councilmen to establish a new form of city charter adopted by the Legislature at its recent session at Baton Rouge . The Democrats carried the election by a vote of 5 to 1 , none but Democrats being chosen . The law fixes Monday next as the period when the new City Government shall assume control . A caucus had been held and it was determined to choose the Hon. Thomas J. Semmes , an eminent lawyer of the Third Ward and ex-Confederate State Senator , President of the Councii , a position which would make him Mayor pro tem . To-day , like a flash of lightning in a clear sky , appeared in the evening papers a communication from Mr. Semmes in which he says : " My attention having been called by the press to the provisions of the eighteenth section of the new city charter , I have determined to resign the office of Councilman . That section provides ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirectly interested In any work , business , or contract , the expense or price or consideration of which is paid from the City Treasury , or ny an assessment levied by an oruinance or resolution of the Council . ' As a stockholder of the New-Orleans Gas  --  linht Company , I am indirectly interested in a contract w.th the city . As an attorney having charge of suits and claims against the city , to be paid by assessments to be levied by the Council . I have an indirect Interest in the contracts I am seeking to inforce . Indeed , this section disqualifies for office the holder of any city obligation . My business affairs are such , I can not , without great sacrifice , remove the disqualification . " Mr. Semmes 's interpretation of the law will probably disqualify several other members of the City Government , among them , it is alleged , Air . Behan , the newly elected Mayor , who is a judgment creditor of the city under an old contract for lighting the suburban portion of town with coal oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in working up election frauds , and a large number of arrests have already been made .
