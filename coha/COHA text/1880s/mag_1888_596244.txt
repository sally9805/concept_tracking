ILLUSTRATIONS BY FREDERIC REMINGTON . MY home ranch lies on both sides of the Little Missouri , the nearest ranchman above me being about twelve , and the nearest below me about ten , miles distant . The general course of the stream here is northerly , but , while flowing through my ranch , it takes a great westerly reach of some three A MONTANA TYPE . miles , walled in , as al ways , between chains of steep , high bluffs half a mile or more apart . The stream twists down through the valley in long sweeps , leaving oval wooded bottoms , first on one side and then on the other ; and in an open glade among the thick-growlug timber stands the long , low house of hewn logs . Just in front of the ranch veranda is a line of old cottonwoods that shade it during the fierce heats of summer , rendering it always cool and pleasant . But a few feet beyond these trees comes the cut-off bank of the river , through whose broad , sandy bed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshet fills it from brim to brim with foaming yellow water . The bluffs that wall in the river-valley curve back in semicircies , rising from its alluvial bottom generally as abrupt cliffs , but often as steep , grassy slopes that lead up to great level plateaus ; and the line is broken every mile or two by the entrance of a coul6e , or dry creek , whose head branches may be twenty miles back . Above us , where the river comes round the bend , the valley is very narrow , and the high buttes bounding it rise , sheer and barren , into scalped hill-peaks and naked knife-blade ridges . The other buildings stand in the same open glade with the ranch house , the dense growth of cottonwoods and matted , thorny underbrush making a wall all about , through which we have chopped our wagon roads and trodden out our own bridle-paths . The cattle have now trampled down this brush a little , but deer still lie in it , only a couple of hundred yards from the house ; and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the open , or make their way down , timidly and cautiously , to drink at the river . The stable , sheds , and other outbuildings , with the hayricks and the pens for such cattle as we bring in during winter , are near the house ; the patch of fenced garden land is on the edge of the woods ; and near the middle of the glade stands the high , circular horse-corral , with a snubbing-post in the center , and a wing built out from one side of the gate entrance , so that the saddle band can be driven in without trouble . As it is very hard to work cattle where there is much brush , the larger cow-corral is some four miles off on an open bottom . A ranchman 's life is certainly a very pleasant one , albeit generally varied with plenty of hardship and anxiety . Although occasionally he passes days of severe toil ,  --  for example , if he goes on the round-up he works as hard as any of his men ,  --  yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All rights reserved . No. * . // has to undergo the monotonous drudgery attendant upon the tasks of the cowboy or of the apprentice in the business . His fare is simple ; but , if he chooses , it is good enough . Many ranches are provided with nothing at all but salt pork , canned goods , and bread ; indeed , it is a curious fact that in traveling through this cow country it is often impossible to get any milk or butter ; but this is only because the owners or managers are too lazy to take enough trouble to insure their own cornfort . We ourselves always keep up two or three cows , choosing such as are naturally tame , and so we invariably have plenty of milk and , when there is time for churning , a good deal of butter . We also keep hens , which , in spite of the damaging inroads of hawks , bob-cats , and foxes , supply us with eggs , and in time of need , when our rifles have failed to keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken also . From our garden we get potatoes , and unless drought , frost , or grasshoppers interfere ( which they do about every second year ) , other vegetables as well . For fresh meat we depend chiefly upon our prowess as hunters . During much of the time we are away on the different round-ups , that " wheeled house , " the great fourhorse wagon , being then our home ; but when at the ranch our routine of life is always much the same , save during the excessively bitter weather of midwinter , when there is little to do except to hunt , if the days are fine enough . We breakfast early - before dawn when the nights have grown long , and rarely later than sunrise , even in midsummer . Perhaps before this meal , certainly the instant it is over , the man whose duty it is rides off to hunt up and drive in the saddle band . Each of us has his own string of horses , eight or ten in number , and the whole band usually split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scattered groups of the saddle band , our six or eight mares , with their colts , keep by themselves , and are rarely bothered by us , as no cowboy ever rides anything but horses , because mares give great trouble where all the animals have to be herded together . Once every two or three days somebody rides round and finds out where each of these smaller bands is , but the man who goes out in the morning merely gathers one bunch . He drives these into the corral , the other men ( who have been lolling idly about the house or stable , fixing their saddles or doing any odd job ) coming out with their ropes as soon as they hear the patter of the unshod hoofs and the shouts of the cowboy driver . Going into the corral , and standing near the center , each of us picks out some one of his own string from among the animals that are trotting and running in a compact mass round the circle ; and after one or more trials , according to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have caught their horses the rest are again turned loose , together with those that have been kept up overnight . Some horses soon get tame and do not need to be roped ; my pet cutting pony , little Muley , and good old Manitou , my companion in so many hunting trips , will neither of them stay with the rest of their fellows that are jamming and jostling each other as they rush **/oi. round in the dust of the corral , but they very sensibly walk up and stand quietly with the men in the middle , by the snubbing-post . Both are great pets , Manitou in particular ; the wise old fellow being very fond of bread and sometimes coming up of his own accord to the ranch house and even putting his head into the door to beg for it . Once saddled , the men ride off on their different tasks ; for almost everything is done in the saddle , except that in winter we cut our firewood and quarry our coal ,  --  both on the // ranch ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what wild hay we need . If any horses have strayed , one or two of the men will be sent off to look for them ; for hunting lost horses is one of the commonest and most irksome of our duties . Every outfit always has certain of its horses at large ; and if they remain out long enough they become as wild and wary as deer and have to he regularly surrounded and run down . On one occasion , when three of mine had been running loose for a couple of months , we had to follow at full speed for at least fifteen miles before exhausting them enough to enable us to get some control over them and head them towards a corral . Twice I have had horses absent nearly a year before they were recovered . One of them , after being on the ranch nine months , went off one night and traveled about two hundred miles in a straight line back to its old haunts , swimming the Yellowstone on the way . Two others were at one time away nearly eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on one occasion a couple of the men fairly ran their horses down in following them . We began to think they were lost for good , as they were all the time going farther down towards the Sioux country , but we finally recovered them . If the men do not go horse-hunting they may ride off over the range ; for there is generally some work to be done among the cattle , such as driving in and branding calves that have been overlooked by the round-up , or getting some animal out of a hog-hole . During the early spring months , before the round-up begins , the chief work is in hauling out mired cows and steers ; and if we did not keep a sharp lookout , the losses at this season would be very serious . As long as everything is frozen solid there is , of course , no danger from miring ; but when the thaw comes , along towards the beginning of March , a period of new danger to the cattle sets in . When the ice breaks up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the quicksand is at its worst . As the frost goes out of the soil , the ground round every little alkali-spring changes into a tremhling quagmire , and deep holes of slimy , tenacious mud form in the bottom of all the gullies . The cattle , which have had to live on snow for three or four months , are very eager for water , and are weak and in poor condition . They rush heedlessly into any pool and stand there , drinking gallons of the icy water and sinking steadily into the mud . When they try to get out they are already too deep down , and are too weak to make a proROPING IN A HORSE-CORRAL. // longed struggle . After one or two fits of desperate floundering , they resign themselves to their fate with dumb apathy and are lost , unless some one of us riding about discovers and hauls them out . They may be thus lost in wonderfully small mud-holes ; often they will be found dead in a gulch but two or three feet across , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost be jumped . An alkalihole , where the water oozes out through the thick clay , is the worst of all , owing to the ropy tenacity with which the horrible substance sticks and clings to any unfortunate beast that gets into it . In the spring these mud-holes cause very serious losses among the cattle , and are at all times fruitful sources of danger ; indeed , during an ordinary year more cattle die from getting mired than from any other cause . In addition to this they also often prove very annoying to the rider himself , as getting his steed mired or caught in a quicksand is one of the commonest of the accidents that beset a horseman in the far West . This usually happens in fording a river , if the latter is at all high , or else in crossing one of the numerous creeks ; although I once saw a horse and rider suddenly engulfed while leisurely walking over what appeared to be dry land . They had come to an alkali mud-hole , an old buffalo-wallow , which had filled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them through as if they had stepped on a trap-door . There being several of us along , we got down our ropes and dragged both unfortunates out in short order . When the river is up it is a very common thing for a horseman to have great difficulty in crossing , for the swift , brown water runs over a bed of deep quicksand that is ever shifting . An inexperienced horse , or a mule , - for a mule is useless in mud or quicksand ,  - -  becomes mad with fright in such a crossing , and , after speedily exhausting its strength in wild struggles , will throw itself on its side and drown unless the rider gets it out . An old horse used to such work will , on the contrary , take matters quietly and often push along through really dangerous quicksand . Old Maniton never loses his head for an instant ; but , now resting a few seconds , now feeling his way cautiously forward , and now making two or three desperate plunges , will go on wherever a horse possibly can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the bottom may give way where it seems hardest ; and if one is alone he may work hours in vain before getting his horse out , even after taking off both saddle and bridle , the only hope being to head itso that every plunge takes it an inch or two in the right direction . Nor are mud-holes the only danger the A DEEP FORD . // horseman has to fear ; for in much of the Bad Lands the buttes are so steep and broken that it needs genuine mountaineering skill to get through them , and no horse but a Western one , bred to the business , could accomplish the feat . In many parts of our country it is impossible for a horseman who does not know the land to cross it , and it is difficult enough even for an experienced hand . For a stretch of nearly ten miles along the Little Missouri above my range , and where it passes through it , there are but three or four places where it is possible for a horseman to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the river . In places this very rough ground comes down to the water ; elsewhere it lies back near the heads of the creeks . In such very bad ground the whole country seems to be one tangled chaos of cafion-like valleys , winding gullies , and washouts , with abrupt , unbroken sides , isolated peaks of sandstone , marl , or " gumbo " clay , which rain turns into slippery glue , and hill chains whose ridges always end in sheer cliffs . After a man has made his way with infinite toil for half a mile , a point will be reached around which it is an absolute impossibility to go , and the adventurer has nothing to do but painfully retrace his steps and try again in a new direction , as likely as not with the same result . In such a place the rider dismounts and leads his horse , the latter climbing with cat-like agility up seemingly inaccessible heights , scrambling across the steep , sloping shoulders of the bluffs , sliding down the faces of the clay cliffs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge like a goat , and accepting with unruffled composure an occasional roll from top to bottom . But , in spite of the climbing abilities of the ponies , it is difficult , and at times - for our steeds , at any rate - dangerous work to go through such places , and we only do it when it can not be avoided . Once I was overtaken by darkness while trying to get through a great tract of very rough land , and , after once or twice nearly breaking my neck , in despair had to give up all attempts to get out , and until daybreak simply staid where I was , in a kind of ledge or pocket on the side of the cliff , luckily sheltered from the wind . It was midsummer and the nights were short , but this particular one seemed quite long enough ; and though I was on the move by dawn , it was three hours later before I led the horse , as hungry , numb , and stiff as myself , out on the prairie again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worst parts of the Bad Lands with a wagon , and such a trip is exhausting and laborious beyond belief . Often the wagon will have to be taken to pieces every few hundred yards in order to get it over a ravine , lower it into a valley , or drag it up a cliff . One outfit , that a year ago tried to take a short cut through some of the Bad Lands of the Powder River , made just four miles in three days , and then had to come back to their starting-point after all . But with only saddle-horses we feel that it must be a very extraordinary country indeed if , in case of necessity , we can not go through it . The long forenoon 's work , with its attendant mishaps to man and beast , being over , the men who have been out among the horses and cattle come riding in , to be joined by their fellows - if any there be - who have been hunting , or haying , or chopping wood . The midday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the men have returned from their work ; but , whatever be the hour , it is the most substantial meal of the day , and we feel that we have little fault to find with a table on whose clean cloth are spread platters of smoked elk meat , loaves of good bread , jugs and bowls of milk , saddles of venison or broiled antelope steaks , perhaps roast and fried prairie chickens , with eggs , butter , wild plums , and tea or coffee . The afternoon 's tasks are usually much the same as the morning 's , but this time is often spent in doing the odds and ends ; as , for instance , it may be devoted to breaking-in a new horse . Large outfits generally hire a bronco-buster to do this ; but we ourselves almost always break our own horses , two or three of my men being very good riders , although none of them can claim to be anything out of the common . A first-class flash rider or bronco-buster receives high wages and deserves them , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can hope to grow old ; his work being infinitely harder than that of an Eastern horse-breaker or rough-rider , because he has to do it in such a limited time . A good rider is a good rider all the world over ; but an Eastern or English horse-breaker and Western bronco-buster have so little in common with each other as regards style or surroundings , and are so totally out of place in doing each other 's work , that it is almost impossible to get either to admit that the other has any merits at all as a horseman , for neither could sit in the saddle of the other or could without great difficulty perform his task . The ordinary Eastern seat , which approaches more or less the seat of a cross-country rider or fox-hunter , is nearly as different from the cowboy 's seat as from that of a man who rides bareback . The stirrups on a stock saddle are much farther back than they are on an ordinary English one ( a difference far more important than the high horn and cantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly erect in them , instead of having his legs bent ; and he grips with the thighs and not with the knees , throwing his feetwell out . Some of the things he teaches his horse would be wholly useless to an Eastern equestrian : for example , one of the first lessons the newly caught animal has to learn is not to " run on a rope " ; and he is taught this by being violently snubbed up , probably turning a somersault , thefirst two or three times that he feels the noose settle round his neck , and makes a mad rush for liberty . The snubbing-post is the usual adjunct in teaching such a lesson ; but a skillful man can do without any help and throw a horse clean over by holding the rope tight against the left haunch , at the same time leaning so far back , with the legs straight in front , that the heels dig deep into the ground when the / / If / I * A HARD TRAIL . -I * / 4 ; 2/ strain comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rope , is brought up standing , or even turned head over heels by the shock . Cowboys are probably the only men in the world who invariably wear gloves , buckskin gauntlets being preferred , as otherwise the ropes would soon take every particle of skin off their hands . A bronco-buster has to work by such violent methods in consequence of the short amount of time at his command . Horses are cheap , each outfit has a great many , and the wages for breaking an animal are but five or ten dollars . Three rides , of an hour or two each , on as many consecutive days , are the outside number a bronco-buster deems // necessary before turning an animal over as " broken . " The average bronco-buster , however , bandies horses so very rudely that we prefer , aside from motives of economy , to break our own ; and this is always possible , if we take enough time . The best and most quiet horses on the ranch are far from being those broken by the best riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been handled most gently , although firmly , and that have had the greatest number of days devoted to their education . Some horses , of course , are almost incurably vicious , and must be conquered by main force . One pleasing brute on my ranch will at times rush at a man open-mouthed like a wolf , and this is a regular trick of the range-stallions . In a great many-indeed , in most-localities there are wild horses to be found , which , although invariably of domestic descent , being either themselves runaways from some ranch or Indian outfit , or else claiming such for their VOL . XXXV. - 9o. sires and dams , yet are quite as wild as the antelope on whose domain they have intruded . Ranchmen run in these wild horses whenever possible , and they are but little more difficult to break than the so-called " tame " animals . But the wild stallions are , whenever possible , shot ; both because of their propensity for drivif the ranch mares , and because their ining 0 curable viciousness makes them always unsafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wild stallion fears no beast except the grizzly , and will not always flinch from an encounter with it ; yet it is a curious fact that a jack will almost always kill one in a fair fight . The particulars of a fight of this sort were related to me by a cattle man who was engaged in bringing out blooded stock from the East . Among the animals under his charge were two great stallions , one gray and one black , and a fine jackass , not much over half the size of either of the former . The animals were kept in separate pens , but one IN WITH THE HORSE HERD . // day both horses got into the same inclosure , next to the jack-pen , and began to fight as only enraged stallions can , striking like boxers with their fore feet , and biting with their teeth . The gray was getting the best of it ; but while clinched with his antagonist in one tussle they rolled against the jack-pen , breaking it in . No sooner was the jack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , he made straight for the two horses , who had for the moment separated . The gray turned to meet him , rearing on his hind legs and striking at him with his fore feet ; but the jack slipped in , and in a minute grasped his antagonist by the throat with his wide-open jaws , and then held on like a bull-dog , all four feet planted stiffly in the soil . The stallion made tremendous efforts to shake him off : he would try to whirl round and kick him , but for that the jack was too short ; then he would rise up , lifting the jack.off the ground , and strike at him with his fore feet ; but all that he gained by this was to skin his foe 's front legs without making him loose his hold . Twice they fell , and twice the stallion rose , by main strength dragging the jack with him ; but all in vain . Meanwhile the black horse attacked both the combatants with perfect impartiality , striking and kicking them with his hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough hides , met with a snap like that of a hear-trap . Undoubtedly the jack would have killed at least one of the horses had not the men come up , and with no small difficulty separated the maddened brutes . If not breaking horses , mending saddles , or doing something else of the sort , the cowboys will often while away their leisure moments by practicing with the rope . A man can not practice too much with this if he wishes to attain even moderate proficiency ; and as a matter of fact he soon gets to wish to practice the whole time . A cowboy is always roping something , and it especially delights him to try his skill at game . A friend of mine , a young ranchman in the Judith basin , about three years ago roped a buffalo , and by the exercise of the greatest skill , both on his own part and on his steed 's , actually succeeded , by alternate bullying and coaxing , in getting the huge brute almost into camp . I have occasionally known men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when circumstances all joined to favor them ; and last summer one of the cowboys on a ranch about thirty miles off ran into and roped a wounded elk . A forty-foot lariat is the one commonly used , for the ordinary range at which a man can use it is only about twenty-five feet . Few men can throw forty feet ; and to do this , taking into account the coil , needs a sixty-foot rope . When the day 's work is over we take supper , and bed-time comes soon afterward , for the men who live on ranches sleep well and soundly . As a rule , the nights are cool and bracing , even in midsummer ; except when we occasionally have a spell of burning weather , with a steady , hot wind that blows in our faces like a furnace blast , sending the thermometer far up above a hundred and making us gasp for breath , even at night , in the dry-baked heat of the air . But it is only rarely that we get a few days of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day has been , we can at least sleep pleasantly at night . A ranchman 's work is , of course , free from much of the sameness attendant upon that of a mere cowboy . One day he will ride out with his men among the cattle , or after strayed horses ; the next he may hunt , so as to keep the ranch in meat ; then he can make the tour of his outlying camps ; or , again , may join one of the round-ups for a week or two , perhaps keeping with it the entire time it is working . On occasions he will have a good deal of spare time on his hands , which , if he chooses , he can spend in reading or writing . If he cares for books , there will be many a worn volume in the primitive little sitting-room , with its log walls and huge fireplace ; but after a hard day 's work a man will not read much , but will rock to and fro in the flickering firelight , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty he has had with the cattle ; or else may simply lie stretched at full length on the elk-hides and wolf-skins in front of the hearthstone , listening in drowsy silence to the roar and crackle of the blazing logs and to the moaning of the wind outside . In the sharp fall weather the riding is delicious all day long ; but even in the late spring , and all through the summer , we try , if we can , to do our work before the heat of the day , and if going on a long ride , whether to hunt or for other purposes , leave the ranch house by dawn . The early rides in the spring mornings have a charm all their own , for they are taken when , for the one and only time during the year , the same brown landscape of these high plains turns to a vivid green , as the new grass sprouts and the trees and bushes thrust forth the young leaves ; and at dawn , with the dew glittering everywhere , all things show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a man may gallop for miles at a stretch with his horse 's hoofs sinking at every stride into the carpet of prairie roses , whose short stalks lift the beautiful blossoms but a few inches from the ground . Even in the waste places the cactuses are blooming ; and one kind in particu // lar , a dwarfish , globular plant , with its mass out farther to the flat prairie land on the diof sulendid crimson flowers glows against vide . Here , in places , the level , grassy plains the sides of the gray buttes like a splash of are strewn with mounds and hillocks of red flame . or gray scoria , that stand singly or clustered The ravines , winding about and splitting into little groups , their tops crested , or their into a labyrinth of coul*es , with chains of rounded hills to separate them , have groves of trees in their bottoms , over the sides of the water-courses . In these are found the blacktail deer , and his cousin , the whitetail , too , with his flaunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after antelope only , we mu stgo sides covered , by queer , detached masses of volcanic rock , wrought into strange shapes by the dead forces whose blind , hidden strength long ago called them into being . The road our wagons take , when the water is too high for us to come down the river bottom , stretches far ahead - two dark , straight , parallel furrows A BUCKING BRONCO. // which merge into one in the distance . Quaint little horned frogs crawl sluggishly along in the wheel tracks , and the sickle-billed curlews run over the ground or soar above and around the horsemen , uttering their mournful , neverceasing clamor . The grass-land stretches out in the sunlight like a sea , every wind bending the blades into a ripple , and flecking the prairie with shifting patches of a different green from that around , exactly as the touch of a light squall or wind-gust will fleck the smooth surface of the ocean . Our Western plains differ widely in detail from those of Asia ; yet they always call to mind The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rider on the plains will hear bird songs unknown in the East . The Missouri sky-lark sings while soaring above the great plateaus so high in the air that it is impossible to see the bird ; and this habit of singing while soaring it shares with some sparrow-like birds that are often found in company with it . The white-shouldered larkbunting , in its livery of black , has rich , full notes , and as it sings on the wing it reminds one of the bobolink ; and the sweet-voiced lark-finch also utters its song in the air . These birds , and most of the sparrows of the plains , are characteristic of this region . But many of our birds , especially those found in the wooded river bottoms , answer to those of the East ; only almost each one has some marked point of difference from its Eastern representative . The bluebird out West is very much of a blue bird indeed , for it has no " earth tinge " on its breast at all ; while the indigo-bird , on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . The flicker has the shafts of its wing and tail quills colored orange instead of yellow . The towhee has lost all title to its name , for its only cry is a mew like that of a cat-bird ; while , most wonderful of all , the meadow-lark has found a rich , strong voice , and is one of the sweetest and most incessant singers we have . Throughout June the thickets and groves about the ranch house are loud with bird music from before dawn till long after sunrise . The thrashers have sung all the night through from among the thorn-bushes if there has been a moon , or even if there has been bright starlight ; and before the first glimmer of gray the bell-like , silvery songs of the shy woodland thrushes chime in ; while meadow-lark , robin , bluebird , and song sparrow , together with many rarer singers , like the grosbeak , join in swelling the chorus . There are some would-be singers whose intention is better than their execution . Blackbirds of several kinds are plenty round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like so many dwarf crows ; and now and then a flock of yellow-heads will mix for a few days with their purple or rusty-colored brethren . The males of these yellow-headed grakles are really handsome , their orange and yellow heads contrasting finely with the black of the rest of their plumage ; but their voices are discordant to a degree . When a flock has done feeding it will often light in straggling order among the trees in front of the veranda , and then the males will begin to sing , or rather to utter the most extraordinary collection of broken sounds - creakings , gurglings , hisses , twitters , and every now and then a liquid note or two . It is like an accentuated representation of the noise made by a flock of common blackbirds . At nightfall the poor-wills begin to utter their boding call from the wooded ravines back in the hills ; not " whip-poorwill , " as in the East , but with two syllables only . They often come round the ranch house . Late one evening I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and watching the green and brown of the hill-tops change to purple and umber and then fade off into shadowy gray as the somber darkness deepened . Suddenly a poor-will lit on the floor beside me and stayed some little time ; now and then uttering its mournful cries , then ceasing for a few moments as it flitted round after insects , and again returning to the same place to begin anew . The little owls , too , call to each other with tremulous , quavering voices throughout the livelong night , as they sit in the creaking trees that overhang the roof . Now and then we hear the wilder voices of the wilderness , from animals that in the hours of darkness do not fear the neighborhood of man : the coyotes wail like dismal ventriloquists , or the silence may be broken by the strident challenge of a lynx , or by the snorting and stamping of a deer that has come to the edge of the open . In the hot noontide hours of midsummer the broad ranch veranda , always in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be comfortable ; but here he can sit for hours at a time , leaning back in his rocking-chair as he reads or smokes , or with half-closed , dreamy eyes gazes across the shallow , nearly dry riverbed to the wooded bottoms opposite , and to the plateaus lying back of them . Against the sheer white faces of the cliffs , that come down without a break , the dark green tree-tops stand out in bold relief . In the hot , lifeless air all objects that are not near by seem to sway and waver . There are few sounds to break the stillness . From the upper branches of the cottonwood trees overhead , whose shimmer- // ing , tremulous leaves are hardly ever quiet , but if the wind stirs at all , rustle and quaver and sigh all day long , comes every now and then the soft , melancholy cooing of the mourning dove , whose voice always seems far away and expresses more than any other sound in nature the sadness of gentle , hopeless , neverending grief . The other birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now and then the black shadow of a wheeling vulture falls on the sun-scorched ground . The cattle , that have strung down in long files from the hills , lie quietly on the sand-bars , except that some of the bulls keep traveling up and down , bellowing and routing or giving vent to long , surly grumblings as they paw the sand and toss it up with their horns . At times the horses , too , will come down to drink , and to splash and roll in the water . The prairie-dogs alone are not daunted by the heat , but sit at the mouths of their burrows with their usual pert curiosity . They are bothersome little fellows , and most prolific , increasing in spite of the perpetual war made on them by every carnivorous bird and beast . One of their worst foes is the black-footed ferret , a handsome , rather rare animal , somewhat like a mink , with a yellow-brown body and dark feet and mask . It is a most bloodthirsty little brute , feeding on all small animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kill very young fawns if it finds them in the CRUISING FOR STOCK . // mother 's absence , and work extraordinary havoc in a dog town , as it can follow the wretched little beasts down into the burrows . In one instance , I knew of a black-footed ferret making a succession of inroads on a ranchman 's poultry , killing and carrying off most of them before it was trapped . Coyotes , foxes , swifts , badgers , and skunks also like to lurk about the dog towns . Of the skunks , by the way , we had last year altogether too much ; there was a perfect plague of them all along the river , and they took to trying to get into the huts , with the stupid pertinacity of the species . At every ranch house dozens were killed , we ourselves bagging thirty-three , all slain near the house , and one , to our unspeakable sorrow , in it . In making a journey over ground we know , during the hot weather we often prefer to ride by moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear night air , turning the gray buttes into glimmering silver ; and the horses travel far more readily and easily than under the glaring noonday sun . The road between my upper and lower ranch houses is about forty miles long , sometimes following the river-bed , and then again branching off inland , crossing the great plateaus and winding through the ravines of the broken country . It is a five-hours ' fair ride ; and so , in a hot spell , we like to take it during the cool of the night , starting at sunset . After nightfall the face of the country seems to alter marvelously , and the cool moonlight only intensifies the change . The river gleams like running quicksilver , and the moonbeams play over the grassy stretches of the plateaus and glance off the wind-rippled blades as they would from water . The Bad Lands seem to be stranger and wilder than ever , the silvery rays turning the country into a kind of grim fairy-land . The grotesque , fantastic outlines of the higher cliffs stand out with startling clearness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses , and the deep gorges are in black shadow ; in the darkness there will be no sound but the rhythmic echo of the hoof-beats of the horses , and the steady , metallic clank of the steel bridle-chains . But the fall is the time for riding ; for in the keen , frosty air neither man nor beast will tire , though out from the dawn until the shadows have again waxed long and the daylight has begun to wane , warning all to push straight for home without drawing rein . Then deer- saddles and elk-haunches hang from the trees near the house ; and one can have good sport right on the sand of the river-bed , for we always keep shot-gun or rifle at hand , to be ready for any prairie chickens , or for such of the passing water-fowl as light in the river near us . Occasionally we take a shot at a flock of waders , among which the pretty avocets are the most striking in looks and manners . Prairie fowl are quite plenty all round us , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perch among the trees near by . At evening they fly down to the river to drink , and as they sit on the sand-bars offer fine marks for the rifles . So do the geese and ducks when they occasionally light on the same places or paddle leisurely down stream in the middle of the river ; but to make much of a bag of these we have to use the heavy No. 10 , choke-bore shot-gun , while the little i6-bore fowling-piece is much the handiest for prairie fowl . A good many different kinds of water-fowl pass , ranging in size from a teal duck to a Canada goose , and all of them at times help . to eke out our bill of fare . Last fall a white-fronted goose lit on the river in front of the ranch house , and three of us , armed with miscellaneous weapons , went out after him ; we disabled him , and then after much bad shooting , and more violent running through thick sand and thick underbrush , finally overtook and most foully butchered him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , however . Sometimes strings of sandbill cranes fly along the river , their guttural clangor being heard very far off . They usually light on a plateau , where sometimes they form rings and go through a series of queer antics , dancing and posturing to each other . They are exceedingly wide-awake birds , and more shy and wary than antelope , so that they are rarely shot ; yet once I succeeded in stalking up to a group in the early morning , and firing into them rather at random , my bullet killed a full-grown female . Its breast , when roasted , proved to be very good eating . Sometimes we vary our diet with fish - wall-eyed pike , ugly , slimy catfish , and other uncouth finny things , looking very fit denizens of the mud-choked water ; but they are good eating withal , in spite of their uncanny appearance . We usually catch them with set lines , left out overnight in the deeper pools . The cattle are fattest and in best condition during the fall , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shipped - four-year-olds as a rule , though some threes and some fives go along with them . Cattle are a nuisance while hunting on foot , as they either take fright and run off when they see the hunter , scaring all game within sight , or else , what is worse , follow him , blustering and bullying and pretending that they are on the point of charging , but rarely actually doing so . Still , they are occasionally really dangerous , // and it is never entirely safe for a man to be on foot when there is a chance of meeting the droves of long-horned steers . But they will always bluster rather than fight , whether with men or beasts , or with one another . The bulls and some of the steers are forever traveling and challenging each other , never ceasing their hoarse rumbling and moaning and their long-drawn , savage bellowing , tearing up the banks with their horns and sending little spurts of dust above their shoulders with their fore hoofs ; yet they do not seem especially fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally have most desperate and obstinate set-tos with one another . A large bear will make short work of a bull : a few months ago one of the former killed a very big bull near a ranch house a score of miles or so distant , and during one night tore up and devoured a large part of his victim . The ranchman poisoned the carcass and killed the bear . In the winter there is much less work than at any other season , but what there is involves great hardship and exposure . Many of the men are discharged after the summer is over , and during much of the cold weather there is little to do except hunt now and then , and in very bitter days lounge about the house . But some of the men are out in the line camps , and the ranchman has occasionally to make the round of these ; and besides that , one or more of the cowboys who are at home ought to be out every day when the cattle have become weak , so as to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to get through the season - a coxv that has had an unusually early calf being particularly apt to need attention . The horses shift for themselves and need no help . Often , in winter , the Indians cut down the cottonwood trees and feed the tops to their ponies ; but this is not done to keep them from starving , but only to keep them from wandering off in search of grass . Besides , the ponies are very fond of the bark of the young cottonwood shoots , and it is healthy for them . The men in the line camps lead a hard life , for they have to be out in every kind of LINE RIDING IN WINTER . // weather , and should be especially active and watchful during the storms . The camps are established along some line which it is proposed to make the boundary of the cattle 's drift in a given direction . For example , we care very little whether our cattle wander to the Yellowstone ; but we strongly object to their drifting east and south-east towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they drift that way they come out on flat , bare plains where there is danger of perishing . Accordingly , the cowmen along the Little Missouri have united in establishing a row of camps to the east of the river , along the line where the broken ground meets the prairie . The camps are usually for two men each , and some fifteen or twenty miles apart ; then , in the morning , its two men start out in opposite ways , each riding till he meets his neighbor of the next camp nearest on that side , when he returns . The camp itself is sometimes merely a tent pitched in a sheltered coul*e , but ought to be either made of logs or else a dug-out in the ground . A small corral and horse-shed is near by . with enough hay for the ponies , of which each rider has two or three . In riding over the beat each man drives any cattle that have come near it back into the Bad Lands , and if he sees by the hoof-marks that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will follow and fetch them home . They must be shoved well back into the Bad Lands before a great storm strikes them ; for if they once begin to drift in masses before an icy gale it is impossible for a small number of men to hold them , and the only thing is to let them go , and then to organize an expedition to follow them as soon as possible . Line riding is very cold work , and ( langerous too , when the men have to be out in a blinding snowstorm , or in a savage blizzard that takes the spirit in the thermometer far down below zero . In the worst storms it is impossible for any man to be out . But other kinds of work besides line riding necessitate exposure to bitter weather . Once , while spending a few days over on Beaver Creek hunting up a lost horse , I happened to meet a cowboy who was out on the same errand , and made friends with him . We started home together across the open prairies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the ranch where we CATTLE DRIFTING BEFORE THE STORM . // had spent the night . We were soon completely turned round , the great soft flakes - for , luckily , it was not cold - almost blinding us , and we had to travel entirely by compass . After feeling our way along for eight or nine hours , we finally got down into the broken country near Sentinel Butte and came across an empty hut , a welcome sight to men as cold , hungry , and tired as xve were . In this hut we passed the night very comfortably , picketing our horses in a sheltered nook near by , with plenty of hay from an old stack . To while away the long evening , I read Hamlet aloud , from a little pocket Shakspere . The cowboy , a Texan ,  - -  one of the best riders I have seen , and also a very intelligent as well as a thoroughly good fellow in every way ,  --  was greatly interested in it and commented most shrewdly on the parts he liked , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more homely language with great relish , and ended with the just criticism that " old Shakspere saveyed human natur ' some " - savey being a verb presumably adapted into the limited plains ' vocabulary from the French . Even for those who do not have to look up stray horses , and who are not forced to ride the line day in and day out , there is apt to be some hardship and danger in being abroad during the bitter weather ; yet a ride in midwinter is certainly fascinating . The great white country wrapped in the powdery snowdrift seems like another land ; and the familiar landmarks are so changed that a man must be careful lest he lose his way , for the discomfort of a night in the open during such weather is very great indeed . When the sun is out the glare from the endless white stretches dazzles the eyes ; and if the gray snow-clouds hang low and only let a pale , wan light struggle through , the lonely wastes become fairly appalling in their desolation . For hour after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life except , perhaps , a big white owl sweeping noiselessly by , so that in the dark it looks like a snow-wreath ; the cold gradually chilling the rider to the bones , as he draws his fur cap tight over his ears and muffles his face in the huge collar of his wolf-skin coat , and making the shaggy little steed drop head and tail as it picks its way over the frozen soil . There are few moments more pleasant than the home-coming , when , in the gathering darkness , after crossing the last chain of ice-covered buttes , or after coming round the last turn in the wind-swept valley , we see , through the leafless trees , or across the frozen river , the red gleam of the firelight as it shines through the ranch windows and flickers over the trunks of the cottonwoods outside , warming a man 's blood by the mere hint of the warmth awaiting him within .
