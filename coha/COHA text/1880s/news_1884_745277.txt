txt The " curiosities " of the dime museum are downcast at the result of the election . The nomination of the two renowned tattooed men , BLAINE and BUTLER , and of the beautiful Circassian , BELVA LOCKWOOD , had given rise to the hope that museum curiosities might in the near future be . able to turn their I attention profitably to politics . ' ; That hope is now dashed , and the dime museums are everywhere shrouded in a gloom deeper than that ordinarily produced by their respective brass bands . Tattooed men , doubtless , have their uses . They earn fair salaries in dime museums , and they are gazed at with interest by countrymen . It is a great mistake , however , for a tattooed man to become a candidate for the Presidency .

Had Gen. BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum hundreds of people would have flocked to see him ; or had Mr. BLAINE shown himself in the same museum in the act of writing letters , or of making Hocking Valley stock certificates pass through a wooden table and reappear in the form of options , he would have been worth fifty dollars a day to the museum ? proprietor . But , when these two tattooed men undertook to exhibit the pleasing patterns with which they are frescoed to the whole American Nation without any charge for admittance they found that they had made a mistake , and that the public , however much it may like museum curiosities in their appropriate place , has no intention of giving them situations in - the White House . The museum curiosity will never again be seen as a Presidential candidate . When the next Republican Convention meets it will as soon think of nominating a fat woman as a tattooed man . It has once tried the experiment , and it is the wiser for it .
