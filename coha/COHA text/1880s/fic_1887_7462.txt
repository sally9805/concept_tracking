Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : HENRY WARD BEECHER . A MEMORY OF A SERMON . from Henry Ward Beecher ( 1887 ) Out of the past comes forth one Sabbath-day , A silvering head uplifted from the crowd That the great preacher 's eloquence could sway Like wind-swept wheat ; a voice not low nor loud . Varying from gentle to impetuous force As changeful inspirations struck the keys Of utterance ; like a torrent in its course , Breaking apart into new harmonies . Unspoken thoughts rose , struggling underneath The current of expression , deepening still The emphasis of full and steady breath That , poised in silence , seemed the house to fill . Slow came the words , as when swift waters lie Calmed in the pool whereunto they have run : " Brethren , this will I strive for till I die  --  Union in Christ , his sundered flock made one . " The voice is hushed ; the impulse that it gave Is moving onward like an army 's tread ; The man who helped the outcast and the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He lived in this great human family As in the all-embracing church of God . He lives here still ; a freer path have we Since with so free a step our earth he trod . The petty shibboleths of sect and clan His lips refused , rejected to the end ; His manhood met itself in every man , He counted even his enemy his friend . What grander glory to attain than this ? To be an overflow of God , a force Magnetically fusing lives in his , The father of all spirits , our life 's source . There are men  --  he was one  --  whose atmosphere Breathes freshening vigor through earth 's drowsy air : The master in the servant so draws near , And hearts leap up His sacrifice to share . The day is dawning ; beautiful the glow Upon the mountains , of Christ 's coming feet ; And the prophetic heavens already know His world redeemed , His church in Him complete , The purpose this man lived for can not die , The fire is kindled , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring sky , " O brethren , in the name of Christ , be one !
