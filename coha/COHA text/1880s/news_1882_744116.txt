txt Secretary Folger and Congressman Crowley arrived here to-day and together , after a short absence from the capital , and upon their return the report was circulated that Judge Folger would soon resign his place as Secretary of the Treasury , and that Mr. Crowley would be appointed as his successor . Mr. Crowley 's friends seem very confident that the report is well founded , and have openly congratulated Mr. Crowley upon his good fortune . When asked whether the report was true Mr. Crowley did not positively deny it , but suggested that it might be an idle rumor , and intimated that it was only an expression of good-will on the part of friends . Secretary Folger has been questioned repeatedly about the report . To all questions asked to-day he has expressed his surprise that such a report should gain circulation , as he has never at any time since he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury heard a hint , request , or suggestion that he should change his place in the Treasury Department for one in the Supreme Court . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to say that the report of his early appointment to succeed Judge Folger is not true , and Secretary Folger 's equally careful replies are very liberally construed by Mr. Crowley 's New-York friends as pointing to an immediate change in the Cabinet and in the Supreme Court , and the succe ; sion of Mr. Crowley to Judge Folger 's place . It is said to-night by friends of Judge Folger that he has neither exoectation nor desire to exchange his present office for a place on the Supreme bench , but that on the contrary he has taken the Treasury Department with the intention of remaining through the President 's term .
