txt Adventurous persons who long to risk their lives and spend the Government 's money in vain attempts to reach the north pole are unable to gain the support of Secretary ENDICOTT and Secretary WHITNEY . These members of the Cabinet have , it is said , refused to recommend to Congress the projects of any of the explorers whose ardor has not been cooled by the fate of DE LONG and his associates and the sufferings of GREELY and his men at Starvation Camp . In this decision of the two Secretaries the people of the United States will concur . Daring men who would gain fame by reaching a point in the Polar Sea beyond that which any other explorer has attained may find citizens who will fit them out with private capital . The millions raised by taxation for the support of the Government should not be expended in sending them northward and afterward in sending other explorers to find them . The work of this kind which the Government has recently done will suffice for this generation . Now that so much has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the money of civilized nations and the energy of explorers can be more profitably and wisely used in latitudes where the risks are not so great and where the results to be obtained are of greater value . So long as there are deposits of gold in the latitude of the arctic circle sufficiently rich to attract miners and capital , and so long as our hardy whalers cruise in the waters beyond Behring Strait , labors like those of SCHWATKA , STONEY , * CAN1WELL , ALLEN , and MCLENEGAN in Alaska may reasonably be undertaken . The Canadian Government has wisely expended its money in measuring the season of navigation in Hudson Strait . If it could be shown that grain carriers could use that passage with safety for five months in each year there would soon be an outlet through Hudson 's Bay for the wheat of Manitoba and the Saskatchewan country and the farmers of those regions would be able to defy the Canadian Pacific monopoly . Unfortunately for them , it does not now appear that the season is sufficiently long or the passage safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ships . But the work of the observers and the cruisers was worth all that it cost . The journeys of our own officers in Alaska have revealed the existence of enormous rivers and given us a knowledge of the country which surely ought to have been procured if it could have been obtained without loss of life . The great peninsula does not seem to be an acquisition of great value , it is true , but we are only beginning to know something about it . It should be remembered that the mouth and lower waters of the Yukon are in the latitude of the Russian port of Archangel , on the White Sea , and that the mouth of the Copper River is in the latitude of St. Petersburg . There are settlements on the Yukon , and one result of recent explorations is the discovery that wrecked or icebound whalers on the north coast can reach these settlements by an overland journey . The commander of the Corwin was able , during his recent visit to the north coast , to rescue several shipwrecked sailors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those waters . It may be that a permanent station for whalers ought to be established at or near Point Barrow , where Lieut . RAY passed two Winters . Half of the cost of a polar expedition would yield results of considerable value if expended in Alaska .
