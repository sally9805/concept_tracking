Afterwhile --  we have in view A far scene to journey to --  , Where the old home is , and where The old mother waits us there , Peering , as the time grows late , Down the old path to the gate --  .

Ah , the endless afterwhiles --  ! Leagues on leagues , and miles on miles , In distance far withdrawn , Stretching on , and on , and on , Till the fancy is footsore And faints in the dust before The last milestone 's granite face , Hacked with : Here Beginneth Space . O far glimmering worlds and wings , Mystic smiles and beckonings , Lead us through the shadowy aisles Out into the afterwhiles . Herr Weiser Herr Weiser --  ! **27;3308;TOOLONG , A hale white rose of his country-men , Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam , And blossomy as his German home --  As blossomy and as pure and sweet As the cool green glen of his calm retreat , Far withdrawn from the noisy town Where trade goes clamoring up and down , Whose fret and fever , and stress and strife , May not trouble his tranquil life ! Breath of rest , what a balmy gust --  ! Quite of the city 's heat and dust , Jostling down by the winding road , Through the orchard ways of his quaint abode --  . Tether the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And thumping the wood bridge at night With lumps of ripeness and lush delight , Till the stream , as it maunders on till dawn , Is powdered and pelted and smiled upon . Herr Weiser , with his wholesome face , And the gentle blue of his eyes , and grace Of unassuming honesty , Be there to welcome you and me ! And what though the toil of the farm be stopped And the tireless plans of the place be dropped , While the prayerful master 's knees are set In beds of pansy and mignonette And lily and aster and columbine , Offered in love , as yours and mine --  ? What , but a blessing of kindly thought , Sweet as the breath of forget-me-not --  ! What , but a spirit of lustrous love White as the aster he bends above --  ! What , but an odorous memory Of the dear old man , made known to me In days demanding a help like his --  , As sweet as the life of the lily is --  As sweet as the soul of a babe , bloom-wise Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful City ! Forever Its rapturous praises resound ; We fain would behold it --  but never A glimpse of its dory is found : We slacken our lips at the tender White breasts of our mothers to hear Of its marvellous beauty and splendor --  ; We see --  but the gleam of a tear ! Yet never the story may tire us --  First graven in symbols of stone --  Rewritten on scrolls of papyrus And parchment , and scattered and blown By the winds of the tongues of all nations , Like a litter of leaves wildly whirled Down the rack of a hundred translations , From the earliest lisp of the world . We compass the earth and the ocean , From the Orient 's uttermost light , To where the last ripple in motion Lips hem of the skirt of the night --  , But the Beautiful City evades us --  No spire of it glints in the sun --  No glad-bannered battlement shades us When all our Journey is done . Where lies it ? We question and listen ; We lean from the mountain , or mast , And see but dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dust of the one blurs our vision , The glare of the other our brain , Nor city nor island Elysian In all of the land or the main ! We kneel in dim fanes where the thunders Of organs tumultuous roll , And the longing heart listens and wonders , And the eyes look aloft from the soul : But the chanson grows fainter and fainter , Swoons wholly away and is dead ; AND our eyes only reach where the painter Has dabbled a saint overhead . The Beautiful City ! O mortal , Fare hopefully on in thy quest , Pass down through the green grassy portal That leads to the Valley of Rest ; There first passed the One who , in pity Of all thy great yearning , awaits To point out The Beautiful City , And loosen the trump at the gates . Lockerbie Street Such a dear little street it is , nestled away From the noise of the city and heat of the day , In cool shady coverts of whispering trees , With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie street ! There is such a relief , from the clangor and din Of the heart of the town , to go loitering in Through the dim , narrow walks , with the sheltering shade Of the trees waving over the long promenade , And littering lightly the ways of our feet With the gold of the sunshine of Lockerbie street . And the nights that come down the dark pathways of dusk , With the stars in their tresses , and odors of musk In their moon-woven raiments , bespangled with dews , And looped up with lilies for lovers to use In the songs that they sing to the tinkle and beat Of their sweet serenadings through Lockerbie street . O my Lockerbie street ! You are fair to be seen --  Be it noon of the day , or the rare and serene Afternoon of the night --  you are one to my heart , And I love you above all the phrases of art , For no language could frame and no lips could repeat My rhyme-haunted raptures of Lockerbie street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , till the sparkles in delight Snapped their saucy little fingers at the chill December night ; And in dressing-gown and slippers , I had tilted back " my throne --  " The old split-bottomed rocker --  and was musing all alone . I could hear the hungry Winter prowling round the outer door , And the tread of muffled footsteps on the white piazza floor ; But the sounds came to me only as the murmur of a stream That mingled with the current of a lazy-flowing dream . Like a fragrant incense rising , curled the smoke of my cigar , With the lamplight gleaming through it like a mist-enfolded star --  ; And as I gazed , the vapor like a curtain rolled away , With a sound of bells that tinkled , and the clatter of a sleigh . And in a vision , painted like a picture in the air , I saw the elfish figure , of a man with frosty hair --  A quaint old man that chuckled with a laugh as he appeared , And with ruddy cheeks like embers in the ashes of his beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirth , On a damask-covered hassock that was sitting on the hearth ; And at a magic signal of his stubbly little thumb , I saw the fireplace changing to a bright proscenium . And looking there , I marvelled as I saw a mimic stage Alive with little actors of a very tender age ; And some so very tiny that they tottered as they walked , And lisped and purled and gurgled like the brooklets , when they talked . And their faces were like lilies , and their eyes like purest dew , And their tresses like the shadows that the shine is woven through ; And they each had little burdens , and a little tale to tell Of fairy lore , and giants , and delights delectable . And they mixed and intermingled , weaving melody with joy , Till the magic circle clustered round a blooming baby-boy ; And they threw aside their treasures in an ecstasy of glee , And bent , with dazzled faces and with parted lips , to see . ' T was a wondrous little fellow , with a dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom in ; And he looked as ripe and rosy , on his bed of straw and reeds , As a mellow little pippin that had tumbled in the weeds . And I saw the happy mother , and a group surrounding her That knelt with costly presents of frankincense and myrrh ; And I thrilled with awe and wonder , as a murmur on the air Came drifting o'er the hearing in a melody of prayer --  : By the splendor in the heavens , and the hush upon the sea , And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee , We feel Thy kingly presence , and we humbly bow the knee And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee . Thy messenger has spoken , and our doubts have fled and gone As the dark and spectral shadows of the night before the dawn ; And in kindly shelter of the light around us drawn , We would nestle down forever in the breast we lean upon . You have given us a shepherd --  You have given us a guide , And the light of Heaven grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes to lead Thy children where the gates will open wide To welcome his returning when his works are glorified . By the splendor in the heavens , and the hush upon the sea , And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee --  , We feel Thy kingly presence , and we humbly bow the knee And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee . Then the vision , slowly failing , with the words of the refrain , Fell swooning in the moonlight through the frosty window-pane ; And I heard the clock proclaiming , like an eager sentinel Who brings the world good tidings --  , " It is Christmas --  all is well ! " Anselmo Years did I vainly seek the good Lord 's grace --  , Prayed , fasted , and did penance dire and dread ; Did kneel , with bleeding knees and rainy face , And mouth the dust , with ashes on my head ; Yea , still with knotted scourge the flesh I flayed , Rent fresh the wounds , and moaned and shrieked insanely ; And froth oozed with the pleadings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vainly , vainly ! A time , from out of swoon I lifted eye , To find a wretched outcast , gray and grim , Bathing my brow , with many a pitying sigh , And I did pray God 's grace might rest on him --  . Then , lo ! A gentle voice fell on mine ears --  " Thou shalt not sob in suppliance hereafter ; Take up thy prayers and wring them dry of tears , And lift them , white and pure with love and laughter ! " So is it now for all men else I pray ; So is it I am blest and glad alway . A Home-Made Fairy Tale Bud , come here to your uncle a spell , And I 'll tell you something you must n't tell --  For it 's a secret and shore-'nuf true , And maybe I ought n't to tell it to you --  ! But out in the garden , under the shade Of the apple-trees , where we romped and played Till the moon was up , and you thought I 'd gone Fast asleep --  , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something queer Goin ' on there in the grass , my dear --  ! ' Way down deep in it , there I see A little dude-Fairy who winked at me , And snapped his fingers , and laughed as low And fine as the whine of a mus-kee-to ! I kept still --  watchin ' him closer --  and I noticed a little guitar in his hand , Which he leant ' ginst a little dead bee --  and laid His cigarette down on a clean grass-blade , And then climbed up on the shell of a snail --  Carefully dusting his swallowtail --  And pulling up , by a waxed web-thread , This little guitar , you remember . I said ! And there he trinkled and trilled a tune --  , " My Love , so Fair , Tans in the Moon ! " Till presently , out of the clover-top He seemed to be singing to , came k'pop ! The purtiest , daintiest Fairy face In all this world , or any place ! Then the little ser'nader waved his hand , As much as to say , " We 'll excuse you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids to , A kiss like the drip of a drop of dew ! The South Wind and the Sun O The South Wind and the Sun ! How each loved the other one Full of fancy -- - full folly --  Full of jollity and fun ! How they romped and ran about , Like two boys when school is out , With glowing face , and lisping lip , Low laugh , and lifted shout ! And the South Wind --  he was dressed With a ribbon round his breast That floated , flapped and fluttered In a riotous unrest , And a drapery of mist From the shoulder and the wrist Flowing backward with the motion Of the waving hand he kissed . And the Sun had on a crown Wrought of gilded thistle-down , And a scarf of velvet vapor , And a ravelled-rainbow gown ; And his tinsel-tangled hair , Tossed and lost upon the air , Was glossier and flossier Than any anywhere . And the South Wind 's eyes were two Little dancing drops of dew , As he puffed his cheeks , and pursed his lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like diamond-stone , Brighter yet than ever known , As he knit his brows and held his breath , And shone and shone and shone ! And this pair of merry fays Wandered through the summer days ; Arm-in-arm they went together Over heights of morning haze --  Over slanting slopes of lawn They went on and on and on , Where the daisies looked like star-tracks Trailing up and down the dawn . And where'er they found the top Of a wheat-stalk droop and lop They chucked it underneath the chin And praised the lavish crop , Till it lifted with the pride Of the heads it grew beside , And then the South Wind and the Sun Went onward satisfied . Over meadow-lands they tripped , Where the dandelions dipped In crimson foam of clover-bloom , And dripped and dripped and dripped ; And they clinched the bumble-stings , Gauming honey on their wings , And bundling them in lily-bells , With maudlin murmurings . And the humming-bird that hung Like a jewel up among The tilted honeysuckle-horns , They mesmerized , and swung In the palpitating air , Drowsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipped away , And left him hanging there . And they braided blades of grass Where the truant had to pass ; And they wriggled through the rushes And the reeds of the morass , Where they danced , in rapture sweet , O'er the leaves that laid a street Of undulant mosaic for The touches of their feet . By the brook with mossy brink Where the cattle came to drink . They trilled and piped and whistled With the thrush and bobolink , Till the kine in listless pause , Switched their tails in mute applause , With lifted heads and dreamy eyes , And bubble-dripping jaws . And where the melons grew , Streaked with yellow , green and blue These jolly sprites went wandering Through spangled paths of dew ; And the melons , here and there , They made love to , everywhere Turning their pink souls to crimson With caresses fond and fair . Over orchard walls they went , Where the fruited boughs were bent Till they brushed the sward beneath them Where the shine and shadow blent ; And the great green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the gleam of gold Laughed out in every look . And they stroked the downy cheek Of the peach , and smoothed it sleek , And flushed it into splendor ; And with many an elfish freak , Gave the russet 's rust a wipe --  Prankt the rambo with a stripe , And the wine-sap blushed its reddest As they spanked the pippins ripe . Through the woven ambuscade That the twining vines had made , They found the grapes , in clusters , Drinking up the shine and shade --  Plumpt like tiny skins of wine , With a vintage so divine That the tongue of fancy tingled With the tang of muscadine . And the golden-banded bees , Droning o'er the flowery leas , They bridled , reigned , and rode away Across the fragrant breeze , Till in hollow oak and elm They had groomed and stabled them In waxen stalls oozed with dews Of rose and lily-stem . Where the dusty highway leads , High above the wayside weeds They sowed the air with butterflies Like blooming flower-seeds , Till the dull grasshopper sprung Half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , with whirring wings , And sung and sung and sung ! And they loitered , hand in hand , Where the snipe along the sand Of the river ran to meet them As the ripple meets the land , Till the dragon-fly , in light Gauzy armor , burnished bright , Came tilting down the waters In a wild , bewildered flight . And they heard the killdee 's call , And afar , the waterfall , But the rustle of a falling leaf They heard above it all ; And the trailing willow crept Deeper in the tide that swept The leafy shallop to the shore , And wept and wept and wept ! And the fairy vessel veered From its moorings --  tacked and steered For the centre of the current Sailed away and disappeared : And the burthen that it bore From the long-enchanted shore --  " Alas ! The South Wind and the Sun ! " I murmur evermore . For the South Wind and the Sun , Each so loves the other one , For all his jolly folly And frivolity and fun , That our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And when at last we love them most , They laugh and sail away . The Lost Kiss I put by the half-written poem , While the pen , idly trailed in my hand , Writes on --  , " Had I words to complete it , Who 'd read it , or who 'd understand ? " But the little bare feet on the stairway , And the faint , smothered laugh in the hall , And the eerie-low lisp on the silence , Cry up to me over it all . So I gather it up --  where was broken The tear-faded thread of my theme , Telling how , as one night I sat writing , A fairy broke in on my dream , A little inquisitive fairy --  My own little girl , with the gold Of the sun in her hair , and the dewy Blue eyes of the fairies of old . ' T was the dear little girl that I scolded --  " For was it a moment like this , " I said , " when she knew I was busy , To come romping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And clamoring there at my knee For ' One ' ittle kiss for my dolly , And one ' ittle uzzer for me ! " God pity , the heart that repelled her , And the cold hand that turned her away , And take , from the lips that denied her , This answerless prayer of to-day ! Take Lord , from my mem'ry forever That pitiful sob of despair , And the patter and trip of the little bare feet , And the one piercing cry on the stair ! I put by the half-written poem , While the pen , idly trailed in my hand Writes on --  , " Had I words to complete it Who 'd read it , or who 'd understand ? " But the little bare feet on the stairway , And the faint , smothered laugh in the hall , And the eerie-low lisp on the silence , Cry up to me over it all . The Sphinx I know all about the Sphinx --  I know even what she thinks , Staring with her stony eyes Up forever at the skies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery --  Why for aeons mute she sat --  : She was just cut out for that ! If I knew What Poets Know If I knew what poets know , Would I write a rhyme Of the buds that never blow In the summer-time ? Would I sing of golden seeds Springing up in ironweeds ? And of raindrops turned to snow , If I knew what poets know ? Did I know what poets do , Would I sing a song Sadder than the pigeon 's coo When the days are long ? Where I found a heart in pain , I would make it glad again ; And the false should be the true , Did I know what poets do . If I knew what poets know , I would find a theme Sweeter than the placid flow Of the fairest dream : I would sing of love that lives On the errors it forgives ; And the world would better grow If I knew what poets know . Ike Walton 's Prayer I crave , dear Lord , No boundless hoard Of gold and gear , Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure-heaps of anything --  . Let but a little hut be mine Where at the hearthstone I may hear The cricket sing , And have the shine Of one glad woman 's eyes to make , For my poor sake , Our simple home a place divine --  ; Just the wee cot --  the cricket 's chirr --  Love and the smiling face of her . I pray not for Great riches , nor For vast estates and castle-halls --  , Give me to hear the bare footfalls Of children o'er An oaken floor New-rinsed with sunshine , or bespread With but the tiny coverlet And pillow for the baby 's head ; And pray Thou , may The door stand open and the day Send ever in a gentle breeze , With fragrance from the locust-trees , And drowsy moan of doves , and blur Of robin-chirps , and drone of bees , With after-hushes of the stir Of intermingling sounds , and then The good-wife and the smile of her Filling the silences again --  The cricket 's call And the wee cot , Dear Lord of all , Deny me not ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And lordly sway --  , I only pray for simple grace To look my neighbor in the face Full honestly from day to day --  Yield me his horny palm to hold . And I 'll not pray For gold --  ; The tanned face , garlanded with mirth , It hath the kingliest smile on earth ; The swart brow , diamonded with sweat , Hath never need of coronet . And so I reach , Dear Lord , to Thee , And do beseech Thou givest me The wee cot , and the cricket 's chirr , Love and the glad sweet face of her ! A Rough Sketch I caught , for a second , across the crowd --  Just for a second , and barely that --  A face , pox-pitted and evil-browed , Hid in the shade of a slouch-rim 'd hat --  With small gray eyes , of a look as keen As the long , sharp nose that grew between . And I said : ' T is a sketch of Nature 's own , Drawn i ' the dark o ' the moon , I swear , On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thither and everywhere --  With its keen little sinister eyes of gray , And nose like the beak of a bird of prey ! Our Kind of a Man 1 The kind of a man for you and me ! He faces the world unflinchingly , And smites , as long as the wrong resists , With a knuckled faith and force like fists : He lives the life he is preaching of , And loves where most is the need of love ; His voice is clear to the deaf man 's ears , And his face sublime through the blind man 's tears ; The light shines out where the clouds were dim , And the widow 's prayer goes up for him ; The latch is clicked at the hovel door And the sick man sees the sun once more , And out o'er the barren fields he sees Springing blossoms and waving trees , Feeling as only the dying may , That God 's own servant has come that way , Smoothing the path as it still winds on Through the golden gate where his loved have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! However little of worth we do He credits full , and abides in trust That time will teach us how more is just . He walks abroad , and he meets all kinds Of querulous and uneasy minds , And sympathizing , he shares the pain Of the doubts that rack us , heart and brain ; And knowing this , as we grasp his hand We are surely coming to understand ! He looks on sin with pitying eyes --  E'en as the Lord , since Paradise --  , Else , should we read , Though our sins should glow As scarlet , they shall be white as snow --  ? And feeling still , with a grief half glad , That the bad are as good as the good are bad , He strikes straight out for the Right --  and he Is the kind of a man for you and me ! The Harper Like a drift of faded blossoms Caught in a slanting rain , His fingers glimpsed down the strings of his harp In a tremulous refrain : Patter and tinkle , and drip and drip ! Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed my eyes and I bit my lip , As he played there in the street . Patter , and drip , and tinkle ! And there was the little bed In the corner of the garret , And the rafters overhead ! And there was the little window --  Tinkle , and drip , and drip --  ! The rain above , and a mother 's love , And God 's companionship ! Old Aunt Mary 's Was n't it pleasant , O brother mine , In those old days of the lost sunshine Of youth --  when the Saturday 's chores were through , And the " Sunday 's wood " in the kitchen too , And we went visiting , " me and you , " Out to Old Aunt Mary 's ? It all comes back so clear to-day ! Though I am as bald as you are gray --  Out by the barn-lot , and down the lane , We patter along in the dust again , As light as the tips of the drops of the rain , Out to Old Aunt Mary 's ! We cross the pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poplar stood , Where the hammering " red-heads " hopped awry , And the buzzard " raised " in the " clearing " sky And lolled and circled , as we went by Out to Old Aunt Mary 's . And then in the dust of the road again ; And the teams we met , and the countrymen ; And the long highway , with sunshine spread As thick as butter on country bread , Our cares behind , and our hearts ahead Out to Old Aunt Mary 's . Why , I see her now in the open door , Where the little gourds grew up the sides and o'er The clapboard roof --  ! And her face --  ah , me ! Was n't it good for a boy to see --  And was n't it good for a boy to be Out to Old Aunt Mary 's ? The jelly --  the Jam and the marmalade , And the cherry and quince " preserves ' ' she made ! And the sweet-sour pickles of peach and pear , With cinnamon in ' em , and all things rare --  ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Out to Old Aunt Mary 's ! And the old spring-house in the cool green gloom Of the willow-trees --  , and the cooler room Where the swinging-shelves and the crocks were kept --  Where the cream in a golden languor slept While the waters gurgled and laughed and wept --  Out to Old Aunt Mary 's . And O my brother , so far away , This is to tell you she waits to-day To welcome us --  : Aunt Mary fell Asleep this morning , whispering --  " Tell The boys to come ! " And all is well Out to Old Aunt Mary 's . Illileo Illileo , the moonlight seemed lost across the vales --  The stars but strewed the azure as an armor 's scattered scales ; The airs of night were quiet as the breath of silken sails , And all your words were sweeter than the notes of nightingales . Illileo Legardi , in the garden there alone , With your figure carved of fervor , as the Psyche carved of stone , There came to me no murmur of the fountain 's undertone So mystically , musically mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low the leaves were mute , And the echoes faltered breathless in your voice 's vain pursuit ; And there died the distant dalliance of the serenader 's lute : And I held you in my bosom as the husk may hold the fruit .

Let them reeling reach to win me --  even Heaven I would miss , Grasping earthward --  ! I would cling here , though I clung by just a kiss . And blossoms should grow odorless --  and lilies all aghast --  And I said the stars should slacken in their paces through the vast , Ere yet my loyalty should fail enduring to the last --  . So vowed I. It is written . It is changeless as the past .

And they rode high over the dewy lawn , With brave , glad banners of every hue That rolled in ripples , as they rode on In splendor , two and two ; And the tinkling links of the golden reins Of the steeds they rode rang such refrains As the castanets in a dream of Spain 's Intensest gold and blue . And they rode and rode ; and the steeds they neighed And pranced , and the sun on their glossy hides Flickered and lightened and glanced and played Like the moon on rippling tides ; And their manes were silken , and thick and strong , And their tails were flossy , and fetlock-long , And jostled in time to the teeming throng , And their knightly song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the fluttering sash of the queen went wild In the wind , and the proud king glanced at her As one at a wilful child --  , And as knight and lady away they flew , And the banners flapped , and the falcon too , And the lances flashed and the bugle blew , He kissed his hand and smiled . And then , like a slanting sunlit shower , The pageant glittered across the plain , And the turf spun back , and the wildweed flower Was only a crimson stain . And a dreamer 's eyes they are downward cast , As he blends these words with the wailing blast : " It is the King of the Year rides past ! " And Autumn is here again . A Bride " O I am weary ! " she sighed , as her billowy Hair she unloosed in a torrent of gold That rippled and fell o'er a figure as willowy , Graceful and fair as a goddess of old : Over her jewels she flung herself drearily , Crumpled the laces that snowed on her breast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair like a dove in its nest --  .

Lift up the lashes weighed down by her tears And wash with their dews one white face from her history , Set like a gem in the red rust of years ? Nothing will rest her --  unless he who died of her Strayed from his grave , and in place of the groom , Tipping her face , kneeling there by the side of her , Drained the old kiss to the dregs of his doom --  . And naught but that shadowy form in the mirror To heel in dumb agony down and weep near her ! The Dead Lover Time is so long when a man is dead !

The sunshine showers across the grain , And the bluebird trills in the orchard tree ; And in and out , when the eaves dip rain , The swallows are twittering ceaselessly .

When Bessie Died If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped , And ne'er would nestle in your palm again ; If the white feet into the grave had tripped --  " When Bessie died --  We braided the brown hair , and tied It just as her own little hands Had fastened back the silken strands A thousand times --  the crimson bit Of ribbon woven into it That she had worn with childish pride --  Smoothed down the dainty bow --  and cried When Bessie died .

The Shower The landscape , like the awed face of a child , Grew curiously blurred ; a hush of death Fell on the fields , and in the darkened wild The zephyr held its breath . No wavering glamour-work of light and shade Dappled the shivering surface of the brook ; The frightened ripples in their ambuscade Of willows thrilled and shook . The sullen day grew darker , and anon Dim flashes of pent anger lit the sky ; With rumbling wheels of wrath came rolling on The storm 's artillery .

From the Headboard of a Grave in Paraguay A troth , and a grief , and a blessing , Disguised them and came this way --  , And one was a promise , and one was a doubt , And one was a rainy day .

Fame 1 Once , in a dream , I saw a man , With haggard face and tangled hair , And eyes that nursed as wild a care As gaunt Starvation ever can ; And in his hand he held a wand Whose magic touch gave life and thought Unto a form his fancy wrought And robed with coloring so grand , It seemed the reflex of some child Of Heaven , fair and undefiled --  A face of purity and love --  To woo him into worlds above : And as I gazed with dazzled eyes , A gleaming smile lit up his lips As his bright soul from its eclipse Went flashing into Paradise . Then tardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . 2 And once I saw a man alone , In abject poverty , with hand Uplifted o'er a block of stone That took a shape at his command And smiled upon him , fair and good --  A perfect work of womanhood , Save that the eyes might never weep , Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep , Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist , Be brushed away , caressed and kissed . And as in awe I gazed on her , I saw the sculptor 's chisel fall --  I saw him sink , without a moan , Sink life less at the feet of stone , And lie there like a worshipper . Fame crossed the threshold of the hall , And found a statue --  that was all . 3 And once I saw a man who drew A gloom about him like cloak , And wandered aimlessly .

I saw him , in my vision , filled With rapture o'er a spray of bloom The wind threw in his lonely room ; And of the sweet perfume it spilled He drank to drunkenness , and flung His long hair back , and laughed and sung And clapped his hands as children do At fairy tales they listen to , While from his flying quill there dripped Such music on his manuscript That he who listens to the words May close his eyes and dream the birds Are twittering on every hand A language he can understand . He journeyed on through life unknown , Without one friend to call his own ; He tired . No kindly hand to press The cooling touch of tenderness Upon his burning brow , nor lift To his parched lips God 's freest gift --  No sympathetic sob or sigh Of trembling lips --  no sorrowing eye Looked out through tears to see him die .

The Ripest Peach The ripest peach is highest on the tree --  And so her love , beyond the reach of me , Is dearest in my sight . Sweet breezes bow Her heart down to me where I worship now ! She looms aloft where every eye may see The ripest peach is highest on the tree . Such fruitage as her love I know , alas ! I may not reach here from the orchard grass .

A Fruit Piece The afternoon of summer folds Its warm arms round the marigolds , And with its gleaming fingers , pets The watered pinks and violets That from the casement vases spill , Over the cottage window-sill , Their fragrance down the garden walks Where droop the dry-mouthed hollyhocks . How vividly the sunshine scrawls The grape-vine shadows on the walls ! How like a truant swings the breeze In high boughs of the apple-trees ! The slender " free-stone " lifts aloof , Full languidly above the roof , A hoard of fruitage , stamped with gold And precious mintings manifold . High up , through curled green leaves , a pear Hangs hot with ripeness here and there . Beneath the sagging trellisings , In lush , lack-lustre clusterings , Great torpid grapes , all fattened through With moon and sunshine , shade and dew , Until their swollen girths express But forms of limp deliciousness --  Drugged to an indolence divine With heaven 's own sacramental wine .

The Wandering Jew The stars are falling , and the sky Is like a field of faded flowers ; The winds on weary wings go by ; The moon hides , and the tempest lowers ; And still through every clime and age I wander on a pilgrimage That all men know an idle quest , For that the goal I seek is --  Rest ! I hear the voice of summer streams , And following , I find the brink Of cooling springs , with childish dreams Returning as I bend to drink --  But suddenly , with startled eyes , My face looks on its grim disguise Of long gray beard ; and so , distressed , I hasten on , nor taste of rest .

Is there no end ? I plead in vain : Lost worlds nor living answer me . Since Pontius Pilate 's awful reign Have I not passed eternity ? Have I not drunk the fetid breath Of every fevered phase of death , And come unscathed through every pest And scourge and plague that promised rest ? Have I not seen the stars go out That shed their light o'er Galilee , And mighty kingdoms tossed about And crumbled clod-like in the sea ?

A Glimpse of Pan I caught but a glimpse of him . Summer was here . And I strayed from the town and its dust and heat . And walked in a wood , while the noon was near , Where the shadows were cool , and the atmosphere Was misty with fragrances stirred by my feet From surges of blossoms that billowed sheer Of the grasses , green and sweet . And I peered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vines that swept To the face of a river , that answered these With vines in the wave like the vines in the breeze , Till the yearning lips of the ripples crept And kissed them , with quavering ecstasies , And wistfully laughed and wept And there , like a dream in swoon , I swear I saw Pan lying --  , his limbs in the dew And the shade , and his face in the dazzle and glare Of the glad sunshine ; while everywhere , Over across , and around him blew Filmy dragon-flies hither and there , And little white butterflies , two and two , In eddies of odorous air . Sonnets Pan This Pan is but an idle god , I guess , Since all the fair midsummer of my dreams He loiters listlessly by woody streams , Soaking the lush glooms up with laziness ; Or drowsing while the maiden-winds caress Him prankishly , and powder him with gleams Of sifted sunshine . And he ever seems Drugged with a joy unutterable --  unless His low pipes whistle hints of it far out Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Drops quiveringly down , as though to die --  Then lifts and wavers on , as if in doubt Whether to fan his wings or fly without . Dusk The frightened herds of clouds across the sky Trample the sunshine down , and chase the day Into the dusky forest-lands of gray And sombre twilight . Far and faint , and high , The wild goose trails his harrow , with a cry Sad as the wail of some poor castaway Who sees a vessel drifting far astray Of his last hope , and lays him down to die . The children , riotous from school , grow bold And quarrel with the wind whose angry gust Plucks off the summer-hat , and flaps the fold Of many a crimson cloak , and twirls the dust In spiral shapes grotesque , and dims the gold Of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust .

The lily blows A bugle-call of fragrance o'er the glade ; And wheeling into ranks , with plume and spear , Thy harvest-armies gather on parade ; While faint and far away , yet pure and clear , A voice calls out of alien lands of shade --  : All hail the Peerless Goddess of the Year ! Silence Thousands of thousands of hushed years ago , Out on the edge of Chaos , all alone I stood on peaks of vapor , high upthrown Above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow , Nor any motion won of winds that blow , Nor any sound of watery wail or moan , Nor lisp of wave , nor wandering undertone Of any tide lost in the night below .

Thy languor seems An ocean-depth of love wherein I sink Like some fond Argonaut , right willingly --  , Because of wooing eyes upturned to mine , And siren-arms that coil their sorcery About my neck , with kisses so divine , The heavens reel above me , and the sea Swallows and licks its wet lips over me . Her Hair The beauty of her hair bewilders me --  Pouring adown the brow , its cloven tide Swirling about the ears on either side And storming round the neck tumultuously : Or like the lights of old antiquity Through mullioned windows , in cathedrals wide Spilled moltenly o'er figures deified In chastest marble , nude of drapery . And so I love it --  . Either unconfined ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or indolently twined In careless knots whose coilings come unrolled At any lightest kiss ; or by the wind Whipped out in flossy ravellings of gold . Dearth I hold your trembling hand to-night --  and yet I may not know what wealth of bliss is mine , My heart is such a curious design Of trust and jealousy ! Your eyes are wet --  So must I think they jewel some regret --  , And lo , the loving arms that round me twine Cling only as the tendrils of a vine Whose fruit has long been gathered : I forget , While crimson clusters of your kisses press Their wine out on my lips , my royal fair Of rapture , since blind fancy needs must guess They once poured out their sweetness otherwhere , With fuller flavoring of happiness Than e'en your broken sobs may now declare .

The Serenade The midnight is not more bewildering To her drowsed eyes , than to her ears , the sound Of dim , sweet singing voices , interwound With purl of flute and subtle twang of string , Strained through the lattice , where the roses cling And , with their fragrance , waft the notes around Her haunted senses .

So wrought he , witless that behind him leant A woman , with old features , dim and sear , And glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear , And with a voice , like some sad instrument , That sighing said , " I 'm dead there ; love me here !

And he returned and came again to his horse , and took off his saddle and his bridle , and let him pasture ; and unlaced his helm , and ungirdled his sword , and laid him down to sleep upon his shield before the cross .  - -  Age of Chivalary Grant What shall we say of the soldier . Grant , His sword put by and his great soul free ? How shall we cheer him now or chant His requiem befittingly ? The fields of his conquest now are seen Ranged no more with his armed men --  But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waving grain is there again . Though his valiant life is a nation 's pride , And his death heroic and half divine , And our grief as great as the world is wide , There breaks in speech but a single line --  : We loved him living , revere him dead --  ! A silence then on our lips is laid : We can say no thing that has not been said , Nor pray one prayer that has not been prayed . But a spirit within us speaks : and lo , We lean and listen to wondrous words That have a sound as of winds that blow , And the voice of waters and low of herds ; And we hear , as the song flows on serene , The neigh of horses , and then the beat Of hooves that skurry o'er pastures green , And the patter and pad of a boy 's bare feet . A brave lad , wearing a manly brow , Knit as with problems of grave dispute , And a face , like the bloom of the orchard bough , Pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the clover-bloom , And fresh it gleams as the morning dew , As he reins his steed where the quick quails boom Up from the grasses he races through . And ho ! As he rides what dreams are his ? And what have the breezes to suggest --  ? Do they whisper to him of shells that whiz O'er fields made ruddy with wrongs redressed ? Does the hawk above him an Eagle float ? Does he thrill and his boyish heart beat high , Hearing the ribbon about his throat Flap as a Flag as the winds go by ? And does he dream of the Warrior 's fame --  This Western boy in his rustic dress ? For in miniature , this is the man that came Riding out of the Wilderness --  ! The selfsame figure --  the knitted brow --  The eyes full steady --  the lips full mute --  And the face , like the bloom of the orchard bough , Pink and pallid , but resolute . Ay , this is the man , with features grim And stoical as the Sphinx 's own , That heard the harsh guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the sweet spring heavens were clouded o'er With a tempest , glowering and wild , And our country 's flag bowed down before Its bursting wrath as a stricken child . Thus , ready mounted and booted and spurred , He loosed his bridle and dashed away --  ! Like a roll of drums were his hoof-beats heard , Like the shriek of the fife his charger 's neigh ! And over his shoulder and backward blown , We heard his voice , and we saw the sod Reel , as our wild steeds chased his own As though hurled on by the hand of God ! And still , in fancy , we see him ride In the blood-red front of a hundred frays , His face set stolid , but glorified As a knight 's of the old Arthurian days : And victor ever as courtly too , Gently lifting the vanquished foe , And staying him with a hand as true As dealt the deadly avenging blow . So brighter than all of the cluster of stars Of the flag enshrouding his form to-day , His face shines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not pass away : He rests at last : he has borne his part Of salutes and salvos and cheers on cheers --  But O the sobs of his country 's heart , And the driving rain of a nations tears ! In Dialect Old Fashioned Roses They ai n't no style about ' em , And they 're sorto ' pale and faded , Yit the doorway here , without ' em , Would be lonesomer , and shaded With a good ' eal blacker shudder Than the morning-glories makes , And the sunshine would look sadder Fer their good old-fashion ' sakes . I like ' em ' cause they kindo '  --  Sorto ' make a feller like ' em ! And I tell you , when I find a Bunch out whur the sun kin strike ' em , It allus sets me thinkin ' O ' the ones ' at used to grow And peek in thro ' the chinkin ' O ' the cabin , do n't you know ! And then I think o ' mother , And how she ust to love ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found ' em up above ' em ! And her eyes , afore she shut ' em , Whispered with a smile and said We must pick a bunch and putt ' em In her hand when she wuz dead . But as I wuz a-sayin ' , They ai n't no style about ' em Very gaudy er displayin ' , But I would n't be without ' em --  , ' Cause I 'm happier in these posies , And the hollyhawks and sich , Than the hummin ' - bird ' at noses In the roses of the rich . Griggsby 's Station Pap 's got his patent-right , and rich is all creation ; But where 's the peace and comfort that we all had before ? Le 's go a-visitin ' back to Griggsby 's Station --  Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore ! The likes of us a-livin ' here ! It 's jest a mortal pity To see us in this great big house , with cyarpets on the stairs , And the pump right in the kitchen ! And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city all around us ever'wheres !

Le 's go a-visitin ' back to Griggsby 's Station --  Back where the latch-strings a-hangin ' from the door , And ever ' neighbor round the place is dear as a relation --  Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore !

Le 's go a-visitin ' back to Griggsby 's Station --  Back where they 's nothin ' aggervatin ' any more , Shet away safe in the woods around the old location --  Back where we ust to be so happy and so pore ! I want to see Marindy and he'p her with her sewin ' , And hear her talk so lovin ' of her man that 's dead and gone , And stand up with Emanuel to show me how he 's growin ' , And smile as I have saw her ' fore she putt her mournin ' on . And I want to see the Samples , on the old lower eighty , Where John , our oldest boy , he was tuk and burried --  for His own sake and Katy's --  , and I want to cry with Katy As she reads all his letters over , writ from The War . What 's in all this grand life and high situation , And nary pink nor hollyhawk a-bloomin ' at the door --  ? Le 's go a-visitin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so happy and so pore !

And sae these hamely lines I send , Wi ' jinglin ' words at ilka end , In echo o ' the sangs that wend Frae thee to me Like simmer-brooks , wi mony a bend O ' wimplin ' glee . In fancy , as wi ' dewy een , I part the clouds aboon the scene Where thou wast born , and peer atween , I see nae spot In a ' the Hielands half sae green And unforgot ?
