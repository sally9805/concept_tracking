EDUCATI&amp;NAL TOPICS . ARTICLE 1. - THE HARVARD ELECTIVE SYSTEM . THE question as to the kind and amount of election which should be allowed to college students in this country has of late excited an increasing interest . In view of the comparatively recent introduction of any large and free choice into the education furnished by this peculiarly American institution , it has hitherto been impossible to argue the question on a basis of actual trial . Wbat is known as the " Harvard System " is of very recent origin ; it is , in fact a new and stupendous experiment . Until recently , then , the party opposed to this system has simply urged its fears and the general considerations belonging to a conservative policy in education ; while the party in favor of this system has replied by stating its hopes and aspirations , together with copious reference to certain disadvantages of the policy it wishes to replace . Within a few months , however , no less than four noteworthy papers have undertaken to discuss the question in the light of accomplished facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Professor Ladd of Yale in the Andover Review for November , 1885 , and January , 1886 , portions of the " Annual Reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College " for 1884-85 , and a pamphlet on " the System of Instruction and Government at Harvard College , " by Samuel Brearley , Jr. , of New York City . The article of Professor Palmer and the report of President Eliot take the ground that the " Harvard System " has demonstrated its great superiority over that in use in other colleges in this country , as a matter of indubitable fact and in several important particulars . The article of Professor Ladd replies to that of Professor Palmer by showing that better results are actually gained , even in the particulars chosen as decisive by the latter , at Yale where the " Harvard system " is not in vogue . The pamphlet of Mr. Brearley restates the facts to which the Harvard President and Professor make their appeal , but claims them to be distinctly and highly unfavorable to the // conclusions drawn from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers of the New Englander the substance of Mr. Brearley 's argument against the " Harvard System . " But , first , it will be in order briefly to answer two questions , namely : What is the origin and character of this pamphlet ? and What is the question which is really presented for its discussion ? Mr. Brearley 's paper gives at the length of nearly forty pages , his conclusions as sub-committee of a committee of eight gentlemen appointed to report to the Harvard Club of New York City concerning the working of the elective system as at present conducted in their alma mater . The pamphlet is therefore authorized and ex-officio ; it is clear , able , and thorough . It is written in admirable style and temper , and shows large comprehension of the various bearings of the subject . Its point of view is from the inside as it were . It has the advantage of being by a graduate of the department criticized , who is an intelligent gentleman and who knows the meaning of the word " education . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the letters on Yale by Mr. Page of the same city , recently published in the New York Nation . Mr. Brearley inspires the confidence of the reader . The question discussed in the pamphlet and the one really at issue between the advocates and the opponents of the " Harvard System , " concerns the kind and amount of election of his studies which should be allowed to the college student . The peculiarity of the " system " is , not that it admits elective studies , but that it makes the choice practically unlimited , beginning with Freshman year and extending to all the studies of the college curriculum . The point of debate is thus stated by Mr. Brearley 's pamplflet . " To begin with , we premise that every one accepts the elective principle . Some system based on that principle must be established . No one wants the old required systems back or any new required system . The true question is , at what time in a man 's course should he have a right to choose , and between what things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the point to be considered is , what kind of elective system will be best for us ? " Before entering upon his answer to these questions , Mr. Brear ley calls attention to the exceedingly small amount of experience upon which the venture is made of flying in the face , as it were , of the world 's accumulated wisdom on the matter of education . Not a single entire college course has been run by any class // 361 under the developed Harvard system . And yet we are assured that its results already demonstrate beyond doubt its brilliant success ; it has wrought a complete revolution in education ! The fallacy of claiming all the advances of Harvard-its growth in numbers , and accumulation of money , etc. - as arguments in behalf of its elective system , is also pointed out . On this subject the pamphlet remarks as follows : " When the Faculties of the University of Berlin proclaimed that in the matter of classics vs. modern studies they were convinced by an experience of only fifteen years , many were surprised by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old institutions are like judging a machine for perpetual motion by its record for eight days . After all , young men have been objects of observation a long time , and academic systems have been under consideration from the beginnings of civilization . Certain conclusions have been arrived at with the general consent of all high authorities , and if the present system at Harvard runs counter to those conclusions , it is probably an irrational experiment . There is a strong tendency to credit the growth of the college , the improvements i1*i teaching , the increased use of the library , and other signs of advancement to this particular kind of elective system . This seems to us an argument of post hoc , propter hoc . We believe the gains would have been far greater with a different elective system . " We desire to have Mr. Brearley 's paper speak for itself ; this it is quite competent to do , and this it certainly does most emphatically . We prefer , therefore , to do little more ourselves than to arrange in order quotations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly demonstrated . And first of all : is the " Harvard System " at all likely to give , or does it in fact give , a reasonable and symmetrical education ? It has been urged in its behalf that the old system of education led inevitably to the imparting of a smattering of many knowledges . The new science of the age is manifold ; no man can compass much of it . Let the student therefore choose freely and so avoid the miscellany of little courses in the various studies to which the ordinary college curriculum would compel him . This is the argument of the advocates of the " Harvard system . " But the reply is patent . No one else concerned is so likely to make an unintelligent " hodge-podge " of his studies as the boy of eighteen or nineteen in the midst of the bewildering opportunities that invite the Harvard Freshman and Sophomore . Following is Mr. Brearley 's statement of the facts . // " The student 's freedom of choice is between these little , incomplete courses of study . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i. e. at the rate of a new subject , language , science , history , or what not , for every month or two of his four years . Men are allowed to take up subjects in any order they choose , and pursue them as far as they like . A student who sees fit may for his Sophomore year form some such combination as this : one course in music ( 10 Sophomores gave a fourth of their time to harmony in 1883-4 ) , two courses in fine arts-eleven of that class elected principles of delineation , color , and chiaroscuro in 18834 , while thirty-seven of the same class chose a course on ancient art ; - as his last course he might take the elements of Sanskrit . In the Junior year this student might go on with further courses in music and fine arts , or embark on mathematics , physics , and natural history . His Senior year might be given to Greek and Latin , or political economy , or Semitic languages . Such a combination would be highly absurd and would excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the college would be bound to give him a degree , even a degree summa cum laude , provided his general average reached 95 per cent . " " Students are strongly urged , ' says the Catalogue , to make their choice with the utmost care , under the best advice , and in such a way that their studies from first to last may form a rationally connected whole . It is believed that any plan of studies deliberately made and adhered to , will be more profitable to the student than studies chosen by him from year to year , without plan , under the influence of temporary preferences . ' In saying this the College , judged by its present policy , should qualify its last assertion to read , any plan of studies deliberately made and adhered to , provided it be the free choice of a very young man . ' The college asks Freshmen to arrange for themselves a plan of study to cover four years , and , having formed it , to carry it out . Now , supposing a Freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own judgment and sele ? *ting his advisers with discretion , is he likely to form the best plan of studies , or , having formed it , to carry it out ? It is like asking the whole Freshman class to choose their professions , and then requiring that they should arrange their own plans of professional study , with the help of casual advice . Nor are the plans formed with a sense that , once made , they are irrevocable . On the contrary , the student commits himself to the studies of one year at a time , and may easily change his plans . The following passage in the pamphlet is significant : Changes of elective studies can be made in the vacation by sending written notice to the Registrar , provided , such notice reaches him on or before September 21st . No changes can be made between September 21st and October 8th . Students desiring to change on or after October 8th must apply in person at the Dean 's office . " ' " The weight of authority is against any such extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suggestions on Academical Organization , ' has // a passage which places the responsibility for fixing courses of study upon the university itself . The passage is as follows : It is a chief business of the university to lay down correct lines of study , to indicate the high-road of education among the innumerable cross-roads and bypaths of learning ; from the vast mass of all that may be learned and may be taught , to select what should be taught and learned . On its elementary side it is to offer a systematic course of initiatory study , which shall be the results of all the experience of the past , of the long educational experiment which has been going on ever since reason and intelligence began to be objects of cultivation . ' " It should be borne in mind that the danger of pursuing a variety of heterogeneous studies without persistent method is by no means confined to the seekers after " soft options . " It may be , however , that the danger is greatest in their case . But young men of thoroughly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run no little risk of becoming bewildered in the midst of the multifarious opportunities offered them by so many unclassified elective courses . On the other hand , the opposite danger is not far away . Boys with a strong bent in one direction may be led wholly to neglect what they ought to take but dislike and consider themselves unfitted for . Specialization is necessary to a large extent in modern education , as it is in modern business or mechanical industries . But it should not come too early . The special and technical should be built upon a broad basis of general discipline and culture . Mr. BrearIcy has not overlooked this latter danger ; concerning it he says : " Opposed to such a hodge-podge is a danger which affects the upper rather than the lower half of the class ,  --  the danger of premature and narrow specialization . A striking instance of this is the encouragement given to specialists in physics , chemistry , mathematics , etc . Eighteen courses in physics and chemistry , eighteen in mathematics , and nineteen in natural history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these subjects . Under the present requirements for admission-examinations and examinations in college , a man may , so far as the classics go , take the Harvard degree , who has succeeded in obtaining 50 per cent . on pass-examinations in four books of Xenophon 's Anabasis , four books of C*esar , six books of Virgil , together with corresponding work in reading easy Greek , exercises in Latin composition , and a certain knowledge of the grammars . The other requirements , outside the specialty of chemistry , or whatever it may be , are a considerable amount of mathematics , and some acquaintance with French , and German . " In connection with the extreme length to which the elective system is carried at Harvard , another form of privilege ( or license ) // has been accorded to her undergraduates . This is the privilege of managing their own time free from all restraints of attendance upon the daily exercises or of responsibility for the performance of daily tasks . In our judgment this kind of liberty is much more likely to be pernicious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . Conservative minds have predicted of the " Harvard system " that it must inevitably result in artificiality and " cram ; " since it lays the emphasis on getting ready for an occasional examination rather than upon daily fidelity in performing stipulated amounts of labor . In every branch of human activity , the world thrives on the faithful doing of work constantly appointed to be done at fixed seasons . Why should young men in Cambridge , Mass. , thrive on what is bad for all the rest of the world ? Even the accomplished man of science or literature is accustomed to set himself his diurnal stint of labor . Not long since Mr. Thwing-who lives near enough to Harvard to inform himself about it in particular and who appears to be busy in collecting facts about colleges in general-stated that the lights in the rooms of the students are four times as numerous as ordinary just before the examinations . We do not know how to interpret Mr. Thwing unless he means to say that more than three-quarters of the Harvard students do not ordinarily employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow work is duly emphasized by Mr. Brearley 's pamphlet . " Harvard College neither indicates a systematic course of initiatory study , nor sets up any long-distant , definite aim towards which men may bend all their energies for several years . There is an arrangement by which men who take six courses in certain subjects may obtain honors in that department , provided their marks in a special examination indicate proficiency . But the arrangement does not commend itself to either teachers or students , and few men enter for these honors . The 189 courses fall under twenty heads , and in some departments there is a certain amount of method in the adjustment of the courses . In many cases , however , the preferences of instructors and accidents of various kinds have determined the subjects of courses . Students often enter upon a more or less advanced course without sufficient introductory or general work . In biology , for instance , a knowledge of chemistry and physics is not required as a preliminary . A teacher of Greek may , it is true , exclude from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his instruction he can assume nothing as to the proficiency of his pupils in Latin or literature . There are no regular examinations for admission to the various courses . That is left to the instructors of the several subjects , and they // 1886. 365 are very busy men , who , in the case of the larger classes , could not , however much they wished to do so , make any searching scrutiny of applicants . " " The great change in recent years , so far as requirements go , is in the failure to require work from day to day . The experiment of voluntary attendance has been given up , and men attend with sufficient regularity , but the preparation of lessons is no longer required . Many of the classes are so large that any questioning or testing of each man 's work would be impossible ; and the exercise consists of lectures , or lectures varied by voluntary questions asked by pupils , and informal questions put by the teacher . No marks are given day by day in the courses generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules for an instructor to give three extra examinations of one hour each in the course of the year , and one or two examinations of this kind are sometimes given , if the engagements of busy teachers leave the time . Other spurs are applied sometimes , as in the case of one instructor in history , who calls for theses at regular intervals and for smaller papers more frequently . In laboratories , there is obviously a great check upon irregularity of work . It may , however , be asserted that in all the courses at Harvard , or in all with very few exceptions indeed , a man may pass , and satisfy the minimum of college requirements , without doing an hour 's work in the year except when he crams for the midyear and final examinations . Not only is this true , but in many of the courses most largely attended , he may obtain a high mark , with no work except listening to his teacher through the term , and cramming before the two more serious examinations . A student must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a general average of 50 per cent . He needs only to attain 40 per cent . with a considerable margin-50 per cent . or 60 per cent. - in the mid-year and final examinations in order to satisfy the requirements in a course . These examinations could not be very hard , and are , as a rule , by no means so hard as they might be . To begin with , they are given by the instructors thems*lves , and are examinations not upon the subject , but upon the teacher 's instruction in the subject ,  --  instruction on which notes have been taken , and notes may be bought if a man has not taken them for himself . It is also true that the particular work of an instructor in any given course is usually familiar to old pupils and tutors , who make a business of preparing men for his examinations . The examinations , moreover , cover but a small amount of ground . A full course includes one-fourth of a year 's work ; a half course includes one eighth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a single course could not be arduous , but as a matter of fact , it is now the custom at Harvard to divide the year 's work , so that a man is examined upon the first half of it-in February , and the last half of it in June . If the course is a full course , therefore , the mid-year examination is given upon one-eighth of the year 's work , and the final upon a similar amount ; in the case of a half course , the mid-year and final examina // tions would , each of them , cover one-sixteenth of the year 's study . A man who obtains a general average of 50 per cent . ( with a small margin , say 10 per cent. , provided he does nothing outside of his regular examinations ) is entitled to the Harvard degree . And men whose work is practically confined to cramming for such a series of disconnected little examinations often graduate with high rank . " " This system sets a premium on irregular , unsteady work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cramming is more and more common among students of every grade , and private tuition is resorted to even by men with serious pretensions to scholarship . Any recent graduate of Harvard will confirm these assertions and furnish stories in illustration of them . " With such facts as the foregoing in view , it is extremely difficult to justify the claim of Professor Palmer , that the " Harvard System " is an ethical culture . " Irregular , unsteady work " is not simply an intellectual , it is also a moral , evil . Closely connected with the foregoing disadvantageous effect of the " system , " is the growing unwillingness of the student to bring his life under a rigorous discipline . The rise in scholarship which it has been claimed , has gone on in Harvard of late years , is , in the opinion of Mr. Brearley , simply a rise in fictitious rather than real value . It is much easier than in times past to obtain honors there ; they are the bids which attract men to certain of the lecture courses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirms . " The extension of the present system has lowered the standard in another way . In his article Professor Palmer says : How this or that course is conducted , what are the peculiarities of its teacher , what is the proportion in it between work given and gains had , are matters which interest the inhabitants of Hoffis and Holyoke as stocks interest Wall Street . ' There has been a steady influence working to raise the marks , at the same time that it weakens the rigor of the work . An instructor who demands hard work through the term and marks low on the examination must have a very attractive subject , or his classes will dwindle rapidly . The rank-list tells the story . 90 per cent . is no longer considered a very high rank . Men complain of it sometimes , and urge their claim for an advance . The lack of general adminstrative supervision and the loose organization leave instructors much freer in fixing their standards , than in the days when all the Faculty knew about each student 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a man 's degree , or his Honors , may be thrown absolutely on a single teacher . And , of course , this tends to relax the severity of college requirements . Mr. Palmer is greatly encouraged to find that half the last Senior Class had 80 per cent. - four fifths of a perfect mark . Our inference // from this fact does not correspond with his . When we see that out of a class of 191 , 122 are mentioned in some way on the Commencement programme , in view of what we know of the system and its workings , we conclude that distinctions are given lavishly at Harvard . " According to the statement just quoted , 90 per cent . is no longer considered a very high mark at Harvard ; half the last class got 80 per cent . But at Yale , 90 per cent . is a good rank for even the valedictorian to attain ; not three men in the class ordinarily attain it ; and not one quarter of the class attain 80 per cent . This difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on honors ; they cost more at the latter than the former institution . Mr. Brearley evidently does not sympathize with the view that the Faculty of a college discharge their whole duty to young men and their parents , when they simply lecture on the subjects advertised , at the appointed hours . In his judgment the matter of discipline is not satisfactorily arranged for at Harvard . On this point he remarks " One thing at least is clear : if in Harvard the students are to choose their own studies and govern themselves , then there should be a rigorous exclusion of men who prove to be incapable of self-government . When young men are trusted to Harvard College , and she finds her organization unfitted to deal with them , then at the least she is bound to resign her trust . There is no way of shifting this duty . And yet under the present regulations neglect of work and misconduct might not be known to the college unless they were flagrant . If the work of each man were closely supervised there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only twice a year , and then not very effectively . Professor Palmer says : Parents should be warned , and those who have brought up t1*iefr sons to habits of luxurious ease should be made fully aware that a college which appeals to character has no place for children of theirs . Every mode of training has its exclusions . I prefer the one which brings least profit to our dangerous classes  --  the indolent rich . Leslie Stephen has said that the only argument rascals can understand is the hangman . The only inducement to study , for boys of loose early life , is compulsion . But for the plain democratic many , who have sound seed in themselves , who have known duty early , and who have found in worthy things their law and impulse , the elective system , even during the freshman year , gives an opportunity for moral and mental expansion such as no compulsory system can afford . ' Parents may be warned in advance , but after all it is the college itself that must carry out such a policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A policy like this is , moreover , by no means desirable or admirable . The duty of the college seems to us the formation of character , not simply the instruction of men whose characters are already formed . Harvard College is one of the institutions bound in honor to mould the characters of the rich men who are to hold high and influential positions . To renounce the education of the men whose habits and ideals are not fixed , and whose characters are unformed , would be a confession of incompetency and bad faith . " It is acknowledged by all , however , that the " Harvard System " operates per se to make all that personal influence of the teacher on the pupil which is so highly to be prized , more difficult and more uncertain . For , as says Mr. Brearley " In its greatly increased numbers as well as its peculiar organization , the college finds itself in most urgent need of personal influence exerted by teacher over pupil . The personal influence of the teacher is able in some sort , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the system can not dispense with personal influence . With influence there is life , without it there is none . ' All authorities agree that this is the most important of all the elements which constitute a university . Have a university in shanties , no ! in tents , but let there be great teachers in it 1 ' " Some teachers at Harvard do their best to maintain friendly relations with their pupils , and accomplish a great deal . Of this individual , social work there is , probably , more than heretofore , but there is no systematic organized attempt to bring the college , through some one of its teachers , into intimate association with every student . Social intercourse is not enough , the tutor and pupil must do serious work together , like private tutor and pupil , if the relation is to be effective . " " The huge , heterogeneous , fluctuating classes make personal influence in the class-room more difficult , and , in a corresponding degree , call for supplementary teaching . The free choice between all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent need of special teaching for individuals , but there is , let us say it once more , no organized , systematic effort to meet that need . In the old days the dozen or score of teachers and the four small classes used to know each other well in the class-room if not in a social way . They formed a community with a good circulation to its outermost extremities . " It is not intercourse with teachers alone ( or perhaps even chiefly ) that is needed to complete the ethical and manly tone of character which a college course should be fitted to produce . Many graduates of Yale can testify most warmly to the immense benefit which they have received from the cordial , democratic , and generous , class-life and common life which prevails in her // 369 walls and upon her campus . Mr. Brearley laments the lack of this at Harvard . " The existing system also lessens the effectiveness of association between students themselves . Classes now are associated in a single study , and perhaps not longer than one year ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied different things before , and often have different plans for the future ; they often do not work together at all in any true sense , but cram for the same examinations . In many cases they have previously been strangers , , and they are perhaps well on in their hundred lectures or informal recitations before they know each other 's names . There is , of course , a great deal of association in college , but association in pleasure or even athletics-rigorous athletics at that-has not the virtue of steady , constant identifl* cation in work between men of the same standing . Under the old system men of various antecedents who would rarely meet in a social way were thrown together on neutral ground , and in the ardor of work taught each other invaluable lessons . If their tastes and temperaments differed , they approached the same subjects from different sides and thus brought out their full meaning . Working together with full understanding of one another , they set standards one for another and inspirited each other . " " A system which prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's self and one 's classmates , simply destroys real emulation . When a teacher scarcely knows what to expect or require of any one student , the student will feel the same difficulty , and emulation must die out . Rank , honors , and scholarships are based upon marks-marks obtained in multitudinous courses , hard or easymarks given by scores of instructors either good-natured or strict . There is no standard of comparison of the kind essential to genuine emulation . With such a standard of comparison able men , independently of other influence , will spur each other on to do themselves and their college credit . The has of it is a very serious loss indeed . " We are reluctant to limit ourselves in quoting from this very instructive and incisive criticism of the " Harvard system . " It will be possible , perhaps , for readers of the New Englander to procure the pamphlet and so possess themselves of all its information . In closing , however , we call attention to a different point . It is obvious that much has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no little eclat for both its claims and its results , by creating the favorable prejudice that it is an advance or improvement upon the ordinary American conception of the " college . " The " Harvard system " is popularly supposed to have more virtue as a system because born of the " University " idea . But Mr. Brearley plainly shows-what has indeed been shown before voL. ix . 24 // that no appeal can be taken to England or to Germany for precedents ; the plan adopted at Cambridge is absolutely without authority from experience had anywhere upon the face of the earth . Says Mr. Brearley " For such an application of the elective principle as that at Harvard there is no good precedent whatever . German universities lend it no countenance . English universities present nothing at all similar to it . In Germany men enter the university after receiving the unrivalled training of the Gymnasia , which carry students further in scholarship than most of our colleges do . At the Gymnasia they are treated like school-boys , and in the universities they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one most important restriction . At the end of the university course a man must pass a severe examination , regulated by the State , or every important career is barred against him . His freedom in the university is subject to the necessity of preparing for these examinations . Mr. Matthew Arnold says almost every student has them in view , and that they include three or four days of paper work as well as six or eight hours of viva-voce examination . Since the misapprehension has been general in regard to the precedent of German universities , we quote from an article by Mr. R. T. Ely in Harper 's Magazine for July , 1880 : There is no regulation , ' says Mr. Ely , to prevent a student of law from hearing a lecture , e. g. , on the Agamemnon of *schylus , but this rarely happens . Each one has the examination in mind which is to admit him into active life , and , as a rule , pursues only the studies required for passing it , and what is more , pursues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * There are exceptions ; some study for the love of study , for the love of science , of truth ,  --  but they are few . The professors who teach sciences not required for some examination complain that comparatively few students attend these lectures . Professor Wundt says in Mind , November , 1877 : It requires either compulsion or a specially lively interest to bring our doctors , lawyers , philologists to the philosophical lectures . But of late compulsion has for the most part ceased . ' Professor Wagner , Professor of Political Economy at Berlin , says only a small number of law students hear lectures on political economy , or any other lectures which are not absolutely required for examination . Over three thousand matriculated students and two thousand non-matriculated are in Berlin , and yet Zeller has few hearers , because his subject enters into few examinations . * * * The essence of the freedom which each university student has of selecting his studies is simply the freedom given to men of selecting their own professions . The door through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination ; but the Minister of Instruction and other public authorities prescribe very minutely the studies required for each examination . * * * The student has only the option of pursuing those sciences where and in the order which he will . ' Professor Lane , in an article on German Universities ( vol. xlvi. , No . Amer . Rev. ) , after speaking of the examinations for graduation from the // 371 Gymnasia ( Maturitiitszeugniss ) and the State examination which follows upon the university Course , uses these words : Take the two examinations away , and the whole university and lecture system of Germany would immediately drop to pieces. * The precedents in England are also remote from the experiments at Harvard . Men have the right of election there , too , but their election must be made between broad lines of study , combinations of courses all cognate and closely allied . Early in their college life men follow a course which does not vary in essentials , some studying more mathematics than others , but all aiming at the same general training . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who are studying for honors , take , at Oxford , one or another of a half dozen schools , and , having chosen their school , they work within that department . These departments are , the old Oxford School par excellence ; Litera3 humaniores , theology , modern history , jurisprudence , mathematics , and natural science . The school in modern history , for example , includes some political economy , constitutional law , political philosophy , and geography . In history proper it comprises the entire modern history of England , constitutional and political , a period in general history ( say from 1648 to 1815 ) , and a special subject studied from contemporaneous documents ( say the French Revolution ) . A large choice is allowed in selecting the period of general history and special subject . A knowledge of French and power of writing English are both assumed . At Cambridge the schools ( " Triposes " ) are more numerous , and the tutorial system is not so efficient as in the better colleges at Oxford . The work of men studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford ) during these years is directed toward severe examinations at the end of the time ,  --  examinations lasting five or six days , with six hours a day of written work , and including an hour of oral examination , for each man . The distinction *and emoluments to be won by taking a first class in these examinations , make men most eager to succeed . College and university scholarships and college fellowships awarded upon competitive examination at many times and in various subjects , also do much to maintain high standards . Having these spurs to their ambition , English students are thrown upon themselves much as a young man would be who was beginning the world . But the college community offers a strong guiding influence in the tutor , who acts as special friend and teacher for his pupil . We are able to say that in the best colleges at Oxford every undergraduate has some one amongst the teachers who is specially responsible for him , and to whom the student is consigned by the authority of the college . This tutor , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to know his pupil in a friendly way ; to help him plan out his work , lectures , and reading ; to advise him about all his interests ; to do a substantial amount of private work with him every week ; and , finally , to act as an intermediary between him and the college . This is the relationship of tutor frequently mentioned in English biographies  --  a relationship that often gives direction to a man 's whole life . In Balliol College , ten men divide the tutorial // work for two hundred and fifteen undergraduates . This personal influence is felt by the whole college to be a duty , and the task of making the most of a student is felt to be difficult enough if man himself and college coöperate in every possible way . The analogy between college and family is accepted and not disclaimed . A college in Oxford is judged by her men-not by her buildings or endowments . The greatest teacher in Oxford has served there forty years , always in the same college , and for fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorest , but also the college of the highest standing in scholarship , and the most influential in Oxford . During all these forty years his college has received additions of not more than $250,000 to its funds . But throughout the British Empire are planted his pupils , governors of the people often , who well know the debt they owe him , and still claim him as their friend .
