txt A person who plausibly represents himself to be the author of " The Student 's Dream " has prepared a sort of conundrum which is to be submitted to the Concord school of Philosophy , with an offer of $500 for an essay of not more than 1,000 words upon it which shall disprove the metaphysical theory stated in the aforesaid " Student 's Dream . " With diabolical ingenuity this fiend has so arranged his problem that no one who once commits his mind to it can ever thereafter dismiss it from his thoughts . He can not escape or turn back , but must constantly ponder the horrid thing till his mind is a complete wreck , which , with the average philosopher , would happen in from three to five hours . The wretch enticingly says that the object of his offer is " to raise and settle the question whether there are five or three ultimate realities , and whether the three are not included in motion . " This looks as innocent as algebra or criaternions . It is just the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord thinker . Prof. HARRIS would lay down Hegel to take it up . Dr. JONES is notoriously incapable of letting such things alone , and who can say that if the speculative eye of Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE were to light upon it she would not first inquire , then ruminate , then embrace ? Observe the subtle cunning of this monster , who puts on the livery of metaphysics to serve the mad-house keeper in . He first lures his helpless victims on by the hope of emolument . Five hundred dollars is a large sum to a philosopher , for the calling is not lucrative and this is the dull season . Then he limits the essay to 1,000 words , which makes the price 50 cents a word . " The idea in limiting the reply , " he says , " is to oblige people to reduce their thoughts to the simplest possible terms before expressing them . " That is intended to flatter and encourage the Concord philosophers , who , ' being accustomed to compress their language until it is wholly unintelligible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other competitors . Then he stipulates that the essay " shall disprove the metaphysical theory " of a certain book . Everybody knows that it is meat and drink to a metaphysician to disprove the theories and systems of those who have gone before him . That is all there is in metaphysics . New theories are constantly being set up , of course , but that is merely a provision against the extinction of the business , for those who are to come must necessarily have something to work upon . These things are perfectly well understood among the members of the guild . Finally  --  and this is the first thing that would arrest the attention on . a superficial reading  --  the circular containing the announcement thrusts that irresistible bait of the " three or five ultimate realities " under the very nose of the victim , and the trap springs with a vicious snap . Even then there is a merciful moment of peace . A careful examination of the conditions of the problem with a view to undertaking the task of its solution reveals at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all phenomena are explained by motion ; that motion is the ultimate relation , and that thought and all that thought represents or can represent is reducible to this relation . " There is certainly no harm in that , though the italics  --  which are the author 's ? might well make a prudent man pause . But the plot thickens . " The terms of this ultimate relation , " we are told , " as disclosed by the ideas which the conception of it includes , are space and.time . But this theory rests upon the truth that matter and space are two.names tor the same thing , and that the word force , when not used in the place of motion , can only mean time . " At this point the judicious reader , if he has a wife and family depending on him , alarmed not so much by the growing wildness of the language as by the suspicious recurrence of the italics , puts the ghastly thing from him and is saved . But the professional philosopher is by this time hopelessly enmeshed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mind is intoxicated by these phrases , and he rushes on to what follows . After , a sentence or two , which , as a respectable journal , we must decline to print , this eclipse of reason proceeds in the following fashion : " If , therefore , the correlates ( or the related realities ) matter and force and space and time , when viewed in the broadest possible light , are found to be but one pair of realities instead of two , and if we find the words space and time more able to express the conception of these two ultimate realities than the words matter and force ; if we find it impossible to form a conception of motion without at the same time thinking of these two ultimate realities , then we are justified in saying that motion is three in one , and that it expresses all . " As if anything could justify such horrible language ! This is not all . Down in the lower left-hand corner one of those grim diagrams which , in a less poisonous form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , spreads its deadly snare , and the reeling victim tumbles helplessly into a mass of idiotic and absolutely meaningless terms . There arc the " infinite , " the " unlimited , " the " absolute , " and the " unconditioned , " with something about " sequence , " " co-existence , " " popular , religious , and philosophical , " mingled with brackets and algebraic signs in a way which makes the brain whirl . By the time the Concord thinkers have reached that diagram , JULIA . WARD HOWE , perched upon the lofty back of old Mr. ALCOTT 'S chair , will be shrieking out that she is the original and only ultimate reality ; Prof. HARRIS will be nervously climbing an apple tree , under the impression that he is the missing link , and Mr. FRANK SANBORN , who is some seven feet tall , will be crouched in a curtained corner charging 10 cents admission to look at the smallest dwarf ever exhibited . Last sad scene of all , the Concord Selectmen will come with a four-horse wagon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , they would live but a few weeks , for this problem entails the absolute destruction of the brain . The author of the " Student 's Dream " is evidently about to slay in an inhuman manner a number of estimable gentlemen and ladies who never did him any harm . Will the Massachusetts authorities allow this ?
