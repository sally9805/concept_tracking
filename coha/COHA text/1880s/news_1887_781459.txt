txt A cable dispatch from London informs us that JOSIAH CALDWELL , " railway promoter , " has failed , and that his liabilities are supposed to be enormous , inasmuch as he failed once before for ? 1,000,000 . The name falls familiarly upon the public ear . Among the railways promoted by JOSIAH CALDWELL was the Little Rock and . Fort Smith . It was of the bonds of that road that he did or did not send to Mr. JAMES G. BLAINE $25,000 , either from love and affection , or , from some other consideration , or from no consideration . He afterward did or did not send to the Judiciary Committee of the House a dispatch from London fully exonerating Mr. BLAINE from any suspicion of impropriety in connection with the railroad in question . That a dispatch purporting to come from him was received by the Chairman of the committee is a historical fact , but the question whether he sent it is still enveloped , we believe , iu mystery and gloom . Now that he is relieved from the cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this mystery . For two or three days in the mouth of June , 1876 , Mr. CALDWELL was at once the most interesting and the most inaccessible of the persons from whom light was sought on the financial experiences and the political prospects of Mr. BLAINE . It was not to be expected that a personage so important should fail for less than a million sterling , and it is to be hoped that his schedule of liabilities will not contain any of the savings of the statesman with whose name his own is inseparably connected .
