txt Perhaps there is no quality more essential to success in public life in this country than that intuitive accuracy of judgment regardng men and things known as common sense . The more of knowledge , of mental capacity , and of uprightness of character there is united with it the better , but no amount at these will make up for a lack of the universal solvent of American ideas , " plain , horse sense . " In countries whose government does not depend so completely on popular support this may be less important , There may be a powerful aristocratic class , a great laded interest or a strong ecclesiastical organization , to divide with the mass of the people the control of the Government . ? One or all of these may , indeed , . exert a far greater influence than comes from the mass of the people . A statesman may understand these , and learn to win their favor and secure their support without being distinguished for the quality of which we speak . But in this , country the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with and to depend upon . Whatever may be the devices employed to intercept their power and to attain ends regardless of their approval , in the long run the statesman or politician finds that he can not get along successfully unless the people are with him . Public opinion is a power he can not thwart or overcome , and to know its demands , to appreciate the standards it sets up , and to be able to meet its requirements , a man must be in sympathy with the people 's way of thinking , of feeling , and of judging , and.with the people the dominant faculty , more or less trained and enlightened , is common sense . A man may be born in humble station end make his way to a conspicuous place by the force of intellect and perseverance . He may acquire the mastery of political facts and conventional ideas , and make effective use of them . If he has a good memory and is ready of speech , he may captivate those among whom he personally appears and acquire a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record before a wider public by his skill in the display of acquired ideas and his ability as a debater of questions of policy . And yet that man may be deficient in his judgment of men and of living Communities , and lack the essential qualities of a leader in a free country . One may know all history and political economy and not be able to manage his own household with ordinary tact . One may make very telling speeches and stand high in a parliamentary assembly and be incapable of dealing ; practically with men without running Into constant difficuity . However great his intellectual powers , and however wide his-acquirements , if he have not practical judgment he is liable to fail whenever an emergency comes upon him . He will easily become the victim of designing men , whose purposes he is unable to fathom and the outcome of whose plans he can not foresee . He is likely to be swayed from his course by temporary or superficial considerations and to back down from his position under pressure , because he does not understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abiding strength of sound conviction . In a position of great responsibility or difficulty he is liable to allow himself to be governed by others , because he lacks that intuition which would impel him to the safest course . In this country the politicians are many and the statesmen few . Of those who have some claim to be regarded as statesmen only a very small number have closed their public career without suffering a fall in the popular estimation , Those who have been really and continuously successful were eminent for the equality of common sense that 17 ; enabled them to judge of the temper of the people and feel the drift of public sentiment at all times . They were the men who knew better than to do even a desirable thing at an unseasonable time or in an inopportune manner . They knew when the people were with them and what would meet with the approval of the public , and foresaw the inevitable consequence of a certain course of action . They could deal with parties as well as with the unorganized multitude , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and the convictions and purposes of the people at large . The organism springs from the unorganized mass and must partake of its qualities . The statesman of common sense is not addicted to seeking to produce harmony by methods that are sure to result in discord . He never enters upon a course without a very definite idea of how and where he is to come out . He is not apt to be astonished at the effects of his own conduct , for he knows how effects are produced , and understands the connection between them and their causes . In short . he never blunders or gets into a trouble that he did not anticipate and is unalA to overcome tri umphantly . We have an abiding faith in the good sense of the American people . They are not mostly politicians in the sense that most of them desire to hold office or to get personal advantage from the public service . They desire to have the public service honestly and efficiently administered for the common good of all , and their judgment of public men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who can win a lasting ascendency over them and command their enduring support must be endowed with the dominant quality of sound common sense .
