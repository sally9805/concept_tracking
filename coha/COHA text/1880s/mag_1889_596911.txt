One question more than others all Of thoughtful minds implores reply : It is , as breathed from star and pall , " What fate awaits us when we die ? " these words are true , certainly next in importunate demand is whether men shall direct their conduct by practical wisdom and right motives , or look for and follow occult intimations which may either confirm or contradict the judgment . Exclusive of the sphere of true religion ,  - -  which does not claim to be an infallible guide except to repentance , purity of motive , and the life beyond ,  --  omens , premonitions , presentiments , visions , and apparitions have exerted the greatest influence over the decisions and actions of mankind . Omens are extraordinary events which , on account of the opinions held of them , are thought to presage disaster . They are not true presentiments , but generalizations from imperfect data . Astrology and divination exhibit on a large scale the fallacies underlying such conclusions , belief in them being sustained by the observation of occasional coincidences between events and preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . Dreams often afford similar materials for erroneous reasonings , but as they originate in the mind , they are sometimes so similar to presentiments that it is impossible to decide whether a presentiment caused the dream , or the dream the presentiment . A presentiment in the strictly etymological sense is a previous conception , sentiment , opinion , or apprehension ; but its secondary meaning , which has almost supplanted the primary , both in the French and English use of the word , is an antecedent impression or conviction of something about to happen . Though presentiments of'good are common and often fulfilled , as their results are not tragical they are seldom remembered or attributed to supernatural causes ; and for this reason the word presentiment is confined almost exclusively to inward premonitions of evil , and is practically the equivalent of " foreboding " in such passages as Dryden 's , " My heart forebodes I ne'er shall see you more . " Few would consider general forebodings of evil worthy of special investigation . To some temperaments they are peculiar , and prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may arise from overwork , old age , or from prolonged sickness of any kind except consumption ; and as evil overtakes the majority of mankind , such general forebodings are certain of general fulfillment . It is only when time and events concur with the presentiment that it becomes a phenomenon requiring scientific treatment ; and being a product of the mind allied to many other experiences , it is a philosophical problem of the first magnitude . A writer in the " Cornhill Magazine " for October , i886 , attempts to lay down the essence of a true presentiment . He says that " it must be spontaneous ; it must come at a time when you have no reason to look for it . " He explains these conditions by saying that you must not be ill and think you have a presentiment that you will not recover ; you must not be away from home and think that some calamity has happened there ; you must not know that a friend is in danger and have a presentiment of his death ; you must not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will cheat you . In laying down these conditions he justifies himself by saying that they are necessary , " because in all these instances there is a simple natural cause for fear or uneasiness . " I can not admit that all these conditions are exact . The person may indeed be sick , yet the illness may be slight , and its seat removed from any fatal possibility ; and if in opposition to every indication he have a foreboding that he will not recover , which persists in defiance of reason , and does or does not end in death , it has the mental and emotional characteristics of a presentiment . Of course if a person hax e yellow fever , and a presentiment of his death , it is in harmony with popular belief ; though , according to the statistics of the epidemic in Jacksonville , the proportion of deaths is but about one to ten cases , and the rational expectation would be that an ordinary person attacked had nine chances in ten for recovery . Again , if a person leave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to them or to his property , and have a presentiment impelling him to go back , and on arriving find his worst fears realized , although his peculiar state of mind arose during an absence from home , it has the characteristics of a presentiment , both in its origin and in the relation of time and events . // Conclusions drawn from reasoning and generalizations from data may produce convictions so strong that men would die for them . Under their influence they may risk their lives and fortunes in the pursuit of objects which can not be attained , if at all , until after many years . These are not presentiments , for the sum of the reasonings and experiences of the man becomes the unconscious test which he applies to everything submitted to his judgment . But if there be genuine presentiments which foretell future events they must have an external source , human or extra-human . That God could produce such impressions none who admit his existence can doubt . Whether other beings , in or out of human bodies , could do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to the subject of presentiments in the sense now under consideration . The clairvoyant theory of perception is the power to read the past , discern the present , and forecast the future ; that of telepathy a transfer of ideas and feelings spontaneously or intentionally from a living person called the agent to another called the percipient . These theories will hereafter receive attention upon their own merits . Most persons holding that God could at any time create a presentiment will incline to the comfortable belief that he sometimes does so , and that this is one of the means whereby he cares for those who put their trust in him . But the fact that God can produce presentiments is not in itself an evidence , nor does it even rise to the dignity of a presumption that he will produce them . He could preserve all his servants from destruction by sea or by land , be could impart to all his people a knowledge of future events ; but he does not . The righteous often die in the pestilence and in calamities at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . While it would be presumptuous to affirm that no such presentiment as we are considering is ever imparted by the Spirit of God to human beings , two propositions may be supported without irreverence : first , that the human mind without special influence from God or other beings may originate presentiments ; second , that the probability is that this is their true explanation . UNSUSPECTED MENTAL RESOURCES . SELF-ESTEEM is common and self-conceit general , yet few persons have an adequate idea of the resources of their own minds . Most fancy that what they recollect is the measure of what they know ; whereas , in addition to every fact or idea that any person remembers , there are countless others which have entered his mind , and are liable at any moment to cross the plane of his consciousness . He who , when a thought arises , will ask , " How came I to think of this ? " in the effort to trace the successive steps by which the mind traveled from the last conscious thought or experience to that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lightninglike movements of the mind have as often been directed by associations of which we are unconscious as by those whose significance and relations are perceived . Experiments to determine the rapidity of thought , by uttering a sentence or command and noting the time before the rational , perception of it is manifest , are deceptive , because they involve the rate of motion of the senses , which is slow compared with the movement of ideas in the mind . Revery frequently affects the emotions powerfully , and produces an influence which is felt for days and even months , and that when the mind , calmly reflecting , rejects the idea that there is any cause for the depression . A common experience of foreign travelers is that the mind runs over the whole field of personal interest illuminating it as with flashes , bringing before him who pursues his way " remote , unfriended , melancholy , slow , " vivid thoughts of home and friends . Such pensive states are often accompanied by intense concern , which crystallizes into conviction , that death or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many telegraphic dispatches inspired by such feelings cross the sea every summer to receive responses indicating that there is no occasion for anxiety . Many business men will also acknowledge that at different times in the course of their careers , for reasons which they have not been able to fathom , an impression of impending calamity has possessed them , which was so strong as to make them ready to dispute the truth of the trial-balance which shoxved them to be solvent and prosperous . The observation of the reader will doubtless furnish instances of persons whose forebodings of calamity - sometimes confirmed by the event , but oftener otherwise - are recognized by their business partners and friends , and call for the exercise of patience and the use of every means to dissipate the mysterious , unwelcome , and paralyzing impression . A manufacturer whose name is known in every city in the Union , and in most foreign countries , whose riches are estimated at many millions , whose employees are numbered by thousands , whose charities are munificent , whose piety is undoubted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of times within the last twenty-five years , no one of which has been fulfilled ; but all were as // intense and overpowering while they lasted as any could be . Two other mental phenomena must be observed . No discipline , however protracted and rigid , can exclude thoughts which start mysteriously concerning life , business , home , friends , investments , etc . The mathematician may be engaged in solving the most intricate problems , the theologian in preparing discourses , the essayist in the flow of composition , the accountant in adding a column of figures , but none of these can be certain of fifteen consecutive minutes undisturbed by ideas or impressions almost as vivid as a living personality . The difference between the disciplined and the undisciplined mind consists chiefly in the ability to expel the intruder , and not in exemption from such visits . The other phenomenon is , that the mind , in a voluntary or an involuntary review of the situation , will frequently pause upon one phase of it , which will predominate over others without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly anxious about one of three children and be for weeks under the shadow of a causeless fear . As every mental state must have a cause , in the labyrinth of associated ideas and feelings , some occasion must exist ; but introspection may never reveal it . To demonstrate that the mind can not originate presentiments is , therefore , impossible ; and we are brought to the question whether , in the number or character of such presentiments , there be convincing evidence that they have a supernatural origin . Many experiences called presentiments are not of that nature . Dr. Forbes Winslow 's " Psychological Journal " gives a tragic account of a presentiment to the great master of kings , Talleyrand . Dr. Sigmond received it from the widow of the private secretary and friend of Talleyrand , M. Comache . It shows signs of having been written afterwards and embellished . Talleyrand said , " Upon one occasion I was gifted for a single moment with an unknown and mysterious power . " He had fled from France with an intimate friend named Beaumetz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering that they could not return to France , decided to improve the little money that was left by speculation , and freighted a small vessel for India . Bills were all paid and farewells taken ; but there was a delay of some days for a fair wind , during which the time of departure was uncertain . Beaumetz was irritated to an extraordinary degree , and unable to remain quietly at home . He hurried back and forth from the city with an eager , restless activity . He had been ever remarkable for great calmness and placidity of temper . One day he entered , evidently laboring under great excitement , though trying to seem calm . Talleyrand was writing letters to Europe . Beaumetz , with forced gaiety , said : " What need to waste time penning those letters ? They will not reach their destination . Let us take a turn on the Battery . The wind may be chopping round ; we may be nearer our departure than we imagine . " The language in which the d6nouement is described is graphic : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seized my arm and hurried me along , seemingly in eager haste to advance . We had arrived at the broad esplanade , the glory then , as now , of New York . Beaumetz quickened his steps still more until we arrived close to the water 's edge . He talked loud and quickly , admiring in energetic terms the beauty of the scenery , the Brooklyn Heights , the shady groves of the island , the ships riding at anchor , and the busy scene on the peopled wharf , when suddenly he paused in his mad , incoherent discourse , for I had freed my arm from his grasp , and stood immovable before him . Staying his wild and rapid steps , I fixed my eye upon his face . He turned aside cowed and dismayed . " Beaumetz , " I shouted , " you mean to murder me . You intend to throw me from the height into the sea below . Deny it , monster , if you can . " The maniac stared at me for a moment , but I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he quailed beneath it . He stammered a few incoherent words , and strove to pass me , but I barred his passage with extended arms . He looked vacantly right and left , and then flung himself upon my neck and burst into tears . T is true , c is true , my friend . The thought has haunted me day and night like a flash from the lurid fire of hell . It was for this I brought you here . Look ! You stand within a foot of the edge of the parapet . In another instant the work would have been done . " The demon had left him . His eye was unsettled , and the white foam stood in bubbles on his white lips , but he was no longer tossed by the same mad excitement under which he had been laboring , for he suffered me to lead him home without a single word . A few days ' repose , bleeding , abstinence , completely restored him to his former self , and , what is more extraordinary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . What there is in this narrative to imply anything extraordinary , in view of the extraordinary circumstances , I am unable to perceive . Beaumetz had been unusually calm ; he became greatly excited . Every action he performed and every word he said , for several days , was sufficient to excite alarm as to his mental condition . He was on the verge of an attack of acute mania . That Talleyrand had recognized his condition to some extent is apparent ; that his mind perceived the danger , and that he took the only natural course to escape , is also clear ; and the history of lunatic asylums abounds in accounts by friends or attendants of their discerning at the right moment that the maniac meant to perpetrate a tragic deed . // In some instances it has been foreseen , and the wife , after predicting her own death at his hands , has succumbed to the maniacal fury of the once loving husband rather than allow him to be placed under restraint . A case of this sort , originating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has startled the world within a few years . IMPRESSIONS AND " IMPERATIVE cONcEPTIONS . " IMPRESSIONS are closely allied to presentiments , and many both devout and undevout persons yield to their influence . Baseball pitchers , prize-fighters , soldiers , and politicians are subject to them . The celebrated Dr. Nathan Bangs , a minister of great influence and strength of character , early in life was accustomed to believe in and follow impressions . The manner in which he was delivered from the fear of them is described in Stevens 's " Life of Bangs , " page Ioi : On a certain occasion , when the weather was very cold and the snow deep , the mind of Dr. Bangs became more than Lisually impressed with the value of souls . As he rode along he came opposite a dwelling which stood quite a distance back in the field , and instantly he became impressed with the thought that he ought to go and talk and pray with that family . He was in a feeble condition , no path had been made to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wade that distance and expose himself to the cold . So he resisted the impression and passed on ; but no sooner had he passed the house than it became doubly strong , and " he finally turned back , tied his horse to the fence , waded through the snow to the house , and not a sortlwas there ! " His friend and successor in Canada , Dr. Fitch Reed , who communicated these facts to Dr. Stevens , says , " From that time he resolved never to confide in mere impressions . " A ludicrous instance of an impression connected with a supposed answer to prayer was notorious in the city of New York forty years ago . A gentleman of excellent character prayed that he might receive an impression from God when he should come into the presence of the person who would make him a suitable wife . He received assurance that his prayer would be answered , and tried to maintain a devout and expectant frame of mind . 1 Dr. Henry M. Hurd , the justly distinguished superintendent of the Eastern Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative conceptions says : " By this term is understood a mental concept or impression arising in the mind without external cause , or an emotional basis , or logical connection with any previous train of thought , which dominates the will and often compels to actions which are known to be ludicrous or improper , or contrary The months passed without a sign , but one day , while walking up Broadway , he saw a lady walking ahead of him whose motions were exceedingly graceful , and instantly came the impression , " This is the woman whom God hath chosen for thee . " For a long time he followed her in silence . At last the object of his anxiety turned into a side street . He turned also , and at that moment she dropped her handkerchief . He hastened forward to take it from the ground , and as she lifted her veil to thank him he perceived that she was of African descent ! In an instant his faith in impressions was forever destroyed , and it was his custom in speaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be substituted for common sense . The number of impressions of which nothing comes is so much greater than those which appear to be fulfilled as to satisfy rational minds that they are not to be relied upon ; and this requires on moral grounds the further conclusion that they are not of supernatural origin . " Imperative conceptions , " known among the insane , often have parallels among the sane . It is common for lunatics who have committed some atrocious act to assign , and often with absolute truth , that " it had to be done , " or that they " had to do it . " Certain crimes committed by sane persons under a powerful influence have also been excused upon that ground , when a just view would show that though strongly impelled they were not incapable of resisting the impression , and were therefore responsible . I venture to affirm that there are few persons who have not at some time in their lives felt almost irresistibly drawn to do some act , make some decision , or utter some word which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it had to be done " predominated , and in many instances they have yielded . Where the consequences are not serious the effects may still be evil , for when the " ego " yields contrary to the judgment its power of resistance is lessened . These imperative impressions , which in the purely insane absolve from guilt , are often seen in their germs in the conduct of children who are dominated by their imaginations and sensibilities . These are all akin to the state of mind in which presentiments arise.1 to the judgment of the individual . The imperative conception differs from the delusion in the fact that it is not elaborated by any process of reasoning , and does not commend itself to the reason or to the judgment . . . . it is not necessarily an evidence of insanity , unless it persists and dominates the conduct habitually . All persons have imperative conceptions arising spontaneously in the mind , which momentarily influence action and compel attention . " He gives as // CONSEQUENCES . nary .

Yet in some instances , and very often in the beginning of insanity , they admit that they are morbid and contend against them . A question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects treated in these articles , is whether subjective visions are possible to the sane ; and , if so , whether they are at all common , and liable to occur as isolated circumstances . On a full survey of the subject , both these questions will be ansxvered in the affirmative . To say nothing of the visions produced by alcohol , opium , hasheesh , fever , blows upon the head , prolonged abstinence , deep anxiety , or those which precede attacks of epilepsy or of apoplexy , it is certain that hallucinations often arise without assignable cause or subsequent effect ; and the subjects of them demonstrate their sanity by recognizing the unreal character of their perceptions . Griesinger , one of the most eminent and discriminating writers on mental diseases , says : " Nothing would be more erroneous than to consider a man to be mentally diseased because he had hallucinations . The most extended experience shows rather that such phenomena occur in the lives of very distinguished and highly intellectual men , of the most different dispositions and various casts of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In illustration he speaks of Tasso , who , in the presence of Manco , carried on a long conversation with his protecting spirit ; and of Goethe 's well-known blue-gray vision , and his ideal flowers with their curiousbuds . He speaks briefly also of the hallucinations of Sir Walter Scott , Jean Paul , Benvenuto Cellini , Spinoza , Pascal ; of Van Helmont , who saw his own soul in the form of a light with a human countenance ; of Andral , the great physician , who experienced an hallucination of sight ; and of Leuret , who , in his " Fragments of Psychology , " gives an account of a phantasm of heanng which he experienced . A. Brierre de Boismont divided hallucinations that are compatible with sanity into two kinds - those which are corrected by the understanding , and those which , on account of superstition , sluggishness of thought , love of the marvelous , inability to interpret them correctly , or because the emotions which they excite make calm consideration impossible , are not corrected . The cases which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talma , who , when he trod the stage , cot the force of his will make all the brilliant dresses of his numerous audience disappear and substitute skeletons for the living characters . When he had thus filled the theater with these singular spectators , his emotions were such as to give to his playing a force which produced the most striking effects . The case of an intelligent lady who would see a robber enter her chamber and conceal himself under her bed is in point . Though the spectacle produced violent palpitation of the heart and universal trembling , she was aware of its falsity , and after some moments her judgment and reason would triumph so that she could approach the bed and examine it without fear . Another case was communicated by a physician of acknowledged reputation to Sir Walter Scott . The first hallucination was that of the presence of a great cat . After a few months the cat disappeared , and a phantom of a higher grade took its place-that of a gentleman usher dressed as though he was in the service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church . But after some months he disappeared , and a phantom horrible and distressing , a skeleton , appeared . The fact of these visions was concealed by the subject of them , who was an important officer in a department of justice , for several years . Though he knew that they were of subjective origin , they wore him out , and he died a victim to the agony in which his years were passed . Dr. Abercrombie gives a case of a man who had been all his life beset by hallucinations : when he met a friend in the street , he was uncertain whether he was a real person or a phantom , but by paying close attention he could distinguish between them . Dr. Abercrombie declares that he was at the time of writing in good health , of a clear intellect , and occupied in business . Many striking instances , the most valuable of which are those personally attested by Boismont , or by the authorities whom he quotes , are given where the mind was sane , though the hallucinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed that these hallucinations of the sane are confined to persons of distinction , of sedentary habits , or of poetic temperaments . Many have had once or twice in their lives spectral illusions , or instances of hallucination ; and among plain men , mechanics , laborers , and the peasantry of all nations , they are very common . Griesinger , after giving a list of distinguished men who , though sane , had hallucinations , says : " Judging from what we have heard and observed on this subject , hallucinations doubtless occur also in men of very average minds , not as rare but as freqiiently overlooked phenomena . " Spectral illusions are very common in children , and are most frequently , though not always , perceived in the night between waking and sleeping . The persistence of dreams after one is fully awake is also a suggestive occasional experi // ence . After the appearance of the article on " Dreams , Nightmare , and Somnambulism , " the editor of iHE CENTURY received a letter written by a gentleman of the city of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before , in which he dreamed that he was lying on his back in his own room and saw a frightful black hobgoblin , well defined in shape , which stood by the side of his bed and acted as if about to attack him . In the midst of the horror produced by the specter he awoke , found himself lying on his back just as he had dreamed , looked around the room and recognized the furniture and other things in the room , but continued to see the hobgobun as plainly as he saw anything else , heard him growl , and distinctly saw him going on with his hostile demonstrations . Reasoning upon what he should do , he struggled to move , was unable to stir hand or foot for some time , but finally did move , and that instant the uncanny specter vanished . He says : " I had my eyes on the hobgoblin at the moment when I made the movement , and at once tried to see whether there was any object in the room which I could have mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of marvels contain narratives which sometimes afford the evidence of their explanation , but frequently omit details which a person not disposed to the marvelous would be sure to examine if he had the opportunity . In Stilling 's " Pneumatology , " translated from the German and edited by Dr. George Bush , there are many of these . Stilling endeavors to show that people who see themselves are generally likely to die soon afterwards . He says : " When a person sees himself out of himself , while others who are present observe nothing , the apparition may be real , or it may be merely imaginary ; but when it is also perceived by others it is no fantasy , but something real . " He then gravely adds , " I myself know of persons having seen themselves and dying shortly afterwards . " He tells of one of the Government secretaries who went , as he was wont to do , to the archives to look for a paper which was very important . On arriving there he saw himself sitting on a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman servant to fetch the documents . It is asserted that the woman found him there also . Dr. Stilling does not say that the man died " shortly afterwards " ; but that he did die some time after is probable , as the book is nearly a hundred years old . Another case is that of a professor who was having a theological dispute with a number of his friends . Having occasion to go to the library for a book , he saw himself sitting on a chair at the table where he usually sat . Going nearer , he looked over the shoulder of the person and saw that this figure of himself pointed with one finger of the right hand to a passage in the Bible . He looked at the passage indicated and saw that it was , " Set thine house in order , for thou shalt die . " Full of astonishment and fear , he went back to the company and related the occurrence ; and in spite of all they could say be was firm in the opinion that this apparition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " The day after , at six o'clock in the evening , he expired , being advanced in years . " Many persons can be found who are not advanced in years who would be killed by such an experience as this . The origin of such visions is readily traced . To imagine one 's self in a familiar place with almost the vividness of life is not uncommon . Whether the vision shall be that of one 's self or of another , when the mind is in such a state as to develop visions , depends much on the general belief at the time . The same principle is illustrated where it seems impossible not to see , in his accustomed seat at the table , a person who has died ; and when worn with anxiety and long watching , even strong-minded men have been for a moment almost certain that they saw the familiar figure pass through the room . They have felt " the touch of a vanished hand " and heard " the sound of a voice that is still . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision is complete . Sudden flashes of the imagination may develop the phenomenon instantaneously . Thus a sea captain engaged in his duty saw in the mist the figure of a boyhood companion beckoning to him . He was certain that it portended his death or that of the friend whose figure he saw , but nothing came of it . A gentleman passing along the street suddenly saw his brother whom he had not seen for twentyfive years . The figure was plain , and he was about to speak to him when he disappeared . Sometime afterwards the news came of his death at about the time of the vision . Taken alone it might seem as if there was some connection between the two circumstances ; but so many have such occasional experiences which seem remarkably real , and yet are not followed by any noteworthy event , that the natural explanation is adequate to cover the cases . The visions and hallucinations of hypnotism and animal magnetism require special examination . HABITUAL VISIONS . HALLUCINATIONS may become frequent , and to a certain extent systematic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which case a person may be for a long period // of sound and discriminating understanding , except when in a trance , or beholding a vision . The visions of St. Theresa have , for three hundred years , formed an important chapter in religious literature , and another in pathology . At twelve she was devoutly pious , becoming so after the death of her mother . About the age of fifteen she fell off into a very worldly state , and against her will was placed by her father in a convent . She was frequently ill , and finally , after a year and a half , owing to dangerous sickness , returned home . Sometime afterwards she was seized with a violent fever , and upon recovery determined to devote herself to a religious life , and in opposition to her father 's wishes entered a Carmelite convent and took the veil . This was in her twentieth year . Her biographer , as translated by Dr. Madden , says that she was attacked " with frequent fits of fainting and swooning , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her senses . " Her first trance was in 1537 , in her twenty-third year ; it lasted for four days , and during it through excess of pain she bit her tongue in many places - a phenomenon common to fits of various kinds . At last she was reduced almost to a skeleton , had a paralytic affection of her limbs , and remained a cripple for three years . Her first vision was three years later , when she had alloxved herself some dissipation of mind . " The apparition of our Lord was suddenly presented to the eyes of her soul , with a rigorous aspect testifying to the displeasure occasioned by her conduct . " There were great differences of opinion as to the source of her visions . Several very learned priests and confessors judged her to be deluded by the devil . One of them instructed her to make the sign of the cross , and to insult the vision as that of a fiend . In one of her visions , according to her statement , the Lord appeared angry at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She acknowledged that she frequently saw devils in hideous figures , but she drove them away by the cross or by holy water . She also claimed to see St. loseph , the blessed Virgin , and other saints ; had visions of purgatory , and saw a great number of souls in heaven who had been there . There is no difficulty in explaining her visions on natural principles . She was a religious woman , in such a state of health as to be subject to trances , and they took their character from her conventual and other religious instruction . Visions of this kind have been common in the excitable of all sects . The early Methodists had many of them , which Mr. Wesley could not understand ; and he expelled some persons from the society because they persisted against his commands in narrating visions which even he could not accept as of divine origin . Luther suffered from hallucinations of a religious character for a considerable period of his life . The opposition he encountered , his sedentary life , taken iii connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explain his visions . Luther thought that the devil removed a bag of nuts , transformed himself into a fly , hung on his neck , and lay with him in bed . His visions would sometimes come on after nightmare . Here is his own account : " I awoke in the middle of the night . Satan appeared to me . I was seized with horror . I sweated and trembled . My heart beat in a frightful manner . The devil conversed with me . His logic was accompanied by a voice so alarming that the blood froze in my veins . " Zuinglius had a similar experience when he was half asleep . A phantom , black or white , he could not say which , appeared before him , called him a coward , and stirred him up to fight . This is explained by Forbes Winslow as a case of overheated sensorium , " during the transient continuance of which the retina became so disturbed as to conjure up a phantom which the patient not only mistook for a reality , but , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . " Swedenborg 's visions were of the same class . He was educated , devoted himself for many years to science , and up to his fifty-fourth year had the reputation of a scientific and philosophic student ; was a professor in the mineralogical school , and believed to be a simple-minded man of the world . About 1743 he had a violent fever , in which for a little time he was mad , and rushed from the house stark naked , proclaiming himself the Messiah . After that period a change took place in him , and he lived twenty-nine years in the firm conviction that he held continual intercourse with angels and also with deceased human beings . He says that he conversed with St. Paul during the whole year , particularly in reference to the text Romans iii . 28 . He asserted that he had conversed three times with St. John , once with Moses , a hundred times with Luther , and with angels daily " for twenty years . " Swedenborg had an elevated style of thought , and when reasoning upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute and profound . Attention has frequently been called to his shrewdness in explaining why when he claimed to hear the voices of angels those who stood by could not , by his declaring that he was accustomed to see and hear angels when perfectly wide awake , and adding : " The speech of an angel or of a spirit sounds like and as loud as that of a man , but it is not heard by the bystanders . The reason is that the speech of an angel , // or of a spirit , finds entrance first into a man s thoughts , and reaches his organs of hearing from within . " It is necessary only to read his literal statements to perceive the subjective character of the visions . He gives detailed accounts of the habits , form , and dress of the angels . He sends his opponents mostly to Gehenna and sees them there . The chief representatives of the reformed churches go to heaven , but Catholics and some of his Protestant opponents he sees in vision elsewhere . The visions and hallucinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ecclesiastical conflicts of the Middle Ages , and more lately , as proofs of the doctrines held by them . But as proofs they are mutually destructive , exist in all religions , true or false , and are liable to occur apart from religion . In the revivals which occurred in the early part of this century in the United States , and which sometimes take place now , visions are not infrequently connected with religious experience . When men pray without attending to the necessary cares of the body days and weeks together , the result is faintings and trances accompanied by visions . Where they are believed to be of divine origin they produce profound impressions , but there is no reason to think their cause different from those already discussed , nor have unbelievers in Christianity escaped them . The autobiography of Lord Herbert of Cherbury relates one of the most remarkable visions , and an equally remarkable illustration of inconsistency . Lord Herbert did not believe in Christianity , and wrote a book against the miracles recorded in the Bible . When it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met in France . They praised it much and exhorted him to publish it ; but he foresaw that it would encounter great opposition , and hesitated for some time , not knowing whether to print it or not . The history of xvhat followed is given in his own words : One fine day , about noon , my windows being open , I took my book , knelt down , and pronounced aloud these words : " 0 eternal God , creator of the light which illuminates me , thou who enlightenest souls when thou wouldst , tell me by a celestial sign if I should publish or suppress my work . " I had hardly uttered these words than a loud but agreeable sound proceeded from heaven , which impressed me with such great joy that I felt convinced that my request was granted . Howsoever strange this may appear , I protest , before God , not only that I heard the sound , but saw , in the clearest sky on which I ever gazed , the spot whence it came . In consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout all Christian lands , amongst all the learned capable of reading and appreciating it . This circumstance is of great importance . No doubt has ever been thrown upon the truth of the recital , which shows how a person not subject to hallucinations may , under circumstances of deep meditation , or under the influence of strong desire and expectation ,  - -  if I may so speak ,  --  generate an hallucination , which may be the only one that he will experience in the course of a lifetime , and leave no evil effects except the false inferences which he will draw from it when he supposes it to be of supernatural origin . It shows that the absence or the presence of any form of faith may not be an essential , and it is clear that Lord Herbert might easily have passed into a state of habitual visions in all respects analogous to those of Swedenborg and St. Theresa . VISIONS OF THE DYING . THE visions which the dying are supposed to see are regarded by many with reverence bordering upon awe . The explanation given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , in his " Visions : a Study of False Sight , " is strictly physiological . After a long and very suggestive philosophical exposition , he says : Should a bright ray of light falling from some object in the chamber on the retina of a dying person excite the visual apparatus and cells , the hieroglyphic of a departed child , husband , lover , or friend be brought into the field of subjective sight , the beloved one would be reproduced , and at once projected into space . Intense emotion , engendered by such a sight , would for an instant break through the stupefying power of nature 's anesthetic , as the surgeon 's knife sometimes momentarily breaks the spell of ether , and the dying individual springing , with eyes intent , features transfigured , and arms outstretched , towards the vision , would naturally pronounce the long-remembered name , and then fall back and die . Such scenes have occurred . Few could witness them without an overwhelming sense of awe , oppressed " with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veil and the glory within . To th' dying such a vision would not be false . It would not be imagination . It would be real to him . The well-known features would be there , and yet they would be a creation or reproduction of a dissolving brain , and not a messenger from the opened heavens . The vision would be a physiological effect , not a supernatural intervention . Dr. Clarke is not willing to say that it is impossible that there shall be to the dying a revelation of the future into which they are about to enter . He says : " Probably all such visions as these are automatic . But yet , who , believing in God and personal immortality , as the writer rejoices in doing , will dare to say absolutely a/i ? - will dare to assert there is no possible exception ? " During the past thirty years I have seen many persons die , and many who supposed // themselves to be dying who afterwards recovered , but I have no ground to suppose any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a faculty of cognizing another world . The single case given by Dr. Clarke appears insufficient to raise a presumption , much less to support a conclusion.1 The following facts can not be disputed nor disregarded in the elucidation of the subject : First . Such dying visions occur in all parts of the world , under every form of civilization and religion , and if the dying appear to see anything , it is in harmony with the traditions which they have received . Second . Such visions are often experienced by those whose lives have not been marked by religious consistency , while many of the most devout are permitted to die without such aid , and sometimes experience the severest mental conflicts as they approach the crisis . Third . Where persons appear to see angels and disembodied spirits , the visions accord with the traditional views of their shape and expression ; and where wicked persons see fiends and evil spirits , they harmonize with the descriptions which have been made the materials of sermons , poems , and supernatural narratives . Four//i . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who supposed themselves to be dying , but were not ; and who when they recovered had not the slightest recollection of what had occurred . When a student I was called in with the others to witness the deathbedscene of the most popular young man in the institution . He had professed on the bed of death a religious experience , and was supposed to be dying of typhoid fever . Never have I heard more vivid descriptions or more eloquent words . It seemed as though he must see another state of being . After the scene he sunk into a lethargic state , so remained for some days , and gradually recovered . Both his religious conversion and visions were entirely forgotten , and not until many years afterwards did he enter upon a religious life . F/dz . A consideration of great weight is this : the Catholic Church confers great honor upon the Holy Virgin ; Protestants seldom make any reference to her . Trained as the Roman 1 Some years ago I was visiting at the house ofa citizen of Brooklyn , now one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of his wife , was very ill . His disease was consumption complicated with extreme age . It was thought that he could not survive the day . For several days he had been in a state of stupor hordering upon coma , nor had he spoken for some hours . During the absence of his daughter from the room I sat hy his bedside watching his painful hreathing and anticipating the end , which could not he long delayed . Suddenly the dying man opened his eyes and said , " Old Virginia , old Virginia , old Virginia . " I immediately summoned his daughter , hut he never Catholics are to supplicate the sympathy and prayers of the mother of our Lord , when they have visions of any kind I am informed by devout priests and by physicians that she generally appears in the foreground . Among the visions which dying Protestants have been supposed to see I have heard of only two in which the Virgin figured , and these were of persons trained in their youth as Catholics . APPARITIONS . THE passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dr. Johnson in " Rasselas " puts into the mouth of the sage Imlac : That the dead are seen no more I will not undertake to maintain against the concurrent testimony of all ages and all nations . There is no people , rude or unlearned , among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed . This opinion , which prevails as far as human nature is diffused , could become universal only by its truth ; those that never heard of one another would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience could make credible . That it is doubted by single cavilers can very little weaken the general evidence ; and some who deny it with their tongues confess it with fears . All authorities agree that Dr. Johnson was very superstitious , and this passage when critically examined does not seem to be entitled to the weight which his great name and its clearness of statement have given to it . The concurrent testimony of all ages and nations can hardly create a presumption , unless it be assumed that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion could become universal only by its truth compels the assumption that all universal opinions are true . To prove that the dead are seen no more , or can not appear to living beings , is of course impossible . But that a thing can not b* proven impossible is not a reason for believing it actual . No one can demonstrate that the spirit of Mahomet is not now embodied in the present Sultan of Turkey , but no one believes it to be so . The belief in apparitions , common in all ages , was generally dying out in the middle of the last century , but was revived in the uttered another syllahle or showed any sign of consciousness , and died in a few hours . On asking members of the family if he had ever been connected in any waywith Virginia , they said he had not , but was a native of Kentucky . Three months afterwards his son-in-law informed me that inquiry suggested by the circumstance revealed the fact that he was horn in Virginia and lived there until hewas ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so nearly exhausted as to he incapable of stimulating any of the brain cells , except those early impressed ; and a vision of the lovely scenes of his childhood rose in his mind , and his intelligence was sufficient only to recognize it as in a dream . // antagonisms created by the excesses of materialistic and infidel opinions , which denied the truth of the miracles recorded in the Christian Scriptures . John VvTesley says , " It is true that the English in general , and indeed most of the men in Europe , have given up all accounts of witches and apparitions as mere old wife 's fables . " He expresses great sorrow at this and says , " If but one account of the intercourse of men with superior spirits be admitted , their whole castle in the air ( deism , atheism , materialism ) falls to the ground . " The discussion of Mr. XVesley 's views of the relation of witchcraft to true Christianity is not in place here . His testimony as to the opinions of men of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion quoted concerning the value of proof of that kind in the then pending conflicts with the freethinkers justifies the use made of it by Dr. Hibbert in his " Philosophy of Apparitions , " published not more than forty years after Wesley 's death . Two subjects which have a bearing upon any theory of apparitions , telepathy and modern spiritualism , are also postponed . Telepathy does not bear directly upon apparitions in the sense of the direct manifestations of the dead only so far as it is connected with alleged perce.ptions of persons just dead or dying . At the close of the second part of " A Theory of Apparitions , " published by the Society of Psychical Research , the writer says , " Of apparitions after death we say nothing here , " and makes use of telepathy merely for the purpose of analogy . Modern spiritualism has so many phases , and its alleged and real phenomena are many of them so dissimilar in matter and manner to the spontaneous apparitions referred to by Lord Byron in I merely mean to say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years , All nations have believed that from the dead A visitant at intervals appears , as to make it necessary to consider it separately . What I design is to show that when the evidence is rigorously though fairly examined , the Scotch verdict of " Not proven " must be rendered concerning the reality of apparitions ; and that the presumptions of their natural origin are so strong as to leave little doubt in minds not intoxicated by a love of the marvelous , or who do not desire to find by sensuous evidence an " Elysian road which will conduct man undoubtingly to such beliefs as his heart most craves . " The belief in apparitions was universal before the development of the scientific spirit . Scarce an instance can be given from antiquity of a tale of supernatural events carefully investigated , because to be told of the appearance of a ghost excited no more surprise than to be informed of a storm at sea , orofanextraordinary flash of lightning . In Greece and Rome such narratives furnish the materials of poetry , and for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken the impression of primeval superstitions was so strong that the questions which science now asks-nay , more , the questions which practical men now ask - were not propounded . To believe in such cases what antiquity believed , because antiquity believed it , is but to tighten the swaddling-clothes of the infant about the grown man and force him back into the cradle . The testimony of a single witness to an apparition can be of little value , because whatever he thinks he sees may be a spectral illusion or an hallucination . The state of mind of a person who thinks that he sees an apparition is entirely unfavorable to calm observation ; and after he has seen it he has nothing but his recollection of what he saw , unsupported by analogies or memoranda taken during the vision . To say that immediately after he witnessed such a thing he made a note of it , is at best to say only that he wrote down what he could remember at that time . The identification of the dead must be a matter of very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ghost stories the deceased has not been seen for txventy or twenty-five years , or perhaps was never seen by the person to whom he is alleged to appear . In view of the mental excitement , not to say trepidation , induced by the belief that he sees a spontaneous and unexpected apparition , the one who fancies that he sees the dead must be the least competent to determine whether it be a subjective vision or an actual object . It has frequently been laid down as indisputable that if two persons see a vision at the same time its objective and authentic character is conclusively demonstrated . This by no means follows ; on the contrary , a hundred persons may be confident that they see an apparition , and the proof that they do not may be conclusive . In the Middle Ages thousands believed in Vampyrism . Less than two hundred years ago in Hungary , Moravia , Silesia , and Lorraine it was prevalent . " Some dreamed that these malicious specters took them by the throat , and , having strangled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually saw them . At times when the imagination is greatly excited , and a belief in ghosts exists , they can be manufactured by the thousand , and thousands can see them . The colored people in the South have no trouble on this point . It is a common occur- // rence for the ghosts of persons hanged to appear to the prisoners in the jail , and though the officers may look at midnight , or whenever the ghost is said to appear , and can see nothing , scores of the prisoners are certain that they see the dreadful vision , and great revivals occur among them . An instance of this kind has occurred within a few years , resulting in the permanent reformation of several persons . Sailors , naturally superstitious , have great powers as seers of ghosts . A vessel that sailed from Newcastle-upon-Tyne had on board a cook one of whose legs was shorter than the other , so that he walked in that way which in the vulgar idiom is called " with an up and a down . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few nights afterwards the captain was told by the mate that the cook was walking before the ship , and that all hands were on deck to see him . Angry at being awakened , the captain told the mate to let the cook alone and race with him to see whether the ship or he would get first to Newcastle . But being further importuned the captain finally turned out . I will now quote the words of Mr. Ellis ( who published " Brand 's Popular Antiquities " ) as they were received from the captain : He honestly confessed that he had like to have caught the contagion , and on seeing something move in a way so similar to that which an old friend used , and withal having a cap on so like that which he was wont to wear , verily thought there was more in the report than he was at first willing to believe . A general panic diffused itself . He ordered the ship to be steered towards the object , but not a man would move the helm . Compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach that the ridiculous cause of all their terror was part of a maintop , I*he remains of some wreck , floating before them . If he had really caught the contagion the evidence would have been complete ; the Society for Ps ) Tchical Research might make much of it , and it would be declared to be a convincing proof of a future state . Dr. Tuke gives an instance of a general misapprehension of vision . At the conflagration in the Crystal Palace , in the winter of 1866-67 , when the animals were destroyed by fire , it was supposed that the chimpanzee had succeeded in escaping from his cage . Men saw the unhappy animal holding on to the roof and writhing in agony while trying to get hold of one of the iron ribs . They watched its struggles with sickening dread  --  but there was no animal there . " It was a tattered piece of blind , so torn as to resemble , to the eye of fancy , the body , arms , and legs of an ape ! " When Brigham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ensign Point , making signs that that was the place where the great city and tabernacle of the Latter Day VOL . XXXVJIJ. - 6i . Saints would be established , the surrounding Mormons thought they beheld it , and nothing could shake their conviction of its reality . Mistaken identity accounts for many apparitions . Resemblances between persons in no way related are much more numerous and striking than is generally supposed . Many instances of this were given in an article in this series entitled , " Astrology , Divination , and Coincidences . " Lord Byron , who was superstitious , in speaking of ghosts said : And what is strangest upon this strange head Is that , whatever bar the reason rears Gainst such belief , there s something stronger still In its behalf , let those deny who will . Yet he occasionally laughed at ghosts . In i8ii , writing to Mr. Murray , he says , " My old school and form fellow Peel , the Irish Secretary , told me he saw me in St. James street ; I was then in Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother a person across the way and said , There is the man I took for Byron . ' His brother answered , Why , it is Byron , and no one else . ' I was at this time see ; t to write my name in the Palace book . I was then ill of a malaria fever . If I had died , here would have been a ghost story . " According to the telepathic theory , Byron 's self might have left his body in Turkey where he was sick and made an excursion to London . It would be interesting to have an account of the state of his body on that day ; whether much agitated , or enjoying a calm and refreshing sleep in the absence of the perturbed spirit of the poet , who must have been an uneasy tenant at the best of times . But these details were omitted , and the natural explanation would be " mistaken identity . " A whole city was excited by the appearance of a person known to be dead  --  a silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked wistfully about , speaking to no one , and not willing to explain his business . Terror seized upon the people . Every person who looked at him affirmed that he was the dead man . He was compelled after a few days to account for himself , and had no difficulty in proving , not only that he was a living man , but that he had never seen the man whom he so strongly resembled . A remarkable fact about this case was , that both the dead man and his double had three moles on the left cheek . J ugglery and intentional deception , subsequently confessed , have explained many cases of apparition which within a short period previous to the exposure had been generally believed real in the communities where they were reported . One of the most common sources of supposed supernatural interference with ordinary laws is unexplained noises , especially // those that appear to respond to questions . Many of these have been subsequently explained by chemical conditions ; others by the wind shrieking through bottles , down chimneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or motions by the movements of distant bodies ; one famous case by changes that had taken place , the result of mining operations beneath the ground upon which the house stood . The ringing of bells when it was obvious no one was pulling the wires - occasionally the result of electricity , at other times of cats - has terrified some ordinarily intelligent persons almost out of their senses . The disturbances produced by dogs , cats , and even rats , magnified by large rooms , immense fireplaces , and the transformation of innocent objects in nights when the moon is at the full , and the deep shadows produced by the movements of the limbs of trees reflected in mirrors , have all contributed to the production of awful impressions . In a certain rectory within forty miles of the city of New York stood an old-fashioned candlestick surrounded by prisms of glass which were pendent from the top . On several occasions the family were awakened by the ringing of these in the night , the effect of which was to terrify the servants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rector , who determined to solve the mystery . For a long time the sounds were not produced except in total darkness , but by gradually introducing the practice of burning a light at night the ringing was finally heard one night when there was a light in the room . The lady of the house then went quietly down to the dining-room and saw a large rat with every expression of pleasure leaping forward and with his forelegs striking the prisms so as to make them ring , and evidently taking the keenest delight in the sound thus produced . In an article on Apparitions written by Andrew Lang , in the second volume of the " Encyclopredia Britannica , " ninth edition , he says : The writer once met , as he believed , a wellknown and learned member of an English university who was really dying at a place more than a hundred miles distant from that in which he was seen . Supposing , for the sake of argument , that the writer did not mistake some other individual for the extremely noticeable person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective impression aud the death of the learned professor is , to say the least , curio:is . To determine whether or not it was a case of mistaken identity is very important , but no opportunity is given in the passage quoted . If it was a subjective impression , the coincidence would be curious and nothing else ; and not more so , as I have shown abundantly , than many coincidences in trifles , and many other circumstances absolutely disconnected , and many subjective impressions without any coincidences . Mr. Lang , in the article referred to , has written like one who has crammed with the literature of the subject without being at the pains to reason closely upon the alleged facts . He refers to the superstitious horror shown by a dog at the moment of a supposed apparition to his master . That the dog exhibited horror when his owner thought he saw an apparition may be readily believed . And one familiar with dogs knows that nothing xviii terrify them more than a great appearance of alarm on the part of their masters without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark concerning the mysterious disturbances at the house of the Wesleys : " The mastiff was more afraid than any of the children . " The volatile imaginations of children have never shoxvn any great horror of mysteries ; they were sustamed , too , by confidence in their parents . But the dog heard mysterious noises which naturally greatly agitated him . Mr. Lang closes his remarks on this part of . the subject by naiively saying , " The case of Baalam 's ass is sufficiently well known . " This case is not pertinent . Balaam 's ass , according to the record , not only saw a supernatural appearance , but engaged in a process of reasoning in which his past life as an ass was called up to vindicate him from abuse , and further engaged in a conversation with his master in the latter 's vernacular . Indeed , according to the record , he exhibited a cogency of reasoning which applied to most of the tales attested to prove the reality of apparitions would effectually " lay " the ghosts . Many persons fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make raps or answer raps , conclusively prove that they are directed by intelligence . Sometimes they may , and the intelligence is quite likely to be of human origin ; but noises of atmospheric , chemical , or electrical origin may furnish astonishing coincidences , just as the fissures in the rocks are extremely difficult to be distinguished from hieroglyphics . Some years ago an alphabet based on the spiritualistic alphabet was applied to the successive gusts of wind of a stormy autumn day , and the coincidences were astonishing . Whole sentences of a very significant character at times appeared to respond to the arbitrary standard . And in any case the conclusion that a noise the cause of which is not yet understood must be supernatural is a process of reasoning ab zg ; wrau/uz . That ghosts do not come to those most interested in them , and seldom or never to any who // long for them , has been a matter of note from the earliest times . Wordsworth 's words , often quoted , state the conclusion drawn from this in language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was ever intercourse Betwixt the living and the dead , For surely then I should have sight Of him I wait for day and night With love and longings infinite . The ceremonies practiced by the Christian Church in the Middle Ages in the successful exorcising of ghosts are not less striking than the sort of evidence on which the ghosts were accel ) ted . Two or three clergymen are necessary and the ceremony must be performed in Latin , " the language which strikes the most audacious ghost with terror . " According to history and tradition the ghost may be laid for any term less than a hundred years , " in any place or body , filled or empty . " But what a ghost hates most is the Red Sea . It is related on the most indisputable authority that the ghosts have earnestly besought exorcists not to confine them in that place ; nor is any instance given of their escaping before the time ! When we consider the horrible injustice inflicted upon orphans whose estates are squandered by trustees , the concealment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diverting of trust funds for benevolent purposes to objects abhorrent to those who with painful toil accumulated them and with confidence in the stability of human laws bequeathed them , the loneliness and despair that fill human hearts , and the gloomy doubts of the reality of a future existence ,  --  all of which would be rendered impossible if actual apparitions took place ,  --  the conclusion that neither in the manner of the alleged comings nor in the objects for which they come is there any evidence to be found of their reality gathers almost irresistible force . If it be assumed that the testimony of one person or of one hundred persons to a supernatural event is not sufficient to prove that it occurred , the question , " What becomes of the testimony of the Apostles and the five hundred brethren to the resurrection of Christ , and of Stephen to his seeing the heavens open , " comes up again . It admits of but one answer . If they had nothing to give us but the fact that they saw a person alive who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the ground that it is far more probable that they were deceived than that such a thing occurred . But that is not the case . They present to us the whole body of Christian doctrine , declaring that it was received from that person who predicted that he would rise from the dead , and whom they believed themselves to see , and with whom on various occasions they conversed after his resurrectioii . If the body of Christian doctrine in its relation to the moral nature of the thinker does not convince him of the divine origin and consequent truth of the record , we know of no means of doing so .
