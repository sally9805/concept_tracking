txt The canvass for Assembly in both the districts of Niagara causes considerable interest . Both are close and both are now represented by Democrats . In the First , or Lockport , District.J . W. Higgins , the present member and Democratic candidate , is pretty strongly fortified by his record at Albany last Winter as a canal man . and is appealing for the support of the canal interests , which compose a very large per cent . of the voting population of the district . His competitor , Edwin Levan , is well known and popular , and is running also on the free canal platform . Both candidates are making a close personal canvass , and the result is doubtful . In the Second , or Niagara Falls , District , which embraces seven ' of the twelve towns , the canvass is prosecuted with a vizor and earnestness never known there before . Thomas N. Welch , the present member and Democratic candidate , is a shrewd , stirring young man , prominent in Roman Catholic circles , and was conceded to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor and proprietor of the Niagara Falls Gazette , took the Republican nomination . This candidate is young , wealthy , and ambitious , and is stirring up the voters in every part of the district in his favor . Just 21 years ago . in November . 1801 , his father , Col. Peter A. Porter , who was afterward killed at Cold Spring Harbor , was elected to the Assembly iu the same district on the Republican ticket , and the election of the son at this time would be something of a coincidence . The canvass in this district is complicated with the Question of the proposed International Park at Niagara , and both candidates find it difficult to steer a safe course between the popularity of the project in the town of Niagara and its unpopularity in the other towns arising from the fact that the proposed park would exempt a very large valuation of property from taxation . Besides this , Mr. Porter has a large interest in the property expected to be taken for this purpose . These Assembly contests have become very lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
