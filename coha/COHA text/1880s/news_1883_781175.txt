txt The compendium of the " Tenth Census , " a volume of 1,769 pages , will very soon be published by general distribution , and a few copies in paper covers have already been issued from the Government Printing-office . The compendium contains in condensed form pars of the matter heretofore published in bulletins and volumes , together with the mast important parts of the report which will hereafter be published at length . Congress was told a few days ago that four months would be required for the completion of the full report of Mr. Frederick H. Wines upon the defective , dependent , and delinquent classes . There are in the compendium the summary tables of this report , which are introduced by a statement made by Mr. Wines to the Census Bureau a few weeks ago . The most striking result of the work was the apparently great increase in the number of those included in the three classes named . The number of insane persons , idiots , blind persons , and deaf-mutes , as shown by the several censuses , was 50,994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 251.698 in 1880 . In other words , although the population has a little more than doubled in 30 years , the number of defective persons returned is apparently nearly five times as great as it was SO years ago . The increase of population between 1870 and 1880 was only 30 per cent. , while the apparent increase of these defective classes was 155 per cent . While there were only 2,551 defective persons in each million in 1870 , there were 5,018 in each million in 1880 . Mr. Wines says that it is impossible to believe that there has , in fact , been so great an increase . Either the enumeration in 1880 was excessive or the enumeration in 1870 was incomplete . He speaks of the difficulties which confront an agent attempting to make an accurate report of the number of these persons , and shows that in 1880 new and ingenious methods were used to overcome these difficulties . The bureau was assisted in the work by 80,000 physicians , and the agent believes that a much more perfect enumeration of the defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been secured than was ever before presented in the history of this or any other nation . Of the 91,997 insane persons , any per cent , were in hospitals and asylums ; of 76,895 idiots , 3 per cent . were in training schools for the feeble minded ; of 48,928 blind persons , less than 4X per cent . were in schools and industrial homes for the blind , and of 33,878 mutes , nearly 16 per cent . were in schools established for them . Of the deaf persons , one-half were between the ages of 5 and 21 , but not more than one-sixth of the blind were between those ages . It appears that insanity attacks women more frequently than it does men , but men on the other hand are more liable to be idiotic , blind , or deaf . The negro population is much more liable to idiocy than insanity . Both the negro and the foreign population are singularly more liable to blindness than to deafness . The tendency of the foreign population to insanity is especially worthy of attention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that of 50,000,000 of inhabitants over 400 , - 000 are either insane , idiots , deaf-mutes , or blind , or are inmates of prisons , reformato-ries , or poor-houses . If to these we add the outdoor poor and the inmates off.private charitable institutions , the number will swell to nearly or quite 500,000 , or 1 per cent . of the total population . We can not begin too soon or prosecute too vigorously the inquiry into the causes of the prevalence of these evils , which are like a canker at the heart of all our prosperity . " The number of paupers enumerated in almshouses was 67,067 , and the number of prisoners in confinement was 59,255 . There were 11,340 inmates of reformatories for the young . Of the prisoners 16,000 are maintained in idleness . Speaking of the leasing of convicts in the South , Mr. -W ices says that one case was reported where a man convicted of manslaughter was leased out to his own wife , and in this way allowed to return to his home . In Florida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Texas the number of convicts outside of the walls of the penitentiary is nearly equal to the number confined inside . The death-rate of the United States , as established by the number of deaths recorded , was 15.1 to the thousand , a rate decidely higher than those given in the censuses of 1860 and 1870 . This does not indicate , however , any actual increase in the rate , but shows that the returns in 1880 were more complete . Adding estimates of deficiencies , the agent in charge estimates the actual death-rate at somewhere between 17 and 19 per thousand . The rate iu England in the same year was 2014 . Of the total number of deaths reported , which was 756,893 , the cause in 91,551 cases was consumption ; diphtheria caused 38,398 deaths ; enteric or typhoid fever , 22,905 ; malarial fever , 20,261 , and accidents or injuries , 35,932 . The death rate of the colored race is much greater than that of the white . The compendium contains the statistics of fire and life insurance , public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newspapers , steam craft , and mining , as well as the statistics of population , sericulture , manufactures , and wealth , debt , and taxation , which fill a laree part of the volume .
