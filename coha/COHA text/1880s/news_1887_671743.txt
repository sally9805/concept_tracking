txt It can be stated with a good deal of positiveness that the proposition of taking the tax off fruit brandy , which is alleged to be a part of the tariff programme at Oak View , has never for a moment been entertained either by the President or Secretary Fairchild . A few years ago this question was agitated in Congress , and Mr. Randolph Tucker and other Southern members made inquiry of the Treasury Department as to what would be the effeot on the revenue of taking off the tax upon this ? " home product , ' as they called it . The reply was made that the direct loss to the revenueIould be trifling , as the amount collected item spirits made from apples , peaches , &c.,; ever since the reimposition of the internal revenue laws shad ranged from $500,000 a year up to $2,000,000 , according to the bountifulness of the fruit crop , with a general average of a very little over $1,000,000 . It was stated , however , that the indirect loss to the revenue would be very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit brandy from taxation would practically render the collection of the tax on grain spirits in many districts impossible . There would be nothing to prevent the grain distillers from flavoring their alcohol with fruit extracts and putting it on the market free of duty'as peach brandy . Then , again , the exemption of one class of distilleries from taxation would immensely increase the output or fruit brandies . At the present time the production of these articles is mainly limited to what the Southern farmers require for their home consumptions and to the surplusage of their fruit crop winch they are unable to get to a profitable market . If they could put their whole crop into fruit brandy without paying a tax on it they would undoubtedly do so , and the result would be that all the email grain distilleries in the Southern States would either be turned into fruit distilleries or ' would make spirits illicitly and put them on the market as fruit brandies . Commissioner Miller being asked to-day if it would be practicable to take the tax off fruit brandies without deranging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; that it would open the door to frauds in every direction . He further said , in answer to a direct inquiry , that he had not been asked for any statistics on the subject . xx Assistant Secretary of State Porter authorized the statement to-day that he would resign his office and take his departure for his home in Tennessee within the next two or three days . He said he had mentioned this purpose to Secretary Bayard several days ago , and had since been busily engaged in removing his personal effects . He is only awaiting the return from his vacation of the clerk who has charge of his personal papers to sever his connection with the State Department . The regret being expressed that Gov . Porter , who has always been exceedingly courteous to the newspaper men , should leave , he replied that he in turn had to thank the newspapers . for their fair treatment , and that he had the satisfaction of knowing , in leaving ; the office , that he left the Consular Service of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better condition than he had found it . Gov . Porter said lie had not yet placed his resignation in the hands of the President ; that he had intended doing so today if the President had ' come to the White House , and finding that a premature announcement of his intention had been made , he had just telegraphed to the President at his country home saying that he desired to be relieved at the earliest possible moment . Gov . Porter assigned as the sole cause of his resigna tion the health of his wife and the urgency of private affairs . intimating that the work of the department ; had been very heavy and was not entirely congenial to him . To a suggestion that some ' ill-natured ? comments might be made , to the effect that his retirement was the result of lb disagreement with Secretary Bayard on ' the fishery negotiations , Secretary . Porter replied that that would not be true and that lie left the office with the kindest feelings toward every one in it . When asked if ho would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ; that he should leave as soon as he could get his private papers together . Secretary Bayard is expected to return to the city to-day or to-morrow . Referring to the Behring Sea seizures , it may be interesting to recall the exact language addressed by Secretary Fish to Sir Edward Thornton Jan. 22 , 1875 , this dispatch being in reply to a suggestion of the British Government that the limit of territorial jurisdiction heretofore held to be the equivalent of a gun shot of three miles should be extended to comply more nearly with the range of modern artillery . Secretary Fish wrote as follows : " We have always understood and asserted that , pursuant to public law , no nation can rightfully claim j urisdiotion at sea beyond a marine league from its coast . This opinion on our part has sometimes been said to be inconsistent with the facts that , by the laws of the United States , revenue cutters are authorized to board vessels anywhere within four leagues of their coasts , and that by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d of February , 1848. the boundary line between the dominions of the parties begins in the'GuLt of Mexico three leagues from land . It is believed , however , that in carrying into effect the authority conferred by the act of Congress referred to , no vessel is boarded , if boarded at all , except such a one as upon being hailed may have answered that she was bound to a port of the United States . At all events , although the act of Congress was passed in the infancy of this Government , there is no known instance of any complaint on the part of a foreign Government of the trespass by a commander of a revenue cutter upon the rights of its flag under the law of nations . " The Post Offices at Bay Shore and Port Jefferson , Suffolk County , N. Y. , were to-day made first class offices , to take effect Oct. 1 , at a salary of $1,100 a year . ? The Hon. W. L. Scott , of Pennsylvania , returned to the city this evening from his visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tariff and a reduction of the revenue had been discussed by the President himself , Secretary Fairchild , and Mr. Carlisle , and whether any bill bad been agreed upon , he said that this subject , as well as other public matters , had been talked about , and that while there was no difference of opinion among the gentlemen present as to the necessity for an early reduction of the revenues and taxation , no measure for that purpose had been agreed upon , and none would be without consultation with the members belonging to the majority in the House of Representatives . It was the opinion of all that there ought to be a very considerable reeuction at the earliest possible date after the meeting of . Congress , but the manner in which the reduction should be made . was considered only in a general way , and no details were agreed upon . This , lie said , was all that could be said about the so-called conference , and the statements upon the subject going the rounds of the press were mere speculations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day and presented to him in behalf of the Chinese Viceroy , Li Hung Chang , a fine imperial photograph of his Excellency , the Viceroy . The Count also bore a letter to Mr. Porter from United States Consul Smithers , at Tien-Tsin , introducing him to the Assistant Secretary . No reference was made to the concession during this morning 's visit , and none of the Envoys were present . Nothing has been made public as yet in reference to the treatment of the concession by the Chinese Minister , but it is believed that up to this time no dual action has been taken in the matter . * yr The evidence is overwhelming that on the occasion of the reception given by the President and Mrs. Cleveland last night in honor of the foreign guests of the Nation attending the International Medical Congress many of the guests for whom the reception was given were unable to obtain admission , though the President and his wife considerately prolonged the time named for the reception two hours beyond the limit proposed . A crowd of free luncliers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible way in dress and manners did discredit to the American name . Where the fault lay it is perhaps useless to inquire now when it is too late to apply the remedy . It is quite evident that the foreign guests should have been conveyed to the White House in carriages and admitted by a sepcrate entrance from the general crowd , as is usual with the diplomatic corps on stated occasions , and it is not at all evident why there should have been a general crowd or why the same rules of admission by badges or special tickets which governed the right to the floor at Albaugh 's Opera House on the opening day should not have been applied and enforced at the entrances to the ' Mute House grounds . Whatever the cause , the result is a most unfortunate imputation , on American hospitality and manners . The foreign delegates keenly feel the slight put upon them , though with characteristic courtesy they do not say much . Cue distinguished foreigner said in the presence of a reporter to  --  day that he was " heart-broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , but declared that he was going to get Mrs. Cleveland 's photo . graph and keep it near him all his life . Warning might have been taken by a similar experience not quite so bad at the Conversazione at the Pension hall on Monday night . The announce went was made to-day that a number of the tickets for the banquet to-morrow night had fallen into wrong hands , and that new tickets would have to be issued . Incidents like this and others which will be recalled  --  the Chinese recep tion last Winter , for instance  --  are felt to cast deep disgrace upon Washington , and it is with regret they are referred to .
