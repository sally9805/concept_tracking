txt Frank James was found at the Ralston farm , a few miles north of Independence , Iowa , yesterday , by a reporter who went out there to see what had become of the notorious bandit . Frank is no longer the handsome , stalwart fellow of old , but is in the last stages of consumption . Frank said that he was quite poor , and that he did not know just how he would get through the long Winter . To the question concerning the reports of his adopting the stage as a profession , he said : " That 's only talk . I have received a bushel of letters from managers of first-class theatres who wanted to get blood and thunder plays written for me , and from managers of dime museums who wanted to place me on exhibition , but I have paid no attention to their offers . I 'm a little too old to become an actor , and I do n't want to be made a curiosity of . These managers all offer me big money , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind not to go on the stage or into any museum business . I have chosen farm life and I 'm going to stick to it through all the rest of my days . I have been before the public long enough and I do n't want any more of It . I bad a lawyer speak to me once on this subject . He told me it would be a very profitable thing for me to go on the stage , so I told him that I would have a five-act tragedy written for both of us. if he would agree to star in the play and let me support him . Or course , he would n't agree . " " Do you propose at any time to write an account of your life ? " " No . Sir . If I did it would be so simple and tame that people would not only be disappointed ? they would n't believe it . " What do you mean ? " " I mean that so much has been written about the James boys and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , calm statement of how little we did and how entirely lawful our acts were the public would ne surprised , and would say there was no truth in my book . " " Have you read any of the books published about the James boys ? " Not one . I have seen some of them and may have skimmed over a page or two , but I have not read any one through . Still I know they are full of exaggerations and distortions of the truth . They are reproduced large y Irom the newspaper accounts of us , and you know , being in the newspaper business , that no matter how truthful a correspondent may be be will be tempted to put a little color on to give his article the sensational hue that the readers of his paper want . " Frank says be has no fear of the Minnesota authorities claiming him , for , as he puts it , they have not a scintilla of evidence against him . He says that , having answered all the charges brought against him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , and be proposes ending his days on the farm at Independence .
