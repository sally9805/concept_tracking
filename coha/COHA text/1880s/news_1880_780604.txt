txt The hearing before the House Committee on Commerce in relation to the bills abolishing compulsory pilotage began to-day . Several gentlemen were introdnced by James A. Van Brunt , of New-York , and they made short arguments in favor of the . proposition . The first speaker was William W. Goodrich , who was introduced as a representative of the merchants of New-York City . After sketching the history of pilot regulations in New-York , he characterized compulsory pilotage as the last relic of barbarism on the statute-books , and condemned any law which made it possible for pilots to stand at the gateway of the American commercial Metropolis , and say , " Stand and deliver . " The system was bad in principle and in effect , and sustained by class legislation of the most odious kind . Affidavits were submitted to show the practices of Hell Gate pilots , whom , he compared to the robber Barons of the Rhine , Who once levied toll upon passing vessels . To Illustrate the injustice of discrimination , he chose two ships , lying side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same cargo , One of these could go to San Francisco , and was not compelled to take a pilot , while the other , bound for HaVane , must pay $2,800 a year for pilotage in the port of New-York alone , her master getting only $2,400 a year for his serVices . Eight thousand foreign-going ships arrived in New-York in 1879. and 25,000 coasters , who were not bound to take pilots . He challenged proof that the coasters met with mere accidents than the ships from foreign ports . The merchants asked for the removal of a burden upon commerce , which was already having a powerful influence in depressing maritime interests . Mr. Goodrich reproduced many of the statistics which he recently used in his argument at Albany . Capt . Dean , of Taunton , Mass. , a practical toaster , showed that where compulsory pilotage had been abolished there was no scarcity of pilots , and denounced the exactions made at Wilmington , Galveston . and other Southern ports . The Government had , at great expense , Made the water-ways plain by lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary service should be repealed . At most ports the tug-boats , which bore better pilots than could be found elsewhere , went out further from the shore than the pilots whom the law supported in their piratical exactions . There was no necessity for pilots at Hell Gate . Charles Lawrence , President of the Vesselmuerte and Captains ' Association of Philadelphia . argued that Congress could establish a Universal Pilotage law , and asserted that a yes- ! el is often compelled to pay one-eighth of her tiet annual earnings to pilots for services not tendered . To the proposition that pilots must Ile supported because they are necessary for the safety of life and property , be answered that the necessity for pilots is becoming less apparent every year , swing to the efforts of the Government to make the coast plain by surveys , charts , buoys , and lights . With regard to competition , he could not see why men in this profession , like those In others , should not take their chances , In conclusion , he asked the committee whether it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel-owners , or help the latter to healthy life again . Statements Were submitted , which showed that the pilots in deleted 4 lines Brunswick , Ga. , were 50 per cent . of all the port charges at those places . amounting to $145 , while the owner received for the whole trip $480 . J. Ernest Miller , of the Maritime Association of New-York , declared that compulsory pilotage was one of the greatest burdens against which American vessel-owners had to contend in many of the Southern States , which had hardly any tonnage of their own . The impression seemed to exist that it was right to plunder vessels from other States in this way . He owned portions of many vessels , but this property yielded only 8 per cent . without insurance or repairs . These would cost about 18 per cent . But the owners were unable to pay for insurance . He thought the committee could plainly see how our maritime interests must decline under these conditions . Compulsory pilotage might have been necessary many years ago , before tugs were plenty in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than pilots charge . It was not right to impose the pilot tax upon a coastwise vessel when its owner became more enterprising and went into foreign trade . " You ca n't imagine , " saidhe , " how burdensome the exactions at Hell Gate are . " The pilots there , he continued , did not wish to render service , but preferred to collect half the pilotage , because more money could be made in that way . A vessel was mentioned which earned only $150 in three years , but paid $1,200 to pilots in that time . The pilots at Sandy Hook did not deny that they received $3,500 annually , which far exceeded the salary of a master of a vessel . Mr. Lincoln appeared as the representative of the New-England Ship-owners ' Association and the Allan Line to Glasgow . He argued against the maintenance of high rates , and claimed that the competition which would follow the abolition of compulsory pilotage would not only lower the rates , but would result in retaining the best pilots in service , and in throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business . Vessel-owners could be expected to look out for their own interests and to favor measures of safety . The fact that they were united in opposing compulsory pilotage showed that competition would not impair the efficiency of the pilot service . The hearing will be continued to-morrow . The Hell Gate pilots have sent E. M. Patsy to appear before the committee in their behalf .
