Lord Cairngorm Upon my word , a merry party  --  what a whole-souled way of doing things these Americans have ! Everybody seems to be making the most of life  --  at least all except that melancholy-faced young fellow who seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance with that pretty girl  --  Libby  --  ah , yes , Libby Ray . The young man seems to be quite a sport in his juvenile way , but the supper and the wine and the pretty girls have been too much for his nerves . What an awkward fellow he is ; bumped into me three times , and instead of apologizing gave me a look which carried a villainous desire to commit murder in it . Charley Brood enters from house and looks round Char . Charley Brood I wonder where Libby has gone to ? Her aunt called her away from me half an hour ago and I have n't been able to find her since . Sees Lord Cairngorm Oh  --  there is the English lord that wanted to dance with Libby and would n't give her up to me . What right has he got to come over here and monopolize the best girl in the house ? He do n't seem such a bad sort of fellow , but I 'm desperate , and I 'd quarrel with anyone that dances with Libby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've got a bone to pick with you . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Looks up , puts glass to eye By jove , it 's the youthful sport  --  ah  --  where is your bone ? Char . Charley Brood You have n't got any right to come here and take my girl away  --  you have been dancing with her every chance you got , and I do n't like it . I love the girl , and if any fellow thinks he can take her away from me , I 'll make him sick of his job , and I do n't care who he is , either . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Oh , really ! By jove , it 's droll , but actually , I should n't have known it if you had n't told me . Char . Charley Brood Well , I wanted you to understand it . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm My dear fellow , you are not going to get jealous of me , are you ? Char . Charley Brood I am jealous of you . I 'm jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm A desperate case for a young country . Char . Charley Brood I have loved her ever since I have known her , but I never had the courage to tell her so . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Faint heart never won fair lady , you know . It 's easy enough , and the young lady evidently has not forgotten you . Char . Charley Brood Anxiously Do you really think I have made an impression ? Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Undoubtedly , and a lasting impression , I should say , considering that you danced on her dress and stepped on her toes , and tore about a yard of lace . Char . Charley Brood The music was too quick  --  it confused me . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I should have imagined it was the wine . But no doubt the music was at fault . Char . Charley Brood It might have been a little of both . But the worst of it is that her aunt got angry about it . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Her aunt ? Char . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her aunt , who wo n't let me speak to her if she can help it . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm The charming widow who speaks French with such delightful persistency ? Char . Charley Brood Yes  --  Mrs. General Gilflory . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Oh , yes  --  a most estimable lady , with such a droll manner of expression . Char . Charley Brood Say , I do n't believe you are such a bad fellow after all , and I 'm sorry if I said anything out of line , but you see how it is , when a fellow is in love . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Oh , yes , I have a brother who is continually making an ass of himself by falling in love . Char . Charley Brood Suppose you were in my place , if you were trying to win a girl and you were running neck and neck right up to the wire , and something came in between you and the girl  --  how would you like it ? Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I am afraid I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just makes me feel as if I 'd like to put the gloves on . Clara Dart , assisted by Mrs. Gilflory , enters from house Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Now Mrs. Dart , you must sit down and get a good breath of fresh air . Leads her to seat , R. Lord C. Lord Cairngorm There is our lovely hostess . Char . Charley Brood How pale she is ! She looks as if she had seen a ghost . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm She has no doubt exerted herself to entertain so large a party , and the excitement was too much for her . Clara . Clara Dart On seat , to Mrs. Gilflory Thank you so much . I feel better already since we came out into the cool evening air . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory It is a beautiful evening , so clear and calm . Clara . Clara Dart Beautiful , indeed . How different is the peaceful calm out here from the excitement and heat of the dining room . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You and Mr. Dart have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scale . No wonder your strength is overtaxed . Clara . Clara Dart It is my only happiness to see my friends around me happy and enjoying themselves . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory By the way , did you see Mr. Vance among the guests ? Clara . Clara Dart Indeed ? He has not spoken to me . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Has n't he ? Why , I thought he was an old admirer of yours , and would be glad to see you again . Clara . Clara Dart With apparent effort Oh , that was only a boy-and-girl affair , and forgotten long ago . But do not let me keep you out here . Indeed I would rather be alone . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I do n't care to go inside . Clara . Clara Dart Yes , do  --  go and join the dancers . Lord Cairngorm will take you , wo n't you ? Lord C. Lord Cairngorm With pleasure . Offers arm . Exit into house with Mrs. Gilflory Clara . Clara Dart Alone Ah , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last hour in that scene of festivity . The dining room brilliantly lighted and the drawing room ringing with happy laughter and merry jests , my face bearing a smile , my heart dark and lonely . Vance appears at door of house Where is Mr. Vance now ? Has he suffered , too ? Perhaps I shall never know . Vance . Roland Vance Aside Why did I come here tonight ? The sight of her has brought back all the painful memories of the days when my first bitter disappointment fell upon me . Clara Northwick 's smile was then the sunshine of my life , and the sunshine was gone when she cast me off for a millionaire ! How refreshing this cool evening breeze is . Ah  --  there she is now . She has gratified her ambition , she has married a man who is wealthy  --  but is she happy ? She has everything that is dear to a woman 's heart but love . Poor girl , how wan and pale she is  --  her face has not lost its beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she was when I told her of my love , and believed that I was loved in return . What a fool I am to tear open the old wounds . I will remain here no longer  --  I dare not trust myself : under the spell of her eyes I should be a traitor to Blanche Thurston and to myself . Clara has had face turned sideways , but now looks at him Clara . Clara Dart Mr. Vance ? Vance . Roland Vance Ah , Mrs. Dart  --  pardon me , I did not wish to intrude . Good night . Clara . Clara Dart Stay one moment  --  I wish you to hear me . Vance . Roland Vance I am at your service . Clara . Clara Dart Why did you come here ? Vance . Roland Vance Because your husband 's invitation was so pressing  --  to decline would have been an insult . Clara . Clara Dart I would have avoided a meeting if I could  --  I feared my strength would be unequal to the strain  --  but it gives me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past . Vance . Roland Vance The past is buried , and the wish to revive it comes with ill grace from the one who dug the grave . Clara . Clara Dart How cruel you are . If you could read my heart you would not say such bitter words . Vance . Roland Vance I thought once I could read your heart , but it was only a dream  --  and the awakening almost broke mine . Clara . Clara Dart Do not judge me so harshly , you know nothing of my motives  --  my reasons . Vance . Roland Vance They explained themselves . Mr. Dart is wealthy . Clara . Clara Dart O Roland , how can you be so cruel ! Hate me if you will , but you shall not despise me , and that is why I have waited so long for a chance to clear myself in your eyes . Believe me , Roland , this marriage was not of my own seeking . Vance . Roland Vance But you are married to Mr. Dart . Clara . Clara Dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fortune had been swept away  --  poverty , even starvation stared her in the face , and I sold myself that she might end her days in comfort . Vance . Roland Vance Poor girl . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Appears at door of house Will you join me in a stroll in the garden ? Char . Charley Brood With him With pleasure . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Well , well ! If this is n't a pleasant change , from the hilarious scenes inside the house to the beauties of nature outside ! Char . Charley Brood This cool evening breeze is just what I wanted . I have been dancing till I am ready to melt . Does my face look flushed , judge ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Looks like the head of a torchlight procession . Both up C. Clara . Clara Dart To Vance Excuse me , Mr. Vance . I must return to my guests . Exit into house . Vance sits in deep thought , with averted face Char . Charley Brood I say , judge , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Bardwell Slote I should say so  --  you would n't let anyone else get near her . Char . Charley Brood Devilish fine girl , is n't she  --  so high-spirited . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Yes , but you had better look out for her aunt . Char . Charley Brood Mrs. General Gilflory ? Oh , yes , she does n't like me to dance with her niece . Mrs. Gilflory heard laughing in house Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote There she is now . You can tell Mrs. General Gilflory by her hearty laugh . Char . Charley Brood I do n't want her to see me , or else she will tell me I must n't dance with Libby any more . Excuse me , judge . Exit , L.U.E. Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote That 's right , you 'd better step P.D.Q. , pretty damn quick . ' Pon my soul , I consider the young lady 's aunt is a more attractive specimen of irrational femininity than the young lady herself . Well , it 's a good thing we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bless my heart , if there is n't Mr. Vance . How do you do , Mr. Vance  --  delighted to see you ! Resting yourself after the excitement of the dance ? Vance . Roland Vance Coldly Thank you , I came out here for a moment 's rest and the cool evening breeze . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Same case here , too much highfalutin ' inside . Will you smoke a cigar ? Offers one Vance . Roland Vance Thank you . I seldom smoke . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote No ? Well , I did n't know but you might like a little social chat . Vance . Roland Vance Turning away I prefer to be alone . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote You 'd rather be alone ? Why , you ai n't ill , are you ? You look as if you 'd just quarreled with your best girl . Vance . Roland Vance I have been overworked lately . You know we newspaper men have to get through a great deal of hard work . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon to exhaust our vitality under the strain of immense responsibility . Now one of my committees  --  Vance . Roland Vance Pardon me if I decline to discuss professional affairs . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Oh , yes , certainly . I hate to talk shop at a garden party , but while we are here , it is so seldom a man of your prominence in the newspaper circle can be reached for a sociable ten minutes , I 'd like to get the benefit of your vast experience and keen foresight . Vance . Roland Vance I am afraid you wo n't benefit much . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I just wanted to ask you for an opinion . Do you think , Mr. Vance , that there is a good chance for our railroad bill to go through ? Vance . Roland Vance Interrupts Whatever information I may have on the subject is confidential , and I must decline to make any use of it . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote But I do n't want you to make any use of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him Merely asking your opinion  --  as man to man  --  what do you think about it , eh , my dear Mr. Vance ? Vance . Roland Vance I can not discuss the matter . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote But you can tell me what you think . Vance . Roland Vance You must excuse me , Mr. Slote . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Following One minute , my dear Vance . Vance . Roland Vance Good night . Exit into house Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Looking after him That 's what I call the D.S. , the dirty shake . No , sir , it 's a D.D.S. , a damn dirty shake , by a large majority . He does n't like me , and that was one of his ways of showing it . I 'd like to clip his wings a bit . I 'd like to clip the wings of the whole brood of newspaper hawks . That 's my sentiment , by a large majority . They come down here and parade about the legislative halls of the nation with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prerequisites of office without any of the responsibility ; they stick their noses into people 's private affairs , and when a patriotic Congressman tries to look after his own interests by a practical arrangement with some ambitious railroad , out comes the Morning Clarion or the Daily Windbag with a howl about bribes and corruption and rings . And they call that the freedom of the press ! Freedom of humbug . I 'd like to squelch the whole lot of them , that 's my opinion , by a large majority . That fellow Vance do n't like me . He called me a political dodo once in his weak-kneed journal . Yes , sir ! He calls me , the Honorable Bardwell Slote , a dodo , and holds me up to the public ridicule . I do n't know what a dodo is , but I 'll bet it 's something nasty . But every dog has his day , and I guess it 's pretty much the same with dodos , and this dodo will have his day , and then Mr. Newspaper Vance will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters from house Dart . Clara Dart Ah , Slote ! It 's rather unusual to find you alone . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I had retired from the joyous scenes of festivity within those hospitable walls to enjoy the peaceful calm of the lawn . Dart . Clara Dart It is a beautiful evening and the air is pure and clear out here . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I wish you had come out here a few moments sooner . You would have seen something that might have made the atmosphere look cloudy . Dart . Clara Dart I was fully occupied in getting the guests comfortably settled down together , but what would I have seen that would raise a cloud ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote You would have seen your friend Vance and your wife enjoying a little tte -- tte in the friendly shadows of the trees , but when I say they were enjoying themselves , I am using the word in a parliamentary sense , for the expression on their faces indicated that there was a wagonload of trouble on their minds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard stroke of fortune . Dart . Clara Dart Vance and my wife are old friends . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Yes , I guess they must have been . Maybe you 're not very sensitive on those points , but I am , by a large majority , and if I had seen him talking to my wife with that look on his face , and bringing that look into her face , I 'd create a vacancy among the newspaper men . Dart . Clara Dart I have heard Vance 's name coupled with that of my wife , but I have the fullest confidence in her . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote And she 's worthy of it , too , but I ca n't say that much for Vance . Not by a large majority . Why did you invite him here ? Dart . Clara Dart I did it more on my wife 's account . She seemed averse to meeting him here for fear that malicious tongues might be set wagging , but I resolved to let her and the world see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but trusted her implicitly . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote And you can always trust her , but I 'd keep an eye on the newspaper man . They will all bear watching , and they do n't always make such fine distinctions in personal honor as a man would who was n't eternally hunting for other people 's secrets . Dart . Clara Dart O Slote , you are inclined to be severe on Mr. Vance , I think . You always were hard on them . A little too hard perhaps . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote No , sir , not by a large majority . If I am hard on them , it 's because they deserve it . What claim have they on my reverence ? They never report a speech correctly . And how have they treated me ? Sometimes with absolute silence , and at other times passed me by with half a dozen lines when my opponents are given a whole column . They have conspired to ignore me , sir , to ignore the Honorable Bardwell Slote ! If I rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , the next day the Morning Bugle says Mr. Slote amused the House for a few minutes , and if I make a speech bursting with eloquence , the Daily Startler says Mr. Slote took up the time of the members by some incoherent nonsense which was listened to with impatience . Do you call that freedom of the press ? No , sir ! Not by a large majority ! Why , sir , if it was not for the Congressional Record the great and glorious name of Bardwell Slote would be handed down to posterity unwept , unhonored and unhung Dart laughs no , no  --  I meant unsung . Dart . Clara Dart Oh , but you said unhung . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote But my time will come , sir ! My time will come  --  and the whole world shall do homage to the name of Slote . Why , sir , our enemies will retract in terror all the vile calumnies they have uttered against our fair names , and from the highest pinnacle of fame to the utmost corners of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though once crushed to earth , will rise again , and when that time comes , let the perfidious press look to itself ! Dart . Clara Dart I have no doubt you would prove a formidable opponent . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Formidable , sir ! Why , when I get after my friend Vance , I will make him look worse than he did when he was talking to your wife . Dart . Clara Dart Why do you couple their names so persistently ? I understand that they have been friends since they were children , and it is only natural that a sort of familiarity should exist between them , but I am sure neither of them would forget honor and duty . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Colonel Dart , I may be Johnny O.S. , Johnny on the spot , but there is one thing I can lay to my heart ; I am not so A.G. , awful green . And I am neither wicked nor ungrateful , so when I think a friend 's confidence is being abused I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of giving offense . Dart . Clara Dart Good-natured O Slote , you ca n't make me jealous . Vance is not a bad fellow . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I 'm glad you think so . Dart . Clara Dart But now to business . Have you any news regarding the Railroad Bill ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Nothing new , but we are pushing it along as fast as possible  --  I have done a heap of talking . Dart . Clara Dart Do you think there is any chance of getting it through our way ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Any chance , my dear sir ! Of course , there is a chance , by a large majority . There are a great many people who want the road to run our way , but there are also a great many people who want it to go the other way . Dart . Clara Dart Of course  --  there is naturally some opposition . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Colonel Dart , you know it is an F.F. , a financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash basis . Dart . Clara Dart Yes , of course , but the land out that way is n't fit for anything : it 's all rock and stumps . I own a large tract in Chalkville and I ca n't sell it at any price . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Vance has got some land in Muggins Glen  --  one of his ancestors used to live out there and left him five hundred acres by will , and it 's right on the line where our road wants to go . Dart . Clara Dart He knows nothing about the road ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Not a thing , and the political dodo wo n't tell him . Dart . Clara Dart If he should hear of it , of course he would work against the road running through my land in Chalkville , so why not purchase his Muggins Glen property and then he would have no interest in opposing us ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote A good idea , and whichever way the road runs it will be a good speculation for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a chance to get at Vance . He 's in want of ready money and will be glad to sell , and then we will go in and rush the bill through . You see to that part of it  --  here 's the money . Gives money Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I will , by a large majority . The political dodo will wander across Mr. Vance 's path and whichever way the road goes in the end , I will prepare him for an H.O.T. , a high old time , by a large majority . Dart . Clara Dart In the meantime you sound the other members , and secure enough votes to carry our point . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I will send the flood of my eloquence to carry with it conviction of our ultimate success . Dart . Clara Dart And if we can get within a dozen or so votes of a majority , we can get those by buying them . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Buy a Congressman 's vote ? No , sir ! P.T. , perish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters in a strictly practical light . Dart . Clara Dart Laughing Of course , of course . Well , I will leave that to you . By the way , I have purchased a place up the river , and my wife has invited some of her friends to a sort of housewarming and picnic . Will you make one of the party ? There will be several honorable gentlemen there whom you have met in political circles , and who may be of some service to us . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I accept with pleasure , my dear colonel . A good free lunch will go a long way toward opening a Congressman 's heart . Dart . Clara Dart Laughing That 's the idea exactly . One of the points of human nature  --  when you want a man to do you a favor , there 's nothing like giving him a good dinner first , eh , Slote ? Nudges him , exit into house , laughing Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Has money in his hand Ha ! There 's a man after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things coming my way ? Well , I should say so , by a large majority ! That reminds me , I have n't seen the K. of his M. , the color of his money , yet . The treasury department is running low , and I must vote a fresh supply . Puts money in pocket This is the best thing I have had since I was appointed chairman of the Buildings Committee . That Railroad Bill must go through . It shall go through , by a large majority . Takes money out and looks at it I have often caught a glimpse of the shadow , but never before had a squint at the substance . Laughter heard , off L. , in house They seem to be enjoying themselves in there . That 's what they call society ! I 'd like to have a contract to supply society with all the powder and paint it uses . It would beat a government contract , by a large majority . Mrs. Gilflory . Mrs. Gilflory Enters from house Libby , dear ! Libby , dear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L.U.E. Libby . Libby Ray Here I am , aunty . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Come here at once . I want you . Libby . Libby Ray O aunty , wo n't you allow me one more dance with Charley Brood ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory No , indeed . Libby . Libby Ray O aunty  --  just one more  --  please . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Not one  --  not a part of one . Lord Cairngorm is waiting to dance with you . Libby . Libby Ray Aside Oh , shucks ! Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Libby ! Enter Lord Cairngorm . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Offers arm May I have the pleasure ? Libby takes it . Charley , up C. , looks angry Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Tell me frankly , Lord Cairngorm , what do you think of the American women ? Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I think your American ladies are the prettiest in the world . By Jove , you are all beautiful . Really , it is wonderful for a new country , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only a hundred years ago you were all red savages ! Wonderful , by Jove . And you American ladies have such a go-ahead sort of way  --  so independent and self-reliant . By Jove , I believe an American woman fears nothing . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Quite sans peur . Excuse my French , Lord Cairngorm ; we lived abroad so long . Libby , dear ! Libby , dear ! Do n't do that  --  you annoy me . Libby is spatting with Charley Brood Excuse me , my lord . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Do n't call me my lord  --  it makes me feel as if I were out of place in a new country where there are no lords  --  call me colonel or major or judge . I would much rather you would call me plain judge . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , do n't be embarrassed on account of a title , for the upper classes in America are not so much opposed to hereditary titles as they might seem to be , and I dare say you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our national characteristics . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm But how about the dignified simplicity of personal equality ? I had always imagined that the glorious principles of Democracy were strongly opposed to the adoption of titles ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , dear , no  --  not so much as you might suppose . On the contrary , I assure you some of our very best families would not object to wearing titles , and forgetting the principles of equal birth . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Ah , yes  --  after all it is only the lower classes who claim the equality . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Has been near Yes , and title or no title , I consider myself just as good as anyone , lords included . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Carelessly No doubt  --  even a great deal better . Turns up L. One of the remarkable products of a new country . Exit , L.U.E. Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Looking after him He belongs to what they call the B.A. , the bloated aristocracy , of Europe . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little fun . They would n't do a thing with him  --  not a thing , by a large majority ! Goes to Mrs. Gilflory , down L. My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , you are not wearing your usual air of serenity . You seem vexed . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I am vexed , very much vexed about Libby dear . That girl gives me no end of trouble . Really I can not do anything with her . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I sympathize with you , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You are trs aimable . Excuse my French , wo n't you , judge  --  we lived abroad so long , you know . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Oh , oui , oui . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , you speak French , too , do you not ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Pas beaucoup . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory How delightful ! Really you speak it beautifully , trs bien . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Yes , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a beautiful language . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Oh , yes , it 's a great language . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory And so poetical compared to our plain English . Now when you see pommes de terre au natural on a bill of fare , who would think that it meant just common boiled potatoes ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote But they taste the same in any language . Libby and Charley Brood appear at R.U.E. , but seeing Mrs. Gilflory , they retreat Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Seeing them Libby , dear ! Libby , dear ! O judge , that girl gives me no end of trouble and anxiety . I can not make her obey me in anything , and she will persist in being unfashionable in spite of all I have done to make her a woman of ton . I took her all over Europe with us , and showed her the Coliseum at Naples , and the Bridge of Sighs at Berlin , and Mount Vesuvius in California . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote That ought to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilflory Yes , indeed , the late General G. was always liberal ; there was n't a stingy hair in his head . Pause He was completely bald . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote You must have traveled a great deal . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , yes , Europe and Asia , and nearly all over the world . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote When you were in Europe I suppose you visited the Dardanelles ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , yes , we dined with them quite often . Oh , yes , Libby dear had every advantage , and now I can see a chance for her to settle down and make a bon mariage . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Lord Cairngorm ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Yes  --  he admires her very much . He is rich , comes from an old family , and it would be a splendid match for her . Well , I have set my heart on it . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote She does n't seem to care very much for his lordlets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is so wilful and perverse , she is constantly running after young Charley Brood , to make a misalliance . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Come again ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory A misalliance , if she married young Brood . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote He 's a pretty good boy . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Of course , I know a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , but Lord Cairngorm is of a grand famille . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Aside Why the devil ca n't she speak straight United States ! Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory And that is why I am looking for her now . I have cherch everywhere . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Aside There she goes again . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I want to speak to her about Lord Cairngorm , entre nous . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , would you oblige me by speaking English ? My French is a little rusty . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , pardonnez-moi  --  excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make Libby dear a woman of ton , but she always has so many gaucheries . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Then why do n't you take the groceries away from her ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory That 's very good , judge  --  Pas mal . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Aside There she goes again . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory So I have just made up my mind that Libby dear must give Lord Cairngorm a chance , and I 'm going to do all I can to keep her away from Charley Brood . The idea of a girl like Libby dear throwing herself away on that young bte noire ! When I have given her such a splendid education ! She has always had the best of teachers and books , too  --  I bought her Macaulay 's Lies of Ancient Rome , and Mr. Dickens ' History of David Copperplate , and all those books , and we had the most expensive teachers for her music , and they taught her how to use the diagram of her throat , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to think that she should look no higher than that young monkey Charley Brood . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote He is a P.A. , a perfect ass , and I will tell him so . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I have done the best I could for Libby dear ; our famliy is one of the oldest in the country . Our ancestors came over in the Cauliflower , and it is no more than natural I should want to see her married to someone who has blue blood , and now that she has got such a splendid chance , I have set my heart on seeing her Lady Cairngorm . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote But is n't it rather hard on Libby ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory She will soon forget all about Charley Brood  --  he is only a boy , though he is as rich as Creosote . He has got eight hundred thousand dollars . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Aside Eight hundred thousand dollars !

Mrs. Gilflory Yes  --  that is Lord Cairngorm . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Lord Cleargone  --  and that is the man you want her to marry ? That fellow there ? Why , he 's all collar and cuffs  --  blue blood you call it ! It looks like green blood to me , and not Irish green either . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory He is not green by any means , but au contraire he is very observing ; besides he is very kindhearted , and quite a gentleman .

We excel all the rest of creation in everything , sir , either natural or artificial . We have the longest nights and the brightest days , the highest mountains and the biggest rivers , the tallest trees and the greenest grass , the busiest cities and the highest buildings , the shortest pedigrees and the longest purses . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory And the longest speeches . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote You are K.K. , quite correct , by a large majority . Dart . Clara Dart Now , my friends , that we are all here together , I hope you will thoroughly enjoy yourselves . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote We are having a T.T.T. , a tip top time . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm How royally you Americans manage your entertainments ! You are as lavish as princes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , and you know we rather pride ourselves in the Old Country on having learned the art of dining . Dart . Clara Dart It is the pleasure of entertaining one 's friends which compensates us for the hard work involved in our money-making lives . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm No wonder the American gentlemen are so popular in Europe . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You ought to see how they spend money in Paree . Dart . Clara Dart As it is such a lovely night , what do you say to a dance on the lawn by moonlight ? All . All Oh , yes  --  wo n't it be lovely , etc . Slote .

Libby Ray Yes , it does now , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some artists ' club ? Libby . Libby Ray No , you goose . It belongs to Colonel Dart  --  of course . He has just bought it from some old ruined family , and has had the rooms decorated and the whole place brushed up . Char . Charley Brood It looks as if it would n't take much to brush it down . Libby . Libby Ray Colonel Dart is giving a housewarming party , and is keeping open doors to all his friends . O Charley , how nice it must be to have a great big place like this and ask all your friends to come and have a jolly time ! Char . Charley Brood Absently Yes , awfully nice . Libby . Libby Ray Looking off R. and L. What a romantic place it is ! O Charley , see those nice trees down there . Would n't it be just lovely to go there and hide ? Char . Charley Brood Yes , lovely .

Libby Ray Angry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Aside Asking me if I think he can win her ! Char . Charley Brood Do n't say that , Libby . For if I win it means a diamond necklace for you . Libby . Libby Ray Aside With her money , I suppose ! To him Thank you , but I would rather not have one . Char . Charley Brood Oh , come now , Libby ! How can you be so indifferent ! By Jimminy , I ought to win . Kitty Bluestocking is a daisy . Libby . Libby Ray Oh , indeed ! Is she ? Char . Charley Brood Yes , and there 's a fortune on the event for me . Libby . Libby Ray Aside So she is rich , too ! I suppose that is why he prefers her to me . Oh , the wretch ! Char . Charley Brood Though I am half sorry I risked so much , because she has a bad temper . Libby . Libby Ray Spiteful I 'm glad of that . Char . Charley Brood What ? Glad ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Aside She ca n't be very ladylike . Char . Charley Brood But on the other hand she 's a kicker . Libby . Libby Ray A kicker ! Some horrid skirt-dancer , I suppose ? Char . Charley Brood And she bites . Libby . Libby Ray Aside Very charming ! Ugh ! I would like to bite her . Char . Charley Brood But she has such grand action ! Such a stepper ! Libby . Libby Ray Quite an attraction ! Char . Charley Brood Yes  --  but I am rather nervous . She is a little queer about the knees and I hear she pulled up lame yesterday . Libby . Libby Ray Oh , the creature ! Char . Charley Brood And she has a cough . Libby . Libby Ray I hope she will die . Char . Charley Brood Oh , do n't say that , Libby ! It makes me nervous to think of it . Libby . Libby Ray Then you must be very fond of her . Char .

I wish I could see her when she comes out this afternoon . Libby . Libby Ray Then why do n't you go to see her , if you are so anxious about her ? Char . Charley Brood I ca n't . It 's too far . Libby . Libby Ray I should n't think you would care how far it is if you want to see her so very much . Char . Charley Brood But there is n't time . She runs at three o'clock and it 's two now .

I wonder where the rest of the people are ? Char . Charley Brood I heard their voices down there by the river . They seemed to be having a jolly time of it . Libby . Libby Ray And where is my aunt ?

Charley Brood I mean , I do n't know . Libby . Libby Ray You do n't know ? Char . Charley Brood No . Nobody ever asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the proper thing for a girl to make love to a fellow once in a while ? Libby . Libby Ray Why do n't you try it instead of waiting for a girl to do it all ? Char . Charley Brood That 's what I have been thinking of . Libby . Libby Ray Well , why do n't you do it ? Why do n't you tell her what you 've been thinking . Char . Charley Brood But she might refuse me . Libby . Libby Ray Out of patience How are you going to know she would if you never give her a chance ? Char . Charley Brood But suppose she said " No " ? Libby . Libby Ray Eagerly Oh , but she would n't . Char . Charley Brood If I thought she would n't  --  Libby . Libby Ray Anxious Yes ? Char . Charley Brood If I thought that the girl I love loved me  --  I would  --  Pause Libby .

Libby . Libby Ray What would you do , Charley ? What would you do ? Char . Charley Brood I would tell her all about it . Libby . Libby Ray Then why do n't you , Charley ? Why do n't you ? Suppose it was me you were in love with , what would you say , Charley ? What would you say to me ? Char . Charley Brood Are you sure you would n't say " No " ? Libby .

Charley Brood Aside , Up R.C. I 'm an ass . Libby . Libby Ray Aside I thought it was coming then . But the silly fellow could n't say a word , and what 's more , I do n't believe he ever will unless I make him . Lord Cairngorm enters , L.U.E. Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Seeing her Ah , there she is now . A charming girl  --  really a charming girl , by Jove . A little wild and unconventional , but after all it is better than the polite little deceits of the more fashionable dames . What I like about her most is that she is the only one I have met so far who does not think more of me because I am a lord . Looks at her with glass Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , and unspoiled by the vanities of society . Goes to her Good afternoon , Miss Ray . Libby . Libby Ray Turning quickly O Lord Cairngorm ! You here again ? And you are one of the party , too ? I 'm awfully glad . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Oh , thanks , awfully . Kind of you to say so , do n't you know . Libby . I am sure you will enjoy an American picnic , and on such a lovely afternoon . You must confess , Lord Cairngorm , that our bright sunshine is preferable to the mists and fogs of your little Island . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I confess it willingly , Miss Ray  --  but pray do not call me Lord Cairngorm . It is so awfully formal and insular , do n't you know . Call me judge , or colonel , or something of that sort . Libby . Libby Ray Laughs Call you judge ? Or colonel ? Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Yes , so much more sociable and jolly  --  do n't you know , and besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , R. and L. , side by side , she seeming deeply interested , and Charley trying to attract her attention and call her away , pulling her dress from behind , she pushing him aside One feels so much more at ease when addressed familiarly as major , or even captain . Libby . Libby Ray You are a close observer . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I have always endeavored to be so , my dear Miss Ray , that I might adopt the peculiarities of expression which are so charmingly American . Libby . Libby Ray I am so glad you like us . Lord Cairngorm . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm Judge , if you please , or professor if you prefer it . Of course , there are many little differences of speech and thought which are noticed by a visitor from the older countries , and sometimes I feel afraid of making myself conspicuous by failing to adopt them . Libby . Libby Ray Oh , no . I am sure you do not . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm This is a young country , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many new ideas presented to a stranger , but I hope to assimilate the best of them by persevering in the study of typical characteristics . Libby . Libby Ray I think I shall have to call you professor . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm And I daresay I shall be able to drop into the American style sufficiently to perhaps pass for an American myself , and join the list of worshippers of the American girl . Libby . Libby Ray I am afraid we American girls have fewer admirers than our English cousins . Lord C. Lord Cairngorm I would not think the men would show such wretched taste as to feel no heartbeats for such charming girls . I would venture that you have your devotees by the dozen . Libby . Libby Ray I ? Oh , dear , no . No one ever becomes devoted to me  --  or if they do they never say anything about it . Spoken to Charley , spitefully Lord C. Lord Cairngorm If I might be included among your devoted slaves , there would be one whose admiration would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have often told you  --  ah ! Charley has been following them jealously , and as they reach R. and turn , they meet him , he putting his face close to theirs . Lord Cairngorm retreats , leaving sentence unfinished There is that extraordinary person again . I suppose he is another , though of remarkably well-developed nerve . Goes to Libby My dear Miss Ray , if I may have the pleasure of another half hour in your delightful society , I should propose a quiet stroll among the trees . Offers arm Libby . Libby Ray With pleasure . Takes his arm Char . Charley Brood Oh , yes , with pleasure . Starts up , L. , beside her , she pushes him aside ; she and Lord Cairngorm exeunt , L.U.E. , leaving Charley staring blankly after them Libby . Libby Ray In an aside when at L.U.E. There ! I hope that will make Charley find his tongue . Char . Charley Brood Alone How easily he did it ! Why ca n't I do it , too ? By Jove , I can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , L.U.E. And as for him , I can see his finish . Pantomime of hitting and kicking . He exits , L.U.E. Slote enters , R.U.E . and comes down Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote No one here ? That 's good . B.B. , bully boy , by a large majority . I knew I would be too late when I missed that B.B. , blamed boat . Missed the boat by one brief minute , and missed the fun by a large majority . Had to come by train , found I had left my deadhead ticket at home , and I 'm out 40 cents . The minions of a grinding monopoly demanded 40 cents ! Of me ! And they call this a free country . Looks himself over Well , I 'm in a pretty plight to come to a high-toned party . Dusts himself with handkerchief Dust on my shoes , dust on my coat , in fact , dust everywhere except in my pocket .

She is a charming woman ! When I see her I almost feel like breaking the record and taking a second plunge into the matrimonial tide . No , no , Slote , my boy  --  you ca n't do it ! You ca n't do it . The nation needs your services , by a large majority . But Mrs. General Gilflory might be a very useful friend . I might get her to do some lobbying for me when it would be most opportune , and I know she has some very influential friends in the House . If I can get a few more votes and put that Railroad Bill through , it will be ten thousand dollars in my pocket , and ten thousand dollars is a consideration not to be sneezed at in these hard times .

Bows to Pete , who bows in return When I gaze around me and behold the glories which are on every hand , my heart swells with pride of my native land . When I look up into the boundless expanse of azure sky with its uncounted stars  --  they do n't come out in the afternoon  --  when I gaze upon these magnificent trees with their mighty limbs bending before the balmy breezes , I feel that I am breathing the glorious air of freedom , the air of freedom which is the heritage left to us by our brave forefathers .

One of the boys kneels and Slote sits on his back Slote .

Stands on boxes , boy gets up and goes up , C. Never again shall the colored race be crushed to the earth . No , Mr. Chairman , and my colored brothers , as the sun rises to perform his journey through the heavenly vault , so shall you rise to carry out the new destiny of your race , and before I sit down I will simply remark  --  Goes to sit , falls Damnation , where the devil is that black rascal ?

Clara Dart I bought the place that we might have our little haven of rest together , as loving husband and wife , free from the bustle and turmoil of a busy city . Clara . Clara Dart It is more than I deserve . You have surrounded me with all the pleasures that wealth can bring . Who could not be happy with such a noble , generous husband ? Dart .

Clara Dart She said she would bring him back with her . It must not be ! I can not meet him here . I can not trust myself , and a look would betray me . What shall I do ?

You know Libby dear ? Yes  --  of course you do , everyone knows Libby dear . I have quite lost track of her , and I 'm dreadfully worried about her . You have n't seen anything of her , have you ? Clara . Clara Dart No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine where she has gone to . Looks off , L.U.E. Well ! As I live , if she is n't down there by the river and with that abominable little Charley Brood , and flirting with him just as hard as she can , and in spite of all I have said to her . Flirting with an empty-headed garsong like that , with a big cauliflower stuck in his buttonhole . After all I have tried to teach her about ton and clat . Calls Libby ! Libby ! Libby , dear ! Each time louder , waving handkerchief Clara . C lara Dart Aside She has a kind heart in spite of her eccentricities . Shall I confide in her and ask her to help me ? I will . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Calling Libby , dear ! Come here this instant . Clara . Clara Dart I beg your pardon , Mrs. General Gilflory . Mrs. Gilflory does not hear Mrs. Gilflory . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory There ! If she has n't turned round and deliberately gone the other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I might shout myself hoarse for all the young minx would care  --  I declare it is enough to drive one into hysterics . What 's the good of trying to make her have some ton if she wastes all the advantages of her foreign education on a young scamp like that Charley Brood . Turns to Clara , who has been trying to get a word in Oh , excuse me , Mrs. Dart , were you speaking to me ? Clara . Clara Dart I should like to , at your convenience . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Going to her Why , of course , my dear Mrs. Colonel Dart . I am ready  --  votrey service , as we say in French . Clara . Clara Dart I am in great distress , and in need of a friend . Would you be very angry if I were to ask you to help me ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Why , certainly . I mean , of course I would n't . Now tell me what it is . Clara . Clara Dart May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great favor ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Going to pocket With all my heart , my dear . How much would you like to have ? Clara . Clara Dart Smiling sadly Thank you  --  but it is not money that I want . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Not money ? Then what can I do ? Clara . Clara Dart I want you to prevent a gentleman from coming here this afternoon , whose presence would bring great pain to the hearts of two women if they should meet face to face . You can understand , I am sure your woman 's heart will guide you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Nods knowingly Yes , my dear , I understand , and you can depend on me to help you , too . Oh , dear , I do love anything that has any romance in it , and this reminds me of a play that I saw when we were abroad , at the Theatre Franaise in Dublin . I can see it now : there were two romantic lovers , and they met in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a long loving kiss , and a blustering blizzard came and blew them far away across the bounding billow , and they came to this country and were married , and lived happily ever after . Clara . Clara Dart If I tell you the circumstances you will see the danger . A very dear friend of mine named Blanche Thurston is in love with a Mr. Vance . Vance , who is also a  --  who was a friend of mine before my marriage to Colonel Dart  --  . Blanche is coming here this afternoon , and is going to bring Mr. Vance with her . Ca n't you see how much pain it will cause me if we should meet ? Go and meet him , detain him . Do not let him come till I am about to leave our guests and retire to my room . Detain him anyhow or anywhere , your woman 's wit will supply an excuse  --  only do not let us meet , I beg of you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory All right , my dear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Clara . Clara Dart You will do this for me ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You can make your mind perfectly easy on that score . I will find some excuse for meeting your betey noir , and I 'll take care of him . Clara . Clara Dart Oh , thank you , thank you from the bottom of my heart  --  you will not fail ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory My dear Mrs. Colonel Dart , when two women put their heads together , and one of them is Mrs. General Gilflory , there is no such word as fail . Clara . Clara Dart You have taken a load from my heart , and I shall be very grateful . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Not another word  --  now you go to your room and brighten yourself up a bit , and I 'll go and head off the unwelcome young man . Clara . Clara Dart Going into house , aside The blow is averted , but it must fall . Exit into house Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Sitting down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these women , too . Now let me think of all that I have got to do . Half a dozen important things on my mind  --  I declare , I am getting mixed up already . First of all , there is a young man coming here that Mrs. Dart does n't want to come . That 's all right , as plain as day . Mrs. Dart was in love with a young man before she was Mrs. Dart , and the young man was in love with Mrs. Dart and somebody else who was n't Mrs. Dart  --  no that ca n't be the way . Now Mrs. Dart was in love with a young man before she was Mrs. Dart and the young man was in love with Mrs. Dart when he ought to have been in love with Mr. Dart before he married Mrs. Dart . Oh , dear  --  that 's worse and worse . I must try it a little slower . Now Mrs. Dart is in love with a young man who is n't Mr. Dart before she became Mrs. Dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it out . No , that is n't right , there are two women mixed up in it somehow . Now Mrs. Dart was in love with a young man before she became Mrs. Dart who is not Mr. Dart but who ought to have been Mr. Dart , and the young man is in love with a young woman who is not Mrs. Dart , and Mrs. Dart wants me to keep the young man from meeting Mr. Dart  --  oh , well , that 's near enough . Oh , dear , dear , my head is going round and round like a whirligig with all this young man and Mrs. Dart scramble . Shades of the late General G. , look down upon me and help me to get the tangle straightened out ! But there is one thing sure , I 've got to prevent that young man from coming here this afternoon and meeting Mrs. Dart now that she has married Mr. Dart . Why will people persist in getting themselves into such ridiculous muddles ? Now I never had any trouble with the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a wooden leg , which he earned in the service of his country as quartermaster in the army , and when I went out I always kept that leg locked up . Consequently we were always happy , and when at last he died as a brave warrior should die , peacefully and at home in bed , he left me his blessing and his fortune . It was lucky that he was able to get himself appointed quartermaster in the army , for if he had n't he would have left me his blessing without the fortune . Ah ! He was a noble soul , full of military ardor , and he served his country well , and he had sense enough to see that his country rewarded him well for it . Rises Now I must see if I can find the young man who is to be headed off . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Enters , R.U.E. Oh , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , all alone admiring the transcendent beauties of nature ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Yes , Judge Slote. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will excuse my French , wo n't you ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Certainly , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory . I have been looking for you everywhere . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Looking for me , judge ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Searching earnestly , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory . I wanted to see you on a subject of some importance . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You do me honor , Judge Slote . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote On the contrary , my dear madam , the honor is mine , and the pleasure , too , as I have found you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You are trying to flatter me , judge , but what can I do for you ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , if I may be permitted to address you by such an endearing term , dear Mrs. General Gilflory , I want to ask you to do me a great favor . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , dear , what great demand I am in today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to do a favor . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote It is because your magnanimous nature is so well known , and your kindness of heart is universally acknowledged , and that is why I have sought your assistance . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I will do anything I can , judge , you may be sure . It is always a pleasure to serve an old friend . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , you are generosity itself . I will annoy you with as few details as possible . There is a bill which is about to pass through the House , and I want to enlist your aid in getting it through . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Down L. Good gracious , you do n't want me to go to Congress , do you ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote No , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory . I do not want you to go to Congress , not by a large majority . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Then how can I help you ? Slote . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Send my what ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , Congress is composed of grindstones , and men who have axes to grind , and almost invariably the grinders and axes exceed the grindstones . Some enthusiastic writer has declared that an honest man is the noblest work of creation , but sometimes the noblest work is out of luck , probably because he is an honest man . Does the chair follow me ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Sitting down , L. I do n't say that she does to any great extent . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Then I will speak more plainly and to the point . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Yes , for goodness ' sake do . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Well , then , we are going to get a railroad through the House . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Wo n't it hurt the House ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote If it hits the House hard enough it will hurt some part of it . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it for instance , will be greatly benefited . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory The chair is beginning to follow . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Now , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , I know you have many influential friends in Congress , and if I can only have your assistance our success will be assured , and I shall be your debtor for life , by a large majority . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Then in plain English , you want me to lie for you ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Diplomatize , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , diplomatize . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh ! Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Lying is a different matter altogether . A man who tells lies , even though they may be for the general good of the community , is a liar , and can never be considered a gentleman , but the man who diplomatizes in his own interest is a  --  Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Liar ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote A diplomat . Nobody would call him a liar . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Now my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , if you will be good enough to use your influence in the direction of diplomacy , you will make me your E.D. , everlasting debtor . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I am the soul of good nature , judge , tell me how I can be useful . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote In our Railroad Bill there is a division of interests as to which way the road shall be laid out . Now we want it to go through Chalkville , the others want it to go through Muggins Glen . If we can carry our point and send the road through Chalkville , my fortune is made ; you shall have some shares in the enterprise , and I shall be your H.S. , your humble servant , for life . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You say you want it to go through Chalkville ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Chalkville , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , Chalkville , by a large majority . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Then Chalkville it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can depend on you ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You can . There 's old Major Wilson from Tennessee , and the bald-headed Congressman from Chicago , and half a dozen others that are friends of mine , and I know they will do anything I ask them  --  there 's a dozen votes that I know of now . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote And we need only fourteen . My dear Mrs. General Gilflory , when the proud bird of freedom soars aloft on pinions of victory to its everlasting home , and the nation is aglow with excitement , then in the highest niches of the temple of fame shall blaze in letters of fire the initials of Mrs. General Gilflory , O.B.I. , our beauteous idol . Kisses her hand Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Shades of the late General G. , look down upon me and lend me some of your military enthusiasm ! Chalkville versus Muggins Glen , up with Chalkville and down with Muggins . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Chalkville down the Glen , by a large majority , hooray ! Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slote I can depend upon you ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory You can , for all I can do . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote I knew you would not refuse my ardent prayer . You are my G.A. , my guardian angel . And now that my mission has been crowned with your consent , I will hurry with the good news to my waiting friends and tell them of our C.C. , certain success . Going toward L.U.E. I will not say good-bye , my dear Mrs. General Gilflory , but as we say in French , O.R. , o-revoir  --  over the river . Kisses hand to her and exit , L.U.E. Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Dear me , what great demand I am in today ! That is the penalty of being popular . I wonder where my protege pretty jay is ? Starts up L. but stops No , no  --  first I must go and meet the young man who ought to have been Mr. Dart , and prevent him from coming here and meeting Mrs. Dart . What a lovely romantic affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance in it . That makes me think of Libby dear and young Charley Brood again . Starts L. , then R. , and wavers Oh , dear . Between Mrs. Dart 's young man and Libby 's young Brood , and Mr. Slote . and Chalkville and Muggins Glen , my brain is positively pulverizing . Libby enters , L.U.E. , in condition of untidiness . Tries to retreat but Mrs. Gilflory sees her Libby ! Come back here . Libby , dear . Libby meets her , C. Good gracious , what a condition for a girl with ton to be in ! Your hair looks as if you had been dragged through a brush heap  --  what on earth have you been doing ? Libby . Libby Ray Demurely I have only been playing marbles with Charley Brood . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory What ? On your head ? Libby . Libby Ray Of course not  --  we were playing on the grass . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Playing marbles with Charley Brood ! Nice intelligent occupation for a man and a full-grown girl . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air when you have such disgustingly red cheeks ! How often have I told you that red cheeks and sparkling eyes are positively vulgar this year . You ought to look pale and languid and interesting . I am surprised that you should allow yourself to become so healthy and robust . Libby . Libby Ray You look pretty robust yourself , aunty . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Never mind about me ; we widows have no such restrictions placed around us as the social buds have . Libby . Libby Ray But aunty , dear , I want to tell you what happened just now . Oh aunty  --  it 's such news . I could hardly wait till I had a chance to tell you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Good gracious child  --  what was it ? Has anything happened to that Charley Brood ?

Libby Ray To which of course I answered " No . " Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Astounded Libby  --  you said " No "  --  you refused to marry Lord Cairngorm ! Libby . Libby Ray Of course I did . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory What for ? Libby . Libby Ray Because I do n't love him . And I asked him as a great favor never to mention the subject to me again . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory O Libby  --  what have you done ? And I had hoped and planned for him to propose . Libby  --  do you want to break my heart ? Libby . Libby Ray No , aunty , dear  --  but I did n't want you to break mine . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid husband .

Libby Ray No . He had n't got the courage , so I proposed to him . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Sarcastic Oh , indeed ! Quite a creditable performance . He had n't the courage , so she proposed to him !

Blanche Thurston Dear Clara , I am so unhappy when I think of my selfish vanity and the pain it has caused you . When I told you of my happiness you rejoiced with me , and in the pride of my heart I gave no thought of the ache that might be in yours , and when you and Roland met face to face and the shock was too great for you to bear , I knew then for the first time that you were not strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your lives than a mere society acquaintance . It is but natural that I should wish to know more , and I have questioned Roland , but can learn nothing from him , so I have come to ask you to relieve my anxiety . Clara . Clara Dart Blanche , dear , why will you insist on worrying yourself over insignificant trifles which have probably passed out of Mr. Vance 's memory long ago ? Blan . Blanche Thurston No , no , Clara . It was no trifle which chilled your heart at the sight of one man , nor have they passed out of his memory . I can not help worrying , for he is so changed since that afternoon ; he is not the same these last few days , and I am sure there is some secret , some mystery which is clouding all our hearts , so I have come to you , as I always did in the past , for your advice and sympathy . Clara . Clara Dart What cloud can there be upon your heart , my dear child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you not engaged to Mr. Vance ? Blan . Blanche Thurston Yes , but may he not have loved you once ? And may you not have loved him ? Clara . Clara Dart Blanche  --  Blanche  --  Libby enters , L.2.E. , with card , which she takes to Clara Libby . Libby Ray O Clara , dear  --  a friend of yours has just called to see you . Shall I show him up ? Clara . Clara Dart Looking at card Roland Vance ! To Libby No , no ! Blan . Blanche Thurston I will go . Clara . Clara Dart Remain here . Libby . Libby Ray Goes to L.2.E . O Clara  --  Mr. Vance is up here now . Clara . Clara Dart Detain him a moment , on any pretext  --  detain him till I send you word . Libby . Libby Ray All right  --  I 'll talk to him for you . Exit Blan .

Mr. Vance is nothing more to me than any other caller , I assure you ; there is nothing between us , nothing . Blan . Blanche Thurston Then there can be no harm in your receiving Roland in the presence of his affianced wife . Clara . Clara Dart Blanche ! Why will you insist on seeking to revive a dead and uninteresting past ? My dear child , you must not let every little doubt or question worry you , if you would spend a life of happiness . Blan . Blanche Thurston It is those very doubts which would make my life miserable . If he has loved you once , has he ceased to care for you , and if you have loved him , may you not love him still ? Clara . Clara Dart O Blanche , Blanche  --  why do you torture the hearts that love you ! Pause Oh , well , the mystery must be cleared up sometime , perhaps it were better now than if doubt should become suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may overhear what passes . Clara . Clara Dart What ? You  --  Blanche Thurston , whom I have always thought the soul of honor , you ask as a favor permission to become a spy ? an eavesdropper ? You who have always been so frank and openhearted ? Blan . Blanche Thurston I am a woman , and above all a woman who loves with all her soul , and I must learn at any cost whether the man I love is unworthy . Clara . Clara Dart You will not be satisfied when I tell you that he is in every way worthy of a good woman 's love . But you shall do as you wish , but remember , if evil comes of it , it was of your own seeking . Blan . Blanche Thurston I will accept the consequences ; let the cost be mine , but there must be no word of warning  --  no glance or sign to put him on his guard . Clara .

Roland Vance Mrs. Dart . Clara . Clara Dart Good morning , Mr. Vance . Vance . Roland Vance I should have called upon you some time ago to inquire after your health , but was suddenly called away from Washington and only returned last night . Clara . Clara Dart You are very kind  --  will you be seated ? Vance . Roland Vance Thank you , it will hardly be worth while . I shall not detain you long . Clara . Clara Dart To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit ? Some business , I presume ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon you to ask , to beg , that you will not tell Blanche anything of the past in our lives . I love Blanche Thurston , and if for one moment I have wavered in an unswerving loyalty to her pure and unselfish devotion , it was because the fascination of your society has bridged over the past few years and revived the scenes which made me forget that you had ever caused me to suffer . It is all over now , the past is dead . What joy and sorrows there were are only a memory ; and to save a trusting , unsuspecting heart from such a sorrow I now ask you to keep our secret . Clara . Clara Dart Never fear . The past is dead  --  I shall say nothing of it to anyone . I promise to keep our secret . Vance . Roland Vance Thank you . I am grateful for the assurance . Clara . Clara Dart If you have nothing more to add , I presume we may consider this interview at an end . Speaks choking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankness , Mrs. Dart , and hasten to withdraw . I had hoped to meet Col. Dart here to demand an explanation , but will call upon him some other time . Clara . Clara Dart Colonel Dart will be happy to receive your call . Vance takes his hat Permit me to congratulate you on securing the love of such a woman as I know Blanche to be . May you be very happy together . Vance . Roland Vance Thank you . It shall be the earnest hope of my life to become in every way worthy of her deep and true love . Clara has back turned to him Do not let us part as enemies . Goes to her Clara . Clara Dart No  --  not enemies  --  only strangers . Bows , exit , R.2.E . Vance . Roland Vance Crushed She despises me ! She despises me . Oh , well  --  so be it . It is better so  --  better so .

Roland Vance You were concealed there  --  behind that screen ! You have played the spy . And she was a party to it . Nay , it was her plot  --  she sought to ruin me and she has accomplished it . Blan . Blanche Thurston No , Roland  --  it was all my fault , it was my doing . Vance . Roland Vance Yours ? You in whom there was never a thought of deceit ? Blan . Blanche Thurston Roland , dear  --  do not blame her . If evil came of it , it was of my own seeking , but the suspense was gnawing at my heart . I loved you so much , dear and I was afraid . Vance . Roland Vance Afraid ? Blan . Blanche Thurston O Roland , you do not know what suspense means to a loving woman 's heart . But let us forget the past that is dead . Let us leave this house with its luxury and wretchedness . Come , dear Roland , I will never question you , never reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that you have no trust in me . You , on whose faith I would have staked my life ! O Blanche , you are cruel  --  unjust . Blanche . Blanche Thurston And you reproach me with want of faith , you whom I loved and trusted  --  Heaven knows how I trusted you  --  you reproach me because , feared the mystery that linked your life with hers ? You were hiding it from me  --  a secret that was yours and hers-you were trying to hide from me that I was not your first love , but that you had once loved my dearest friend . I trusted you and you deceived me . I can not trust you again . Farewell , Roland , a woman 's heart can only love where it can trust  --  farewell . Exit , L.2.E . Vance . Roland Vance Sadly I will not call her back . She would only despise me the more . I will leave this place at once . Why did I ever enter it ? It is accursed , this abode of gilded misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dart O Vance  --  not going , are you ? Vance . Roland Vance Yes  --  just going . Dart . Clara Dart Can you spare a few moments ? I have been seeking you , and am lucky to find you where we can have a word or two in comfort . Motions him to sit Vance . Roland Vance Sits , L. I am at your service , Colonel Dart . Dart . Clara Dart I hear you have a few hundred acres of land in Muggins Glen which has very little prospect of ever commanding more than a nominal price . Vance . Roland Vance Yes  --  twelve hundred acres  --  a bequest from my father . Dart . Clara Dart Now you know I am always in some political speculation or other , and I want a few acres of clear land in that neighborhood . Would you be willing to part with it ? Vance . Roland Vance Amused and surprised Willing to part with it ? My dear sir , are you in earnest ? Dart . Clara Dart Certainly  --  or I should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  I only wished to warn you of the nature of the land , for fear you might repent of your bargain afterward . The land is clear out of the world  --  a wilderness of rocks and sand , and I did n't want to take an unfair advantage of you by selling to one who evidently knew nothing regarding its actual value . Dart . Clara Dart What does that matter to you as long as I can make it answer my purpose , and am willing to pay a good price for it ? Vance . Roland Vance Oh , nothing , of course , except that I do n't want to take you in with your eyes closed . Dart . Clara Dart Oh , that is my risk , of course ; you newspaper men have really no idea of the risks involved in speculation . Now what do you consider a fair price for the tract as it stands , or to be more practical , what will you take for it ? Vance . Roland Vance Well , the whole twelve hundred acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its full value . Dart . Clara Dart It is taxed at twelve hundred dollars . I will give you fifteen hundred dollars for it  --  what do you say ? Vance . Roland Vance Aside Fifteen hundred dollars ! Elated With that sum I could leave this place and find a new and nobler field for my pen and brain . To Dart I will accept your offer . Dart . Clara Dart Very well . I will write my check for the amount at once and you can give me your receipt . Vance . Roland Vance Certainly . Goes up , C. , while Dart sits at desk and writes , then Vance sits at desk and writes Dart . Clara Dart Aside while Vance writes If the railroad goes that way I shall have paid fifteen hundred dollars for fifty thousand . Vance rises Here is my check , Mr. Vance , fifteen hundred dollars .

I almost feel as if I had the pleasure of knowing you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory I 'm glad of that , because you are just the gentleman I want to see . Vance . Roland Vance You flatter me .

I have heard so often how kind Mr. Vance is , and I am sure you have great influence among the members of Congress . Now there is a Railroad Bill coming before the House , and I want some assistance from you in getting it passed . Vance . Roland Vance Well , that depends upon who are the promoters of the railroad , and who is behind the bill . Mrs. Gil .

Roland Vance Aroused Muggins Glen , do you say ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Yes . Colonel Dart and his party want it to go through Muggins Glen , but Judge Slote and all the rest of us are in favor of Chalkville . Vance .

But it 's just like the world  --  willing enough to ask for favors , but when anyone asks a friend for a favor in return , the friend takes himself off in a raging passion . But hold on  --  am I right ? I wonder if I had it right , or have I got it twisted around . Was it Chalkville that Judge Slote wanted , or Muggins Glen ? Let me see  --  yes  --  surely Judge Slote said Chalkville  --  of course he did . Yes , it was Chalkville  --  I remember distinctly . Now , I 'm positive it was Chalkville . Slote .

They say we shall be too strong for any opposition , and the road will be sure to go through Chalkville . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote In horror Chalkville ! Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Oh , yes  --  I worked hard for two whole days , and got at least a dozen votes , and Chalkville will win . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Chalkville ? Murder ! G.I.C.

Retract what you have said under a mistaken impression , and secure the votes for Muggins Glen before it is too late , and I will be your E.F. , your everlasting friend . If you succeed , the bill will go through swimmingly and we shall be A.H. , all hunky . We only need those twelve votes , and they are in your hands . Mrs. Gil .

Clara Dart Do n't let that worry you , little woman . He wo n't try to make any trouble for his own sake  --  because no man wants to tell the world that he has been bribed .

Clara Dart Oh , no , this is not a romantic letter . It is quite a plain business one . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory A business letter  --  good gracious , I hope it is nothing about railroads , or Chalkville or Muggins Glen . I have just got my brain out of the muddle it was in about those dreadful votes , and I do n't want another attack . Clara . Clara Dart Oh , no , there is nothing about railroads in it .

Clara Dart I shall never be able to repay you . Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Do n't say a word about paying . A woman who would not stand by another in a case like this is not worthy of the name of woman , especially when it is all so romantic . Clara . Clara Dart I am so anxious  --  my heart is so full of dread ! Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory My dear Mrs. Dart , make your mind perfectly easy  --  remember I am your friend , and Mrs. General Gilflory was never known to fail  --  never , never , never . Clara .

I never had so much excitement crowded into a week before , not even in all my travels through Europe , except that time when I got lost in the kittycombs in Berlin , or was it Constantinople ? No , it was the Walhalla Hall we saw in Berlin , and the dried-up mummies in Constantinople , so it must have been Naples where the kittycombs were . Oh , they were just lovely  --  and so was the Dodges Palace in Rome and the Tragedians Arch in Venice , and the Campanilly at Nice . But those mummies just made the cold chills run all up and down my back . Libby enters , L.2.E. , running , with two tickets Libby . Libby Ray O aunty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gil .

Putting on hat and wrap But suppose I should be arrested for burglary or highway robbery or something ?

Oh , well , I suppose we ca n't expect to have our own way always  --  and Aunty Gilflory is determined not to let me have mine  --  but I mean to have my way , and to have Charley Brood , too . It would have been all settled long ago if he had only had the courage to propose to me . I 've made up my mind that if he does n't propose to me I 'm going to propose to him  --  somebody 's got to do it , sure , and it 's no use being so very goody-goody about a little thing like that , especially when I know he would do it himself if he could muster up the courage .

Coyly Cupid is about to kiss her . Char . Charley Brood I suppose that is the reason she has the expression on her face ? Libby . Libby Ray I suppose so .

Judge Bardwell Slote No , sir . He ca n't explain it . The Dart is not sharp enough , there 's no explaining to it  --  this letter explains itself . Vance . Roland Vance But what has he done to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? He has done everything , sir . Everything , sir . Does he think he can treat me like a peanut ?

Clara . Clara Dart But if I were to give you an explanation ? Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote Interrupts If you were to explain it , madam , it would be T.T. , too thin . This letter explains itself . It is an insult  --  a stab in the dark . Vance . Roland Vance But we could understand the matter more thoroughly if we knew what your complaint is all about . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote My complaint , sir ! It is my R.I. , sir , my righteous indignation ! To think that such words should be addressed to me ! Vance .

Dear Sir : In view of the serious and annoying misunderstandings which seem to be caused by our joint management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispense with your assistance and endeavor to conduct all my affairs unaided . Respectfully , Alfred Dart ! " To Slote All I can see is that Mr. Dart declines to associate himself with you in any further business , that 's all . Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote And is n't that enough ! The ungrateful wretch ! After all I have done for him ! Vance turns letter over , sees writing and reads it , wonderingly Vance . Ro land Vance " Roland , come to me at once . " Slote snatches letter Slote . Judge Bardwell Slote After I have been going about bribing honest people , and making them believe it was all legitimate business ? After all the talking and lying that I have done for him ! Cast me off ! Throw me aside ! Kick me out . It 's B.I. , base ingratitude , that 's what it is . Vance . Roland Vance I ca n't see why you want to make such a fuss about a trifle like that . Clara .

Clara Dart Severe Mr. Vance , I am surprised to see you here after the hostile sentiments expressed so freely on our last meeting . Vance . Roland Vance In view of my intended departure for the West , I have made my just resentment subservient to my sense of duty . Mr. Dart , I have called to defend the good name of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues . Dart . Clara Dart Interrupts My wife 's good name needs no defender , and if it ever should , there is only one man who has the right to champion her cause , and that man is her husband , who will be here to do it .

To him She did write them , but not for herself  --  she wrote them for me . Dart . Clara Dart For you ? Mrs. Gil . Mrs. Gilflory Yes . You see , I wanted to go to the President 's Ball , but I had no one to go with , so I thought I would ask Mr. Vance to take me , but I was so very busy I had n't got time to write to him , so I asked Mrs. Dart to please write a few lines for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and so on , and that 's what she wrote , only she signed her own name to it instead of mine . Winking and nodding to Vance Was n't that it , Mr. Vance ? Vance . Roland Vance Certainly . Clara . Clara Dart Aside Saved ! Dart . Clara Dart Goes to her , down C. Clara !
