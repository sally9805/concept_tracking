txt The Assembly held a brief session to-night and adjourned out of respect to the late Robert H. Pruyn , who at one time occupied the Speaker 's Chair in the House . Among the bills introduced was one by Mr. Sheridan , of Kings , giving the Commissioners of Police and Excise of Brooklyn absolute control over all steam boilers in that city ; by Mr. Van Allen , of New-York , prohibiting the sale of theatre tickets to all children under 14 years of age ; by Mr. Browne , of Otsego , abolishing the Board of Canal Appraisers and the office of Canal Auditor , and creating in their places a Court or Claims ; by Mr. Morrison , of New-York , amending section 779 of the Code , so as to include and cover the costs awarded by an appellate court on appeal from an order , the effect of the amendment , it is claimed , being to prevent many frivolous appeals ; by Mr. Murphy , of New-York , abolishing the threebed clause in the present Excise law , and prohibiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant . This last bill goes to the special committee of New-York and Brooklyn members , which has already under consideration nearly a score of Excise bills . The committee will give a public hearing to the counsel of the liquordealers on Thursday next . CoL Murphy- also introduced a pension bill for the benefit of disabled and worn-out members of the New-York Police force . It provides that the Police Commissioners shall act as Trustees of the fund and shall have power , under certain restrictions , to disburse it . The fund is to be created from the fines imposed upon delinquent members of the force , from lost , unclaimed , or stolen money- for which no claimants have appeared , from the moneys derived from the sale of unclaimed goods , from an assessment of not less than $3 nor more than $4 a month to be levied upon members of the force , and from all rewards which may be secured by policemen , except in cases where the Police Commissioners may permit the policemen to retain this gratuity . Members who have served 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension not exceeding onebalf nor less than one-fourth of their full salary , providing the sum does not exceed $1,000 . The amount of pension allowed widows and orphans of deceased policemen is fixed at $300 . A bill offered by Mr. Robb , Chairman of Committee on Banks , is the outcome of the labors of the commission appointed to modify the banking laws . By its terms certain laws which have practically become obsolete are repealed , and by its chief provision the Bank Superintendent is authorized to investigate the affairs of any bank whenever he deems proper , instead of conducting such examinations at stated periods . The bill makes it the duty of the Superintendent , in his discretion , to examine personally books , papers , and affairs of any bank , banking association , individual banker , or corporation , or designate some competent person to make such examination . The latter shall report , under oath , to the Superintendent , and such report shall be published . Authority is given to examine on oath any individual banker and the officers , agents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , agents , and clerks of any such bank , banking association , or corporation touching matters to be inquired into . On such examination willful false swearing shall be perjury . No person shall be appointed Receiver of any association or corporation whose books , papers , &c.,; shall have been examined pursuant to the provisions of the act . Section 125 is so amended as to provide that whenever default shall be made in the payment of any debt , the stockholders shall be individually responsible , equally and ratably , to the extent of their respective shares of stock . No person not subject to the supervision of the Superintendent of the Banking Department shall use any sign for the purpose of indicating that such place or office is that of a bank or banking association . Among the petitions offered the House is one from a number of residents of Ithaca , earnestly remonstrating against the passage of a bill now before the Legislature incorporating that village as a city . The bill itself is likely to meet with vigorous opposition . In response to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shepherd F. Knapp since the date of his appointment as Receiver of the Bowling Green Savings Bank , in New-York , that gentleman presented a report . This question of Receiverships is likely to attract much attention from this Legislature , and some of the abuses of the system can hardly fail to be made public bya resolution offered by Mr. Hunt . of Jefferson , which went over for debate . The Insurance Committee is directed to make an investigation of the affairs of the following insolvent companies which have gone into the hands of Receivers : Continental , North American , Guardian , Security , Atlantic Mutual , Globe , Eclectic , Widows and Orphans ' , Reserve Mutual , and New-York State Life . The object of the investigation is to find out what time the Receivers have already occupied in the discharge of their duties , and what their expenses have been in closing up these several companies ' affairs . The ordering of bills to a third reading by unanimous consent has become so common a thing in the Assembly , the mistakes that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege being abused are so great that the Speaker felt called upon to-night to direct attention to these facts , and to declare that in future he should himself object unless it could be clearly shown that the case was one of most pressing necessity , and one in which no injury was liable to be done to the public weal . Already a number of bills which were thus hastily rushed through have had to be recalled either from the Senate or the Governor in order to correct the mistakes which they contained . There was a very full attendance of Senators at the session this evening . The Assembly bill appropriating $40,000 to the Emigrant Commission was passed . Among the new bills introduced was one by Mr. R. A. Nelson for amending and consolidating the laws relating to the organization of manufacturing and mining companies , and another by the same Senator for the abolition of the Canal Board and the substitution therefor of a . Commission to hear and determine all claims against the State . Senator Jones offered a resolution for the appointment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolvent corporations . Some discussion occurred as to the number of the committee , and whether it should be a special committee or whether the investigation should be con ' cted by a standing committee . All agreed that an investigation was necessary , and the resolution was finally made a special order for tomorrow . It is reported that the name of Isaac V. Baker , ex-Senator of Washington County , will be sent into the Senate this week for Superintendent of State Prisons , in place of Lewis D. Pilsbury . The complaint recently made by a discharged employe of Sing Sing Prison are alleged to have been instigated by persons who desire a change in the management of the prisons which shall make them more subservient to the aims of politicians . It is believed that the three Tammany Senators will vote to confirm all the Governor 's nominees as a part of the alleged " bargain , " but it is very doubtful whether all the Republican Senators will consent to the displacement of Mr. Pilsbury without some better reasons than have yet been assigned .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
