IT is always good to get back here , gentlemen . The privilege of coming occasionally and being one of yon is really among the important advantages of a Yale education . Yet I * The following paper by MR . HENRY HOLT , of New York City , is substantially the lecture which , by request , he delivered at Yale University in March , 1887 , as one of a series of lectures before the Yale Political Science Club . At that time , Mr. Holt consented to furnish it for publication in this Review ; and also consented to refrain from eliminating some passages which he had inserted in the freedom of colloquial address to an audience that he knew would be composed , to a large extent , of friends , but which he said might be considered to be of too personal a character if presented to the public without explanation . It should perhaps be added that the necessity of sending the proofs to Europe has delayed the publication of the Article , and that Mr. Holt 's continued absence from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing state of the discussion of the important subject of an International Copyright. - ED . NEW ENGLANDER AND YALE REVIEW . // feel that this time I come under circumstances which call for something very like a word of apology . When this course of lectures was planned , it was intendedor at least I so understood  --  to present to the students some of the practical experience of those who had once , like themselves , been here for theoretical education . So understanding , I readily consented to come . But as the plan developed , circumstances seemed , not unnaturally , to modify it a good deal , and when I saw the course formally announced as primarily for graduates , under the auspices of the Department of Political Science , and that it was to be opened by a really scientific lecture from one of the very first of Political Economists , and that he was to be followed by a specialist of great authority , I felt that you were to come here to-night with the expectation of receiving really profound instruction , and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with honest intentions at least ; and I am consoled with the thought that your field of Political Science is so broad as to touch one side of every human activity , and with the realization that I shall probably be dull enough to lead some of you who do not follow me closely to suspect that I may be profound . I was very deliberate in saying that I should talk to you of some of the a8yects of the literary life . I mean some of the things apparent to an outsider . I am not in the literary life , but am sim*ply an observer of it with , perhaps , exceptional opportunities . Nevertheless , as a mere observer , I shall , before I get through , have something to say of a few political and economical facts that are of the first importance to American literature . But first I want to tell you some things which I wish somebody had told me when I was in college , but which I have had to learn in the tardy school of experience . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps all of the younger of you expect to have . When you consider the dozens of young men-would it be too much to say the hundreds ? - who leave American colleges every year with the same hope of making some figure in literature , and then realize that in every generation of Americans there are hardly a score // who do , you must realize how difficult the task is , and what care and work success demands . Here of course you ask : " Can care and work do it ? Must it not be born in a man ? " Care and work can not do as much as most stupid men think they can ; but they can do a great deal more than most bright men think they can . Regarding one of the first dozen American literary men of our timea man who succeeded respectably in poetry , fiction , and narrative , and whose name is known to every habitual reader in the civilized world-his long-headed publisher once said to me : " That man 's neatness , punctuality , carefulness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I want to add my testimony to the same effect . I knew the man intimately , and know that a large part of his genius was a genius for regular , careful work . In the groups of fairly intelligent men where I have met him , he has shown no more genius than pretty much anybody else . While no man has succeeded in literature without some spark of the divine fire , many have succeeded better by taking good care of a small spark , than others have who have been careless with a generous flame . Taking care of that spark means , primarily , taking care of your health . Possibly you 've heard something of this kind before ! It is not a question of being able to get off a good thing occasionally , but ,  --  the ability to get off good things at all being granted ,  --  it is a question of having vitality enough to get off good things often . If a man is sleepy and duli , he can do almost any other brain work better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , the wranglings of courts , even the painting of pictures , all bring something from the outside to hold a man 's attention . But the writer who has to depend upon his own impulses , needs  --  to make those impulses spontaneous and constant-good blood steadily and vigorously pumped into his brain . When I was in college , there was still around something of the ascetic notion that mortification of the flesh tended toward insight into spiritual things . Since then there has raged a good deal of conflict as to what spiritual things really are , and the strongest arguments seem to show that there is a spiritual thing // behind every material thing , and that our true avenue into spiritual things is through doing our duty regarding the physical appearances they put on , including , primarily , the physical apparatus of one 's own consciousness . A man 's duty to his body is almost as important in literature as in athletics . If we look into the facts , we find that , as a rule , the pale and sickly scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Despite some conspicuous exceptions , most great authors have been the possessors of a vigorous physique . The first thing a brain-user must do , is to sleep . Sir Isaac Newton said that he could not do a day 's work without eight hours sleep . Probably the rest of us then , if we want to use our brains , had better fry to get nine . The most efficient literary brain , perhaps , in America to-day , I have often noticed , is taken to bed early , and is also kept a large part of the time in a row boat or on horseback . Now as to the eqnipment best for literary success to-day , as to what in the way of education the world is actually using , perhaps a publisher 's opportunities fit him better than most men for venturing an opinion . There is not much conflict over any question but that between classics and modern languages . My observation has steadily built up the conviction that a man is at great disadvantage in his English , without so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Greek and Latin hare studied with constant reference to English , probably a boy could get as much as that before lie enters college , and as he is constantly using that portion in his English , he would not forget it . That portion is all that is remembered ten years by forty-nine graduates in fifty , while knowledge of French and German , if one has any , tends to increase every day . Yet if you do n't happen to be an academic student , with an elaborate drill in classics , do n't feel that you are at a fatal disadvantage regarding a literary career . A book that some good judges consider as fine a piece of literature as has been produced by any living American , was written by a graduate of this Sheffield Scientific School . I do n't know of anything better by any graduate of the Academical Department . **39;540;TOOLONG , onewhichl specially want to impress upon you because it was so little ap // preciated by the students when I was in college , is the power to do uncongenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts in which yon feel no interest whatever , and master them and their relations . No man can get an intimate and comprehensive view of any subject without the power to do this . There is no subject large enough to be of consequence which is not large enough to include something uncongenial to any one taste . So to master any large subject , every man has got to master some things for which he has no taste . Even poetry and fiction run very thin indeed from a brain not stored with some wide and accurate knowledge . Think what study it must have cost Thackeray to write Esmond , or George Eliot to write IRomola , or Browning to write the Ring and the Book ! And now one thing more . In watching pretty large arcs of the careers of a good many literary men , I have found one thing grow plainer and plainer-that is that honest work pays and meretricious work does not . There are many kinds of honest work . There 's honest blood-and-thunder as well as honest philosophy . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare himself is not more true to nature ! Unless you follow nature , you are sure to get mixed up , and , sooner or later , to break down . This is a tremendously orderly universe-the Cosmos within as well as the one without . Its sequences are absolutely the same , absolutely to be relied on , whether they impel you in a splendid career , or whether they crush you . You can not avoid them and you can not cheat them . Honest literary work is to study them and to delineate them with such art as you may . I remember an art critic saying once : " Do n't try to make iron pillars look beautiful by imitating marble pillars . You lie , and you cheat nobody . Cast capitals are not carved capitals . Mould yourself an honest iron cylinder , give it flanges on the top and bottom to widen its hold , and decorate that . " So in writing , get the habit of doing your own work , not of making cheap imitations of other work . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is marble , but yours is an honest material if you use it honestly and do n't try to make it look like something else . Study the orderly universein dumb nature and in speaking men . If you find nothing // that has not been abundantly told to everybody before , keep still . The world is very busy . But if you find any worthy truth that seems to you new , or that seems to take on in your mind a worthy new aspect , tell it as truly as you can , and with such fit decoration of phrase that will not belie or obscure it , as may naturally come to you . But do n't pump your imagination for meretricious novelty . In literature , the function of imagination is not to supply truth , but to decorate the expression of it . There are few truths so commonplace that they may not be told in new forms and impressed with new eloquence . Evolution is moving each truth into new relations every day . Study what these new relations really are . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gift of fiction , make your characters true to them and illustrate them truly . But do n't build your work with things that do not naturally hang together , or with mere tinsel . Such work ca n't stand , and in the long run , it ca n't pay . And now , supposing yourself to have got your equipment , and formed the habit of honest and needed work , what paths in literature are open to you ? If you have got to make a living , there is at the start only one that is at all direct , though it may branch into others . This is a pretty important point to realize , and very few young people do realize it before experience has shown it to them . Many start with the hope that they can support themselves by writing poems or novels , travels or histories , or even by translating them . Now abandon that at the outset . As to translations , I know a publisher-whom you know at least by sightwho has had to get a letter printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that letter had killed off large crops of budding translators , had a sign put outside of his office door which read : " No translations wanted . " The principal reasons that translations seldom succeed , are that people generally read what is nearest to their personal interests . Those of you who are old-fashioned enough to have read Dickens , remember how fond of reading dear old Joe Gargery was , when all the reading he could do was to pore over the newspaper without being able to make out a word until he came to J. 0 . E. // Joe , and that made him happy . We 're all like that . We all like to read about ourselves and the things close to us . Americans prefer American novels and adventure and history first , then English , then , I suspect , German , especially since we grew so proud of our cousins in 1870 ; next , probably , French , and lately Russian ; that last too , perhaps , because we had some political sympathy with Russia developed in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translations are read , and Russian translations least of all , surprise you a little , but you are not very well placed to know what the majority of people are reading . Your associates are almost exclusively cultivated and cosmopolitan people . Yours is a narrow section of the social pyramid , pretty close to the top . If authors depended upon that small section , they would starve . You find most of the people you go among , reading for instance , Turg6nieff and Tolstoi . But the other people do n't read them ; do n't read Turg6nieff at least ; for the publication of his works in this country has not paid ; and I know if anybody does . Of course one translation in a hundred does pay , but it will not pay you to spend time making the other ninetynine on the chance of catching that one . Remember , I am talking to you of the practical aspects of the literary life , not of its spiritual privileges . When I tell you that translating Turg6nieff does not pay , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . It is only a foolish thing to do for the purpose of making money . I have been told that there are nobler functions in life than making money ; but there is no honest place for them until enough money is made to support life in working order and with a margin for needed recreation . And how to make that amount of money by literature is what we are talking about now . The privilege of opening up new fields of thought and inspiration to your fellow-men , may have to be a subsequent affair . It certainly must be , as far as regards such fields as your fellow-men wo n't pay for , unless fortune has happened to make you independent of their pay . As to novels , I doubt if any American is making a comfortable living by novel writing now ; virtually all the novelists get a large portion of their income from other work , and if any one // of them is making a comfortable living , it is by publishing the novels in the magazines first , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reputation is made . But our question at present , is of the ways to make a reputation . In regard to travel and adventure , if a man has money for travel and adventure , the question of making a living is not crowding him . But , before his reputation is made , no publisher is going to advance him money to get the material for such books . History and the other forms of literature near the line of science , of course require beforehand long periods of study , during which a man must live . As to works of science and philosophy , of course they demand still more years of study , and the demand for them is small . As to magazine writing , the magazines , in the nature of things , must compete with each other for the most attractive tables of contents , and therefore must be mainly filled by writers of reputation already established . They can not give enough space to new writers to do much toward their support . This about uses up all book work outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is important , but there is but little of it , and that little is irregular , and requires special training . What literary work that pays from the start , then , is there left for our* aspirant ? Simply that of the newspapers , daily and , with vastly less chance of a place , weekly . When he leaves college , if he is half as conceited as I was , he will expect to write leading editorials . But probably not many will be required of him at that stage of his career , and even the faculty for criticizing books , pictures , and music which has made him an ornament of the lit . Board , will at first ' hardly compel the admiration of the great world . The chances are that if he wants , at the outset , to get on a big paper in a big city , his only way to make a living with his pen , will be as a reporter . And it wo n't hurt him a bit to do it , if he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sleep depends largely upon digestion , that digestion depends largely on temperance and regularity , and that he has a mother , or had one . There 's great danger to a young man in a reporter 's life . He has // to go to so many bad places in so many bad hours , and live in so much excitement that many young reporters succumb . But I have not learned that many who go out from here do ; certainly no one will who lays to heart a lecture which President Dwight gave in Linonia Hall a few months ago . Of course if your ambition is to be a writer of books , you are starting a long way off , as reporter on a newspaper . But not further off , perhaps , than many successful men start from the objects of their ambition . I have not much faith that a man with literary capacities who begins earning his bread in a career alien to literature , stands much of a chance of developing his literary powers . He had better earn his bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own roll of honor appears to contain a conspicuous example to the contrary , in a graceful poet and subtle critic who stands high in Wall street as well as on Mount Parnassus . But the truth is , he did not begin his active life in Wall street , but in a newspaper office , and did not drift into his present business until he had had a long education on the press , and had formed habits and powers of literary work strong enough to withstand the distractions of a business career . The necessity of beginning in a modest way as a newspaper reporter may not be very stimulating , but there is at least one probability that is stimulating , namely , that your genius is going to be appreciated : Things are not now as they were when Milton sold the manuscript of Paradise Lost for fifteen pounds , or even as they were when Dana sold the manuscript of " Two Years Before the Mast** for two hundred and fifty dollars . There are many more avenues into publicity-more magazines and more publishing houses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , twenty-five years ago , there was hardly a college-bred man in the publishing business ; now there is hardly a publishing house which is not presided over by one . So far from there being any truth in the frequent impression that in the business-offices of literature , the aspirant is treated with neglect , the truth is that if there is any promise in him , it is encouraged and nursed . Not a few of the articles in the magazines are re-written in the editor 's office , because they have been found to contain good material badly dressed . Not a few // books have been labored over in the offices of pnblishers as if they were bright but sickly children . I have heard of an author of some repntation saying that if her books were well written , it was because her pnblisher had re-written them . And why should not editors and pnblishers foster genius in that way ? Does not their living depend upon it ? And is not genius rare , and yet somewhat snsceptible of development ? Of course mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in rejecting . So far as my personal experience goes , not more than one per cent . of those offered are accepted , yet there have been more mistakes in accepting than in rejecting . Of course every business man wants to do business , and where one big success will wipe out a dozen moderate failures , he is a little more apt to err in taking chances for the one big success than in avoiding the chances of the dozen little failures . Be assured then , that if you can produce anything worth publishing somebody will appreciate it , and works of genius are always worth publishing , unless they are in very narrow technicalities . The first one or two persons to whom you offer your work of genius may make the mistake of rejecting it . A certain margin for mistakes has got to be allowed in all human processes , and possibly that margin may come in at the beginning . Publishers ' readers are fallible like all other human beings , and I sometimes am tempted to suspect that even publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considerations of time alone would force them to delegate most of their reading . All people , no matter how widely cultivated , have their hobbies , negative as well as positive . I knew a very accomplished and reliable reader to recommend , at intervals , three novels that were not worth publishing . It appeared that every one of them turned on the Salem witchcraft , and that that was a subject that the reader was simply unable to resist . Do n't be perfectly sure that you are a heaven-born genius if your first manuscript is accepted on the first offer . But , on the other hand , do n't be sure that you are not at least fairly capable if your manuscript is rejected on the first two or three offers . While the merchants of literature are eager to find genius , it is also mcvi tably true that they are very skeptical regarding the chance that any particular manuscript contains it . Certainly not one in a // hundred does , and therefore it is inevitable that a reader should approach any work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability that it is good for nothing . And of course if this a priori impression comes on top of too much dinner , or too little , or too much sleep or too little , or any one of the thousand disturbances that flesh and spirit are heir to , the chances are that unless the work is the great stroke of its decade , the a priori probability that it is good-for-nothing will appear to the reader confirmed . But the next editor or reader , or the next one still , is pretty sure to be found in judicial condition , and the work to get its deserts . Before I leave this topic , I want , partly for selfish reasons , to give you a word of advice . Do n't bore publishers . Busy men hate to be interviewed ; especially when , as in the case of manuscript , the chances are ninety-nine to one that the matter is of no consequence whatever . An author 's desire to expound or explain his manuscript awakens at once an impression that it has been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must realize that he ca n't expound or explain his book to the public . It must explain itself , and if it ca n't do that to the publisher 's reader , it certainly ca n't to the public . When a manuscript is offered in a way that shows a realization of these facts , the presumption is at once aroused that the author has , at least , common sense and good taste ; and it is the sad truth that even these qualities are so rare that they at once lead the manuscript to be approached as something out of the common . On the contrary , a manuscript is apt to have short shrift , if it is backed up as many are , by such arguments as that it is the work of a meritorious lady in reduced circumstances whose grandfather invented a weli-known horseshoe . To save any possible pain , I do n't name the exact invention , but this is the exact parallel of two long letters which I had to read one terribly busy day a few months ago , regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a reason for accepting a manuscript , that the author was only fifteen years old . Yet there is a converse notion just as absurd , that the intrinsic merit of a manuscript ought alone to lead a publisher to undertake it whether many people want it or not . There are // not a few ready to heap scorn upon a publisher because he refuses to give a few people what they want , in his line , at his own expense . Of course it is flattery to a man to expect a great deal of him , and as nobody expects such philanthropy from the butcher or baker , perhaps the publisher should consider himself proportionally honored . But the fact is : the publisher is not the public . He simply tells you whether , in his trained but not infallible judgment , the public wants a given book . If it does not , he certainly is not to blame . Yet I have often heard publishers blamed for lack of literary enthusiasm , when it was simply the public that lacked the enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , when it was the public that lacked its own spirit . But to return to your supposed literary aspirations . You had better seek your first rejection from the magazines , because there 's one chance in a million that you may not get it , and if you don't-if your manuscript is accepted , you will get vastly better pay than you can by publishing in book form first . The public taste is setting more and more toward periodicals . I shall have more to say about this later , but first I want to say a word about writing for periodicals . In one respect , it has been one of the most injurious practices literature has had to contend xv*th , I mean in respect to continued stories . The literary life has not been found always to contribute to the business virtues , and authors are sometimes hard up . Consequently novel writers are very apt to want pay for their novels before they have finished them . So they sometimes sell them to magazines even before they have begun to write them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the flow of inspiration is steady , he may get through with such a story all right . Though even then the early part of his work can not have the benefit of the afterthoughts during the progress of it , or of revision of the early part to make it better develop the conclusion . As he goes on , many happy suggestions are apt to strike him which a slight modification of what has gone before would enable him to introduce , but which he can not introduce if what has gone before is already rigid in // print . This is not the worst of it , however . Health is not absolutely reliable , accidents do happen , inspiration is unsteady . But the weekly or monthly appearance of the periodical is a fixed certainty , and publication day is apt to come sometime when the anthor is dull , or anxions , or ill . And then comes hasty and ill-considered work . Evidence of this can be seen too often in important places . For instance : I do n't believe any body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages in some of his novels ( not in Esmond ) , which if they had been sent into my office in an unknown manuscript and been among the first passages to meet the reader 's eye , would have led to the rejection of the whole manuscript on the ground that no man writing so carelessly could write well . Those passages , I have always assumed , were thrown off while some magazine was waiting for copy. * I have more than once said to a new author : " Your future is secure , if you will never publish the beginning of a story before you have written the end , " and I have more than once known brilliant prospects clouded by disregard of the hint . One way to steer clear of the greatest temptation to make this capital blunder , is not to sell your work outright  --  but to prefer a royalty to payment in the lump . What money you get for this year 's work , you are apt to regard as this year s income , and spend it , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , you *rnay not be able to work , or your work may not be taking , or there may be extra demands on your purse . A man may be able to work at almost anything else , and yet be in no trim to work at literature . I 've heard of eminent soldiers and politicians who did not sleep well . I never heard of an eminent author who did not at least during effective periods . I know an author , whose works , if paying royalty , would give a comfortable income and be a safe provision for old age . Old age is coming and the author has nothing . All his books have been sold outright and the money spent in an unnecessarily rich scale of living . The author is generally in trouble , and selling books before they are done , the work is deteriorating , the public is supplied with more of it than it has appe * Since this paper was read , the newly published letters of Thackeray prove it regarding some of the very passages referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than its predecessor . Moreover , of conrse each manuscript has been sold for vastly less than , on a royalty basis , it was worth . Where the pQblisher has to take the risk of a book 's success , he has to disconnt the probabilities at what capital is worth in business , which is vastly more than capital is worth to a mere investor like the anthor . I said that I should have occasion to speak of periodicals paying more for manuscript than can be got throngli pnblishing in book form alone . It is the general belief of the trade that a book will sell as many copies if it first appears in a periodical as if it does not . If this view is correct  --  and it can not be very far from correct-an anthor who can pnblish first in a periodical gets donble market . The great development of periodicals in the past forty years is worth a moment 's attention . It is one of the consequences of the great increase in means of commnnication . The same kind of person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays in the Spectator on manners and other home topics now wants daily telegrams from India and Africa . Why , even thirty years ago , speculations regarding the intentions of the Kaiser , the Snltan , and the Czar , were aronsed only by weekly mails . Now every issue of a daily paper contains long telegrams and editorials regarding them . A man is to-day more thoroughly a citizen of the world than , thirty years ago , he could be of his own conntry . To keep alive to these wide interests , he must read vast amonnts of matter which would be stale long before it could get between the covers of a book . This rapidity of interconrse is backed np by the rapidity of scientific discovery and of legal adjndication , until now men of science and lawyers , after their preliminary training , depend more upon the jonrnals of their professions than they do upon the books . Even legal decisions can no longer wait for the old fashioned annnal volnmes , but are pnblished in monthly and even in weekly pamphlets . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the universities publish periodicals devoted to it , and it is even crowding practical politics in the daily press . It is literaliy true that many eminent scientific investigators think it a waste of time to // write any more than announcements of their discoveries in the periodicals read by their confreres , and even look askance at scientific men who write much . In view of this , then , begins to come np the question in relation to the remote fntnre : " Will the coming man read books ? " Well , one is not as ready to set np for a prophet when he has been ont of college twenty-five years , as he is before he cracks the college egg shell , but I will risk it so far as to say that the knowledge of the fntnre is going to be stored much more generally than the knowledge of the present is , in vast sets of bonnd periodicals with elaborate indexes . The drift in that direction is very plain in the libraries now . The proportion of bonnd periodicals is rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poole 's Index that nsed to help ns read np for our compositions when I was in college , there is a large qnarto , and two other series of indexes are pnblished monthly . Bnt as to any material falling off in the demand for books , the facts seem a little paradoxical . Of the great increase of the periodicals there can be no question , but until the circumstances which took place abont ten years ago , which I am soon to describe , there was no noticeable falling off in the book-bnying habit , and I have not heard of its falling off in England , where such circumstances have not affected it . It looks then as if the periodicals stimnlate book bnying on the one hand , while they compete with books on the other , and as if they really found their own market in a great increase of the reading habit . Now of course , there are plenty of people grnmbling at the growing tendency to read periodicals , just as there are plenty of people to grnmble at any other change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in this . A person niainly confined to periodicals , if he has had no previous training , is apt to be nnsystematic , discnrsive , snperficial perhaps . But why should he be confined to them ? Voltaire said , or at least he is the last of the dozen men I have heard the saying attributed to , that an educated man knows everything about something and something about everything . Now we can take it for granted that the number of men who know everything about something is very small , and we can take it almost // equally for granted that they are going to find it out for themselves in very calm independence of what means the world sees fit to supply them . It makes little difference to genius whether it depends on books or periodicals or , in some things , on Nature at first hands . It will learn its everything about something anyhow , but as for people who are not geniuses , our chance of learning our little something about everything seems to me enormously increased by the increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any training whatever , is , of course , to diminish the chance that he would have had in an old fashioned library , of getting fastened to some book that would make him so strong in some one subject that it might be a rallying point for his whole intellect . But we are not turning people loose without training , as much as we did . We are not only educating more people , but we are giving them a more saving education . After we get a boy rough-hewn into the shape that enables us to recognize him as human , we are beginning to try to find out what he is really good for , and to train him for that . We have got over the old notion of my college days that to make a thing useful you must make it disagreeable ; and under the elective system , a boy stands a good chance of developing an abiding interest in some department . A boy so educated will be safe in the coming flood of periodicals . He will simply pick out from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed , find himself nourished and sped along by the actual current of the age . Not only is the great increase of this class of publications unlikely to do any harm , but in some ways it is sure to do great good . It is making good reading more accessible and cheaper . Moreover , the mails carry pamphlets to fifty times as many places as the bookstores and news-stands can reach , and they carry a year 's issue for less postage than a single book . The cost of authorship , type setting , engraving , and the difficult preparation of the press for the illustrations , is distributed over so many copies that each copy has to bear but a trifle *f it . If a number of Harper ' 8 illiomthly or the Century did not have a wider circulation than that of an average book , it would have to cost ten times as much as it does . If the periodicals really do kill off more books than they // stimulate to the reading of , note the effect on the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , mainly those that are least fit to survive . On the other hand , the literature furnished by the periodicals is , on the whole , the best of its kind , for the enormous circulation possible to the magazines enables them to bid high  --  to pay the good author better than books alone can . While the periodicals are sometimes supposed to do something to account for the fact that relatively to the increase of population , the sale of books is falling off , the causes that have produced the periodicals have been working too long to account for the remarkable falling off in the past ten years . The railroads have been working for periodicals and against books over fifty years , the land telegraphs over forty , and the ocean cable over twenty , and the magazines have come up gradually . Since they reached a substantial development some thirty years ago , they have no more than kept pace with our general progress , while the distinct revolution in the sale of books of which I speak began only some ten years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous falling off in the demand for books of all kinds . There are not relatively as many published , and there are not as many of each sold . In poems , travels , essays , histories , biographies , the publishers find that they can , as a rule , place but about one third as many copies of a new book a they could ten years ago , and in English novels worth keeping , and in a form worth keeping , only about a tenth . There was ten years ago a book-buying habit , which was a good habit , because it led to a book-reading habit , and because it made a demand so wide that many books could be published that could not have been if they had depended for their sale only on those who read them . The favorite dissipation of many a substantial citizen , even in out of the way places , was to drop into the bookstore of an evening , look over the stock , and take home some book in a shape that would be a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer exist , at least as bookstores . They are now toy shops and ice cream saloons with piles of " Seaside** libraries in one corner , and the substantial citizen , instead of taking home an // occasional volume of Irving , or Emerson , or Macaulay , or even of Timothy Titcomb or the Country Parson ( two excellent men of whom the younger of you probably have not heard much , but they did some good in their day ) , he takes home a toy , or a pound of candy , or a pamphlet copy from ( the chances are even ) some minor English author , which if it had had to be reprinted as a book , would not have been considered worth reprinting at all . The thing is soon torn up , but the family remains the poorer , not only by it , but by the good book which , ten years ago , would have been in its place . But this is not the worst of it . When a good book does get into the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not an American book . Our authorship has not been keeping pace with our growth in other things , and its pace is growing slacker . We are not without respectable authors ; but there is too much point in the frequent question : " Where are the successors of Irving , and Hawthorne , and Motley , and Longfellow , and Bryant , and Emerson ? " Certainly they have not appeared in such numbers as our growing civilization would justify , and , what is worse , they have not appeared in such numbers as the future healthy growth of our civilization can actually depend upon . Did you ever reflect how important it is to a nation to have its own literature ? It is not merely a source of amusement - intense j*nd inspiring  --  but it is a foundation stone of a nation 's greatness and permanence . It first awakens the patriotism of the child , and it informs the patriotism of the man . To a nation at war , poetry is almost as essential as powder . It was a deep thinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , and I care not who makes its laws . " But the man of letters does his part to determine what the laws shall be , as well as what the poetry shall be , and both unite to determine who shall win the battles . No man who lived through our war for the Union and who takes a sound view of its inspirations , can fail to attribute a mighty share of them to Holmes , and Lowell , and Emerson . And now to come from heroic things to ridiculous things . Do you suppose that if our literature had its old grip on the interests of our people , our leisured classes would now be // aping the English as they do ? Such a question is too subtle and complex to justify a very positive answer . Whetherpost hoc or propter hoc , this outbreak of Anglomania has gone on with the recent weakening of our literature , and no one questions the influence of literature on manners any more than on morals or on laws . And our literature is loosing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this condition ? Simply calm and patient Nemesis , standing in the background while we were lagging behind other nations in perhaps the most significant step that civilization has yet taken . We alone have given no protection within our borders to the literature of other nations , and at last our own literature is suffering . What has been the process by which nature has , as she always does , worked out this penalty for neglect of right ? Or , a more mysterious question , how is it that we have been going on for a century without paying any regard to the rights of foreign authors , and have not felt any disastrous effects until within a decade , but are feeling them now ? The reason is that during our period of safety , the rights of foreign authors were quite generally respected , but it was by a voluntary arrangement of the American publisher , which had no law to support it , and which , about ten years since , naturally broke down . The arrangement arose because the publishing business is perhaps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most disastrous . Experience has shown that where a book is not a monopoly , competition will surely lower its price to a point that destroys its value to author and publisher both . It comes about in this way . A certain number of books must be sold before the cost of type-setting can be paid , and in the case of nineteen books in twenty , they must be sold within a few months of publication , before new ones crowd public attention away from them . I am speaking now of current literature , of course . Now if a book is not copyrighted , and two publishers set the type for it , twice as many copies must be sold to pay for the type-setting . But the sale is not apt to be forced up to double or even half-as-much-again by the production of two editions ; but the price is sure to be forced down , so that even if the sale is forced up , the loss is sure to come all the same , and the market to be flooded with // cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the public ( illegitimately , though , as I shall show ) temporarily benefited at the expense of both . Moreover , the prices of books can not be , even in the absence of competition , like the prices of objects of universal demand , such as nails and sugar  --  a trifle above the mechanical cost of production . Of books by untried authors , not over one in five , if one in ten , awakens any remunerative demand ; and even of books by approved authors , not all are sure to succeed . A demand for more can not be forced by making the prices of all exceptionally low . The one book in five that people want , they will pay a reasonable price for , the other four they wo n't have at any price . Now no human being can tell in advance which book out of the live by new authors , that good judges call worth publishing , is going to succeed . Therefore the only way to make it possible to publish them , is to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pay a reasonable profit on the five . But even if this were not so , the price could not bear the same low ratio to mechanical cost that the prices of nails and sugar do . Books are not merely mechanical productions , but at the very outset they must spring from the rarest and most highly organized brains of the race , and those brains , to do their best work , must be assured a certain immunity from material cares . Their owners must be decently paid . and must be paid out of the excess over mechanical cost brought by an article in limited demand . The publisher , too , must be paid , or at least he thinks so , out of this article in limited demand . For the reasons I have given , it early became a question with American publishers how , in the absence of an international copyright law , they were to avoid suicidal competition over the works of foreign authors . At that time ,  --  say thirty-five years ago ,  --  there were so few publishers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am often questioned about these methods , I suppose you may care to know them . Their first agreement was ,  --  roughly speaking ,  --  that no one should reprint a foreign book after another had done so . So they began to compete for the first printing of each foreign book , buying early proof sheets from England in order to // publish a book here as soon as it should appear there , and , of course , before any rival here could get it on to the market . But it was not practicable always to buy advance sheets . ilosts of books by untried authors , and some uncertain books of tried authors , were too risky to buy , and were still open to competition , and when copies came over , two or more houses might begin printing them at once , and all but the one first ready would lose , or else would violate the agreement . It became necessary , then , in the case of such books to decide ownership in advance . It was soon arranged that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement with the author , the book should be left to him who first publicly announced his intention of printing it , and that there might be no dispute as to what was a sufficient announcement , it came to be agreed that the announcement should be made in the Commercial Advertiser , which was , some thirty or forty years ago , the leading literary daily in New York , and now under a new administration is happily striving for its old dominion . But if copies of a promising English book came here , the day after the steamer arrived , there might appear simultaneous announcements of it by several publishers . Who was to have the priority then ? This question led some houses to establish agents in England who should arrange for safe books , and send in advance of publication the names of all books that they could hear of from publishers and printers , and these names were announced . So far was this carried that forthcoming American copies of books , whose titles were learned in England , were sometimes announced as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had contracted for them . Even more , the titles of some American copyright books that had already appeared here and received some attention in England , were sometimes sent over from England with a batch of English titles by agents there , and inadvertently announced as in press here by one house , after another house had already published them . The houses that made their announcements in this sweeping way did not print a fifth part of the books they announced , and yet their announcements prevented other houses from taking up the books . Moreover , this enterprising method of announcement was a game that all could play at . So it became neces // sary to modify it . Consequently one great house refused to recognize any announcement that was not made with the book actually in hand here . Soon another point was set up , that when one house had taken the risk of introducing an unknown author , that house should have the first right to reprint the author 's subsequent books , even if the author , indifferent to the service done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of later books elsewhere , the claimant , of course , assuming the contracts of the buyer . Thus through self interest , backed up by considerable clear insight and not a little openness of spirit , there gradually grew up quite a code of custom *. which , as custom always has been , was a primitive makeshift for legislation . It was called " The Courtesy of the Trade . " Its total effect was to stimulate the making of contracts with foreign authors , and it is safe to say that while it lasted-for about the last twenty-five years of our first century as a nation-most American publishers acted , as the same ones act still , very much as they would have had to if there had been an international copyright law . But , for reasons which I shall soon explain , the " Courtesy of the Trade* ' was broken down about ten years ago . While it lasted there were defects and miscarriages enough , but British authors of any consequence generally had their rights here , although in a lame way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal terms . Now note this tremendously significant fact . Those twentyfive years of virtual international copyright-say from 51 to *T6-were by all manner of odds , the best twenty-five years of American literature . This proof from experience regarding the beneficent effect of even a makeshift for international copyright is confirmed by a second proof from experience with another substitute . I mean Stage-right , which foreign authors have here by a quirk of law . Our judicial decisions treat a foreigner 's manuscript as his own property , just as they treat his watch , and in the same way they prevent the taking of any liberties with it . As you have no right to learn the time from a foreigner 's watch without his consent , so you have no right to learn any fact from his manuscript without his consent . If he sees fit to make // you acquainted with anything that the manuscript contains by any means other than parting with it or a copy of it , you can not get more than he sees fit to give you . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play or opera can be acted , so long as the text and score are not published , without the author losing his right to restrain the making of copies . As a consequence , some of the most popular foreign plays and operas have been produced here solely under license of their creators and upon payment of royalty . Thus writers for the stage are reaping , from a judicial decision , the same benefits of international copyright , that writers of books had from the old " Courtesy of the Trade . " Now note the effect ! The theatre is in a flourishing condition while the book-trade is languishing , and American authors can make vastly more money out of plays than out of books . Our people spend more money on the theatre probably twenty times over , than they do on books . Those who object to giving a dollar and a half for a book that will last , think nothing of giving it for a single evening at the theatre . And yet there is no cry that the foreign author of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their drama cheap . And the stage is flourishing while books are not. * The old " Trade Courtesy , " beneficial as it was , depended upon the voluntary and informal consensus of a small body of men , a body , too , exceptional in being in constant contact with letters . Of course such a state of affairs was in very unstable equilibrium . The miracle is not so much that a set of established houses and one or two seeking establishment by the same methods should respect each others rights mutually conceded , as that for so long a period , no new comers should attack the salutary monopolies those houses had helped each other build . Any fool could make money , for a few years * Since I made these statements we have had what I assume to be an illustration , in this very particular , of the way Nature always works her revenges . Sarah Bernhardt lately played Theodora in New York . The " book of the play " was merely a summary of it . To have given the exact words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume that it was our lack of an international copyright law which put it out of the power of nineteen-twentieths of the audience to follow the play . // at least  --  and that is a long way ahead for a fool to lookby reprinting George Eliot , or Charles iReade , or many other books , and the miracle is that for so many years , no fool , not to say no sharp man without standing to lose , did not do it . An occasional spasmodic attempt was made , but the regular publisher at once reduced his prices to the ruination point and the attempt was short lived . Conditions favorable to such attempts were ripening , however , and about 1876 they matured . The code of " Trade Courtesy , " evolved some ten years prior to the civil war , had been protected from ontsiders by the diversion of industry and attention incident to the war . But after its close , the progress of manufactures , unhealthily stimulated by the protective tariff , in time led to gluts in the paper mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - agriculture and mining . By the early seventies , papermakers , press-makers , type-founders , for the sake of getting rid of their surplus wares were ready to trust almost any adventurer who came along ; and the growth of railroads and of mail facilities made the transportation of floods of - pamphlets without covers a very easy thing . Under these conditions , an adventurer in Chicago , who has since failed , made more of a success in cheap piracy than had ever been made before , by using a second time the type of the continued foreign stoi*ies in his weekly paper , for reprinting them in pamphlet form . About the same time , the proprietors of some of the New York weeklies , and of the Sunday editions of the dailies , began to do the same . These reprinters of novels in the well known flat quarto pamphlet , paid no respect to the old courtesy of the trade among the publishers , or to the rights of foreign authors . Harper 's Franklin Square Library was an exception to this , which I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly piratical principles , and they were not restricted to the pamphlet series , but some of them went into wholesale piracy in bound books . The profits which British authors had been deriving from their legitimate publishers in America , fell to virtually nothing . Under the competition of these floods of stolen goods , the sale of books by American authors fell off two-thirds . How many // people were going to pay a dollar and a-half for a book by Howells when they could get one by Norris or Hardy for twenty cents ? INow it may naturally be asked why , if the pirates could make money publishing in this way , the authorized publishers could not . In the first place , only one of the pirates has made money . The others have all or nearly all , failed , most of them at least twice . But selling books at ruinous prices that pay authors nothing , has of course stopped the sale of books at remunerative prices that do pay authors , just as effectually as if the pirates had made money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , a book usually retails at four or five times the cost of paper , printing , and binding . This fact has been stigmatized by people who do not understand the necessity of it , as a fraud on the public , and one philanthropist appeared as the defender of the public against the extortions of the publishers . He said , substantially : " Why , these vampires are bleeding the public to the extent of three or four hundred per cent . One hundred per cent . or fifty per cent . ought to be enough for any man . Five per cent . is enough for a dealer in flour or metal , why should people have to pay more for its intellectual and spiritual food than for its gross material necessities ? Go to ! I will change all this . " And elaborate circulars were issued to that general effect . Now this philanthropist saw , in th' first place , that about forty per cent . of the retail price of a book was going to the wholesale dealer and the retailer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the customer , for , as you all know , the customer generally gets twenty per cent . of it now-a-days . So this philanthropist 's first step was to say that he would save the reader the forty per cent . by having nothing to do with the jobber and retailer , but would deal with his readers direct . Then he knew that he would not pay anything to the author , so that saved him ten per cent . more , and he had got his price reduced fifty per cent . already . Well , he managed to get it a good deal lower still ; but we need not follow him further before noticing the fallacies in what he had already done . He had left out the fact that the customer was used to a reduction from any price named . This had become so on // account of the foolish competition of the regular publishers in giving discounts to their customers , until at last the retailers got so much discount that they began giving it away to the readers , in competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty per cent . which he had cut off , up to the point when we left him , also included the packing and transportation . His third fallacy was that he could get along without the wholesale dealer and retailer , and he soon found that after all , ont of his greatly reduced price , he had to allow the dealers discounts and to pay transportation . But perhaps the most important item that he left out was the vast uncertainty of the business  --  the fact that I explained earlier , that prices have got to be high enongh to allow four books out of five to pay no profit . It was true that he reduced this uncertainty to a minimum by mainly taking books that other publishers had already had the risk of proving successful , and letting their failures alone . But even in that case , he had to meet their competition , for they , of course , lowered their prices , even to a loss , rather than submit to having another take the fruit that they had grown . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but apparently he had left the printer out too , and the paper maker and binder as well . For he failed , largely in debt to them all . The same story , with variations in detail is true , I believe , of all the pirates but one , though some of them have apparently been put on their legs again , even more than once , generally by some glutted paper maker whom they have saved out of the wreck , and who finds a handy means of getting rid of his superfluous product in the indirect selling of large masses of books and pamphlets at about the cost of the paper in them . Whether author , printer , binder , and the other creditors of the so-called publisher are paid , is , of course , none of the paper-maker 's affair . But the American trade in books of general literaturebooks outside of the literature of knowledge and of picture books and toy books and fancy editions , has been killed . Not only has the revenue of foreign authors from America been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue of American authors has gone with it to an extent that makes literature , // independently of journalism or other distractions , at a desperate disadvantage in America . I said that one of the pirates has made money , and in connection with this fact I promised to explain why none of the regular publishers established before him and connected with the very authors whom he pirated , could make money by his methods . It is obvious , of course , that other things even , as they paid the authors , and he did not , he could sell at lower prices than they . That would be somewhat offset , however , by their being supplied by the author with early proofs of a book and so being able to publish it a few days before the pirate . But this on the other hand was something of an advantage to him , because the regular publisher gets the book well advertised by the time the competing edition is ready , and so saves the pirate that expense , and people have learned to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pirate 's main advantage which is that he can lay hands on the authors of all the regular publishers , while each regular publisher restricts him . self to his own authors . This enables the pirate to issue a vastly better collection than any regular publisher can . Probably no one of you begins to appreciate the commercial value of a series like the Seaside Library , for instance , as distinct from the same books straggling independently . It 's the old story of the faggot and the single sticks . Each book contains a list advertising all the others . When the issue is regular , people get in the habit of looking for the books in a series instead of buying books not in it , and moreover , the postal law gives to publications thus issued periodically , the benefit of the same cheap postage that applies to magazines and weekly papers . But a special point here , is , that for these reasons , dealers will order in advance a quantity of each book that is to appear in a series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course each dealer will prefer the best series  --  the one containing most of the best books , and will neglect the other collections . The public acts in the same way . If Appleton publishes a series and a reader asks for " A daughter of Heth " in it , he wont find it , because Win . Black 's works are published by Harper , and Appleton and Harper respect each other 's rights and the rights of each other 's authors . // Similarly , if the reader asks for " Cometh up as a Flower** in the Franklin Square Library , he wont find it , because Rhoda Broughton is published by Appleton . But if the reader asks for both books in the Seaside Library , he will find both there , because the publisher of the Seaside Library respects no right of Appleton , or Harper , or Win . Black , or Rhoda Broughton , and consequently he has a better series than either of the other publishers , and his series pays well while theirs does not . Other collections to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaside has succeeded , simply because it was earliest in the field in New York and was pushed with an energy that left all competitors to defeat . Some collections like the Franklin Square Library , for instance , are issued by publishers who do respect authors ' rights and therefore can not include everything , but they are kept up more for the sake of holding on to connections and not losing a visible place in the field , than because there is profit enough in them to make them worth while . I trust it is now plain to you , how , although American publishers once did , as some do still , respect foreign authors ' rights and did not steal their books to compete at the prices of stolen goods with books of American authorship , it has naturally come about , in the absence of a copyright law , that success should largely depend upon not respecting foreign authors ' rights , and *o seriously damaging our own authors ' rights . There is still another feature of this wholesale cheap piracy , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . That is , the vast quantity and consequent poor average quality of it . Before these cheap libraries appeared , only such books were published as , for some reason , could be expected to pay author as well as publisher . But the libraries have flooded the country with stuff that under healthy conditions would not justify reprinting ,  --  books that were undoubtedly published in England at their authors ' expense by hack publishers . The reason for this is , that the series must appear regularly like a magazine . Unless it does , it is not entitled to cheap postage , and it will disappoint its customers . Nothing is more fatal to a periodical publication of any kind than irregularity of appearance . So these cheap series , to keep up regular and // rapid publication , at times when good authors were infertile , have had to fill in with poor ones , and even with forgotten ones . And all this , of course , is in competition with authors of merit-authors prepared to instruct on living questions , and above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs and hopes . Authorship at best is an ill-paid pursuit . Most of its rewards are in glory ; and , in modern life , fervid and ingenuous souls can find many other avenues to glory , even outside of the old ones marked by the sword and the cross . What wonder then that in the state of affairs I have depicted , the quiet paths of authorship are less and less sought by able men ? The question is then , plainly enough it seems to me , not merely , are we to have an international copyright law because we want to do justice to the men in other lands who have laid us under the heaviest obligations that any one portion of mankind can lay upon the rest , but it is a more selfish question , or at least a more patriotic question  --  and patriotism is after all but the largest form of selfishness-whether we are going to have an international copyright law in order that we may have a national literature . The demand for international copyright has been resisted by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of American industry , that is the industry of American mechanics . Thc* industry of American authors is not covered by their philanthropy . Every time the matter has been up for discussion , just as every time free trade or an honest dollar has been up for discussion , the well known howl has gone up from Philadelphia . When the senate committee on patents was listening to arguments on this subject in the spring of 86 , a petition was sent against it in charge of representative walking-delegates from that city , which contained the names of ten times as many printers , paper makers , and binders as ever had had a dollar 's interest in a reprinted work . All professed to be interested , yet most of them were manufacturers of blank books and other stationery , or proprietors of job printing offices that seldom got beyond a bifl-head or a circular . Yet all these people were claiming that an international copyright law , at least one that // should not require that all books sold here should be manufactured here , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , especially in that favored centre of the manufacturing interest , who are seized with a frenzy whenever the cry is raised that America is to have the benefit of foreign labor , or even of foreign capital . The sober truth is that but a very small portion of even the paper and printing interest of the country would be affected by the removal from American soil of all reprinting of books copyrighted in foreign countries . The newspaper offices of New York alone would more than equal the whole industries affected , and I incline to believe that any two of the largest offices would . On the other hand , consider the collossal importance of the development of our national literature which would offset the trilling disadvantages that even unrestricted international copyright would bring . There now seems no immediate chance however , for an unrestricted measure . It takes a pretty sanguine soul to hope for even one restricting manufacturing to this country , and if such a one were to pass , it is doubtful if other nations would reciprocate so that it could stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necessitate the expense of doing the type work twice - both abroad and here  --  and our Philadelphia friends are clamoring that even the engraving shall be done twice , and this double expense must of course be paid by the people . Yet the very loudest clamorers for this burden on the people , are also the loudest clamorers for leaving the foreign author to be robbed and our own author to be left to the competition of stolen goods , in order that the same dear people whom they want to make pay for duplicate type-setting and duplicate engraving , may have their books cheap . Verily labor with a big L , not to speak of demagoguery with a big ID , is a good advocate of help to the needy ! It is claimed by the opponents of international copyright , that it is not a natural right which a country is bound to protect , even in an alien , as it would his person or his personal belongings , but that it is a right made by law and not existent until the law makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discussion , no real authority , on either side , admits its validity in this shape . There are , as most of you know , two schools of authorities , one of whom would claim that *dl rights are , in a sense , natural-copyright as well as any other-and that the law , so far as it goes , merely recognizes and protects natural rights ; while the other school claims that there are no natural rights , and that man has no rights except those created by law-that the function of law is not the recognition of abstract principles , but has to do simply with the practical question whether the greatest good of the greatest number will be promoted by any piece of concrete legislation or adjudication . Now in the light of recent knowledge , these two old-time conflicting opinions , between natural rights and legal rights , like many similar pairs of opinions , look very much like the two sides of the same shield . If you admit evolution and admit rights-natural or legal-all rights which conform with evolution must be natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that a right which you propose to make legal is for the greatest good of the greatest number , but an admission that it is in conformity with the course of evolution , and is therefore natural ? In fact , in the modern view , until it seems demonstrated that a right is natural , there is not much thought of making it legal . We simply study the indications of evolution , and try to confirm them by law . Now what has been the course of discovery so far regarding property rights ? Very early it was found that a society can not develop without securing to every man the result of his labor when applied to material things . The bow or boat the savage makes must be his own . From the recognition of that fact , civilization begins , and there is no rational line to be drawn between a savage 's right to have only whom he pleases use his bow , and an author 's right to have only whom he pleases read his book . Some time back , I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . I did so because it is the acknowledgment of the most abstract right yet recognized by law , and it is also the most altruistic of acknowledgments . Primitive intelligence recognizes rights only in material things . Later , are recognized rights in ideas applied to material things and they are protec // ted by patent laws . It is a still later step to recognize rights in such immaterial things as combinations of words . There are plenty of writers and speakers to-day who are not civilized enough to do that . Moreover , the rights of strangers are never recognized by barbarians . They do not even generally respect a stranger 's right to his own person . A community protects the material property of its own citizens at a much earlier stage of civilization than it protects the property of strangers . Domestic patent laws preceded international patent laws . Domestic copyright laws have preceded international copyright laws . All civilized nations have domestic copyright laws , and all but one have international copyright laws , and in that one , whenever such a law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient right of pillage of the foreigner , in order that the native may have his property cheap . The great nation not yet civilized beyond such doctrines , is ours ! I have before alluded to a very significant fact , and I know that of which I speak . Our most active agitators against international copyright include the most active agitators against international trade and against an honest dollar . I hope I have , even if at the risk of boring you , done something to show you the vast importance of this question of international copyright , and its difficulties . It is of the utmost moment th*jt such a question shall be well understood by such persons as yourselves , and to explain it was one of the chief motives that led me here . Another strong impulse however was one of pure affection for this spot , and of desire to contribute anything from my experience that could be useful here . I ventured in the earlier portion of this address on considerable of what might be called professional advice , and perhaps on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I say a parting word of a more intimate nature still . Speaking purely with reference to your happiness and success in life , if my experience is good for anything , it will be well for you while you are here and after you are gone , often to have one feeling I have not yet named . Love this place ! Do not regard it merely as a dead machine for turning out young men with academic attainments. // Regard it more as an influence that devotes attainments to high ends . Such a university as this is no soulless thing . No mere mechanical combination , no mere ingenuity , no mere flat could make it . It has had to grow through all these generations , and to grow from the labors and sacrifices of devoted men . Its traditions are of respect for learning , but they are of respect for manhood first . It is the one place of all I ever knew where a man 's accidents , however brilliant , are subordinated to his essentials , however sober  --  the one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Love it then for these things , but love it more than all because its greatest education is the education of the heart . You who sit here in its sheltered calm and hear the exultant throbs of victory blending into rhythms of music afar off , think it is all victory there . But wherever there is a victory , there is a defeat . Each one expects to share the triumph . But ito one may be certain that he will . Out in the world , even amid the victories , there are disappointments too ; and those who know them best tell us that even triumphs are often empty . Those who feel the disappointments and emptinesses , and every man feels them sometime and too often , know the need of something stronger and warmer than mere power of intellect and will . Now there is no place where men assemble ,  --  I verily belleve ,  --  where the heart can so freight itself with those better and enduring things as it can here . This is one place where meretricious selfishnesses are torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you can really know each other , here you can really be free from the prejudices that keep men apart , and you can grow close together . Work , for none can be a man without work , but feel too ! Feel the splendid traditions which surround you , feel all that is true and spontaneous and generous in each other , and you will take from here something that will be a solace and an inspiration all your days . HENRY HOLT .
