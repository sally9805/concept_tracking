An Apartment in Mr. DODDLEWOBBLE 'S house .  --  Table ( C. ) set for breakfast for two .  --  Side-doors ( R. and L. 2 E. , D.C. and R. and L.C. ) in flat .  --  Mr. DODDLEWOBBLE discovered at table ( L.C. ) , reading paper . DODD . It 's of no use . I ca n't make head or tail of it . They ca n't be all right . It 's against reason . It 's a diabolical and premeditated outrage on common sense . Oh ! it 's a terrible thing to be forced to believe that there are beings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand and a steel pen in the other , doing these things in cold blood . What have I ever done to war-correspondents , that war-correspondents should take this fiendish delight in deceiving me ? ( Reads . ) " The enemy fled before our advancing troops , without firing a gun . " That 's well enough . I 've not the slightest objection to any number of enemies flying any number of times before any quantity of guns are fired ; not a bit of it . If that 's their peculiar way of enjoying themselves , let them enjoy themselves in their peculiar way , in Heaven 's name . No ! it 's not that : it 's this . ( Reads . ) " Our troops fled before the advancing enemy , without firing a gun . " D  --  n it ! it ca n't be both , you know . It 's perfectly distracting . ( Reads . ) " Jeff . Davis is dead . " " Jeff . Davis alive and well . " " Jeff . Davis positively dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O Lord ! O Lord ! I shall go crazy . ( Reads . ) " General Banks is advancing . " " Gen. Banks is retreating . " " Gen. Banks moves forward . " " Gen. Banks has moved backward . " " Gen. Banks will not advance . " " Gen. Banks has advanced . " " Gen. Banks was killed in a skirmish last Monday . " " Gen. Banks dined with the commander-in-chief on Tuesday . " " Gen. Banks 's body will be sent home on Wednesday . " " Gen. Banks made a reconnoissance of the enemy 's lines on Thursday . " O blazes ! ( Throwing down paper , and rising angrily . ) I ca n't go it : it 's too much . The demons of the pen and inkbottle have overcome me . They have unhinged my reason . If I should die to-day , and live till to-morrow to be dissected , my heart would show , in letters of fire : " Our war-correspondent . " The coroner 's verdict would be : " Died of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would considerately and charitably add . " We further think the deceased was of unsound mind , as he is known , on the authority of several reliable witnesses , to have been in the habit of reading the daily papers . " Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! my poor head ! Enter CSAR ( door 2 E.R. ) . CSAR . Ready for you breakfast yet , sah ? DODD . Ready for my breakfast yet , sah ? No ! I shall never be ready for my breakfast again , you black scoundrel ! CSAR . Do n't call names , massa ; do n't call names . Niggers is riz . Niggers is somebodies now . Dey mus n't be called names . You hab heard ob de impending crisis ,  --  eh , massa ? DODD . Impending crisis ! Yes : I 've heard of nothing else these thirty years . CSAR . Well , den , it am impended . Niggers is de crisis . Yes , dey is . I'se one ob de criseses . Yah , yah ! ( Laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lor , massa , dis heah war ai n't about any ob yar common white folks and your rights . No : it ai n't a-goin ' to do you any good . It 's about de niggers . Niggers is de war , massa . DODD . How dare you stand there , and talk in that way ? CSAR . ( Grinning . ) Kase niggers is de war . DODD . Get out ! Do n't talk to me ! How dare you talk politics with me ? Who the deuce are you , that you dare , eh ?  --  CSAR . Who is I ? Golly ! do n't you know ? ( Drawing himself up , and speaking with mock dignity . ) I is one ob de contrebans . DODD . ( Aghast . ) The what ? CSAR . De contrabans . I do n't know what dat is ; but I is one . DODD . Get out , you rascal ! Bring in breakfast . CSAR . I thought , massa , you was n't goin ' to eat any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm hungry now . Get out ! Bring up breakfast , and , hark you , if you ever bring me a newspaper again , I 'll break every bone in your body . CSAR . Guess not , massa . I is a man and a brudder . We ai n't ' mong de seceshers , you know . Yah , yah ! ( Exit , door , 2 E.R. ) DODD . The insolent rascal ! That is the result of getting married , and letting one 's wife have her own way . O Daniel Doddlewobble ! why did you ever resign your overwhelming charms to the tender mercies of a strong-minded wife ? Mrs. Dobblewobble  --  so strong is her antipathy to every thing Southern , and so sympathetic is she for the runaway slaves , that she has filled my house with niggers . In the garret , in the kitchen , in the parlor and the cellar ,  --  go where I will ,  --  I stumble over a nigger . My friends ask why I do n't kick against it . I reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DODDLEWOBBLE ( door 2 E.R. ) . MRS . D. Ah ! good-morning , my love ! At your papers , I see . What is the news ? DODD . All sorts of news , my dear . You pay your money , and you take your choice . What 'll you have ,  --  a victory or a defeat ? You can have news in all styles , dished up to suit the most fastidious tastes . There 's the " Morning Blower , " only one cent . Total annihilation of the Federal army by a hose-pipe . If that do n't please you , turn to another column , and you have the complete destruction of the Secession army by a proclamation from Gen. Patterson , or a leading article from the " New-York Tribune . " ( Getting excited . ) On to Richmond ! On to New Orleans ! Huzza ! On to anywhere and anybody ! All for one cent ! MRS . D. Lor , Doddlewobble ! How can you act so ? DODD . Curse it , Mrs. Doddlewobble , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe that there 's any army , any war , any navy , or any anything but newspaper extras . Yes : there is one thing more to sum up this farrago of nonsense , contradiction , and puerility ; that is the war-correspondent of the " London Times . " Never did so small a rustle make so great a noise . That is the climax . Huzza ! ( Wildly . ) MRS . D. Ah , my dear Doddlewobble ! you have no patriotism in your heart : you have no love of military movements in you . DODD . Mrs. Doddlewobble , do n't be absurd . I love the military . I adore the military . I may say , Mrs. Doddlewobble , that I go down on my knees , in a metaphorical way , every day before the shrine of the military . Do n't adore the military , Mrs. Doddlewobble ? Pshaw ! Have n't I been a colonel in my time , ma'am ? MRS . D. Yes , my dear . But you know you resigned just when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you question my courage , ma'am ? MRS . D. Oh , no , love ! Only the look of the thing , in the eyes of your country . DODD . Do n't be absurd , Mrs. Doddlewobble . The eyes of my country , indeed ! My country has n't got any eyes . Nonsense , Mrs. Doddlewobble ! If my country has any gratitude , she will erect a graceful and everlasting monument to me for resigning . Only think of it ! How many were eager to go ! Should I have stood in the way , when there were so many glorious fellows ready to take my place ? No ! Besides , how do you know that I should n't have been taken ill just before going into action ? MRS . D. Only think of the honor of coming back full of glory ! DODD . Only think of the honor of coming back full of holes ! Re-enter CSAR , with breakfast on tray ( 2 E.R. ) . CSAR . ( Singing . ) " John Brown 's bones hang dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DODD . Very well . Get out ! CSAR . Yes , sah : I 's gwine . Do n't tear your clothes ! DODD . Get out , I say ! MRS . D. Lor , Doddy , how can you be so harsh ! Is n't he a man and a brother ? DODD . I dare say , he is ; but I do n't like the relationship . Besides , this is a family quarrel . Get out ! CSAR . Yes , massa . Yah , yah ! ( Laughs . ) Guess he do n't know de dignity ob de contraband . Guess he tinks himself ob de same consequence . Massy me ! Poor , deluded white man ! ( Exit CSAR , 2 E.R. ) MRS . D. ( Pouring out coffee . ) My love , I suppose you have heard that your nephew is off for the wars ? DODD . Yes , my dear : I 'm glad of it . I like to see the noble spirit of the young man . He 's a hero . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Why , Doddlewobble , my dear , how can you be so cruel ? DODD . My love , that nephew is a weak point of mine . I 'm sure he 'll never come to good . I am in hopes that he will cease to annoy me about my ward , Clara ; for I 'm determined he shall never marry her . MRS . D. ( Suspiciously . ) Why not , my love ? Why not ? I 'm sure they are an excellent match . Perhaps you are jealous of your nephew , sir ? DODD . There ! Now she 's at it with her jealousy again ! ( Aside . ) No , my love : you are mistaken . MRS . D. Do n't tell me , sir ! I see through you . You are tired of me , and look forward to my death as the means of marrying your ward yourself . DODD . Mrs. Doddlewobble , do n't force me to become an unwilling convert to the belief that you are a lunatic . It is barely possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this union . My ward is wealthy in her own right , and my vagabond nephew has n't a penny he can call his own . He is simply a fortune-hunter ; and my duty to her dead father prevents my giving my consent to so rash a union . MRS . D. I more than suspect , Mr. Doddlewobble , that your attachment to the living daughter is of far more consequence to you than your attachment or duty to her dead father . Do n't speak , sir : I wo n't hear of it ! I know how it is . ( Sobbing . ) I 've had my eye on you for some time . DODD . ( Pulling up his shirt-collar indignantly . ) Madam , do I look like a man capable of such deeds ? Can you gaze into my mild and benevolent countenance , and tax me with such things , without blushing ? MRS . D. Then why not give your consent ? DODD . No , ma'am ! Besides , he is going off to the war . Suppose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the family name ! Do you think that the sublime name of Doddlewobble  --  a name that has come down to me pure and untarnished from a line of illustrious soap-boilers  --  is to be polluted by me ? No , ma'am ! I can bear even your suspicions to keep the Doddlewobblean name intact . MRS . D. Oh ! it 's all very well to talk such nonsense , sir ; but the girl is fretting her very heart out about him . DODD . Do n't talk rubbish , my dear . It 's a physical impossibility for her to do any such thing . Do you mean to say that you could fret your very heart out about me ? MRS . D. No ! indeed I do not . DODD . ( Discomposed . ) I did n't mean that . But let us drop the subject . MRS . D. No , sir ! ( Rising . ) I will never drop the subject ! I see plainly how it is yon do n't love me . DODD . Listen to your Doddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to hear your hateful voice again . DODD . What ? Do n't desert your Wobby , love . MRS . D. Rubbish ! I 'll go home to my pa . ( Sobbing . ) DODD . Bother her pa ! ( Aside . ) My dear  --  MRS . D. ( Shaking him . ) You 're a mean , pitiful , sneaking hypocrite ; and I 'll sue for a divorce this very day ! DODD . My love ? No , you wo n't , darling ! MRS . D. You 're right . I 'll live with you to torment your life out . I know you 'd be delighted to get rid of me . I 'm getting hysterical . Ah , ah ! I feel I am ! Ah ! ( Sits in chair , and screams . ) DODD . Infernally pleasant , this ! Here , Betty , Betty ! ( Rings bell . ) A pretty life to lead ! Betty , Betty ! ( Shouting , while his wife screams . ) Enter BETTY ( door 2 E.R. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? DODD . Yes . Take your mistress to her room , and cram a flat-iron or a pillow down her throat ! MRS . D. ( Starting up . ) Ugh , you brute ! Betty , your master is killing me by his brutality . BETTY . Lor , ma'am : why do n't you lick him ? DODD . Killing you ! No such luck . If wishing would do it  --  MRS . D. I should have been dead long ago , I suppose . DODD . Ahem ! BETTY . Come along , ma'am . Do n't mind him : he 's nobody . ( Leading her away , R. ) MRS . D. O Betty ! BETTY . ( At door , 2 E.L. ) Ugh , you brute ! ( Making a face at DODDLEWOBBLE . ) Come along , ma'am . MRS . D. ( Rushing at DODDLEWOBBLE , and shaking him violently . ) O Betty ! I 'm so weak ! BETTY . Of course you are , ma'am ; of course you are . ( Exit BETTY and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! She nearly shook my teeth down my throat . After that , I may enlist with safety . Insulted by my own servants too ! If this sort of thing goes on , I shall begin to have a slight suspicion that I am henpecked ; yes , henpecked ,  --  I , the late colonel of a regiment of State militia ! Doddlewobble , this will never do . You must assert your rights , my boy , and avenge your wrongs . Enter WALTER ( 2 E.L. ) . WALTER . Ah ! my dear uncle . DODD . Well , what the devil do you want ? WALTER . I have enlisted , uncle ; and I have come to say good-by . DODD . Not the slightest necessity to do so . However , say it , and go about your business . WALTER . But that is n't all , uncle . DODD . Oh ! that is n't all , is n't it ? Well , what more is there ? WALTER . You know , sir , how fondly and devotedly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir : I do . And you know how fondly and devotedly I have refused to listen to your addresses for her hand . WALTER . Alas ! I know it , sir ; but , notwithstanding , I have come to make one last attempt on your generosity . DODD . No , sir ! You mean you have come to make one last attempt on her fortune . I wo n't listen to it ! Young man , forbear ! WALTER . I may not come back alive . DODD . Do n't be absurd . You wo n't come back dead , will you ? WALTER . I mean , I may never see her again . DODD . Very likely . Good day , sir : I 'm busy . WALTER . O sir ! you will not be so cruel as to refuse me a last interview with her . DODD . No : I do n't refuse you a last interview with her . WALTER . Ah , generous man ! DODD . But I refuse you a first interview with her . WALTER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Aside . ) Sir ! ( Mysteriously . ) Hush ! DODD . What do you mean ? WALTER . Hush ! Are you sure nobody listens ? DODD . How do I know ? What do I care ? WALTER . Hush ! It 's all , right . DODD . What 's all right ? ( Confused . ) WALTER . Hush ! I 'm a friend : I 'm on your side . DODD . On my side ! ( Aside . ) What does he mean ? He is a lunatic . Oh ! I see how it is . He 's been trying to make sense out of the war-reports , and has gone crazy over his vain task . Keep off ! WALTER . They are here . The plot is ripe for development . In a day or so , all will be ours . DODD . Ours ! What do you mean ? ( Confused . ) WALTER . Why , you know : the wish nearest your heart . I have made your plans known to our friends . DODD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will you explain yourself , sir ? WALTER . Well , then , I received your letter , and our friends in the South are grateful to you for your kind suggestions . DODD . ( Aghast . ) Friends in the South ? WALTER . Yes : the secessionists . DODD . Secessionists ! my friends ! Will you , if you do n't want me to strangle you on the spot , condescend to explain what all this infernal mystery about secessionists , and my friends in the South , is about ? WALTER . Oh ! It 's very well carried out by you , uncle ; but it wo n't do . DODD . But it will do : it must do . WALTER . We all belong to the same party . I know your sympathies are with the South : so are mine . DODD . Monster ! avaunt ! WALTER . Oh ! nonsense , uncle . You should n't , between friends , you know . Is this letter yours ? ( Opens letter . ) DODD . Yes : certainly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to deny what you have written in it ? Listen . ( Reads . ) " Nephew , I have grave and weighty objections to the union . Your ridiculous letter about sympathy has been received . I emphatically decline to acknowledge the right you claim ; and inform you , for the last time , my sympathies are the outer way . " Did you write that ? DODD . Certainly I did . WALTER . Ah ! you admit that . " Your sympathies are the other way , " eh ? Wait a bit . ( Reads . ) " The conduct you extol if mean and pitiful in every way ; and I find the course you complain of perfectly justifiable . " Eh ? Perfectly justifiable ? DODD . Of course I do . WALTER . You admit it , then ? DODD . Certainly ; and I repeat it . Perfectly justifiable ! WALTER . Very well , sir : I am glad you do . ( Reads . ) " You speak of yielding at length . I say , sir , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weighty objections to the Union  --  sympathies the other way  --  perfectly justifiable  --  and never yield . Do you mean to say now that you do n't know what I mean ? DODD . Certainly not , sir . ( Loudly . ) I meant  --  WALTER . Hush ! Speak lower . You do n't know who may overhear us . DODD . What do I care who overhears us ? That is my reply to your last letter , asking for my ward . You asked me to give my consent to your union : I said I had grave and weighty objections to it . You wrote , that I should sympathize with your feelings : I wrote , as you have just read , my symthies were the other way . You said that my conduct was not justifiable : I wrote you , that I considered it perfectly justifiable . You wrote to me , saying I would eventually yield , and I said I never would . Where is the necessity for all this mystery ? WALTER . Nonsense ! This is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , you had objections to the Union of the States : you meant to say that the conduct of the South was perfectly justifiable . DODD . ( Aghast . ) Eh ? WALTER . That your sympathies were not with the North , but the other way . DODD . ( Overwhelmed . ) Murder ! WALTER . And that you hoped they would never yield . DODD . Why , you barefaced rascal ! you know better . WALTER . Nonsense , uncle ! It was on the strength of that belief , that I proposed you as President of a noted Secession club just started in this city ; and I joy to tell you that you are elected . DODD . Me ? What horrible mystery is this ? ( Falls in chair . ) WALTER . ( Aside . ) Poor uncle ! This has completely upset him . Ha , ha ! ( Laughs . ) Well , uncle , what do you say ? DODD . What do I say ? Why , I say that it is one of the most diabolical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of . WALTER . First-rate : you carry it off well . You 'll be an invaluable president . It 's all right . DODD . No , sir : it 's all wrong ,  --  infernally wrong , diabolically wrong , d  --  d wrong ! WALTER . I would n't advise you to say it in the hearing of any member of the club : your life would not be worth a minute 's purchase . DODD . Horrible ! WALTER . There will be a meeting here this evening . DODD . What ! here ? Monster ! WALTER . Yes , here ! Uncle , prepare for it . Get all spies out of the way : we look to you for that . DODD . We ? Look to me for that ? WALTER . Yes . I must go now . Be careful what you say : you ca n't be too prudent , you know . If any thing should leak out , you know , you will be denounced to the authorities as the ringleader ; and you would at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-by , noble President ! BETTY . ( Peeping through door , 2 E.R. ) What a old rascal master is ! ( Exit , R. 2 E. ) DODD . But , Walter  --  WALTER . All right . Good-by ! Remember to-night . ( Aside . ) Peer uncle ! he is puzzled enough . Well he may be . ( Exit , door , 2 E.L. ) DODD . Am I awake ? President of a Secession club ! Me ,  --  a man above reproach , above suspicion ! Me ,  --  a stanch and loyal Northerner ! The very thought makes me feel as if I had three inches of bowie-knife under my fourth rib . A meeting here to-night ! If I should be suspected of receiving a secessionist here  --  oh ! I already feel the soothing effects of hot tar , and adhesive feathers in the most generous profusion . This is worse than our war-correspondent . I am resolved . Here , Csar ! ( Takes teapot by the spout , and begins to ring it as though it were a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETTY ( door 2 E.R. ) . BETTY . O sir ! ( Reproachfully . ) I 'd never ha ' thought it . I knew you could abuse your poor weak and trusting wife ; but I little thought you could ha ' done it . DODD . Another mystery ! Am I going crazy ? What do you mean , you insolent menial ? BETTY . Oh , yes ! you can be sassy to me . What could I expect of a man who ill-treats his wife ? DODD . Sassy ! and to her ! Oh , this is intolerable ! Diminutive and impertinent being , insignificant and most talkative of kitchen wenches , pack up the extremely small amount of wearing apparel that you are possessed of , and depart from the mansion of Doddlewobble ! Wander forth from the palatial dwelling that refuses longer to harbor you ! BETTY . Oh , yes ! I dare say . So you want to get rid of me , that you may abuse your wife without witnesses . I wish you had me to deal with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair curl the wrong way . Oh ! just hold your jaw till I get through with you . If it war n't for your poor and abused wife , I would n't stay under your roof a single minute . DODD . I believe you : you wo n't stay any longer , wife or no wife ; so pack up . BETTY . No , I sha n't : you ai n't master here , your poor , miserable , henpecked , old noodle ! I sha n't pack up till I get orders from missus . DODD . Female ! depart , ere I annihilate you with an explosion of my pent-up dignity . BETTY . That 's pretty language for a gentleman , is n't it ? Ugh ! what could one expect ? DODD . If you do n't get out , I 'll have you taken out , neck and heels . BETTY . Oh ! you will , will you , Mr. President ? DODD . ( Aghast . ) Eh ? BETTY . Mr. Secesher ! you will , will you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll have a good time of it when you 're found out . What a gay old toot you 'll be put through ! DODD . Put through ! O Lord ! BETTY . So you 're a Southerner . DODD . No , Betty : on my soul , no ! Silence ! Would you ruin me ? ( Gives her a coin . ) BETTY . ( Contemptuously . ) A half-dollar ! Poh ! Do you think I am to be bribed to silence ? DODD . Mercenary but powerful being , there 's another . BETTY . ( Indignantly . ) Two half-dollars ! When his neck is in danger , too ! DODD . Fatal , vindictive , and fearfully exorbitant being of the gentler sex , here is another . BETTY . Three half-dollars ! I scorns the bribe ! ( Puts money in her pocket . ) I heard all about it , and missus shall know all about it too . DODD . Insatiable and fiendish tormenter , here is a five-dollar bill . ( Gives money . ) Will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true patriot , should be thus bled by a corrupt and heartless domestic ! Will that do ? BETTY . For the present ; but I must have the privilege of going out when I will . DODD . You can go out , and never come back again , if you want . BETTY . I must have company whenever I choose ; and must have the privilege of seeing them in the parlor when they come , and of asking them to tea if I wish . DODD . All shall be yours , if you 'll only let me make the tea . Would n't you like me to get up , and light the fires , and take in the milk , and do the washing ; making a pleasant wind-up by scouring the kitchen-floor ? BETTY . Well , since you press it so kindly , I give my consent , and do n't mind if you do . DODD . Serpent on my family hearthstone  --  ( Violently ) . BETTY . Very well , sir : if you take it in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to my country , and denounce you as a traitor . DODD . Oh , no , Betty ! in the day of your power , be merciful . BETTY . Do n't think I can , sir . Consider my dooty to my country . DODD . Consider your dooty to the cause of humanity , Betty . I am innocent of this foul charge : I will swear it on my knees . See me swear it on my knees ! ( Kneels . ) There , Betty ! Enter Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE ( door 2 E.R. ) . MRS . D. What do I see ? On his knees to the housemaid ! The monster ! DODD . My wife ! Murder ! Here 's luck ! ( Exit , running , 1 E.R. ) MRS . D. The heartless monster ! I 'll give it to him ! ( Exit , running after Mr. DODDLEWOBBLE , 1 E.R. ) BETTY . There goes a happy couple . Only think that master is such a unnatural villain as to go and conspire against his country in that horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it was n't for my mercy and consideration , and for my disinterested silence , what would become of him ? Enter WALTER , cautiously ( 2 E.L. ) . WALTER . Betty ! BETTY . Ah ! ( Retreating . ) Keep back , you unnatural revolutionizer ! Keep back , or I 'll scream ! WALTER . What , Betty ! do n't you know me ? BETTY . Yes : I know you . I overheard your conversation with master a little while-ago . WALTER . Ah , then ! good ! That does away with the necessity of my telling you all about it . It was only part of a little scheme I have in view , with the object of compelling him to consent to the union of myself and Clara . BETTY . Honor bright ? WALTER . Honor bright , of course . BETTY . Lord bless me ! How well you did it ! WALTER . Now , I want you to assist me ; and , if I succeed , I 'll give you twenty dollars . BETTY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Walter : you 've only to command , and I 'll obey . WALTER . I want you to give Clara this letter from me . BETTY . It 's all fair , I hope . WALTER . Have no fear , Betty : I 'd scorn to do any thing mean or contemptible , even to gain the hand of her I love better than life itself . You need have no fear . BETTY . ( Taking letter . ) I believe you , sir : she shall have the letter . Bless me , sir ! the poor thing frets her very life away along of you . She does n't smile from morning till night ; and , since she has heard that you are going off to the wars , she has scarcely eaten a meal . WALTER . I am sorry for that , Betty ; but I can not be a laggard , nor make an excuse for not fighting for my country in such a glorious cause as the present , even to gain the happiness of her I love . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I delayed to go when called upon ; at least , if she is the woman of spirit I take her to be . Some one is coming : I can not delay longer .

Lor , how different from master ! I should n't mind marrying him myself . Enter CSAR ( door 2 E.R. ) . CSAR . Ah ! you is dere , Miss Betty , is you ? BETTY . Ca n't you see I am ? CSAR . You am de bery party I want to see . I has been looking for you . BETTY . Well , what 's the matter ? CSAR . I want you to take a good look at me . ( Turns around . ) Does you observe my elegance and divine perporshuns ? Well , den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de present moment ? BETTY . Your consequence ! What do you mean ? CSAR . ( Fervently clasping his hands . ) Miss Betty , you sees afore you one ob de oppressed race ob Africa . You sees afore you one ob dat glorious tribe what has produced de present extraordinary state ob affairs . Need I allude to de contrabans ? You perceive my meaning . Well , den , in de spirit ob prophecy , I foresee dat de day is not far distant , when de darkey will be de most consequential man in dis yeah country , especially in de hub ob de universe . It am not unlikely dat I may be de President ob dese United States ewentually . Yah , yah ! BETTY . But you forget , Csar , they are not united at present . CSAR . No , Miss Betty ; but dey 're goin ' to be : you may bet high on dat . Well , den , in de ewent transpiring , and de possibility ob my being elected president , or , at de least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in advance , de honor ob my hand and my heart . ( Taking a grotesque position . ) BETTY . Get out , you black stick of sealing-wax ! Do you think I 'd marry a nigger ? CSAR . Why not ? Dat 's only ' malgamation , after all . Guess you be glad enuf one ob dese days , when de nigger wo n't be so willin ' . You 'd better tink twice afore you rejects it . BETTY . Nonsense ! do n't annoy me . If you talk to me about it again , I 'll pull your wool ! CSAR . Wery well . You does n't understand de dignity and de condescension of this heah contraban . ( Calmly , and with mock dignity . ) Wery well ; I takes it all back again : only I tells you aforehand , you 'll be sorry when I'se gobernor , and de late gobernor is awaitin ' in de lobby to know my commands . Good-day , miss ! I takes it all back . ( Going , 2 E.R. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BETTY . Come here , Csar . ( Advancing to him . ) CSAR . ( Grinning . ) Well , Miss Betty , does you repent ? ( Advancing . ) BETTY . Yes , Csar . Come closer . ( When CSAR is within arm 's length , BETTY boxes his ears and scratches him . ) There , there , there ! ( Exit CSAR , 2 E.R. , pursued by BETTY . ) Re-enter Mr. DODDLEWOBBLE ( 1 E.R. ) . DODD . Well , this has been a blessed day for me . This is a delightful sort of life for a patriot and a Doddlewobble to lead . But I 'm determined not to stand it : I 'll pack up , and get out of the way at once . ( Going , L. ) Enter FUDGIT ( 2 E.L. ) . FUDGIT . ( Looking around mysteriously . ) Humph ! DODD . Halloo ! another adventure ! Who can this be ? FUDGIT . Hush ! DODD . It 's cursedly annoying , that a man is to be so perpetually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's your business ? FUDGIT . Hush ! It 's all right . You 're Doddlewobble . DODD . Well , what of it ? FUDGIT . I 'm here ! ( Mysteriously . ) DODD . Mysterious and incomprehensible mortal , do you think I 'm blind ? I see you 're here . The fact that you 're here is exceedingly gratifying , or no doubt ought to be ; only I ca n't see it , for the soul ef me , in the same light . Your intelligence is very remarkable . You first tell me I 'm Doddlewobble ; and , next , that you 're here . The next gratifying piece of information to me will be , that you 're pitched out of that window , if you do n't tell me why you 're here . FUDGIT . Hush ! You know . DODD . Do I ? FUDGIT . I 'm Fudgit . DODD . Are you ? FUDGIT . Sworn to secrecy ! DODD . Oh ! I 'm glad of that . What secrecy ? FUDGIT . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the devil is it ? FUDGIT . Hush ! some one comes ! Conceal me ! By our sacred bond of brotherhood , I command you ! DODD . ( Puzzled . ) Brotherhood ! It ! This must be a lunatic of the first water . What do you mean ? FUDGIT . Secesh ! noble president . Ah ! they are here . ( Exit FUDGIT , hastily , door L.C. ) DODD . Secesh ! President ! It ! Oh ! I see it all . It is one of the deluded members of that club of which I am the unconscious and innocent president . I am lost ! ( Sinks in a chain , overwhelmed . ) If he is found here , and his purpose known , tar and feathers will be an angelic mercy to what I may expect . I 'll not wait to pack up : I 'll off at once . ( Going , L. ) Enter BLIMBER ( door 2 E.L. ) . BLIMBER . Hush ! DODD . Another one ! O Lord ! He looks a bloodthirsty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know me . ( Mysteriously . ) DODD . Wonderfully developed being , you are right : I do not . BLIMBER . It 's all right . DODD . Is it ? BLIMBER . I 'm a detective . DODD . O Lord ! ( Tumbles faintly against him . ) BLIMBER . Why , what 's the matter ? DODD . Nothing . He is n't here : I assure you , he is n't . BLIMBER . He ! who ? Ah ! DODD . Nobody . I nearly let it out . ( Aside . ) BLIMBER . Oh ! Well , then , you must know that I have received information  --  ah ! Somebody comes ! Do n't betray my secret , as you value your safety . ( Exit BLIMBER , door R.C. ) DODD . No , I wo n't . Oh , dear me ! There 's a blessing for a strictly conscientious man ! Talk about a man 's house being his-castle ! It 's all rubbish : it 's his prison . Here have I got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective officer in the other , equally unwelcome . If I betray the Southerner , I shall be taken up as his accomplice ; and , if I do n't , I shall be arrested just the same , when he is found here concealed . O Lord ! President of a club , too ! Bowie-knives  --  tar  --  feathers ! Bless me ! I 'm a lost man ! I 'll make one more effort to escape . ( Going , L. ) Enter RACKET ( door 2 E.L. ) . RACKET . Hush ! ( Mysteriously . ) DODD . Oh ! it 's of no use . I resign myself to my fate . I know you . ( Wildly . ) Hush ! it 's all right ! I 'm here ! Do n't mind me ! Secesh ! It ! All right ! Some one is coming . ( Starting for door 2 E.L. ) RACKET . Hold ! ( Taking DODDLEWOBBLE to extreme L. ) Are we alone ? DODD . D  --  n it ! ca n't you see we are ? BLIMBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush ! ( Exit . ) RACKET . What 's that ? DODD . There 's the detective ! I 'm lost ! Doddlewobble , prepare yourself for tar . RACKET . We are brothers . ( Taking him to extreme R. ) FUDGIT . Hush ! ( From door L.C. ; then exit . ) RACKET . Again that sound ! DODD . Oh , it 's nothing ! Merely the cockroaches coughing . It 's that confoundedly bloodthirsty rascal ! What shall I do ? O Doddlewobble ! prepare yourself for the accompanying feathers . ( Aside . ) I 'll brazen it out . Ha , ha ! ( Laughs . ) Yes : a devilish good story ! Laugh , you scoundrel ! ( Choking RACKET . ) RACKET . Ha , ha ! ( Laughs . ) DODD . Yes , very good . Ha , ha ! So strange ! Laugh ! RACKET . Hush ! Take this , and prepare . ( Places large bowie-knife in DODDLEWOBBLE 'S hand . ) This evening , all will be settled : you have been chosen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep ! Hush ! we must be cautious . ( Going to door R.C. ) DODD . No , not there ! Here ! ( Takes him by throat , and kicks him into cupboard , L.C. , with FUDGIT . ) What is to prevent my committing a violent and justifiable homicide on the persons of these miscreants ? Oh , if I were not afraid of the consequences ! This has got to end somewhere : it ca n't go on for ever . I begin to feel desperate . Ha , ha ! It 's rather funny : it 's a devilish good joke . It 's rather gratifying than otherwise to have one 's life in perpetual danger . I have rather grown to like the peculiarly gratifying sensation of having cold perspiration run down the middle of my back : it 's quite of a piece with my becoming , in the course of half an hour , a sanguinary president of a sanguinary club , with the most sanguinary of sanguinary bowie-knives in my sanguinary hand . Ha , ha ! Talk of war-correspondents ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand it much longer : I feel I ca n't . It 's worse than being a popular candidate for the presidency . I 'd much rather be in the Secretary of the Navy 's shoes , as uncomfortable as they are . I never was overburthened with brains ; but I know I 've got some , by the peculiarly burning sensation I feel in that precise spot at the present moment . I 'm going ! Another blow , and I 'm up in the air ! I 'll become a blissful cherrybum ! Enter CSAR ( 2 E.R. ) . CSAR . ( Mysteriously . ) Hush ! secesh ! DODD . You villain , you are doomed ! ( Kicks him out , 2 E.R. , after shaking him . ) Enter BETTY ( door 2 E.R. ) . BETTY . Hush ! they 're here , sir ! Mum ! DODD . They are , are they ? Send them away again . BETTY . They wo n't go , sir : they 've all got knives and pistols in their coat-bosoms . DODD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALTER ( door 2 E.L. ) . WALTER . They are all here , sir . DODD . Monster ! ( Catching him by the collar , and shaking him . ) I 'll throttle you ! Get me out of this confounded scrape you have got me into , or I 'll assassinate you on the spot ! WALTER . But , sir , consider . The club  --  DODD . I ca n't consider any thing . ( Shakes him . ) BETTY . Master , let him go ! I wo n't stand by , and see you abuse him . ( Beats DODDLEWOBBLE . ) Enter Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE ( 1 E.R. ) . MRS . D. What do I see ? An assault on my husband ! ( She pummels WALTER , and then pulls off BETTY 'S cap . BETTY leaves DODDLEWOBBLE , and fights with Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE . ) DODD . Monster , recant ! WALTER . ( Striking DODDLEWOBBLE in the stomach . ) Let go ! DODD . ( Gasping . ) Monster ! Release me from this horrid quandary ! ( Gasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . ) WALTER . Help me to part the women ! ( They part BETTY and Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE . ) BETTY . ( Squaring at Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE . ) Ah ! let her come on ! MRS . D. ( In chair , R. , screaming . ) Ah ! BETTY . ( In chair , L. , screaming . ) Ah ! DODD . ( Distracted . ) This is delightful ! WALTER . I tell you what I 'll do . Give me your ward , and I 'll send these men about their business . DODD . You will ? Take her , and be hanged ! WALTER . ( Going to door R. ) Come along , Blimber . It 's all right : I do n't want you any more . The old fellow has yielded . ( Aside . ) BLIMBER . All right . ( Going , R. ) I 'll see you at the camp . DODD . He has suborned the detective ! Can such things be ? BLIMBER . Hush ! ( Mysteriously , to DODD . ) DODD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see you again , old fellow . Get out now ! ( Aside to BLIMBER . ) ( Exit BLIMBER , 2 E.R. ) DODD . Now for the others . WALTER . I have your word that I may wed your ward ? MRS . D. Yes , that you have ! I 'll answer for him , Walter . DODD . Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE  --  ( Firmly . ) MRS . D. ( Sitting in chair , and screaming again . ) Ah ! DODD . Yes ! you have my word . ( Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE silent . ) WALTER . ( Going to door L.C. ) Come along , boys . Follow Blimber , and meet me at the camp . It 's all right . FUDGIT . All right . Hush ! ( Mysteriously , to DODDLEWOBBLE . ) RACKET . All right . Hush ! ( Mysteriously , to DODDLEWOBBLE . ) DODD . ( Starting . ) The miscreants ! ( Exit RACKET and FUDGIT , door 2 E.R. ) WALTER . Now , sir , I claim the fulfilment of your promise . DODD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrieking again . ) Ah ! BETTY . ( Shrieking again . ) Ah ! DODD . I consent . Go and find her . ( Exit WALTER , door 2 E.L. ) Oh , what a happy release from this day of troubles ! It sha n't happen again ; for I 'll off to Europe by the next steamer . As for you , miss ( to BETTY ) , get down to your kitchen , and do n't let me see your face here again , or I 'll tumble you , neck and heels , into the street . ( Takes BETTY by nape of her neck , and leads her off , door 2 E.L. ) Now , Mrs. DODDLEWOBBLE , what am I to understand by your conduct ? MRS . D. O Doddy ! forgive me for my silly jealousy : I will never be so silly again . DODD . Never let it be said that a Doddlewobble was unforgiving . Embrace me , my love ! Enter WALTER with CLARA ( 2 E.R. ) . WALTER . ( Kneels with CLARA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) , and be d  --  d ! WALTER . Thank you , sir . In a few days , I must depart with my regiment ; and , if I should be fortunate enough to return , you will not find me ungrateful . My only wish was to wed my dear Clara before I went off to the war . CSAR enters ( door 2 E.L. ) , followed by BETTY . CSAR . Here de last extra , sah ? ( Gives paper . ) DODD . Ah ! give it me ! ( Takes paper . ) Ah ! ( Reads . ) What do I see ? Another battle ! Price and Mulligan ! What ! have Ned Price and Billy Mulligan been at it again ? " One , P.M.  --  We are informed , on the best authority , that the Government has received positive evidence of the death of Jeff Davis . " Huzza ! What 's this ? ( Reads . ) " Two o'clock , P.M.
