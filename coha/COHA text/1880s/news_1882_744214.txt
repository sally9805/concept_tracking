txt The question of regulating primary elections has occupied the attention of the Assembly on two successive Monday evenings , and is to come up again in a modified shape next Monday . It has lost much of its im portance by the substitution of the Unapin bill for those introduced by Messrs . HICKMAN and BROOKS , but a proposition that contemplates even a beginning of reform is not without interest . The Chapin bill applies only to the city of Brooklyn , and is aimed simply at some of the abuses of the caucus system as at present existing . Such as it is , it has received the approval of the General Committees of both parties in the city directly concerned , and has a better prospect of being adopted than any more radical measure . It prohibits any person at a primary election from voting under any other name than his own , or from voting at all if he is not entitled to do so ; it forbids the concealing or destroying of ballots , provides for administering an oath when votes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not and perhaps could not provide any adequate means of determining whether a person offering to vote in a party caucus is entitled to do so as a member of the party holding the same . It is a difficult matter to define in advance the party status of any man and to determine what shall constitute the right to act in a Republican or a Democratic caucus . Practically it would be left under this bill , as it is now , to the local committees of each party to decide , and it is understood that the Brooklyn committees are disposed to regard a pledge to support the candidates to be nominated as the test of party standing . This would certainly not be consistent with the views of many of the independent citizens who desire a reform of primary elections . The bill introduced by Mr. RUSSELL in the Senate and briefly considered on Thursday appears to be substantially , if not identically , the same as the Chapin bill . Perhaps a measure of this kind would be useful as an entering wedge and as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little confidence that even if its operation should be extended to other cities than Brooklyn or to the State generally it would solve the question of regulating primaries . It is a difficult matter to deal directly by law with party organizations and their methods of action , aside from the doubt that exists as to the constitutional power of the Legislature to do so . Though the bill introduced by Mr. BROOKS has doubtless been set aside for the present session , it can not be regarded as dead . In principle and substance it was the same as that introduced last year , and received far more respectful attention than it did a twelvemonth ago . The principle at least survives , and we are inclined to believe that it furnishes the ortly adequate solution of the problem of securing to the people the power of selecting their own candidates for office . It would provide for no interference with party organization or party action as such , and would leave to each citizen the dete  --  minaton of his own political status . It would simply establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to be preliminary to the other and to serve the purpose of evolving by popular choice the candidates to be finally voted for . Each voter would be left free in his selection ' among the candidates who would be presented for nomination , and would need only to have his ballot indorsed with the name of the party for which he individually made his nomination . The principal objection made to this plan of legalized primaries is that it would involve the machinery and expense of two elections following closely upon each other . It would , however , only require the application of the same machinery twice , and it is doubtful if the expense o a political canvass would be increased by it if we take into account the irregular expense attending the maintenance of the caucus system . So far as the demand made upon the time of the citizen is concerned , it would be far less than that of attending caucuses if this is done with any degree of zeal or effect . The main difference would be that citizens might be induced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of the law , when they would not take part in the rough contests of caucuses where their rights would be little regarded and their action might have no , effect . And it may be suggested that there is no absolute need of having a political canvass every year . It would be far better to have it once in two years , with nominations and elections alike controlled by the people , under the sanction and regulation of law . If such a system were once in operation it would probably be found that politics would be much less exacting upon the time and energies of the people , while the results of political action would be far more satisfactory than at present . This reform has made encouraging progress in the last year , and each repetition of the abuses of the caucus system will serve to impress its importance and necessity upon the minds of the people and promote its final success . Meantime no harm can be done by the experiment proposed for the city of Brooklyn .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
