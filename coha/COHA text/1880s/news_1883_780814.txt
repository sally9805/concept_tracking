txt There was an immense assemblage at the dedication of the New-England Congregational Church to-day . Among the ministers present were the venerable Rev. Dr. George B. Cheever. of New-York ; the Rev. Dr. Barbour , of Yale College ; and the Rev. Dr. Yerkes , of Plainfield , N. J. The principal interest centred in the dedicatory address by the Rev. Joseph Cook , of Boston . He said it was the business of the church to echo God . His topic was the mischief of a fractional orthodoxy and the worth of an integral orthodoxy . The church ought to tell only the truth and nothing but the truth , but the whole truth concerning religion . The axis of orthodoxy is the proposition that God 's opinion ought to be ours . The tendency of all heresy is the idea that man 's opinion ought to govern God . Individualism ends in a blasphemous view of the universe that God ought to be governed by man 's idea of righteousness , and that in the end , perhaps , there would be much in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Follow Me . " He would add to this central proposition two illustrative passages : First , " Ye can not serve God and Mammon ; " second , " Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God . " Christ 's teaching was integral . It had a rational and also a spiritual side . Our faith is an arch on either side of Christ . The keystone . Jesus , was a philosopher who went to the roots of religious truth . He had heard New-England Congregationalists accused of not emphasizing the rational side of Christianity , of being too rational , of depending too much on philosophical considerations ; but Jonathan Edwards was a seer as well as a philosopher . New-England orthodoxy bad believed the vision of the soul was worth something as well as reason . The address discussed at length the relations of the rational and sPirithal , the scientific and mystic side of truth .
