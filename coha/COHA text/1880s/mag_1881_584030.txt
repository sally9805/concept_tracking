THE PEOPLE 'S PROBLEM. -I . INTRODUCTORY . IN the Preamble to the Constitution of the State of Massachusetts , framed in the year 1780 , are these words : " The end of the institution , maintenance , and administration of government is to secure the existence of the body politic , to protect it , and to furnish the individuals who compose it with the power of enjoying in safety and tranquillity their natural rights , and the blessings of life : and whenever these great objects are not obtained , the people have a rz*ht to alter the government , and to take measures necessary for their safety , prosperity , and happiness . " The time has come for the people to exercise this " right to alter the government . " We have , no doubt , accomplished under our present political system great results . We have become a very prosperous people . We have established it as a fact , that , so long as human nature remains substantially what it now is , free speech , a free press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all men before the law , are the only safe and sure foundations for a government . But we have just seen a most singular spectacle . The people of the largest and richest city in the country have made a most earnest effort to be allowed to clean their own streets with their own money , and to secure their own lives against the dangers of pestilence ,  --  and the effort has failed . The reason why it has failed is that the people 's own officials , the very men who should have done the work , have made a powerful combination to hinder the work from being done . It has been a battle , between the people on the one side and the men who should be their honest servants on the other side ,  --  and the servants have won the battle . Singularly , too , in this matter , which has been on the part of the citizens nothing but an effort to save life , we have seen our public officials , of the National , State , and City governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of one city . We have substantially the same state of things in nearly every large center of wealth and population in the country ,  --  public officials are banded together to draw money from the public treasury instead of doing well the public work . We have the same condition of things in our State legislatures . The people 's work is not well done . The people 's offices are not used for the people 's purposes . And at the national capital , where VOL . XXII. - 28. we ought to have a body of public servants watching over the nation 's welfare , the people 's representatives are wasting their time in a mere struggle for place . Great national questions need to be wisely handl6d by the men who control our national affairs . But the men who are highest in the nation 's service have brought the business of the people of the United States to a stand-still , while they wrangle over the appointment of door-keepers and revenue officials . The people are angry . They do well to be angry ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at certain men ; they should be angry at the system , which has made the men what they are . Our political machinery has a radical , fundamental fault . The material which we use in our public service is the same that we use in all private industrial enterprises , - men- human nature . In private life the material serves its uses most nobly . Yet in our public affairs we have become so accustomed to downright robbery at the hands of men holding public place , that the whole community gives a sigh of relief , when Congress or a State legislature adjourns , at the thought that their power for evil is for a time ended . Yet most of these men who fill our public offices are , in private life , honest men . But to say that there is some fault in our political machinery avails nothing . We must go further than that , and find precisely and accurately what the fault is . To find out what the precise fault is , if we stop there , will avail little . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the precise remedy is not enough . We must go further , and convince men that the remedy can be applied ,  --  must show how it can be applied . This , then , is the problem which the people of the United States have to stAve-it is to find : ( i ) The precise fault in our political machinery . ( 2 ) The precise remedy for the fault . ( * ) The precise manner of applying the remedy . The present series of papers is the contribution of one individual among the people to the effort of the people to solve this problem . No one man can ever hope to solve it alone . But , each giving in his // own thought , in due time the combined wisdom of the whole people will work out a complete result , as it has often done before . THE GROWTH OF THE ELECTION MACHINE . THE matter first in order is to find what is the precise fault in our political machinery . And the plan of this branch of the inquiryas to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i ) The main purpose of the people in framing , one hundred years ago , our present system of government . ( 2 ) The main idea in the people 's mind which led them to form that purpose . ( * ) The main features of the system as they have developed . ( i . ) The result which the system , as developed , has actually given . ( * ) The main reasons why the system has given that result ; and then ( 6 ) The nature and sufficiency of the main remedies proposed . I. The main purpose of the people in framing , one hundred years ago , our present system of government , was to have a people 's government , in other words , that ( i ) The people themselves , by turns , should do the public work . ( 2 ) Public officers , the chief ones , should be chosen by the people . ( * ) Public officers should represent the people 's will . ( * ) Public officers should be responsible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the people themselves-should not be centralized in the hands of the people 's officials . II . The main idea in the people 's mind , which led them to form that purpose , was that public officials could not be trusted . The political history of the English people , down to that time , and of the colonists , had been in the main a struggle of the people against the king for the liberties of the subject or citizen . To their mind , government was , in a measure , a contest , between the people and their rulers , for freedom . And , in their minds , the main point to be secured by a written constitution , was liberty . A constitution was , above all things , a bill of rights . III . The main features of the system , as they have developed , were-in National , State , and local governments alike ( i ) Elections were to be held by direct vote of the people . ( 2 ) Elective officers were to be very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and short . ( * ) No power was to be vested wholly in the hands of any one man or body of men . Especially the chief executive was not to have the power of appointing and removing his subordinates . IV . As a result , the system has given us , not a people 's government , but the tyranny of an election machine . ( i ) It has turned the Government into an election machine . The new conditions under which we now live have developed faults in our political machinery which were not foreseen . When this National Government was framed , no one knew what the direct vote of the people was to become . No one thought how many these elective offices were to be , what a mass of this election work would have to be done , or how large a number of public officials we were to have . We are now fifty millions of people ; our public officials number probably three hundred thousand men . The work of holding these frequent elections has become something enormous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the results have come , it will be necessary to examine . Election districts have become very large . The Mayor of the city of New York is now chosen by the direct vote of about two hundred thousand electors , the Governor of the State of New York by a vote of about one million , and the President of the United States by a direct vote ( for the electoral college is only a formal thing ) of about ten millions . The only elections with which the framers of our constitutions were familiar were the elections by the town-meetings , where the voters of one small town , all of them neighbors known to one another , met in one place , and acted as one body . The choosing a chief executive by the votes of ten million electors was a thing not then known . Elective offices have become very many . Elections in the time of our ancestors were confined to the choice of two or three town officials , with one or two representatives to the colonial legislatures . At a general election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each citizen may cast his vote for the following officials : a Governor , Judges of the Court of Appeals , Justices of the Supreme Court , Secretary of State , Comptroller , State Treasurer , Attorney-General , State Engineer and Surveyor , // 355 District Attorneys , County Judges , State Senators , Members of Assembly , Sheriffs , County Clerks , Coroners , Representatives to Congress , thirty-five Presidential Electors and , in addition , for the many city and town officials , who are made elective . Elections , too , of all these officials are very frequent . Many of them are reelected each year . Few terms are longer than three years . This result then follows : Assuming that every single man in the whole country , office-holder and private citizen , is moved only by an honest wish to serve the common interests of the whole people , it is necessary , from the great size of the election districts , the great number of voters , and the great number of officers to be voted for , that there should be combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be any possibility of a choice at the election . These combinations must be national , for elections are national . These combinations must have their branches , and agents , and members in every State , city , and town . This involves a very large membership . They must then have heads , organization , and discipline , or they will have nothing but hopeless confusion . The next result which follows is this : The work which these organizations have to do is so vast , that the ordinary citizens who have to follow their ordinary daily callings can not possibly take the time to do it . Here are nominations for thousands of offices to be made , through all parts of the country ; millions of ballots are to be printed ; these ballots must be in the hands of trusted agents at every voting-place in every State , and , to pay for all this work , money must be found . The work certainly falls into the hands of professionals , who give to it their whole time and thought . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , new sets of professionals , but one or another set of professionals will always do this work , so long as there is so great a mass of it to be done . Some men have an idea that one or two evenings in a year spent in caucus primary meetings will set right all the affairs of this National Government . There could be no greater delusion . The work of these election organizations is all done long before the primaries meet . It must be so . Every large organized body is controlled by the men at the head , and those men at the head do their work before the primary meetings are held . The men who attend the primary meetings merely witness the very end of the last scene of the last act of the play , when the performers come forward hand in hand and make their combined parting salutations to the audience . The men who do and control the work of these election organizations give to it more than two or three hours in one or two evenings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the men must do , who are to do so great a work , and do it so well . We have , next , this vital point : The fact that our highest officials , who are elected , hold their places only for a fixed term of years compels all our officials , the lowest and highest , alike and together , to become the members , and do the work , of these election organizations . Naturally , the men who control the election organizations take for themselves the chief offices  --  the offices which control the appointment of subordinates . The chief officials at the end of their term have another election to carry , and they know that they will not be able to carry it , or even get a nomination , without the support of the election organization . They can not get the support of the men who do the election work , unless they pay for the work with appointments to office . On the other hand , the holders of the subordinate offices know that their superiors are compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do election work . The subordinates are thus driven to do that work in order to save their places . Both sets of officials , then , the lowest who are not elected as well as the highest who are , are compelled by this one powerful common interest , which presses on every man , to do the work on which they all depend for their future ,  --  to do election work instead of the people 's work , and to use the people 's offices and the people 's power for the benefit of the election organization instead of the people . But it is the pressure on the men at the head which makes the effect on the men below , and on the whole body . We may say that this is not a proper way of using the people 's offices . That is very true . The men who so use the offices know that as well as we do . And they would be glad to use the offices for the natural purpose , to have honest work done in an honest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not their wish to endanger life and health . They are compelled to do it by a pressure that they can not resist . We private citizens , in our efforts to do right , have commonly // to deal with the temptations of only one individual ; and a reasonable number of men get on passably well under that burden . But each man in our public service , in his every effort to do what is right , is subjected to the combined pressure of the combined interest of the whole army of office-holders ,  --  and it is too much . While , too , our public officials are at all times under this great pressure which makes them do election work , the main body of the citizens are comparatively under no pressure at all which will lead them to do that work . The ordinary citizen is only indirectly and remotely affected by the results of elections . With our public officers it is a question of bread . And the men who secure the grand prizes in politics and achieve the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we point in our whole present list of public men to more than one or two who have done any great service to the people , or who have , from such service , gained any reputation ? Men will do the work which pays them best . Human nature is , for the present , thus constituted . Another element is now gaining great importance . This election work costs large sums of money . The carrying of elections is coming to be a question of the longest purse . It is now fast becoming an impossible thing for any man to get a nomination for public office who can not command , in his favor , the payment of large sums of money . It is stated , among well.informed men , and is generally believed to be true , that it now costs at least fifteen thousand dollars for a nomination to a seat on the bench in either of the highest courts in the city of New York . For a long time it has been well understood that money , to some amount , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a political campaign . But where , in these days , is the limit , either in kind or amount , to " legitimate *xpenses** ? There is no doubt that , at this day , nominations to public office are often bought outright , and paid for in money . And what difference is there in the result to the people , whether the article sold is an election , or a nomination which insures an election ? The position , then , is this : On the one hand , the election work is so vast and so continuous , it requires the use of so many men , the management of such large organizations , and the expenditure of such large sums of money , that ordinary citizens can not do it . On the other hand , the pressure upon our public officials is so great that they must do it . The result is , they do do it . And they can do little else . These men who should be doing our public work are always doing election work . Our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of pound-keepers and presidents ,  - -  election work by day , and election work by night ,  --  one year and the next year . We turn our government into an election machine . The work of the election machine is done , always quickly and well . The work of the people-that is to be done-when the election work is finished That is , however , only the beginning , - only the first-fruits of the system . We must trace the other results . ( 2 ) This election machine virtually disfranchises the people ,  --  destroys the free choice by the people of their public officers . We are looking now at what is-not at theories of what should be . I do not mean that the citizen , on the day of election , has not a choice between two sets of printed ballots , or that he is forced to vote one of them rather than the other by a bayonet or a policeman 's club . But the purpose of an election is to have citizens use their judgments as to men , and not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point which I shall here try to establish is , that under our present system , the people do not and can not use their judgment as to men . The people become a mere attachment of the election machine , and register its decrees . The details of the growth , of the development , are these : In the first place , the system makes it necessary for the individual voter , and for each small district , to act with some national organization . When the day of election comes , the single voter finds his one voice of no value-he can not be heard . He must combine with other men . A large number of men in only one town are of no value . They must combine with other men in other towns . A large number of men in a single State ( in a national election ) are of no value . They must combine with other men in other States . And these combinations must be made long before the election comes . Unless the voter wishes to throw his vote away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end the national organization , however it may begin , will certainly fall into the hands of professionals . The process of election cen // 357 tralizes : the individual voter and the single district become nothing ; the national organization becomes everything . These national organizations , however they may begin , in course of time become two . Some of the peoples on the European continent have not yet enjoyed the perfect fruit of the perfect system . But to have more than two such organizations defeats the purpose of having any . We have only two . That is the form of our growth . The vote of the individual , in course of time , becomes merely a vote against one of these two organizations . Usually , as far as concerns the real work which our officers are to do ,  --  the work of cleaning streets , building aqueducts and sewers , regulating canals and railroads , man aging the post-office and our national police , the army and navy ,  --  the men of one organization are really no worse than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to think so . As to either set of men , he really knows little or nothing . But when electionday comes , everything is massed . The voter forgets the matter of men . It is not then , to his mind , a question whether this man or that man will better clean the streets , or manage the army and post-office , but it is the matter of handing over the control of the whole government , National , State , and local combined , to the other organization . And this result seems to him a great danger , in comparison with which individual men are not to be weighed . He then votes , not on men , but on organizations , and not so much for his own organization , as against the other one . For I venture to say that there is not an intelligent Democrat in the country who is not thoroughly disgusted with the acts , for the last ten years , of the professional politicians of his own organization , nor is there an intelligent Republican who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . The honest , clear-minded men of both organizations ( and those men are the large majority of both ) are entirely of one mind ,  --  that the professional politicians on both sides do as badly as men can ; but the voters on each side fear the machine men on the other side a little more than they do their own . These two organizations have , at last , through the operation of natural laws , become only the two parts of one machinery . The gradual adaptation of these election organizations to their work , in accordance with the regular processes of growth , uhder which organs vary to serve the needs of the individual organism , and individual organisms vary to serve the needs of all nature , has gradually made these election organizations fitted to their ends , and has made them lose all the connection they ever had with real public measures . They began with being combinations of citizens , based on real differences of opinion , as to matters . which at the time deeply interested the people . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle for plunder . The men who do the voting still have their differences of opinion on different matters . The men who do the acting , who divide the offices , take any set of opinions ( as organizations ) which will serve their purpose . They are compelled to do so . It is not their wish , but they must fit their wares to their market . They are under the necessity of carrying elections . They make their principles , or rather their platforms , to fit this necessity . No doubt there are many men of honest intentions in the nominating conventions of the day . But itis well understood how platforms are made , by the mere stringing together of a few sounding and glittering generalities which every one agrees to , and by striking out everything bearing on matters of real practical interest which may make any danger of losing votes . We talk of the declarations of principles in platforms , and of platforms being good or bad-how much longer are we to amuse ourselves with this nonsense ? The men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two great organizations of this present day profess to make much of the difference between centralization and decentralization . Each organization alike is in favor of centralization of power in its own hands , and of decentralization of power in the hands of the other ,  --  and that is all the difference between them . Their " platforms " are mere words . These two sets of professional election-managers , who pretend to have these great differences over great questions , are playing two parts in a farce . Either one of them will trade with the other for half of the people 's offices , when they can not have the whole . It is perfectly well understood that , in the city of New York , the same set of men under two names manage both political organizations . The same men attend the primary meetings of both , nominate the candidates , draw the platforms , print the ballots , distribute them , and , what is more to the purpose , do the counting . Well-informed men have no doubt that the last elections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for President of the United States , have been , in the city of New York , managed on a distinct agreement , as to casting and counting ballots , made between the political managers in the State of New York , who wear two sets of names . Few intelligent men have a doubt that bargains of the same kind are made at every election between the two sets of professionals at Washington . The very essence of their creed , according to their own saying , is that there will be great danger to the country if men of what is called the opposing organization shall fill any of the public offices . In Washington and Albany and New York , and everywhere else through the country , these men have always made bargains with each other to divide the public offices when either one set could not have the whole . It is their trade . The whole thing is a sham , a game between two sets of gamblers , with the people for the victim . I do not mean that there are not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have no idea of deceiving themselves or any one else . But this is the working of the machinery ,  --  this is the certain result , assuming the best of intentions to exist on all hands . The process of election has become a mere form . It has been superseded by that of nomination , the process of nomination has fallen into the hands of the professional election workers , the professional election workers have fallen under the control of their leaders , and the leaders trade and bargain over the people 's offices , and keep up the form of two " parties " ( as they are called ) , to catch our votes . We do not elect our officers . They are appointed for us by the managers of the machine . We talk of two " parties . " There is only one party , of two parts . It is time to name names . What difference does it make to us whether our public officials are appointed for us by Mr. Roscoe Conkling , or by Mr. John Kelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their successors ? We are disfranchised , none the less so that we are allowed to walk decorously to the polls , and there please ourselves with the choice between two sets of printed papers , prepared by the same men , but with different sets of names on them , with the eagle at the top printed it may be from different dies . Are we to call this kind of performance " popular election " ? Mr. John Kelly and some of his coadjutors in another " hall , " a short time since , drew lots publicly , in our very eyes , for the appointment of our representatives to Congress . The business of the great election-mill goes on from year to year . The names of the members of the firm at times change , new partners are admitted ; there is at times a different distribution made of the interests in the business . At times , the upper and the nether millstones change places . ( * ) This election machine makes slaves of our public officials . The set of men now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings . By far the greater number of them would really wish to give the people good work , if they were free to do so . Does any one doubt that the present President of the United States  --  a man of great ability , a man of great ambition , with the eyes of the world on him , and with the possibility of making a great name for himself if he should serve the people well-wishes to give the people the best work he knows how to give ? But what can he do ? He can not make his own choice of one of his own subordinates . It is , indeed , the custom to confirm the cabinet officers whom he selects ; but there his power ceases , and that power under the present system of affairs is really nothing . That , however , is not all . The moment a president is elected , the men who have elected him clamor for their pay . If he were free to act his own will , his simple despair at being unable to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would drive him , if he were human , to refuse to make a single removal from office , unless for cause , in the ordinary course of administration . But he knows that not only does he owe his past election to the members of the election organization , but that they are the men who can give him the next one . At least , he can not get the next election without them . He may , indeed , lose it with them . Moreover , every official with whom he has to deal , nearly every man with whom he comes in contact , depends in the same way on the election machine for his future . Every man around him besets him with all kinds of influences and all kinds of arguments , to use all the powers of his office for the purposes of the election machine . The whole power of this vast organization is concentrated against him . And it is the same with every official in the service . The combined force of the whole organization is brought to bear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his office for the common needs . And if a man has at times the courage to refuse so to use his office , sooner or later he will lose his place . Our public officials , in short , are a set of slaves . The greatest slave among them is the man in the highest place . No public officer can follow his own will or his own judgment in his official action . Give every man his due . I have no great admiration for the men who are now charged with the duty of cleaning the streets of New York . But they are driven , by the system under which they live , to do precisely what they have done ,  --  to make as many places as can be made , and spend as much money as can be spent ; for the benefit of the people 's masters instead of the people . They are the creatures of the system . We all know that there are two or three men  --  the Governor of the State of New York , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States-who could , by a word honestly spoken , give to the city of New York clean streets , and save hundreds , perhaps thousands , of lives . The word is not spoken . These gentlemen would be glad , if they could , to give us clean streets and save life . But what shall they do ? The election work can not be had , unless it is paid for . ( * ) The system centralizes power in the hands of an oligarchy . Centralization of power was the great dread of our ancestors , though the phrase was one which they did not then use . That , especially , they meant to avoid . The machinery which they framed has given us centralized power in its most centralized form . The Czar of Russia is learning that he must submit his will to the will of his people . But what do the managers of the election machine care for the will of the people ? Such large bodies as these national election organizations must have heads . It is the working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election machine substantially control the appointment and removal-and therefore the action-of every official in the land , through the National , State , and local governments . It is a great power . ( * ) The system destroys the responsibility of public servants . The phrase , responsibility of public servants , means , if it is to have any meaning , responsibility for their official work , and it should mean that an official who fails to do well his official work can be removed from his office , and removed at once . This is the only kind of responsibility worth having , and this we do not have . The system does not secure , nor tend to secure , individual responsibility for individual action . When the day of election comes , individual action of single men is forgotten . Then it becomes a question ( so we think ) of " parfies " and principles * then every voter is filled with the fear lest the control of the whole government may fall into the hands of the opposing branch of professionals . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managed by the election machine , good candidates are weighed down with the unpopularity of other men , and bad candidates are helped by the good deeds of other men . Individuals do not stand on their own merits . There are many other points which can not be urged in a paper of this compass . But the fundamental difficulty is that the only kind of responsibility which is enforced under our present system is responsibility for service to the election organization , not for service to the people . ( 6 ) The system destroys the efficiency of our public service . I do not mean that no good work is done by our present government officials . There are , as we all know , many old and welltrai*med public servants who do good work . They do it for the reason that they are old and well-trained servants . They keep their places , when they keep them , because the men who hold the positions at the head find that the work of the departments can not possibly be done without keeping in office some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come to a stand-still . But it is the tendencies of the system with which we have to deal . The system tends to drive all the best men out of the public service . It would be for the individual interest of each head of a department or office to choose the most efficient men that he could find , to do the work of the office under him . For he would be the man who would get the reputation for it . And if there were no external pressure on him , if he were independent , his own individual interest would make him take that course . If he were to try to make his appointments from motives of favoritism or corruption , he would certainly concentrate on his head all the odium which should arise from the short-comings of his whole de // partment . Centralization of odium is , however , a remedy which we do not have There is pressing on him the power which controls his future , and which he dares not disobey . It is the desire for reputation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who get there ,  --  and it is not a bad reputation that they wish . Secure to them good reputation and good wages for good work , would they not do their work as well as they could ? As it is , they give up the reputation . Gradually the result is , the men who give their time only to the faithful discharge of their duty are weeded out of the service , and the men who do the election work are brought in , and kept in . It is the law of nature , the survival of the fittest-for the special work to be done . Moreover , the system tends to keep out the honest working-men who wish to enter the service , and who would be taken into it under a normal , natural condition of things . Men who have honest work of their own to do , which pays them honest wages , will not , as a rule , go into a service which is full of uncertainties . They can not afford to give up one year or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without having the same certainty which they have in private life , that of permanent employment , if they do their work well . The tendency of our present system is o draw into the public service only adventurers , **en who have not been able to command success elsewhere . And it must be admitted that election work , a very large part of it ( and the work is such as the system necessarily makes it ) , is not work which any man who has a decent self-respect will consent to do . The system , too , makes it impossible that the men who remain in the service should do the best work they are able to do . And the main difficulty here is in our having the term system for the men at the head of the service . No one has time to learn his work . There is no difference , on this point , between the work in the public service and work in private life . They both require time , to learn how to do them , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the men at the foot of the service . Where is it that skill and experience are needed the most ? Of all wonderful ideas , the most wonderful is that held by some friends of civil-service reform who urge that the subordinates in our public service must have experience , but the men at the top of the service can get on without it . What is there so miracu bus about street-cleaning , aqueducts , postoffices , and treasury operations , which calls for training in subordinates only , and needs brains only at the foot of the organization ? And it is impossible for any men to get experience at their work who are going in and out of office once in two or three years . But even this is not the main evil . The main evil is that , while the men are iii office , they must give their time and thought to election work . Aside , however , from the question of training individuals , the system makes it impossible for the public service to become an efficient working organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here especially is it necessary that the men at the head should not be continually changing , and should not be the slaves of the election organization . Every service depends for its efficiency on the men at the top . They are the men who are to organize , if there is to be any organization . They are the men who are to enforce responsibility , if responsibility is to be enforced . They are the only men who can have any accurate knowledge as to the fitness and industry of subordinates . Throughout the service , but with the heads of the service more than anywhere else , men must have time , to find their places , to learn their work , to do their work , and to become adj usted one to another in a smoothly working organization . In short , the system tends to drive the best men who are in the service out of it , to keep the best men who are out of the service from coming in , to hinder the men in the service from doing their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from becoming an efficient organization . Can more than that be said against any system ? Qj ) The system corrupts the public service . It was at first both the principle and the practice to appoint and remove public officers simply for the reason that they were fit or unfit to do their special work . The system went on well enough until the election work became so enormous and paid so well . But now the working of our system of elections and appointments has become nothing but a buying and selling of offices . It is not that the men who control the election organizations wish to make this their trade . But they can not help it . Make all the statutes and civil-service rules that we may , a way will always be found to evade them , so long as the men who have the appointing power are the slaves of the election organization . They must appoint at // the command of the election managers , or their political career is ended . The next step in corruption often and surely follows . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of one kind , soon learn to sell official action of all kinds . And men who sell places and official action for place will learn to sell them for money . But it is not the manner of payment that concerns the people . Of what difference is it to the people , when official action is sold , whether payment is made in money , or some other thing of value ? ( 8 ) The system gives the control of the public service to the great money powers . There is always a set of rich and powerful interests in the land that can be helped or injured by the official action of our public officers . There are the iron and coal interests , the railroads , the telegraphs , the oil monopoly , and many others which need not be mentioned . In former years , our legislators were men in whose hands property of all kinds , the interests of the rich and poor alike , were safe . It is not so now . The election machine has driven our best men out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many of the men who are left in the service , until property is not safe from their attacks . The men who manage the election organizations , and who are thereby enabled to control the action of our public officials , are compelled to use large amounts of money . The result is that the professional politicians have become ( with , of course , many honorable exceptions of men who resist temptation , and are true to their own sense of right and justice ) an army of marauders . They plunder every rich enterprise which comes within their reach . They are the feudal barons of this country and this age , with new methods . The bludgeon of the law has taken the place of the spear and battle-ax . It is a weapon much more deadly to the victim , and much safer to the thief who uses it . The great corporations , like the wealthy Hebrew merchants of the Middle Ages , are compelled , in self-protection , to pay tribute to these brigands , under what we call a free government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one gets any solid good from it . No honest citizen is a gainer , nor is the free-lance , who gets the plunder . If he could only be put in the way of earning honest wages by an honest service of any kind , all parties would be greatly benefited . However , so it is , that the rich corporations find it necessary to pay ransom money to the managers of the election machine , and they do so regularly , to the men on both sides . These rich corporations are now the powers who control the machinery of this Government , National , State , and local , as to measures which affect any interests of theirs , and they are enabled to do so by keeping regularly in their . pay the men who control the election machine , both parts of it . It makes to them no difference which part of the machine happens for the time to be in office , as the term is . They pay both sides , at the same time . It is all one concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tariff in Congress ? The old professional political hacks on both sides , the men who control the election machinery , are in the pay of the iron and coal interests . In the State of New York , it is the railroad and canal and oil interests that control our legislation . The principles have been laid down for us , in the testimony given under oath before a committee of the Assembly of the State of New York , by one of the leading railroad men in the country . He says , as to his regular method of operations : " We had to look after four States-New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Ohio ; and have helped men in all of them ; it was the custom , when men received nominations , to come to me for contributions ; and I made them , and considered them good paying investments for the company . In a Republican district I was a strong Republican ; in a Democratic district I was Democratic ; in doubtful districts I was doubtful ; in politics I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successors are so still . ( * ) This election machine defies the people 's will . It is true that our public servants , for many years , until the growing mass of election work in time developed this election machinery , did represent public opinion . They were , in substance , chosen by the people , and they respected the people 's wishes . There were , from time to time , many instances when public officials did acts which public opinion did not approve . But , so far as I am aware , the year 1870 was the first time in our history when the men who were , in form , elected by the people , to be the people 's servants , said , in so many words , that they would use the people 's power and the people 's treasury according to their own will . The result was not doubtful . That one set of men went down before the people 's wrath . The // figure-heads and leaders of the machine had to be changed . Ten years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes , took the same position , with the same result . Men may change , but the methods remain . Can we say that there is any limit to the boldness of these men , and where shall we place the limit of their power ? ( io ) In such a state of things a healthy national life and growth is an impossible thing . These periodical convulsions of the whole national fabric ( which we call elections ) waste the people 's money , derange the people 's industries , divide the people 's strength , waste the people 's time in fruitless strife over dead issues of the past , and corrupt the people 's conscience . The cost to the people of operating this election machinery is something enormous . The cost of general parliamentary elections in England , as shown by official reports , would seem to be not far from one pound sterling to the vote . In many instances it is much more . That figure does not cover all the real cost , only the acknowledged cost . When we take into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , the vast extent of country over which this election work is to be done , the number of ballots to be printed , the meetings to be held , the processions , the banners , the bands of music , I can not see how the expense of a general election in a Presidential year can possibly be less than five dollars a vote , laying out of consideration any items which would be called improper . At the last election , over nine million votes were cast . That would make an expenditure of forty-five millions of dollars . In some form the people pay all this . When , then , we consider the injury to the people 's interests from the neglect that the public work suffers , no one can estimate the money loss to the public which results from this never-ending series of elections . If there were any sufficient or satisfactory result , we could endure it . But to pay forty-five million dollars for a change from Mr. John Kelly to Mr. Roscoe Conkling is an unwise expenditure . Each one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , makes a serious disturbance of the nation 's industries . No one can tell what will be the result to commerce and manufactures from a change in the men who are at the head of our national affairs . It is not that the new men will really have bad intentions , or that they have any new set of measures which they propose to carry into effect . But they are almost invariably ignorant of the nation 's affairs . Even if their purposes be the best , a new administration , from mere ignorance of the laws of money and trade , may adopt measures which will make a money loss of many millions of dollars , and throw out of employment mainy thousands of poor men . We know , indeed , that the people will survive these troubles ; the Government will go on in spite of them ; but the injury is there , and can not be avoided . The fear of it alone is enough to cause for a time a stagnation in all business enterprises . These contests between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury which can not be weighed , in dividing the people 's strength in times of danger . In the war of the rebellion we had practically half the Northern people arrayed in active opposition to the Government . In the war of 1812 , we had the same thing . In the history of the last few years in England , nearly one-half the House of Commons and of the English people has been actively engaged in embarrassing the operations of the Government at a time when a people should be united . At this present time , the people of the United States , North and South , sincerely wish for peace and rest , for simply an opportunity to work . But once in four years-in fact , all the time  --  the men of the election machine , for their own purposes , stir up all the angry feelings of the past , and leave untouched all the measures of the future . The people have no sound interest in these contests . They have at last learned that no changes in policy result from them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential election is a period of anxious suspense , followed perhaps by a great loss from the ignorance of a set of new and inexperienced officials , and at the end a feeling of temporary relief that the loss is no greater than it is , and that they may have for the rest of the new four years a state of comparative quiet . The system destroys a healthy interest in public affairs . We hear much said as to the lack of interest in public affairs on the part of the business men and the educated men . On the face of things , there is a lack of interest , but it is the result of the present unnatural condition of affairs . Men have become discouraged ; they have in a degree lost their interest in elections for the reason that they know that they can accomplish nothing . It is the indifference of despair . There is really // 363 enough of true public spirit . The business men are willing to give their time and money freely , if any good will come of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse themselves for a revolution against some one set of men , when the tyranny of the election machine becomes unendurable . But the men of business can not be leading a new revolution every day . It has been at times a current idea that we must have periodical national elections in order to keep alive the popular interest in public affairs . That is much as if a physician should recommend a patient to contract a severe case of intermittent fever by way of improving the circulation of his blood . These struggles for place between the two sets of office-seekers , do not tend , as far as I can learn , to the elucidation of any of the great problems of political science . It corrupts the public conscience . There can hardly be a greater influence for evil than to have widely spread among a people the belief that the official action of public officers is bought and sold . That belief is now widely spread among us , and there are facts enough on which to base the belief . Few measures in our legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly considered on their merits . The combined influence of our whole government is largely thrown against honest dealing , and in favor of bribery and corruption . And no one can estimate the evil that comes from that state of things . It was not so before the growth of the election machine . It comes froni the fact that our public officers are not free ; they can not follow the dictates of their own consciences , and their own ideas of what would be for their own individual interests . So long ago as in 1714 , it was said in the British House of Commons , in the debate on the bill for lengthening the term of Parliaments from three years to seven , by Mr. Richard Hampden : " The reasons why I am now for the bill are : To dispose the people to follow their callings and to be industrious , by taking from them , for a time the opportunity of distracting one another by elections ; to prevent such who have the will from the power of giving any new disturbance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much reason to expect one this year as there was the last ; to check that evil spirit in those who have sworn to the King and rose in arms against him , or abetted such who have ; to discountenance that spirit which lately did so far prevail in this nation as to approve of a most ignominious conclusion of a successful war by a ruinous peace ; to render fruitless any concerted project of the Regent or any other foreign princes to disturb this nation at a time when elections , or the approach of them , have raised a ferment in the minds of the people ; and to procure the clergy an interval from being politicians that they may be the better able to take care of their flocks in the manner the Scripture has prescribed . " The argument here has brought us to this result . The purpose in framing our system had been to create a people 's government . It was the purpose , that the people themselves should by turns do the public work , that the people should elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their officers , that public officers should represent th' will of the people , should be responsible to the people , that power should be kept in the hands of the people , and not be centralized in the hands of public officials . That purpose le , has enslaved their servants , has centralized power in the hands of an oligarchy , has destroyed the responsibility of our public servants , destroys the efficiency of the public service , corrupts the public service , sells the control of the public service to the great monopolies , defies the people 's will , and makes the people 's healthy life and growth an impossible thing . We have , not a people 's government , but the tyranny of an election machine . It is a most singular system of slavery . We , the people , have forged our own chains , have put them on , we keep them in repair , and we renew them . Every other oppressed race on the face of the earth hold in their own hands the right of revolution . That right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle of revolution with us seems to be about ten years . XVe rebel with our tongues , submitting ourselves strictly to the letter of the law , as do the men who rob us . And the revolution , as its best result , gives us only a change of tyrants . The system is a slavery that is indeed severe for the slaves . But no men would be so blessed by its end as the masters . V. But what is the reason of the result ? The reason why the system has failed is that it is framed , in some of its most important features , in defiance of the laws of political mechanics , and of human nature . It is framed in defiance of the laws of political mechanics , , chiefly in these respects : ( i ) It uses the process of election for a wrong purpose . It uses that process for the purpose of enforcing responsibility , of putting men out of office . The true use is the selecting men , the putting them in office . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election machine . It is as if we were to build a locomotive , and have it all driving-wheels and no brakes . ( 2 ) It uses the process of election in a wrong form . It is an attempt to have the people vote , at one time , in large districts , where they can not meet together , talk together , and act together . ( * ) As the consequence of these two points , it centralizes power , by centralizing and perverting the process of election . ( * ) It destroys responsibility , by dividing it . It divides responsibility , by dividing single powers among different men , instead of centralizing each different power in a different center . ( * ) It provides no sufficient means of enforcing responsibility . It makes everything of the process of putting men in office , and forgets the process of putting them out . It is based on the fundamental error that public offices are property , which a man is to hold for so many years , and of which he is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trial . Public offices are trusts , from which men should be removed as soon as they fail to fulfill them . ( 6 ) The system is an attempt to have the people govem , with their own hands . We have not the time . The work is too great . We have each our special work . The system of having the people themselves do their public work served their needs one hundred years ago , when the work was small . But we have outgrown the system . Moreover , the system is framed in defiance of the laws of human nature . It is fit only for Utopia , for some dreamland , where beings are all unselfish , where they pay no regard to their selfish interests . If we make three hundred thousand officeholders depend for their advancement on doing something other than their duty , they will do that thing other than their duty . VI . It remains , then , to consider shortly the nature and the sufficiency of the main remedies usually proposed . They are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of executive departments seats in the legislature . The other is to have a system of competitive examinations in different branches of knowledge , as a test for admission and promotion in the lower grades of the service . As to the first of these two measures , the reasons against it are these : ist . If the head of a department is to be a real head , he will have neither time nor strength to sit in a legislature . He can not do the two things . Sir Robert Peel said this many years ago . 2d . The main reason urged for the proposed measure is that the heads of departments should be compelled to defend their measures in debate . But suppose they should not be men skilled in debate . It puts them to a false test . We want at the heads of departments men of administrative capacity , not orators. 3d . It is said that the measure is desirable , in order that the heads of departments may be able to give information on the floor of the House as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . But all men of experience know that information as to matters of administration , if it is to have real value , must be given in detailed printed reports , which can be examined and digested . 4th . The main and final reason against this measure is that it does not touch the roots of the disease . The disease is , that the men at the head of the Government , on whom the working of the whole machinery depends , are the slaves of this election machine , and are compelled to use the powers of their offices in its service . And how is it proposed , by this measure of having cabinet ministers make speeches in the legislature , to deal with that disease ? The other of the two measures is , the having competitive examinations in geography , and history , and grammar , for admission and promotion in the lower grades of the service . To which the comment is , that we must begin at the source of the stream , and not at its mouth . We might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a system of weirs at the South-west Pass . Let us see , then , where the whole argument , thus far , has brought us . This first experiment in the history of the world , on a grand scale , to establish a people 's government , on the fundamental idea of distrust of men , has given us as its result the tyranny of an election machine . The spectacle , looking only at the present condition of affairs , is one that might almost appall the friends of free government . Is there any remedy ? And can it be found ? There is no doubt as to the answer to these questions . The people made this Government , and will yet find a remedy for its faults . But the remedy is not to be found by standing still , or by saying that nothing can be done . In the next paper an attempt will be made to give the outline of a remedy . // BEWARE .
