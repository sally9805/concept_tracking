Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : NOVEMBER . from November 1886 1 The fitful flaws sail over the river 2 For ever away , for ever away ; 3 The scattering oak leaves whirl and quiver , 4 Tossed by the wind away . 5 The bare boughs wave to the bare wild sky , 6 Grey against solemn grey : 7 The dim waves break on the dim shore nigh , 8 And the shore and the waves are grey . 9 Take my heart in your mighty arms , 10 Wrapt in a mantle grey ; 11 Bind it , O spirits , with awful charms , 12 And bear it away , away .
