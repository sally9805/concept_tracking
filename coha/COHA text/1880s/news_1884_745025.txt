txt Prentiss Tiller , the express thief , was not moved to the City Jail last night , where a cell next to a colored murderer awaits him . Instead , he passed the night at the Lindell Hotel , where he made a patient endeavor to rectify the express company 's accounts , which were so badly ** the youth 's exploit . Of the $100,000 which he carried away , some $5,000 was found to be missing . A gentleman who talked with Tiller this morning asked him how he accounted for the shortage in the amount of money recovered . Tiller said that if any money was missing it was taken while the valise was in the trunk store . " I did not spend or give away any such amount of money , " he said . " Perhaps some of those Milwaukee people may be able to tell something about it . " The inference is , therefore , that Tiller will charge the clerk who opened his valise with extracting the amount of money missing and putting it in his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not burst open , as the clerk is said to have stated when the matter was first reported to the Milwaukee police . The lock was a sound one , and the clerk , undoubtedly prompted by curiosity , opened the valise with a key in the regular way . About 2:30 o'clock this afternoon , just as the company officials were about through with the work of examining the accounts and were making ready to turn Tiller over to the custody of the police , he made a very bold attempt to escape , which almost succeeded . Officer King was out in the corridor and the door was closed . Mr. Morsman was engaged in writing at the table in the centre of the room , when Tiller , who had been given his freedom in the room , suddenly got on the sill of one of the windows which had been opened because of the warm sunlight , and catching hold of the rope which serves as a fire-escape , threw the loose end out of the window . Then quickly adjusting the apparatus he lowered himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is on the second floor level . Finding a window open he went through it . The room proved to be a lady 's private bed-chamber , and the lady was in it . She was terribly alarmed to see a man jump through the window as though he had come from the clouds , but before she had time to do any more than cry out , he had reached the door and was out in the corridor . She followed , screaming loudly . Tiller rushed through the hallway , and either lost his bearings or purposely avoided the main stairway in the fear of being intercepted and in the hope of finding a private staircase by which to descend . Mr. Morsman , meanwhile , turned around and discovered that his bird had flown . He rushed out into the hall and told Officer William King , who ran down stairs to head the fugitive off . Tiller , feeling certain that he was being pursued , opened a door into the dining-room , and dashed through it , making a great commotion among the guests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , but was unable to get out , owing to the doors being locked . He then had to retrace his steps , when King , who had by this time reached the second floor , met and caught him . He was put in a carriage and taken to the Four Courts , and on his way he attempted to throw away a file , but was prevented , and it was taken from him . The amazing feature of the attempt to escape was that he lowered himself from the fifth to the second floor in the full view of a multitude of people on Washington.avenue . Tiller says that he will make no fight in the courts , but will plead guilty , and yet ho refuses to name his accomplices , saying that he did the job alone . There is positive evidence against his friend George . The question as to the division of the reward is receiving a good deal of attention at Milwaukee , where the parties most interested reside , and there is occasionally not a little talk at this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise $5,000 for the capture of the man , and a. reward of 10 per cent . on all the money recovered . The actual money amounted to about $40,000 , and under the terms of the advertisement no reward can be claimed on bullion or jewelry . The percentage will therefore be $4,400 , making a total reward of $9,400 . Had the detectives sent from here made the capture this amount would have been saved to the company , as they were all worming under contract . As the case stands , however , the trunk store salesman and the detective who made the arrest are in dispute as to the portion to which each is entitled , and the case may yet get into the courts . The company will refuse to pay a dollar until the claimants are agreed as to what portion each shall receive and are ready to sign receipts in full for all demands .
