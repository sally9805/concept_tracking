THE PEOPLE 'S PROBLEM . III . HOW TO SECURE A PEOPLE 'S GOVERNMENT . LET us see where the argument thus far has brought us . It has been an examination into the disease of our body politic , and its remedy . As to the disease , its main features are these : i . The existing system of having the people , in form , elect many public officers , voting , in their own persons , through large districts , at frequent elections , has made our political life a series of election contests , has taken the choice of our public officials from the people and put it in the hands of professional election managers , has made ourpublic officials serve the election organizations instead of serving the people ,  --  has , in short , turned our government into an election machine . 2 . The attempt to enforce the responsibility of public officials by terms of office and periodical elections , thereby making it at all times necessary for our chief officials to carry the next election in order to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election work , instead of to the people for the people 's work . 3 . The taking from executive officials the poWer of appointing and removing their subordinates has made them unable to give us good administration . As to the remedy , its main features are so framed as to meet the precise disease which we find to exist : i . The proposed system of having the people elect only their chief executive officials , and the members of the supervisory bodies which we call legislatures and common councils , by the votes of delegates , choosing those delegates at meetings of the citizens held in small election districts , where the citizens can meet and act as one body , electing only when there are vacancies , in. // stead of at fixed periods , will put the choice of our chief public officials really in the hands of the people themselves , and will make our public officials free to serve the people , instead of placing them under bonds to serve the election machine . 2 . The simple and direct method of summary removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a failure to do official work , not for a failure to carry an election , or for a failure to put a bill through the legislature ( as in England ) , will enforce responsibility for official work instead of for election work or work in the legislature . 3 . The giving to all executive officials the sole power of appointing and removing their immediate subordinates will put it in their power to give us efficient administration . In short , we should have , under such a system , an organization where the selfish interests of each official would lead him to do the people 's work instead of election work ,  --  where the doing of the people 's work , and not election work , would be the controlling purpose , where the will of the people , and not of the election managers , would be the controlling force . We should have , in short , a government , and not an election machine . Let there be no misunderstanding . As has been said before , it is not meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in our service , or that the men in our service do no good work ; but we have this powerful disturbing force , which operates at all times and with all men in the service ,  - -  especially with the men at the head on whom the efficiency of the service depends , .  --  to defeat in a great measure the very ends for which the service has its existence . On the other hand , it is not expected that under the system here proposed we should never have bad men in the service , or that the men in the service would never use the powers of their offices for improper purposes . No system of government can be devised which will secure us to that extent . But the influences and tendencies of the system proposed would be in favor of good government , whereas the influences and tendencies of our present system are greatly against it . So far as to the disease and the remedy . But then comes the question : How is the remedy to be applied ? How are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of any new system , of government ? In order to give the argument more clearness , it will be well to state in order the questions which need here to be answered . These questions are , as it seems to me , as follows : i . How can the people be brought to an agreement , on this scheme , or on any scheme which involves so great constitutional changes ? 2 . How can the people be persuaded to surrender power-their right of voting in their own persons at frequent elections , for their own public officers ? 3 . How can the people be persuaded to make what will seem to them a rash experiment , of which no man can foresee the results ? 4 . Is it necessary , even if . it is practicable , to make any radical constitutional change in our system of government ? 5 . Even if it be shown that a radical change is needed , and that the people will agree to it , how can the people overthrow the power of the election machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present paper . I. The first question is : How can the people be brought to agree on this scheme , or on any scheme which involves so great constitutional changes ? As will be seen later , the agreement by the people to the scheme of constitutional reform which is to be adopted will be the last thing to be done , and not the first . The first thing in order is to frame the system to which the people are to agree . This framing of the new system , the devising a comprehensive , rational scheme of thorough constitutional reform , we shall accomplish by using the people 's own method-the national convention , the simple old method of one hundred years ago , in combination with the wonderful new forces of to-day . When men speak of the difficulty , the impossibility , of getting the people to agree on a new scheme of government , they forget our own history ; they lose sight of what we have already done-of the great results we wrought with the most slender means in the earliest days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , we had no national existence , before we became , even in form , a people , while we were still in embryo . It will be well to make a short study of the introductory chapter of our national history , to see what we then accomplishedthe result ; and how we then accomplished it  --  the process . As to the result : The result was a creation , out of a political chaos , of a large , comprehensive system // of national government . When the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , which framed our present national Constitution , met , such a thing as a national government had no existence . The old Confederation was nothing but a league on paper . It was not even an election machine . There was a legislature which could not pass a law . There was no executive to enforce a law , had any been passed . There was a body called Congress , which had power to appoint a commander-in-chief for an army which it could not raise , to spend money from a treasury which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not pay , and to make requests for men and money which it could never enforce . The old Continental Congress was nothing but a debating society , which spent its time in moaning over evils which it had no power to heal , and in wellintentioned , mischievous interference with the commander of our armies , whom it had no power to help . But out of this state of things there came a government , a legislature which could make laws , a judiciary which could interpret them , and an executive which could enforce them ; a power was created which could raise money and armies and navies , which could regulate with authority the common affairs in which the people of all the States had a common interest-leaving in existence and in full strength the State and local governments to regulate State and local affairs ; and these different governments were to exist together , and have their distinct operation , each in its own sphere , each within its own limits , giving , however , to the common national organization ( within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious system , flexible yet firm . This supreme national government was voluntarily adopted by the peoples of thirteen independent sovereign States . Of their own will they established a central authority over themselves . This new national government was an organization of which , as far as I am aware , no human being had any conception before the sittings of the Constitutional Convention began . Single individuals did indeed have an idea of framing some system which should be a modification of the Articles of Confederation-which should be something in the nature of a general government . But they were very few . The members of the federal Convention had before them a new problem . That Convention had , as it were , to evolve out of its own consciousness a free national government for a union of free States . The framing a government was a thing not originally intended when the Convention was called . The Convention was only to revise that thing of paper called the Articles of Confederation . The resolution for calling the Convention said , in so many words , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revising the Articles of Confederation . " The needs of the country were great , as many men were well aware . But few men had given careful thought to the practical measures which were required to meet those needs . And it is safe to say that no man had any clear . idea of any system of government such as was finally adopted , such as was absolutely indispensable to cope with what seemed at the time to be a nearly hopeless state of affairs . Even after the Constitution was framed , the government which it was to create was an object of great fear and distrust to a very large proportion of the people who adopted it . There were probably very few individuals in the whole country who did not think that the establishment of this central national organization , with a power unlimited of raising money , of raising men , of keeping a standing army , was a step full of danger to the liberties of the people . Many men of that time had the fear that this establishment of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the first step toward the establishment of a new tyranny . This fear was wide-spread . It was held even by the members of the Convention itself . The expressions of that fear , as it then lay in the minds of very able men , now read almost like a burlesque . Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing , two of the three New York delegates to the Convention , wrote of the new Constitution : " Exclusive of our objections originating from the want of power , we entertained an opinion that the general government , however guarded by declarations of rights , or cautionary provisions , must unavoidably , in a short time , be productive of the destruction of the civil liberty of such citizens who could be effectually coerced by it , by reason of the extensive territory of the United States , the dispersed situation of its inhabitants , and the insuperable difficulty of controlling or counteracting the views of a set of men ( however unconstitutional and oppressive their acts might be ) , possessed of all the powers of government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be supposed to be uniformly actuated by an attention to their welfare and happiness ; that , however wise and energetic the principles of the general government might // be , the extremities of the United States could not be kept in due submission and obedient to its laws , at the distance of many hundred miles from the seat of government ; that if the general government was composed of so numerous a body of men as to represent the interests of all the inhabitants of the United States , in the usual and true ideas of representation , the expense of supporting it would become intolerably burdensome ; and that if a few only were vested with the power of legislation , the interests of a great majority of the inhabitants of the United States must necessarily be unknown ; or , if known , even in the first stages of the operations of a new government , unattended to . " George Mason , of Virginia , wrote : " This government will commence in a moderate aristocracy ; it is at present impossible to foresee whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a corrupt , oppressive aristocracy ; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two , and then terminate in either the one or the other . " Of the fifty-five members who actually attended meetings of the Convention , sixteen ( nearly one-third ) were so strongly opposed to the Constitution , after its adoption by the Convention , that they refused to sign their names to it . Even the members who voted for its adoption did so in great doubt and anxiety as to the results which the new scheme of government would bring them . Franklin said : " Thus I consent , sir , to this Constitution , because I expect no better , and because I am not sure that it is not the best . The opinions I have had of its errors I sacrifice to the public good . Within these walls they were born , and here they shall die . * * * On the whole , sir , I can not help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention who may still have objections to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of his own infallibility , and to make manifest our unanimity , put his name to this instrument . " Gouverneur Morris said " that he , too , had objections , but considering the present plan as the best that was to be obtained , he should take it with all its faults . The majority had determined in its favor , and by that determination he should abide . The moment this plan goes forth , all other considerations will be laid aside , and the great question will be , Shall there be a national government or not ? And this must take place , or a general anarchy will be the alternative . " Hamilton said : " No man 's ideas were more remote from the plan than his own were known to be ; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion , on one side , and the chance of good the italics are mine to be expected from the plan , on the other ? " The letter to Congress which accompanied the Constitution said , among other things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every State is not , perhaps , to be expected . But each will , doubtless , consider that , had her interest alone been consulted , the consequences might have been particularly disagreeable and injurious to others . That it is liable to as few exceptions as could reasonably have been expected , we hope and believe ; that it may promote the lasting welfare of that coun try so dear to us all , and secure her freedom and happiness , is our most ardent wish . " But the wonder of all was the space of time in which the work was done . Those men who met in that Convention were , no doubt , a body of very remarkable men . Such are always the men whom the people choose for their leaders , when the people make their own free choice . But the members of that Convention were not what we should now call men of learning ; they were not , for the work they had in hand , men of experience . Yet they ushered in a new era of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a new law of political growth . Men say governments must grow . This national government , in its framing , was a growth of about four months . On the 25th of May the Convention had its first meeting . On the i5th of September the work of the Convention was finished . In less than a year , this new government was adopted by the peoples of nearly all the States . Here was the myth of ancient poets made true history of men ; here was a new , living creation , not the toiling growth of centuries , but a thing struck , at a single blow , clad in complete steel , from the head of the people . The result , then , was the creation out of a political chaos of a large , complex , comprehensive system , the voluntary adoption by the peoples of thirteen independent sovereign States of one supreme national government  --  a government the like of which had , so far as we now have any evidence , never before been seen on the earth ; of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being before had any conception ; which was , at the time of its adoption , to a very large proportion of the people who adopted it , an object of great fear and distrust ; - this new creation , this national government , was framed in its finished form in four months , and its adoption by the peoples of nearly all those thirteen independent States was brought about in little more than one year . It has taken us one hundred years to grow up to it . That was the result . What was the process ? The process was the simple , direct , scientific process of agreement . It will be // well to examine it , and see what great resuits can come in a short space of time from the deliberations of a body of men who are laboring simply with one common honest purpose of serving the people . The Convention was originally called for the *4th of May . It did not actually meet till the 25th of May , for the reason that a sufficient number of delegates were not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , there had evidently been a most speedy growth in the ideas of the members . Edmund Randolph has given us a statement of it in his own case : " Before my departure for the Convention , I believed that the Confederation was not so eminently defective as it had been supposed . But after I had entered into a free communication with those who were best informed of the condition and interest of each State , after I had compared the intelligence derived from them with the properties which ought to characterize the government of our Union , I became persuaded that the Confederation was destilute of every energy which a constitution of the United States ought to possess . " Although the original intention had been only to revise the Articles of Confederation , a resolution was passed by the Convention , on the very first day of its formal deliberations , in these words : " That a national government ought to be established , consisting of a supreme legislative executive and judiciary . " 1'his was on the 29th of May . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that time the members had reached an agreement , as to what should be the general scope of the new system . That was the main point to be accomplished . Agreement on defails was a thing which required a longer time . It was reached in this way : Single articles and clauses were discussed singly , and were adopted singly . The men who formed the majority in favor of one clause were found in the minority opposed to another . At the end of their deliberations , each single provision had been adopted by a majority vote . But no one man was in favor of them all . Probably no single member had voted in favor of as many as twothirds of the different articles and clauses of the whole instrument . The paper as a whole was not what any one individual wished . But when they had finished their action on the single parts , the Constitution which they had thus formed was the only thing on which they could hope to agree . They agreed , therefore , on that . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus I consent to this Constitution , because I expect no better . " When it came to procuring the adoption of the Constitution by the different State conventions , they had to go through the same process in each . In each State convention the common judgment was , in the beginning , thoroughly against the new Constitution . The opinions of individuals and the common opinion of each convention had to grow up to it . That growth was very quickly reached , under the same influence-that of common discussion . In the end , in each State convention , as had been the case in the national convention , men agreed to the new Constitution because it was the only thing on which they could agree . They took it , because they could get nothing else , with all its faults , with all their fears . Within one year , eleven States had adopted the Constitution . New York , the eleventh State , adopted it on the 26th of July , 1788 . The adoption by Rhode Island , the last of the thirteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole work  --  the appreciation of the existence of any need , the framing of a new national government to meet that need , and its adoption by the peoples of thirteen independent States-may be truly said to have been accomplished in the space of little more than five years . That there was any need of a national government was not learned , as we have seen , until the members of the Convention actually met , and had their common discussions . No doubt , during the war of the Revolution , many men were keenly alive to the difficulties of raising men and money . But those very difficulties were so great that no one had time to give thought to their cause . It was not till the war was over , in the year 1783 , that men began to consider the defects of the Confederation , or the fact that any change in its organization was needed . And in less than six years from that time the work was donethe new government was framed , adopted , and in operation . The whole process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selection , in its simplest , most natural form ; but it was selection by agree ; nen* not by a struggle . The members of the Convention were selected men , selected by an agreement of the people 's voices . The work of the Convention was selected thought , selected by agreement , by the common judgment of the Convention , from the thought of individuals . As soon as the members of the // Convention began their discussions , the common presence stimulated individual thought , the common criticism made it change form and grow , and the common judgment selected from it what was wisest and best . The final result was the people 's selected wisdom , wiser than the wisdom of its wisest man . Where , then , is the difficulty in merely amending the Constitution , if the making of it was so quickly and easily accomplished ? Let us examine the conditions of the existing problem . Now , as was the case in 1787 , men are not yet agreed as to the specific thing to be done . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reached only by a national convention , where discussion can be had by men from all parts of the country , representing all interests and all shades of thought . Thereby only shall we be able to get the common judgment of the people as to the cause of existing evils , and the nature of the remedy for them . Any remedy proposed by only one man would in all human probability be very incomplete , and in many points ill-fitted to accomplish its end . But public opinion is now much farther advanced than it was in 1787 . It has already reached a clear consciousness of the true nature of the evils under which we now suffer . Men generally are agreed that , under our present system of government , the people do not themselves select or control their public officials , but that their public officials are selected and controlled by a " machine , " which , in its turn , is controlled by a " boss . " The words are not pleasing words , but they mean things . Men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an election is at most a new " machine , " or a new " boss . " The common use of these words means that the people are thoroughly aware that the things for which the words stand have an existence . When a people coins new words , or new meanings for old words , it signifies that new things have come into being , or at least that the people have gained a new consciousness of the things to which they give a name . The work which is now to be done by the people is not nearly so great as that done in 1787 . Then a new government was to be created out of nothing . All that we now have to do is to make modifications in a government which already exists . The obstacles in the way of the constitutional changes now needed in our system , compared with those which were in the way of the formation of our national government , are almost none . The jealousies and fears of the peoples of the different States in 1787 were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . We are one people , with common thoughts , feelings , and interests . The changes now needed in our System of national government , whatever they may be , will affect the peoples of all the different States in precisely the same way . Nor is there any question of State rights involved . It is not here proposed to increase the powers of the general government , but only to distribute those powers among the different officials in a different manner , to change the method of election , and to make elections come at different times-only at the times when they are needed for their proper purposes . But it is in the forces at our command that we have our great advantage over the men one hundred years ago-an advantage which can not be estimated . The adoption of our national Constitution was accomplished at a time when there were no railroads , no telegraphs-when , we can almost say , we had no public press . Compare the conditions to-day . Thought now moves with much greater speed . It is lightning against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common interests , but its daily thoughts are the same . Mr. Webster said that the drum-beat of the British army circled around the world with each rising sun . But it was not the same drum-beat . To-day , however , it is the same thought , over the same events , over the same daily history of all the nations of the earth , which the whole American people thinks each day . In 1787 , no one knew what the Constitutional Convention was doing until long after its work was done . If a national convention were now to be held , every village in the land would think with it and discuss with it . It would be , in a new sense , a people 's convention . Its action would be known and approved , as soon as it was taken , in every State , county , city , and town . How , then , can there be a doubt as to the possibility , the thorough ease , of making whatever constitutional changes we need in our national Constitution and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people to amend constitutions , if there is any sound reason for doing so ; the work we now have to do is not nearly so large as the work done in 1787 ; the // obstacles in its way are not so great ; the forces at our command are much greater ; public opinion is much farther advanced . Where is the difficulty ? Here is a problem in the Rule of Three If , in the eighteenth century , the peoples of thirteen independent States , who were held apart by strong local fears and jealousies , who had no railroads or telegraphs or daily press , made a new central government in five years , how long , in the nineteenth century , will one people , who have common feelings , thoughts , and interests , with their land a net-work of railroads and telegraphs , with newspapers by the thousand , require to make a trifling modification in their methods of appointing and controlling their public servants ? II . How can the people be persuaded to surrender their power-their right of voting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own public officers ? The system here proposed is one whereby the people are to regain power which they have lost , instead of losing power which they have . They will give up a form , in order to secure a substance . If , however , it were conceded that the system here proposed involved a surrender of power by the people , what then ? Can not the American people be persuaded to surrender power ? Again we forget our own history . The political life of the people of the United States has thus far been a succession of surrenders of power by the people . Elsewhere governments have been a slow and tedious growth , the result of conquest , followed by long years of tyranny , ending in a violent revolution . With us ( for what we call the Revolutionary War was merely a dropping off from the parent plant , and the late Rebellion was only a severe local disease ) , government has been at each stage a creation by the people themselves-a formal framing of a constitution , of a scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , to which they promise submission . And it has always been the free act of a people which was already free . Other nations have , with a great price , purchased their freedom , but we were free-born . It was of our own freewill that we put on the bonds of the law . It is this submission to the power of the law which has made us bear so long and so calmly the evils of our present system of government . III . But how can the people be persuaded to make what will seem to them a rash experiment , of which no man can foresee the results ? What was the Constitution itself but an experiment ? And who could foresee its . results ? We have , however , the results of that one experiment , where our fathers had substantially nothing but conjecture . They were the original inventors of the political locomotive . We have been operating their invention for a hundred years , and time has developed defects . We have been increasing the power and speed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find it is now absolutely necessary to have an air-brake . We find , moreover , that it does . not conduce to the orderly progress of the railway train if we stop the train once in four hours , and have a grand pitched battle , in which engineer , brakemen , and passengers all take part , for the purpose of seeing who shall drive the locomotive during the next stage of the journey . We have found that that plan is too exciting ; it is costly ; it diverts the attention of the engineer ; and , on the whole , it does not conduce to the safety of the passengers . The question with us now is , whether we shall make a new experiment , which may or may not prove a thorough success , or continue an old one which we know has failed . It is an experiment for us to continue our present system of government without . a change ; for we have new conditions .. Can it be that political science is the only thing which has stood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1787 , . without any experience at all , knew more than we do , with the experience of a century ? IV . Is it necessary , even if it is practicable , to make any radical constitutionaL change in our system of government ? Our great difficulty lies in the fact that our political life is a never-ending struggle for office . How bitter that struggle can be , . we have just had a most striking proof . Assassination , which we have fancied was a prerogative of the hopeless victims of des-. potism , has now for the third time been . attempted against the elected chief magistrate of a free people . Who can say that the attempt will not be often repeated ? It is one fruit , not at all times a necessary fruit , of the never-ending struggle for office , and that struggle is the necessary result of our present system of government . The United States Senate and the New York State Legislature have now for months been engaged in a mere struggle for the spoils of an election campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States // Senators on the one side , the President of the United States has been , perhaps unwillingly , and undoubtedly in defense of his prerogatives under the Constitution , a party to it on the other side . In the warmth of our sympathy for the victim of a great crime , we can not afford to make false studies of political phenomena . Statutes and rules for the appointment of the lower grades of officials in our executive administration may do great good , but they will never reach the roots of this disease . The difficulty is , that our members of Congress and of the State legislatures , our mayors , and governors , and presidents , are compelled always to keep on foot these great election armies , to recruit them from our public officials , and to pay them from the public purse . I find in one of the latest of our daily journals the following extract : " The President to-day sent for the Commissioner of Pensions , and told him frankly that the /ressure for his removal was such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the same time , assured him with equal frankness that against his administration of the Pension Bureau there was not a shadow of suspicion . The Commissioner returned to his office , and promptly wrote his resignation , and sent it to the President . " The statement contained in that extract has been repeated in most of the newspapers of the day , and no one has taken the trouble to contradict it . The statement may not be literally correct . But how many appointments to office are made , either by the President of the United States , or by the governor of any State , or by the mayor of any city , except in payment for election work ? We say the appointments are made for " party considerations . " That phrase , disguise it as we may , means nothing more nor less than that offices are given in payment for election work . And in what respect does that differ from selling votes or offices for money ? We have , in the extract just given , the true statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure is such that lie can no longer resist the demands made . " Every officer , from the top to the bottom , is under this same " pressure . " But it is with the men at the head that the difficulty mainly lies . We may have civil service rules and statutes without number . But it is in the enforcing of rules , rather than the making of them , that the difficulty lies . The enforcing of rules is , and always will be , in the hands of the men at the top . And those men must be relieved from the pressure under which we now keep them , before they will enforce rules of any kind . The President of the United States would be glad to give us an efficient civil service , if he could . But human nature is not equal to resisting this pressure . We can , no doubt , somewhat improve our public service by competitive examinations for subordinates . But what kind of a service is it , that has only efficient subordinates ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . There can be no efficiency or security unless the men at the head are men of ability and experience , and unless they are free to manage the ship according to their best judgment , without being compelled to handle the vessel according to the needs of the election organizations . V. Even if it be shown that a radical change is needed , and that the people will agree to it , how can the people overthrow the power of the election machine ? The men now in office , who now control the election organizations , will themselves destroy the election machine , if we will make it for their interest to do so . We can make it for their interest if we will only make them free from their dependence upon the machine . We must put the men whom we now have in office under a new system , instead of continually trying to get a new set of men under the old system . The men we now have will do well enough under a proper system . The system we now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these men who are now in our employ : " We will give you a fair chance-we will put you under reasonable , common-sense conditions , such as the experience of the whole human race has found necessary for a successful use of men . We say to you now , you shall stay in our service all your lives , so long as you serve us well , and you shall leave our service , not at the end of four years , but at once , if you serve us ill . We will no longer require you to carry the next election as a condition of remaining in our employment , for we know that on that condition you will give your time to carrying elections . We are , on our part , heartily tired of government by election machine , and we know that you are so , too . Let us try a new method . We see that , outside of our affairs , you are honest men . You keep your word ; you do what you think you ought in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you would deal honestly with us in the duties of your public offices , if we did not compel you to depend for your success in // Life on doing some other work than ours . Let us make the experiment . " The plan , then , here proposed has as its main features the responsibility of the chief executive , the abolition of the term system , and the abolition of large election districts . It is proposed , also , to abolish this term system for the men who now fill our public offices , and to have them continue to hold their places so long as they are faithful . The reasons in favor of this particular last proposition are as follows : It is only justice to the men who are now in our public employment to keep them there until they fail us . We have put them in those places-that is , we have adopted their appointments by the election machine . Although it may be said that they took office on an understanding that they might be required to leave it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fairer course toward them to allow them to remain in our service until there is some failure on their part for which they should be discharged . By entering our seryice they have , at least for a time , incapacitated themselves for other occupations . They are the best body of men with whom to begin an attempt to reform the administration of our public affairs . Many of them are very able men . They have , indeed , been selected on false tests and trained in a false school . But they have won their places in a struggle where it has required ability to win . These men now in office have now had a longer experience in their official duties than any equal number of men whom we could select . And they will be ready to serve us well , if we will only allow them to do so . But the chief reason in favor of putting these very men , the present President of the United States , the present governors of States , the present mayors of cities , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common-sense human tenure , instead of the tenure by solar time , is that thereby we can secure the codperation of the men who now hold the control of the election organizations in favor of the reform of our government . Some of these men are Republicans , some are Democrats-together they control the two organizations . They will be very glad to support any scheme which will secure to them the holding of their present places . It is matter of great doubt whether any plan of reform can be carried in the face of the combined opposition of the leaders of the great election organiza tions . Thus far , their opposition has been combined , and it has been successful . As things are now , regulations for the reform of the civil service will not be honestly carried out , even if they should be formally adopted . The leaders on both sides are opposed to it . They will continue to give us platforms without performance as long as the present system of government remains . Th&amp; reason is that , under our present system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been mentioned . They will give us good appointments as soon as we make it for their interest to do so , and not before . As soon as we give them the power of appointing and removing their subordinates , and give them the chance of keeping their places and of making a reputation for themselves by efficient service , they will make good appointments . For , otherwise , they will destroy their own reputations . At least , that is the way human nature works outside of public office . The reasons , then , for beginning the abolition of the term system now , with the men whom we now have in public places , are , that such a measure would be simple justice to the men themselves ; they would be the best men with whom we could begin a reform of our public service ; and thereby we could secure their codperation in making the reform . This would be " reform within the machine . " This would be reform within both machines at the same time . The system of term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction against the system of irresponsible hereditary power . The evils of the irresponsible hereditary system are two : It selects men on the wrong principle , selecting them by the accident of birth , instead of for fitness ; it provides no means of removing the sovereign for inefficiency or misconduct , no lawful method of enforcing his responsibility . The way to meet those two evils is to meet them directly and simply - that is , to have the people elect their chief - magistrate , and to provide the means of enforcing his responsibility by removal in case he uses his power wrongly . But , in nearly all attempts thus far made to avoid the evils of an irresponsible hereditary chief magistracy , it has been the leading feature to substitute , for the irresponsible life tenure , tenure by term election . There is also that other weird , fantastic device called constitutional royalty , which consists in surrounding the chief ruler with twenty heads of executive departments , // and removing all those heads of departments whenever they fail on a vote in the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a name so ill-deserved , are merely different forms of government by election machine . It is hard to say which form is the most pernicious . But the experience of the last hundred years has clearly demonstrated that they are all constructed on false principles , and that they are not equal to the needs of the age . They served the purposes of their day . They were temporary revolutionary , or evolutionary , make-shifts . But this American people has outgrown them all . Their day for us is gone . We have exhausted the possibilities of the system which was founded on distrust . All human private affairs are transacted from day to day on the basis of confidence in men . Public affairs must be transacted on the same basis . They can be so transacted with perfect safety . The large majority of men are , as a matter of simple habit and instinct , faithful to their trusts . It is not from fear or compulsion that the private work of the world is in the main well and honestly done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They remain men of honor , if they were so before . Our security for honest public service must always be , in the main , the character of the men whom we put there . If we have our chief rulers chosen by the real voice of the people , we shall be certain of one thing , and that is , we shall have at the head of our public affairs , almost without an exception , honest men . The men in our public service have aids to honest conduct , such as no private individuals can have , from the greater degree of publicity to which they are exposed . That alone , in a country which has a free press , will keep our public men pure , if we only take time , if we have time to hold men to their official responsibility . But , with these never-ceasing elections , an official is out of office before we can find out who is responsible for the wrong working of public affairs . Public officials do not now fear exposure ; they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term ; if it comes , they think they can avoid its effects until the next election ; and when the next election comes , it will be another grand carnival of banners , and platforms , and glorious old party principles . Under the system which hits been here set forth , we shall trust men with tower . At the head of city and State and national affairs there will be a body of men , chosen by the people , whom the people will have to trust . Those men will have the power of voting the people 's money , as they see fit . They will have the power of removing the people 's chief magistrate , when they see fit . Trusting men whom the people choose is entirely safe . We trust men now , under the system which we have . We are compelled to do so . We can trust these men more safely , if we leave them free , than we can if we compel them continually to d@ election work . But if that be not so , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants wisely , and if the servants whom the people choose can not be trusted to serve the people truly , then government by the people is a failure  --  and we must go back to the methods of Constantinople and the dark ages . The movement of the age is not in that direction . Government by the people has not failed . We have not , indeed , yet found its perfect form . The men of 1787 did not do their work for all time . In these hundred years , something has been learned in political , as well as physical , science . This first experiment in a people 's government for a great nation has not been , in every respect , a thorough success , but it has been fruitful in great lessons . Something is stilt to be done . And it is time for the people to hold their Convention , to take counsel on the situation . We need not yet despair of the Republic .                @ @ @ @ @
