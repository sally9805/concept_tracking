txt The suspension of Weigher , STERLING is a notice to the Democratic Convention that the Administration is not affected by the attitude of those members of the party who-are hostile to the reform of the civil service . It is even more than that . It is a warning that if any politician or band of politicians have made bargains to promote their ends , in which the distribution of Federal offices is counted on to aid them , they will be disappointed . We do not , of course , assume that the suspension of STERLING is equivalent to a dismissal . It would be unfair to the President and to Mr. MANNING to assume that they have made up their minds what will be the result of the inquiry they have ordered . But it is plain that the inquiry is to be a searching one . If it were not to be so , the man would not have been suspended while it was going on . A sham investigation , which was intended to change nothing , would not have been preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating the action of the Secretary and the President , we may say , knowing the facts that must be brought to their attention , that , having cleared the situation by STERLING 'S suspension , they are not likely to make it worse again by reinstating him . An investigation , whatever representations Messrs . BEATTIE and HEDDEN may make , must bring out the fact that the appointment was not only partisan but factional , that it was made to advance the schemes of a particular candidate for the nomination for Governor and of the men who are backing or pushing him , and that it was expected that to reach this end an important concession would be made with reference to Brooklyn politics as well . The whole thing was a " deal , " with the customary complex features of a " deal , " with which the public service had little to do , civil service reform just as little , and the reputation and dignity of the Administration , which is pledged to the reform , nothing at all . It is quite proper that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , matter , but Mr. DANIEL MANNING , in his personal capacity , does not need to be told what was the real charactir of the whole transaction . It is these facts which make the act of the Administration in suspending STERLING of such significance , and an act of such remarkable courage and loyalty . Within two days of the convention in which a large part of the fruits of the Sterling job were to be gathered , and with the knowledge that these fruits were to come into the hands of men who claim to be the special friends of the Administration , the job is " dished . " Whatever the inattentive observer may thinlr of such a policy , its meaning will be beyond all doubt clear to Boss MCLAUGHLIN and HUBERT 0 . THOMPSON and Surveyor BEATTIE and EDWARD COOPER . Even Collector HanDEN , in his muddle-headed way , will begin to realize that something has happened . For him indeed we are free to confess that we feel something akin to pity . He is not a knave . He is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has the idea of many a silly business man that " practical politics " is a mystery , known only to professionals , and that men who had got him a fat salary and an enviable position could be trusted to guide him in his political course . And he had learned so poorly the part he was to play ; there has been such an awkwardness in his recital of the stories about " a routine matter , " an affair that does " not concern the public , " and all the rest of the nonsense with which Mr. BEATTIE bad stuffed him , that it is touching to realize the amazement with which he has discovered that it would have been easier as well as more decent for him to be honest from the start . We trust , and we expect , that the suspension of STERLING will be followed by an interpretation of the civil service law from the President , requiring the place to be filled by competition . That would be the natural result of a candid consideration of the law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make his appreciation of the situation still clearer by dismissing Messrs . BEATTIE and HEDDEN , and putting in their places two Democrats sufficiently loyal to their party to respect the pledges of its President .
