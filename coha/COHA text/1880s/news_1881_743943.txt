txt In all probability it will be found that in the present year our American ship merchants have been more successful than during any twelve months for many years past . In the coastwise trade there has been a brisk demand for vessels at rates which pay to their owners a good profit , a result due partly to the increase of business and in part to the diminution of available tonnage . For six or eight years past the profits in the coastwise trade for sailing vessels have been so small that their owners could hardly afford to insure them against loss , and for this reason , - when a disaster occurred , they were not in a position to replace the lost craft by a new one . As no inducement was held out to capitalists to put money into this species of tonnage , the amount afloat has gradually decreased , until now , with the ordinary expansion of business , the supply of vessels is inadequate to the demand , and those who have held to their shipping property through the period of depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market . With the foreign trade the improvement has been almost as great , as may be judged by comparing the freight rates paid three or four years ago with those now obtainable . Thus , grain freights from San Francisco to Europe , which have been down below 40s. per ton , are now 77s. and 80s. per ton . The rates for general merchandise at Calcutta were for a long time between $5 and $7 to the ton ; they are now considerably over $10 per ton . The rates paid for sending sugar and hemp from Manila to the United States and Western Europe varied in the past from $7 to $9 per ton , but for the last six months from $14 to $16 per ton has been paid . The increase is also perceptible in the payments made for carrying guano and nitrate from the West coast of South America , tea from China , and wool and wheat from Australia . In fact , the business for sailing vessels is decidedly good on all of those great ocean routes upon which they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind is of the utmost importance to our ship-owners . Almost all of the American tonnage engaged in foreign trade is in the form of sailing vessels , and it is pleasing to know that after so many years of financial suffering our ship merchants are likely to make a handsome profit . While a number of reasons , more or less superficial , have been given for this change , it seems to us that one or two important points have been overlooked . The enormous fall in the rates of freight paid to sailing vessels which took place eight or ten years ago , and which has been felt up to the beginning of the current year , was plainly due to the intense competition among the owners of these vessels to secure cargoes . The compound engine had been invented , and the possibility of carrying freight at a low price on transoceanic voyages in steamers had been demonstrated . The vessels that had been profitably employed in the North Atlantic , Mediterranean , and East and West Indian trades were in many cases obliged to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior freighting vessel out of the steamer when the voyage did not exceed 5,000 miles in length . There were routes , however , of two and three times this distance upon which even the compound engine ships could not compete with sailing vessels , except for the highest class of freight , and upon these long routes the vessels that had been crowded out of the shorter routes were placed . The result was an immediate decline in the freight rates upon these long routes , and a loss of money to all those who had capital invested in sailing vessels . The supply of tonnage was abnormal and far exceeded the demand . The only hope of the ship merchant was that in time there would be an increase in the demand for tonnage , Etna that the volume of the latter , in consequence of loss , condemnation , and failure to build new vessels , would decline . This is exactly what has taken place . There is upon all of the long ocean routes more transportation going on than in the past , while in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminution in the number of sailing ships afloat of 1,200 tons burden and upward . Very few additions have been made to the American merchant fleet , while in England the belief that steamers were destined to absorb the ocean carrying trade has prevented the building to any great extent of large sailing ships . The present condition of the trade demonstrates that the fear of steam-ship competition was over-estimated . As we have already said , there are routes upon which sailing craft can successfully compete with steamers . Another coal-saving invention , such as the compound engine , may change this , but until this discovery is made and the improvement perfected , sailing ships have the market to themselves . It is true that two charters have been recently made in England of steamers to take railroad supplies to the west coast of Mexico , and then load with grain in California for their return voyage . But the rates paid are so high that it is questionable if the experiment will be repeated , the trouble being that the steamers will occupy twothirds of the time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where trade winds can be constantly depended upon , the advantages of steam power are reduced to a minimum . There is , then , for some time to come the prospect of good business for American sailing vessels , and if our consular laws and other obstacles to trade were reformed , it is likely that quite an amount of new tonnage would be constructed in this country within the next two or three years .
