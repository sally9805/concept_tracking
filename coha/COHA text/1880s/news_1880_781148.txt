txt The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections continued the examination of Mr. Kellogg 's witnesses today . The full committee decided this morning to admit as evidence a note from William K. Spiering to the witness Seymour , who was recalled to-day , in which he personally agreed to pay $1,500 , if the said amount was required , to obtain affidavits from Blackstone and others that money was paid by Kellogg to secure his election to the United Srates Senate ; also , an agreement entered into between Blackstone , Dicks , and Ewert , which provided for a division among themselves of the $1,500 . Mr. Seymour , on cross-examination to-day , stated that , after receiving this note from Spierintr , he concluded that this was a combination entered into for a corrupt purpose , and subsequently refused to have any further connection with the matter . Mr. Hill asked the witness why he had not sworn these witnesses to the affidavit himself , to which ho replied that , knowing the slippery character of the colored members of the Legislature , and fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny having signed any such papers . he took them before another notary , and only witnessed the Affidavits . L. J. Souer , who was a member of the Louisiana Legislature , and Chairman of the Committee on Contingent Expenses , in 1877 , was then examined . He denied the statement made by Mr. Murray before the sub-committee in New-Orleans , that he Souer had paid money to members of the Legislature to vote for Kellogg , and testified that he did not know of any money being paid by anybody to secure the election of Kellogg . After subjecting this witness to a long cross-examination in relation to the advancing of money to different members of the Legislature on vouchers authorized by Setter , as Chairman of the Committee on Contingent Expenses , the committee adjourned until to-morrow morning .
