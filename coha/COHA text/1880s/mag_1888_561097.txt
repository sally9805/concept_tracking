WHETHER it is right or wrong , per se , to buy or sell intoxicating liquors , is a question which loses its interest to me in the face of the acknowledged and appalling evils with which the liquor traffic confronts us . It is not easy to exaggerate these evils , even if this were possible . There is no single channel through which such depths of misery flow over the human race as through this . No ravages of disease , no devastation of nature , no kinds of vice or crime work so much woe as this . Such a statement no intelligent person will be likely to doubt , and no honest one to deny . The liquor traffic is responsible for four-fifths of our poverty , seven-eighths of our crime , and for a proportion of our disease , and vice , and wrong  --  to say nothing of taxation , which makes every other evil almost insignificant . Now , it is undoubtedly true that all these evils have a moral source . They root themselves in the choices of a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every man 's life were set upon virtue . And it is equally true that a virtuous purpose must be free . No man is made virtuous by compulsion . His virtue is not put upon him or placed within him , save as he himself originates it in his own choice . I have no dispute , therefore , with one who tells me that law is not sufficient for virtue . I know very well that good laws do not make goodness . Evil remains in the human heart and in society under the best laws . // But it is a prodigious mistake , therefore , to argue against all constraint of human conduct except by moral means . One ignores the actual facts of human nature who denies the necessity of physical coercion among men . If the infant Hercules could strangle the serpent in his cradle , unnumbered other infants , with a genuine life , would be strangled by the monster unless he were kept from creeping upon them by a power stronger than he . While we would do everything we can to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us not ignore the need , or renounce the privilege , or throw away the power we have of helping them , by all means , to this self-control . In the present condition of the world we may not adjust our laws to the resources of the actual heroes , and forget the requirements of the possible ones . Most persons , however , admit that men , as they are , can not be governed without force , and that the liquor traffic needs to be regulated by law . The Western Liquor Dealers and Manufacturers ' Protective Association not long ago expressed itself as decidedly convinced of such a need . The question , therefore , relating to the liquor traffic , is not between law and no law , but between one kind of law and another . And , practically , the progress of discussion has narrowed us down to the question , whether we should license the traffic , or prohibit it . Now , I compare all possible good which may come from the traffic with its actual evils , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain is obliterated by the overwhelming loss . I therefore disregard the gain ,  --  questionable at the best ,  --  and , addressing myself to the enormity of the loss , I would do my utmost to remove it by the destruction of its source . Instead of attempting to restrict , I would prohibit absolutely the traffic , believing that we may thus immediately and greatly lessen the evils , which we hope thus ultimately and wholly to destroy . My reason for such a position-as in this paper I must be briefmay be succinctly stated . 1 . A restriction which permits the trade and simply limits the traders to those who are licensed to sell , sets no limit upon the bnyer . His opportunity is not diminished . He can get his liquor , if he wi5hes it , just as copiously as before . One saloon will supply the craving of five hundred  --  or five thousand , for that m-a*-ter-* well as many . The evils , therefore , of the traffic are net // necessarily reduced by reducing the numbers of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sold , rather than their reduction , is what we need , and ought to seek . 2 . License , high or low , takes away what ought to be , and , in a healthy community , would be , an important moral restriction , from the seller . It removes from him the condemnation of the community , and justifies him . It makes his act legal . His moral sense , easily blinded by the gigantic profits of his trade , is thus paralyzed . He becomes thus , what we find him to be , obdurate , rapacious , an evil man and seducer , who waxes worse and worse . I do not wish to condemn him , or any man , but I do not know of any trade so demoralizing to the trader-any class of sales which does the seller so much moi al mischief-as that in intoxicating drinks . And to this damage the community contributes by licensing him in his trade . 3 . To license the liquor traffic on the view that the enormity of its evils can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far shown this to be ,  --  to sanction the opening of its floodgates of woe on the pretense that to keep them shut is to infringe upon the liberty which a wise government should ever guard , is not only , as it seems to me , the enslavement of the multitude for the freedom of the few ,  --  an attempt whose result is likely to be the bondage of all ,  --  but it makes the community itself a party to wrong doing . This can not be done without lowering its own moral tone . 4 . The revenue from license falls heaviest where the burden ought to be the least . The cost of the license , while it may add to the price of the liquor sold , does not , so far as I can learn , diminish the amount of the liquor bought and consumed . Practically , the cost of liquor within the limits which any license is likely to put , seems to have little to do with the consumption . An intemperate man is not likely to drink more because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difference between three cents a glass and four makes no appreciable difference with him . But the family of the drunkard ! Alas ! alas ! the great revenues for high license , the enormous taxes on intoxicating drinks are wrung from the wretchedness of worse than widowed wives and worse than orphaned children . The presence of the prohibitory party in our national politics is in itself a moral education . I hold that the end it seeks is wise // statesmanship and sound ethics , and while I do not anticipate an immediate victory from the use of this weapon , nor an ultimate victory , if we do not employ other weapons also ; while I do not believe that Prohibition alone will stop the sale of strong drink any more than it will stop the continuance of gambling , or of theft , or of any other crime , I would make it clear by statute that it is a crime , believing , with Mr. Gladstone , that " it is the duty of Government to make it as hard as possible for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to go right . " JuLIus H. SEELYE . IT is evident that the flowing tide is at last with the temperance reform . The solution of the very great and complex problem involved in this reform is next in order ; it stands next on the calendar of time . Austin Phelps has said no great social evil has begun to amend ever until it has reached the point of suppuration . The liquor evil has assuredly reached this point , and there is well grounded reason for the belief that the day of amendment is at hand . Two methods of cure are presented : One , restriction by license , or taxation , made higher and higher ; the other , prohibition . There was a time , back in the twilight of civilization , in almost every country , when stealing was common and little thought of ; that theft , in one way or another , was licensed . In France and in Germany still it is thought wise to attempt to control the bawdy-house by license ; and , even in parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great question in that early age was shall the law be put against stealing ; shall theft be made an outlaw at all times and at all places , or shall the privilege of stealing be purchaseable by the few ? Then , as now , doubtless , it was argued that " license is restriction " ; it is " partial prohibition . " But , finally , when theft was made an outlaw-completely , unequivocally so  --  a mighty step upward was taken . The time will come when to legalize a saloon will be thought as hurtful to social order , as is deemed to-day the legalization of a bawdyhouse or a faro-bank ; and then an open saloon on a public thoroughfare will be as rare a sight as will be a house of ill-fame or a gambling hell . // Right here rests the strongest argument for Prohibition : with the masses the most potent educator is the law . With them that which the law permits is right and that which the law forbids is wrong . The law is the great schoolmaster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching license , this will remain true in all of its tremendous educatiohal effect over the minds of the multitude , The selling , buying and drinking of liquor as a beverage is not wrong , for it is permitted by law . That was a monstrous wrong done by the New York Legislature two years ago , the enactment of the Jves law , whereby pool-selling was made legal . After the passage of that law , said a prominent pool seller , " I now feel like a gentleman ; my business is legal . " A saloonkeeper points to his neatly framed " Permit , " signed by wellknown , respectable citizens , and says , " 1 am in a legal business and can claim for my protection all that the flag of my country represents . " The Nevada Liquor Dealers ' Association several years ago passed this resolution : " Resolt , ed , That so long as our business is licensed by the United 8tates , State and County , we consider it perfectly legitimate and honorable , and do not think that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In Paris the educational effect of the law on the side of prostitution is horrible beyond thought . According to Von Oettingen 's " Moral Statistik " ( 3d ed. 1882 ) , fifty per cent . nearly of the fifty thousand children born annually in that city are born out of wedlock . A gentleman who , as commissioner , had charge for years of the business of licensing bawdy houses in Paris , tells a story of an old lady whose license he had often renewed . She wrote to him thanking him for his uniform kindness to her , and ended her letter by saying that she was now four-score years and over , and would soon depart for her home beyond the skies , but that her business would be conducted by her granddaughters , and she bespoke for them the same congiderate care from his hands that he had shown her , and that she from heaven would bless him . This I quote from a newspaper clipping , and see no reason to doubt its correctness . There was not , seemingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her business was not a proper one . And why should we have expected , pray , to have found such a suspicion ? She had complied with the law , and she felt that the law had its mighty arms of protection about her . To the vast majority the law is the one visible , concrete form of right and wrong . // It is a frightful blunder to place the educative power of the law on the side of a wrong . Let the thunder of the legal code be like that of Sinai , " Thou shalt not . " Back yonder , in that distant twilight , Moses might have said , " 0 Lord , the people are not ready for these prohibitory laws . Public sentiment is not educated sufficiently . They will lie and steal and worship idols . Let us go at the reform gradually . Give them license laws , low license for worshiping a calf ; high license for worshiping a full grown cow . " No ; " thou shalt not " has thundered down the ages , educating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that when tbe Roman emperors fought with the gladiators , leaden swords were used . A license law is a very clumsy sword wielded against the wrong by " the powers that be . " It is the duty of government to make the path upward plain as possible and easy as possible , and the way to wrong dark and difficult . " Bat , " it is objected , " you can not enforce a prohibitory law . " Grant , for argument 's sake , that the law can not be enforced , perfectly enforced . It is still advantageous , exceedingly so , to put the educative power of the law against the evil . An unenforced righteous law is infinitely better than an enforced law that gives half sanction to the wrong . It is never wise to legalize a fragment of a wrong in order to suppress the remainder . In the end the experiment will be found always disastrous . " But you confound things that are sinful with things that are simply dangerous . We prohibit a sin ; we regulate things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon is dangerous . " Again , for argument 's sake , grant this distinction . It is not true that we never prohibit things that are dangerous . We prohibit the building of frame houses inside the fire limits . Why ? Not because the building of such a house is sinful , but because it is dangerous . In localities we prohibit absolutely slaughter houses , bone factories , pow*zIer mills , etc. , solely because these things are dangerous . Prove the saloon to be always a menace to the public welfare , and you have ground sufficient for prohibition . And is it not such a menace ? Permit me to quote what I have published elsewhere : The liquor traffic is a stupendous injury to society and to our Government , and is a portentous and continuous menace to both ; responsible , according to Chief Justice Noah Davis , * for eighty percent . of all crime ; according to Premier // Gladstone , for the infliction of more harm on man " than the three great historic scourges , war , famine and pestilence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Willard Parker , + for 35 per cent , of lunacy , 45 per cent , of idiocy , 75 to 90 per cent . of pauperism , and 10 per cent . of deaths ; according to the New York Tribune , " this traffic lies at the centre of all political and social mischief , it paralyzes energies in every direction , it neutralizes educational agencies , it silences the voice of religion , it baffles penal reform , it obstructs political reform ; " according to Lord Chief Justice Coleridge , so intimately connected is the traffic with crime in England  --  and the same is certainly true in almost equal degree in America --  " If we could make England sober we would shut up nine tenths of her prisons ; " and according to the London Times , it is an evil of such vast and growing magnitude " that it may crush and ruin us alL " If a government was ever justified in prohibiting a thing that was dangerous , our government would be justified certainly in prohibiting the liquor traffic . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there in keeping the tremendous educatiug power of the law on its side ? Whatever else is done or left undone in reference to this traffic , let the business be made an outlaw . I. K. FUNK . " PROHIBITION , " written with a big " P , " is now a term used almost universally in this country to signify the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in every form to be used as a beverage  --  the prevention of this commercial transaction by law . There is now an enlarged , the only a ( lequate , and soon to be the universal sense of the term , which includes the manufacture and all other stages , such as transportation , importation from other countries , and any other circumstances which , as well as the sale , are a part of the process which precedes the consumption of such liquors as a beverage . This form of " Prohibition , " when enforced , will prohibit . When the individual makes his own law and prohibits the consumption of intoxicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , is an external force , and is a denial of personal liberty in the consumption of intoxicating beverages to individuals by the state . Is it " wise " to do this ? What is wisdom ? " The right use or exercise of knowledge ; the choice of laudable ends and of the best means to accomplish // them ; the exercise of sound judgment either in avoiding evils or attempting good . " Prohibition as a public policy may be considered first as to its own nature : whether it be a wise policy under any circumstances ; whether , granting its end to be desirable , such an infriugment upon the rights of individuals can be justified as a means to secure that end . In this sense it is opposed to the policy of absolute liberty to individuals in the use of alcoholic liquors as beverages . The true answer to this question must depend upon the fact whether or not such use is an evil , and , if so , how great an evil to society . If its moderate use be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no individual has a right to use it . He has no more right to injure society by injuring himself than by injuring another , and every evil to society which the law of society can reach , society by such law may prohibit . Here , then , is the main question . I assume that any internal administration which is not medicinal is , " for the purposes of this case , " to be taken to be " used as a beverage . " It does not follow that the use is not medicinal because no physician prescribes it . But I do assume that science has proven alcohol to be a poison as indisputably as strychnine , and that its administratration in any quantity to a perfectly healthy human being in condition not requiring medicine , is poisonous , deleterious to the health of the individual , and consequently being hurtful to that member of society who thus administers it to himself , and , by . force of example , to others . Thus , society suffers an evil which society may prohibit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to law ( for the law avoids those trifles which cost less than the oiling of its own machinery ) , then society should prohibit and destroy that evil . On the other hand , the opponents of " Prohibition " declare that the reasonable use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage is not poisonous , that only its excessive use is injurious to the individual , and hence only excessive use is hurtful to society ; that there is a use which lies between the medicinal and the excessive , which is not poisonous ; and most opponents to Prohibition go further , and say that the individual has complete freedom of use to any degree of merely personal hurt , and that society may not interfere further than to restrain and to punish acts of aggressive injury to others . // This is as yet a region of conflicting opinion upon facts as well as theory , and the law in any community which is republican in its form of government , will and should depend upon the facts as each community respectively acting as a jury upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination of the subject which I can make , I am satisfied that the use of alcohol to any extent as a beverage is poisonous , hurtful to the body and mind , almost sure to result in the destruction of the consumer , and full of evil example to others ; that the question whether the use be greatly harmful is not to be decided by noting the effect of the first , or it may be the thousandth glass , nor whether here or there may be found a castiron stomach and a brain with fibres of steel which can withstand the corrosive action of alcohol for a century ; but that the general tendency and final effect of the use as a beverage and the influence of example upon others are the criterion by which the action of society in the election between legal policies is to be decided . And maintaining this view , it is my opinion that the consumption of alcoholic drinks is wrong , because hurtful , both to the individual and to society , and that the law should prohibit not alone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere beverage , but its consumption as such by the individual . It can not be wrong to make and sell that which it is right to buy and consume . The relation between individuals and the communities which they constitute is not that of hostile bands of marauders separated only by geographical lines across which they continually make repris. als upon each other . The social condition is a plexus of harmonious relations , and no member has a right to do that which , injuring directly himself only , injures the whole body . The old fable of the " Belly and the members " is an authority in point . Certainly the evil of intemperance can not exist if there be no occasional or so-called moderate drinker . What greater evil is there in society than intemperance ? Is theft or arson , or even occasional murder , comparable to it ? Therefore I believe that Prohibition should include even the use of liquor as a beverage . There is no such thing possible as moderation in the use of poison when not administered medicinally . These and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and whatever is right I believe to be wise . // Second . But there are degrees in wisdom-wise , wiser , wisest . The question at the beginning has been answered , but I suppose in the public mind the real problem is " What is the wisest policy to be pursued in regard to the use of intoxicating drinks ? " Assuming that the free individual use is to be restricted by society , how shall it be done ? I still say by absolute Prohibition , because I believe Prohibition to be the wisest method of all , and in fact the only one which can result in the removal of the evil . This is not saying that other policies are foolish . There may be different policies which are wise and other methods wiser still , none of which are the wisest . I only claim that absolute Prohibition is the wisest of all . Prohibition is restraint . Whatever interposes obstacles to the free use is restraint , and therefore beneficial as far as it goes . Hence license laws which permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as they are restrictive , beneficial ; therefore they have more or less of wisdom in them , because there is more or less of Prohibition in their practical effect . They are better than nothing . But I must say that I think a small coal of fire about as dangerous in a powder magazine as a large one , and in the long run , and sometimes in the short run , a license law blows up society as badly as free rum . The theory is that the small coal will go out before the powder ignites ; but it does n't seem to work that way . Perhaps the better sizuile would be the use of almost water enough to put out the fire , but still leaving the edifice to burn under difficulties . The trouble is that the water gives out and the fire does not . After a while the firemen go home , the reservoir is exhausted , the enemy returns in the form of a new flood of fire , and society becomes again an earthly hell . The dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never can stop intemperance , however well enforced . Prohibition can . Agitate , and thus educate , until you create the public opinion with which to enforce it . In considering this subject , I think we may be instructed by asking ourselves the question , To what end should the efforts of " moral suasion " be directed in dealing with individuals ? Shall we teach total or partial abstinence ? Is it not common knowledge that moderate drinking is the highway to the drunkard 's grave ? Think of a " Temperance Reform " based upon the theory of drinking just enough , but not too much . What an // admirable improvement upon the old pavement of " good intentions " such a boiling concrete as that would be for the hot city ! No , it is proved beyond all cavil that the only safe rule for the individual is total abstinence . Total abstinence is the law which every man , and especially every boy , should lay down unto himself . It is the only law which any considerate parent will desire for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worse than arson or theft . But all are bad . Of two evils choose the least . But why choose either , when you have at hand a policy of absolute wisdom ? What good is there in a drunken stupor ? If there be none , why then go silly over a single glass ? It is all poison , and if total abstinence be the wisest policy or law for the individual , why is it not the wisest policy for society to lay down for the good of each and of all , under the sanctions of the law ? The question of enforcement which depends upon the public will , is , of course , important ; for without enforcement any policy is void But no law is ever fully enforced . If society were in that state of perfection , the law would no longer be needed . That would be the millennium " When all crimes shall cease and ancient frauds shall fail . " But the better the law in any state of society the more good will be obtained from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the most stringent license law enforced to perfection . Besides , Prohibition always holds up before the public mind the loftiest ideal of absolute right in the law . Thus the statute book , like the Bible , becomes an educator , although it may be violated . I am no believer in low , bad laws because there is vice and degradation among men . Lift up the ideals . It is injurious to society to ignore and violate the laws of Nature and of God . The golden rule is none too good law for the savage . God 's own laws being perfect are most violated , ' yet none of them have been repealed on that account . They are not enforced as well as the Maine liquor law , yet the ten commandments are as inflexible as the stone text of the original , and their author issues no license even to those who pay fees into the Treasury of the Temple itself . It will only confirm existing drunken habits and enable the devil to retain his own , for us to adopt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . // The law of God is always a Prohibitory law . In so far as man 's law is not God 's law , it is the devil 's law . The law should be perfect even if its execution partially fails . Perfect law will accomplish more than the imperfect law , while there will always be within its scope the complete remedy for all evil , and the consummate standard for aspiration and high endeavor . HENRY W. BLAIR . I AM invited , within the limit of fifteen hundred words , to answer the question : " Is Prohibition a wise policy ? " Why is all the civilized world moving in some way against the liquor traffic ? The answer is simple : because it is inconsistent with the general good . As it flourishes , every legitimate industry languishes and dies . It disinclines to honest and continuous work all who come under its influence , and finally unfits them for it . There is no interest , public or private , which it does not antagonize . There is no home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly , from its touch , which blasts everything coming within its grasp . It wastes the wages of labor , which ought to go to the homes of the workers ; it breaks down the health and shortens the lives of the people , which is a great social misery and a great public disaster . It diminishes and wastes to an extent beyond all power of computation the power of the Nation , physical , moral , financial . It inflicts upon Nation and people more and greater evils than come from all other causes of evil combined . At the same time no good whatever comes from it to the community . The inevitable tendency of the saloon , whatever its name , location , magnitude , or adornments may be , is to drive out from among the people every good thing , and to substitute for it everything bad , and so bad that nothing else in the world is or can be so bad . All over the English speaking world the people are actively seeking some remedy for this tremendous mischief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , able and we1l* meaning men . Let us establish it by law as an honest and useful industry , and perpetuate it through all coming time , some of these people say . Since we can not suppress it , let us regulate and // restrict it by " high-license , " others say , and when public opinion will sustain such a measure we can prohibit and suppress it . To repress it in any way , say others , is to interfere with personal liberty , and to assume powers not delegated by the people to the government , but which they have reserved to themselves . Now , what is it wise to do about it ? Under no form of license has the liquor traffic ever been " restricted " nor its volume diminished , because under that policy the demand for liquor , whatever it might be , was fully supplied . Many intelligent people have a horror of what they call " free rum . " What is the worst that can possibly come from that , ? This , and nothing more : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same thing will happen under any system of license , however carefully the law may be drawn . No one who has any knowledge of this matter , either personal or from books , can be ignorant of the fact that the liquor traffic licensed is practically " free rum . " There is no other country in the world where the policy of license has been more firmly established , or where the laws relating to it have been so carefully studied and elaborated as in England . At every session of Parliament there are bills brought in with a view to the changing in some way the law of license , under which the country has become one of the most drunken nations in the world , the condition of a large proportion of the working population there having become as the result of this policy almost unendurable . Looking the ground all over carefully , we " fanatical " temperance men and women have come to the conclusion , unanimously and irrevocably , that unde ' no circumstances nor for any consideration will we consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as our voice and vote are concerned , it shall have no standing under the law , but shall be put under its ban . If we can not have it forbidden and suppressed we will not consent that it shall have legal permission or protection . Whatever evil to society may come from it , let it be without sanction of the State . It seems to follow from all this that we are quite ready to declare prohibition to be a wise policy ; that it is the only wise policy ; and that no other has even a suspicion of wisdom in it . I do not forget that many able men affirm that prohibition has been a failure everywhere and must always continue to be so , and that // it is a folly to persist in a policy which practically has come to nothing . People who talk in that way have no knowledge of the matter of which they speak , and this is the only question , I think , upon which such men would venture an opinion without first knowing something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been adopted ; that is , everywhere it has diminished the volume of the liquor traffic , and from large areas of country it has driven out entirely drinking houses and tippling shops . These results of prohibition have been widely printed and published a thousand times all over the English speaking world , and it is not a credit to any intelligent man that he is ignorant of a matter which more deeply than any other touches the highest interests of nations and peoples . This being so , then how is it , objectors may inquire , that in Maine and in many other districts , where prohibition exists , the liquor traffic yet lingers on a scale larger or smaller , and more or less on the sly , especially in the cities and large towns ? The answer is simple and ready . Liquor is sold in violation of law , not for the fun of it , but for the profit . There has never yet been constructed any prohibitory law with reference to this fact and to meet this point , to wit To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violating it . The able men to whom I have alluded , who object to prohibition as impracticable , seem to assume that any law which simply forbids the liquor traffic is in fact " prohibitory , " irrespective of the character and quality of its machinery . The steam engine , the ocean steamer , the steam printing press , are a great success , and this is due only to the fact that their machinery is constructed and its several parts carefully and skillfully arranged with reference to the work which they have to perform . Everybody not quite an innocent can easily see this . Very well , then , Why have not the Prohibitionists arranged their laws with reference to this want ? The innocents ask this question , and coming from them , it is a proper one and should be answered . When the Maine Law was constructed it was supposed that public opinion might not approve such penalties as would fully meet the necessities of the case , and they were therefore made moderate to avoid that danger . All other prohibitory laws have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our experience in the enforcement of these laws has emphasized the // fact , that they are imperfect in having insufficient penalties , and in permitting such discretion to the courts that in many localities the law is practically nullified . Why then , the innocent may properly inquire , do we not have these imperfections corrected and these wants supplied ? The politics of the country , in nation , states , and cities , is now a mere scramble for office and its rewards , with no reference whatever to the public welfare . The liquor traffic is a tremendous power , from its magnitude , its wealth , its large vote , which is a unit , employed only in its own interest , and from its ability to corrupt voters with its money and party leaders by its ballots . From this it happens that now , so far as its interests are concerned , it controls absolutely the legislation of the nation and of the states and cities ; so we find it difficult everywhere , and in Maine impossible , for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fraction of the liquor traffic yet remaining . This traffic now notoriously controls the politics of the country . In the near future two great parties will be openly and square ! y divided upon the question-Rum or No Rum ? and the battle will be fought out at the ballot-box on that line . All other questions of public policy of whatever kind are insignificant when compared with this . Protection to the labor of the country from foreign competition , so that our people may have larger wages , looks only to this point , that our homes may be peaceful , prosperous , thrifty , happy , from a larger expenditure upon the necessaries , comforts and refinements of life . The suppression of the liquor traffic , which politicians resist , would insure all this beyond the wildest dreams of the warmest imagination , since it would involve a saving to our firesides of more than fifteen hundred million dollars annually-a sum so vast as to be incomprehensible-now spent , lost , far worse than wasted in drink . NEAL Dow . IF , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most effective form , then is it most assuredly a wise policy . The restraining sentiment and law must cover a sufficient territory to give the conditions of independent action , and be so sustained by those who , as public officers , embody the power of the people as to bring that power fully , readily and constantly to bear in the // accomplishment of its purpose . We are glad to make an appeal to reason on the question . If sound reason does not support Prohibition as a national policy , the discovery of that fact would bring instant relief from wearing and unrewarded labor ; if it does justify Prohibition , we shall appeal the more hopefully to our fellow citizens to support the measure . If we consider the slightness of the pleasures that attend on strictly temperate use of intoxicating drinks , the temptations which accompany it , the ease with which this indulgence passes into excess , the obscurity of the transition , the many disturbances and diseases which more careful investigation is tracing to habits of drink which have hitherto been regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest , most convenient , most commanding and most pleasurable personal attitude . We lose almost nothing by it , and gain at once an impregnable position . Even though we hesitate at this point of personal safety and pleasure , if we regard the community as a whole , with its weakness of will , its excessive appetites , its greediness of excitement , its readiness in assuming a ground of factious and foolish independence , its slowness in seeing danger , its disastrous inheritance of vice both from physical and moral transmission , we can not doubt that entire abstinence alone furnishes the conditions of universal safety . We have no ground for a temperate use of intoxicating drinks in the community , till the physical balance of the general constitution is restored by long disuse , and greatly strengthened by moral force . We are as a patient who has already fallen into the hands of the physician , and with whom the injunction of abstinence is peremptory . If this conclusion is correct , if wine has often made , and is sure to make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathetic desire to render aid where aid is needed , I can not do otherwise than accept in my own action the common law of safety . Not to do this is to set up my own pleasures against the well-being of the community , is to isolate my life to its own injury and the injury of all . The well-being involved in this selfdenial is so extended , so urgent , that hesitancy to accept its mandate stands out as as flagrant self-assertion . It is unnecessary to dwell on the imperative motives to this self-denial . Philanthropy has been urging them for the last half century . They are wide and deep , yet crop out conspicuously on // the surface of things . The latest enumeration lies before me " 60,000 lives annually ; hundreds of thousands of wretched homes ; the darkened future of millions of children ; 35 per cent. , according to Dr. Willard Parker , of all idiots , 45 per cent . of the insane , 90 per cent. , according to Judge Noah Davis , of all paupers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not whether these estimates are entirely correct . It matters not whether the money expended directly in the purchase of intoxicating drinks by this nation is a little less or a little more than *900,000,000 annually . These statements will bear large reduction , and the motives to action remain unaltered . The desire for human happiness , the labor for collective progress , the willingness to do and to suffer for righteousness , gather with overwhelming force in this one effort to defeat the avarice and appetite that are setting at naught the general welfare . Nor are there any new purposes or strange methods called for in working out this social problem by the collective power of the state . The interests involved are those most pertinent to law . Thousands of households , tens of thousands of women and children-those who in their weakness most of all appeal to civil law for protection-call with the pressing entreaty of utter want for the shelter the state is failing to provide them . These helpless ones are left to the most bitter and irremediable wrongs that human nature suffers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , in giving the conditions of safety to those , from the nature of the case , so utterly dependent ? Crime , pauperism , burdensome taxation , the waste of physical powers and the overthrow of moral ones , are all wrapped up in the meshes of this traffic in intoxicating drinks ? Can we not cut asunder , if we will , this net of vice , and let the unobstructed beneficence of Nature have way ? Narrow aims and comprehensive ones , small motives and large ones , alike urge society to protect itself , and to define for itself its own conditions of prosperity . The fact that this problem involves the most profound moral issues ought not to embarrass us in invoking the aid of the law in doing those things for which law is instituted . It is said that moral power must lie back of and sustain this movement . Certainly ; but prohibitory law is the most direct and pertinent expression of that moral power . Moral energy can no more exist without law than law without moral energy . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express-we are laboring for this very end  --  the deep , unalterable conviction of the majority of the nation . The sentiment opposed to it will lack ab most wholly moral force . It will be made up of the passions of those deeply immersed in intemperance , of the sentiments of those engaged in this cruel traffic , of the feelings of those who seek their own pleasure with no careful submission of it to the claims of others , and of the convictions of that very small number who reason negligently on the duties to their fellow citizens involved in this problem . The law can not come into being without overwhelming moral energy in its favor , neither can it continue in being without daily adding to the health and vigor of the public mind . There is no new principle involved in the law , no unusual trespass on personal liberty . It is a gross caricature to say that Prohibition seeks to regulate what a man shall eat and drink , and to control actions which lie within the range of his personal wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the industrious against the waste of the dissipated ; the innocent against the crimes of the guilty ; the home against the merciless hands that destroy it ; and generations unborn from the inheritan&amp;e of weakness , poverty and vice which is ready to overwhelm them . If in attaining this urgent object of civil society , the pleasure-seeker is deprived of a portion of his liberty , we can only say that it is a regretable incident of not much moment in a great and progressive movement . If a man builds a house in a city , he must build , not according to his own fancy , but in a method consistent with the security of other houses . If he drives a horse in crowded streets , he must drive so as to consult the safety of those about him . In managing his own household , he must be held subject to the direction of the board of health . Not to pass and enforce prohibitory laws when they are called for would be to disregard the fundamental principle on which civil government rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of any one man . To regard prohibitory law as a wanton invasion of individual liberty is , if we estimate aright the losses-searching , comprehensive , and inevitable-of intemperance , and the gains of indulgence-trifling , willful , and personal-anarchical , as much so as any opinion well can be . If a man will not yield the waywardness of a dangerous appetite for the public weal , what will he concede ? If // the public  --  the public that conscripts its citizens for purposes of war-cannot defend its safety , and provide for its progress at such a point as this , what , pray , can it do ? It never lays a restriction on its citizens without some limitation of this so-called liberty , this illusion of an untempered spirit . But the wisdom of this policy of prohibition must turn on one thing farther , the possibilty of success . We are to remember that we are not speaking of the possibilities of prohibition in a community , the majority of which are opposed to it , but of those possibilities when the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , we have to consider , not the labor of securing the law , but the efficiency of the law when it is obtained . The difficulty of enforcing this form of law arises from two things a strong appetite on the one side , and a favorable opportunity to make money on the other . We can not exterminate the appetite except by slow degrees . We can almost at once remove the money motive to pander to it . The appetite does not furnish the means of gratification , except as it appeals to avarice . Let the state and general government unite in an effort to exterminate the traffic , and the traffic would yield rapidly to the pressure . The manufacture , to meet the demand , must be on a large scale , and can not hide its operations . Transactions of this kind that are concealed are relatively insignificant . Capital , timid , conservative , loving respectability , at every step dependent on law , will not in any large amounts engage in illicit production . The inducements to such production , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been very great . But the moment the nation resolved to control the business , the effort was thoroughly successful . This is a conflict whose danger lies in timidity . Once overcome fear , and open the attack , and the enemy is easily scattered . Nothing is more weak than debased appetite ; nothing is more fearful of assault than outlawed capital . It is said that these laws are incapable of enforcement in large cities . If large cities were not rapidly running to economic waste , social anarchy , and lawless corruption , we might attach more weight to this assertion . The growing evils of our cities are most directly associated with this traffic . If it is more difficult to suppress the trade in these communities , it is in the same // degree more needful . If the city is to be redeemed at all , if its anti-social and anti-republican tendencies are not to go on to complete themselves in overthrow , the most direct and ready step toward that redemption is the repression of the saloon . Dry up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite will no more create beer and whiskey than thirst furnishes water , or than hunger supplies food . The weakness in our way is almost wholly a moral one , and does not make against the wisdom of the policy of prohibition . That policy grounds itself in renewed moral strength , and for that very reason is a wise policy . It certainly is not wise to set up one social standard in the city and another in the country ; to let vice and anarchy rule in squatter sovereignty wherever they can win a foot of territory . Let us stand by the nation in its legitimate purposes , in its conjoint strength . National life is the comprehensive condition of all life . Prohibition has already shown its nationalizing power by the enthusiasm with which it is gathering all sections and all classes into one patriotic effort . JOHIN* BAscoM . POLIcY is defined by Webster as " that system of measures which the sovereign of a country adopts and pursues , as the best adapted to the interests of the nation . " Here , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This is a government of the people , by the people and for the people . " Hence the question of prohibition addresses itself to the interests of the ruling power in our state and nation . Is it for the interests of the people that all public crimes shall be suppressed ? To ask the question is to answer it ; for every crime is opposed to the best interests of the people , and is a direct injury inflicted on them . Civil liberty brings protection to the people , by prohibiting all acts and practices injurious to them . Prohibition of crime is civil liberty . License of crime is despotism in its worst form . When we permit any crime to rise and rule in this Republic , we enthrone a traitor for the sure and swift destruction of free government . Prohibition is wise because it is the only form of legislation adapted to the suppression of crimes . That the manufacture , // sale , and supply of alcoholic poison , in its many beverage forms , is a moral crime , few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clonded by personal participation in the evil , under the light of our advanced civilization . That it is a source of vast injury to the people , even its authors admit , and all its countless victims attest , by their own revelations of human depravity , wretchedness and woe , too terrible to paint or tell . Since the beginning of the present century the alcohol crime has taken the lives of more of more than four millions of our people ; has destroyed more than forty thousand millions of dollars of the fruits of national industry ; and has multiplied vice , crime , insanity , poverty , ignorance , disease , degradation and misery , in all forms and places , beyond all power of computation . Science fails in the awful inquest , and official statistics seem incredible . The records of courts and the reports of jails and prisons , with one voice , have , through all the investigations of this century , proclaimed it as the prolific parent of more than four-fifths of all the crimes that have cursed society ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can we impeach this universal testimony ? Can we doubt this judgment of all experience and history in our own and other nations ? This being the nature of the evil , so proved and confessed as the most colossal , cruel and destructive of all crimes , the law applied must be adapted to that nature , or it will only serve to augment its malign power , by the impotence of the aggression . Every triumph of wrong adds to its force for evil . The legislator who would propose the forms of limited permission , license , tax*tion , local option , personal restriction , or other kind of regulation for the pronounced public crimes , or any of them , from murder down to petit larceny , would be met with universal derision . Why ? Because public intelligence everywhere sees and teaches that there is but one form of law adapted to a crime , and that is total , unconditional prohibition . If the offspring of the alcohol crime can only be suppressed by prohibition , how can the mighty parent crime be subdued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is morally right . If total abstinence as a moral and social principle is the right , and the only right ground of the temperance reform , as now universally affirmed by the friends of that reform , then total prohibition as // a legislative principle is not only right , but is a high and commanding duty . Total abstinence and prohibition , the one a voluntary and the other a coercive remedy for the evils of the alcohol traffic , are both founded on the broad reason and admitted fact , that those evils are the inherent and vital elements , as well as the inevitable results of that traffic ; and hence , the only effective remedy is not reform , but annihilation , of the common and corrupt cause of them all . Temperance societies are now all radical . ThJ3y strike at the root of the manufacture , traffic and use of alcoholic beverages . The only associations which in this day pretend to advocate the principle of moderate drinking as a preventive of intemperance , are the leagues and conventions of liquor dealers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its terrible absurdity . On the same plane of truth , legislation against all kinds of vice , immorality and crime must be radical , or it is not only useless , but it is false and fearfully mischievous . The alcohol traffic is either right or wrong . If right , it should be free , for in this land of freedom there should be no chains imposed on art , labor or commerce outside of prison walls . If it is an organic wrong , that wrongs the people , it should die , and all laws that pretend to regulate , to sanctify and to save it are treason against God and the nation . This is a high question of truth and right which can be solved by no compromise . Policy may divide a principle with the devil or a demagogue , but not with God , not with the conscience of an honest man . Prohibition is wise , because it is the highest practice of wis* dom for government , as well as men , to do right , and it is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law fundamental and functional to all civil government , every act of the people under its administration , not prohibited by it , is sanctioned , either by its express or implied license . Its silence gives license by permission . The eminent Ohio jurist , Judge Ranney , rendering the decision of the Supreme Court in Railroad Co. vs . Keary ( 3 0 . S. Rep. , 205 ) , said : " Whatever is not prohibited may be lawfully done . " Having the power to suppress the alcohol crime , government assumes the responsibility of its existence , and every voter , as an integral part of the government , bears his part of the guilty // burden . As Fox said in the British Parliament of the slave trade : " Government must either abolish it , or plead guilty of all the wickedness which has been shown to attend it . It could not be regulated , because there could be no regulation of robbery and murder . " Thus to license , regulate , tax , or in silence to permit the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people in its perpetuation , as the aiders and abettors of its wrongs and authors of its miseries . When the law-making power refuses to prohibit a wrong business , it bestows on it the same silent license that it does on the honest industry of the farmer and mechanic . It clothes that wrong with its most powerful sanction and exalts it to an eminence with the most honored and esteemed of the arts , trades , and avocations . It is by force of the implied more than the express sanctions of government that the alcohol crime has built up its causeway of human guilt and wretchedness over the broad highway of religion and laws . Prohibition is a wise policy because it is the only successful one ever pursued by civilized governments for the suppression of crimes . Whether in a military despotism or in a free republic , prohibition always prohibits the criminal customs of society when backed by rulers ready and willing to enforce it . None are more prompt than the criminals themselves to recognize the fact when they see that the government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom in many civilized countries , and it yet lingers in some of them , where the laws respecting it are weak and not respected by the rulers themselves . When this custom had become alarmingly prevalent in the Swedish army , the King resolved to put an end to it . Hearing that two of his officers were about to engage in a duel , he ordered that it should be fought in his presence . The parties at first felt greatly pleased at the compliment , but on arriving at the place they were surprised and dismayed to find not only the King with his principal officers there , but a gibbet standing . On inquiring the meaning of the latter , they were informed that it was to hang them both on when the duel was over , the victor by the neck and the vanquished by the heels . They were not slow in discovering that there had been a mutual misunderstanding between them , which was satisfactorily explained . They shook hands , and that was the end of dueling in the Swedish // army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States by laws which classed it with murder . In Ohio , the constitution forever disqualifies from office every person who fights a duel , sends , accepts , or knowingly carries a challenge for it ; and the Legislature added the penalty of imprisonment up to ten years in the penitentiary for either of these acts . So of lotteries , yet licensed , taxed and regulated *A too many Christian states and nations . The Ohio constitution prohibits , and the law punishes with heavy fines and imprisonment all who prepare , publish , or in any way promote lotteries and schemes of chance . Nobody doubts that prohibition prohibits dueling and lotteries in Ohio . Thus it will soon be with the alcohol crime . Like the enchanted bottle of the Arabian tale , when sealed up with the seal of Solomon and cast into the sea , its power is destroyed ; but if recovered and unsealed , though under the most rigid guard , the pestilential mist will , in a moment , go out of it and tower as a malignant giant in the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true philosophy of law against crime . That seal of Solomon the wise is the wise policy of Prohibition . G. F. STEWART . THE question submitted to me is this : " Is Prohibition a wise policy ? " I assume that this refers to the enactments of laws by Congress and the legislatures of the several States prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages , and shall so answer . Behind that question , which is specific , lies the more general question , whether the State acts wisely in prohibiting , for any reason , the manufacture and sale of anything by which a citizen can make money . That question does not require long discussion . The right to do such a thing has always been assumed , and has lately been settled by the law courts of this country . The wisdom of the special prohibition has always been supposed to depend upon the nature of the article prohibited , and its effect on the general welfare . It might surprise some people to learn what a long catalogue of prohibited things stands on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deprived of life or liberty or property without due process of law , has long been // in the constitution of nearly every State in the Union , and was there when the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States was adopted , making that principle a part of the supreme organic law of the land . But never , in the language of the Supreme Court ( October Term , 1887 ) , " has it been regarded as incompatible with the principle , equally vital because essential to the peace and safety of society , that all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner 's use of it shall not be injurious to the community . " In the same case the court held that a State may even prohibit the sale of a dangerous commodity , though patented by the General Government . It illustrates this principle by a case . The State of Kentucky enacted a statute in 1874 , imposing a penalty on any one offering for sale or selling any oils or fluids that would burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens having sold within the commonwealth a certain oil for which letters patent had been issued in 1867 , but which did not come up to the standard of the statute , was indicted therefor . He disputed the State 's authority to prevent or obstruct the exercise of the right which he claimed under the patent , but the courts upheld the State . In the same opinion the Supreme Court cites another case decided after the adoption of the fourteenth amendment . The village of Hyde Park , Ill. , in the same county with Chicago , under legislative authority passed an ordinance forbidding the transportation through the village of any offensive and unwholesome matter . A fertilizing company located its works in that particular part of the county . This was done at great expense and under the authority of its charter . In addition the charter of the village provided that it should not interfere with the transportation of animal matter from Chicago or from manufacturing it into a fertilizer . The enforcement of the village ordinance would destroy the business and seriously impair the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance the court maintained the authority of the village ordinance . These cases show the lawfulness of prohibition , but still leave the question of the wisdom open . To settle that we are to consider the character of the thing prohibited and the probable effects of prohibition . By the rum traffic let us understand the making and selling of intoxicant beverages . In itself that , or any other // business , may be lawful to-day and criminal to-morrow . The State can not part with its discretion " any more than with the power itself , " says the Supreme Court . To-morrow it may declare any business criminal , and from the moment of the passage of the act that business becomes criminal . The aim of Prohibitionists is to render the manufacture and sale of intoxicant beverages criminal . There seems no other way of abating this nuisance . Any mode of licensing or taxing keeps the business lawful . The keeper of the worst groggery in New York , who sells under license , is pursuing as lawful a business as the editor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this city I was present when a clergyman was confronted by a lawyer with the statement that his client was engaged in a business as lawful as the clergyman 's . And the lawyer told the truth . Now , is it wise to make the rum traffic criminal ? It will be granted that it is always wise to do that which will greatly advance the welfare of the community , or greatly relieve it of any nuisance , to help us in settling the question of prohibiting its continuance . Let us inquire what would be the effect if the rum traffic were abolished . In the first place , there are six hundred millions of dollars at least gathered in by the liquor dealers in the United States for intoxicant beverages . Much of this goes out of the country , but probably the larger portion remains . If it all remained the country would be financially no poorer . There would be a readjustment of possession without diminution of bulk . We spend five hundred millions for breadstuffs . If the drink produced the good effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let us compare the two . If not a single drop of the beverage had been taken last year the whole community would be at least as well off but if not a crumb of bread had been eaten probably the whole community would have perished . If any had survived they w6uld scarcely have been able to discharge the ordinary duties of life . That is the very mildest way of putting it ; we all know how much stronger the case is . The result of the spending of those six hundred millions of dollars was the causing of the death of more people than all other causes combined . The country lost a host of men who might be working in mines and factories , who might be engaged in a thousand productive arts . Each dollar spent // in intoxicant beverages represents a dollar lost from the wealth of the country , in the sense that the dollar failed to be added to the general wealth . And every one knows that that is a very small part of the pecuniary loss . There were seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who " lost " whole months of time by the inability and the diminution of ability wrought in them by the drink . If each lost six days only in the whole year , it would aggregate the loss of the labor of a thousand men for thirteen years . The question of the tariff is insignificant when compared with the question of the rum traffic , if this question be regarded only in a financial light . This appears more clearly if we take into account the army of about 400,000 men who are engaged in the manufacture , transportation , and sale of intoxicants . These are grown , able bodied men . They are removed from all the profitable pursuits of human beings . They are engaged in a business which adds nothing to the bodily , intellectual , or spiritual , advancement of a single human being . The world would have been no worse , the country no poorer , if every man of them had been buried on the first of January of the preceding year . Is there any other business in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would not have added , at least , one dollar to the general wealth of the country ? But that great body of workers did not enhance the property of the country by the amount of one solitary dime ! Their business was such that they could not . It is a wicked business , even where it is lawful . This is shown by the fact that none but the lower class of men can engage in it . Search the grogshops of New York , and see if you will find a single respectable Israelite engaged as a saloonist . His religion would forbid . Is there a Protestant church in the city that would permit a grogseller to remain in its membership ? Would public opinion outside the church tolerate such a communion ? Is that a proper business to be allowed to exist , a business in which no Mohammedan , Jew , or Christian can engage in without violating the sanctions of his religion ? To say nothing of the thirty-three millions of dollars worth of grain destroyed as food-thus enhancing the cost of breadstuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers ; it is estimated that the rum traffic throws upon the community the expenditure of over one hundred and // ninely millions of dollars annually for the following items : medical attendance and medicines used in sickness caused by drink ; loss to employers , by drunken workmen ; support of the insane , the paupers and the criminals made by the traffic ; the loss of the labor of the paupers , and the cost of judicial proceedings , all caused by drink . If all this were brought about by unorganized traffic it would be the most frightful nuisance known to mankind since the world began ; but in this country the liquor dealers organize to resist the laws , and to aid , abet and sustain one another therein . They go beyond that and attempt to control legislation , in which they generally succeed ; and to control political conventions , in which they have always succeeded until the Prohibition party held a convention . Is anything better known than that we have in New York only such civil officers as the rum traffic allows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican convention in twenty-five years without consulting the liquor dealers ? When a question exceeds in its financial importance all other questions before the people , all tariff , civil reforms and other questions , involving more interests of every kind to more citizens than all other political questions that have ever been agitated , and the most elaborate consideration is given to the smaller questions by two such great bodies as met in the conventions this year in St. Louis and Chicago , what does it mean ? The conventions were afraid of the liquor dealers ; that 's the only possible explanation . In the latter convention good men , such as Mr. Albert Griffin , wanted an anti-saloon plank put in the platform . Tens of thousands of Republicans desired it ; but it was known that if that plank were omitted , those good men would remain in the party , but the committee were given to understand distinctly that if anything of the kind were inserted , the liquor dealers would desert and carry off their followers ; and the committee and the convention succumbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be carried on only by men whose moral character is at least so low that they can not be expected to obey the law ; a business which injures the country more than the most stringent prohibition of imports , or the most unrestricted free trade could ; a business which produces more distress , destroys more property , happiness , and life , than all other things known ; a business which injures the country // every year more than our civil war did in four years ; a business that produces four-fifths of all the robberies , thefts , murders , and other crimes in the laud ; a business which does the nation and the world more harm than war , famine , and pestilence combined ; a business which stands against all material , intellectual and spiritual progress . I am asked whether the policy of making that business criminal is wise ? Most assuredly , yes . If that be not true , where is the wisdom of prohibiting anything ? CHARLES F.
