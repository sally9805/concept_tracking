txt The meeting at Lower BrultS Agency has come to an end , and while its general conclusion appears to te adverse to the present plan of ceding half the Sioux Reservation . it has vet had . some good.results . It has changed the temper of a portion of the Indians from that of irritation and ailspicion to good-natured consideration , and transferred their objections from the vague domain of race grievances to the practical one of dollars and cents . So long as they dwelt on the past wrongs done to the red men , and on the alleged failure of the Government to execute its portion of previous compacts , they made the discussion one of sentiment , and . failed to indicate a more satisfactory plan . This was a difficulty in the preceding conferences at Standing Rock . which led to some rather sharp retorts from the commission . When provision was made for a general talk at Lower Brul6 of representatives from all the agencies , some of the chiefs concluded to formulate a definite statement of their objections to the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a conviction that if the Government should make some changes in its bill it would be accepted . A good number , however , of the most intelligent and progressive chiefs declared for the bill as it stands . It is true that some of these appear to have gone to the conference against the wishes of many of their people , and some are members of the Indian police , who would naturally be disposed to stand by the Government . Still , the Government has a hold of some sort at nearly every agency . Some of the chiefs declared that they did not wish to sell any of their land , but - to keep it all for their children . This , in some cases , doubtless meant that they personally could do better with tribal lands than with severalty allotments , while in others it was perhaps a basis for driving a more favorable bargain . The argument " what has posterity ever done for us ? " is probably quite as effective with the red man as with the white , and the Indians no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they to take care of themselves . A second objection was that the Flandreau Indians were allowed to take allotments on the reservation after having already sold their own lands ; but that is a detail easy to adjast . A third objection was that the Indians had not been allowed to go to Washington and consult in the making of the law , although they had . raised money to pay for their delegates , and now they are asked to vote yes or no on it without opportunity of amendment . Hence , selected chiefs are now to be allowed to go to Washington . Still another objection was that the school provisions in the old treaty , which were about to expire according to the Government 's reckoning , really last longer , and hence the argument that they must . sell more land for a continuance of these privileges falls to the ground . The Indians say that the Government did not start the schools at the time appointed , and the rejoinder is that the Indians at first - refused to let their children come ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegation is that the Indians are not yet ready to take lands in severalty . The Government argues that they provided for such an allotment even under the treaty of 1868 . Still , as hearty consent is desirable , this objection might prove a fatal obstacle to the plan . It would be possible to open the reservation without the severalty provision , but it would-be a great mistake to lose the present opportunity for accomplishing this result . One objection which shows the business shrewdness of the Indians is that as a large part of the land to be ceded is unfit for farming , that portion could not be sold by the Government , at least for a long time , and hence the payments to be made to the Indians for it would be correspondingly delayed . The plan they suggest is that the Government , instead of making payments on the 11,000 , - 000 acres to be ceded as fast as it sells the land to settlers , should buy it all outright at 50 cents an acre , paying $5,500,000 for it . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like other Government farm lands , while some would be worth nothing . Instead of paying out the price in cattle , tools , schools , and so on , it should be put in money , invested in bonds , and the interest paid regularly . These points the Sioux chiefs will discuss on their approaching visit to Washington .
