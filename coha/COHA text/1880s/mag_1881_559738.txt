CARELESS writers constantly tell us that church and state in America are wholly parted , or , as the favorite phrase is , " absolutely divorced . " Because they say this so often , careless people are surprised in proportion , when they find that in truth their operations are very closely intertwined , as from the nature of things they must be , in any country where there is religion and is also civil order . What is true is that , with the distinctness which belongs to the American written constitutions , quite accurate statements have been made , in general , as to the functions which shall be performed by persons technically called officers of the church , and equally accurate statements as to the functions of the persons who administer what are called civil offices . It happens that a good many functions , such as those of public charity and of education , which , in Roman Catholic countries , are generally in the hands of ecclesiastics , have here been transferred , and belong to the civil service . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are discharged by men named by the church , are discharged here by men named by the state . People are more confused than helped by the European analogies in the study of our politics . In this matter , it is generally true in Europe that the affairs of the church are ruled by one set of men , and the affairs of the state by another . So far as this is true , there is at bottom a severance between church and state . This severance may be concealed on the surface when ecclesiastics undertake civil duties , or when civilians meddle with church administration . All the same there exists the fundamental separation . But in America , outside the Roman Catholic church , which is but a foreign intruder , and seems to wish to remain so , the same universal suffrage controls the state and the church . The same man who votes in a town meeting or // at a county election Monday , votes on Tuesday in a parish meeting , if he so choose . In any village or in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church who direct those of the state ; the same people vote taxes for each , and the same people pay them . Alexander Everett called attention to this fundamental identity of the constituency of church and state , in his instructive book on America , sixty years ago . In that identity is the explanation of the ease with which a double system moves forward , of whose varied checks and balances it would be difficult to give account were there not , at bottom , this substantial identity of the persons carrying on both parts of the system . From this double system , carried forward now in a church meeting , now in a town meeting ; now by ecelesiastics , now by civilians , it sometimes happens that one branch tries an experiment , which , when successful , is taken in hand by the otherali parties assenting . Thus the establishment of evening schools in the city of Boston is due historically wholly to church agency . The first was established by the Warren-street Chapel ; the system was taken up by the associated churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried on the school afterward asked and obtained help from the city treasury , and eventually the school committee of the city took the whole oversight and expense . That is , a movement begun by officers of the church , so called , was adopted and carried on by officers of the state , so calied . In fact , of course , the distribution of the expense is somewhat different when , as in the one case , it falls on the public spirit of the citizens , and when , as in the other case , it is paid by the city tax-payers . But , where the benefit is generaliy acknowledged , this change is generaliy assented to . The history of the primary instruction in Boston is a larger and earlier illustration of a similar transfer . From the same identity of the constituency in both church and state , there frequently springs up in the oversight of public charities a dual supervision , which would be otherwise inconvenient or impossible , but which , with us , is more and more considered to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which prisons and hospitals are subject to regular visitation by the committees of what is called a private charitable association , is such an arrangement of double oversight . The truth is , that the Public Charities ' Society is just as much a public institution as the State Senate is . But because // it is chosen by different agencies , the public has the security of a double oversight , and gains stereoscopic distinctness in its examination of the institutions of correction and of relief . General Grant wisely attempted something of the same kind , when he gave to the great missionary associations the appointment of the Indian agents . The agents were to work , all the same , under the direction of a civil bureau . He thus secured the double oversight of an ecclesiastical and a civil body . And he obtained what the Japanese attempted and did not obtain when they sent two officers for the discharge of one duty . Among these double arrangements by which the people , the sovereign of this country , has assigned to the officers of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the exemption of church property , when used for purposes of worship , from secular taxation . Palpable inconveniences in administration have challenged attention to this particular double arrangement , and it is often carelessly said that it is without any analogy in our system . That is not true . Our system is , in ali regards , a practical system , in which the sovereign advances his purposes in the shortest way , quite indifferent to its theory . It is true that since the publication , by Mr. Josiah P. Quincy , of some simple and vigorous papers on the subject , beginning now nearly ten years ago , the inconveniences of our double system have attracted very general observation . In some states the taxation of church property has been established . In all it has been suggested . It is probable that a practical solution may be found , which will exempt those churches which perform a definite public duty , while those churches are taxed which prefer to act as private corporations . It is the object of this article to show the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly the policy of a republic to encourage men to surrender their private property to the general or public service . This has been from the beginning a principle with us , which has expressed itself in statutes . And the state must not look a gift-horse in the mouth . If a man give a statue to the public , the public must not say it would rather have a registered bond for the amount which the statue would cost . It takes the statue . It ought not even to complain of his choice of an artist . Q It accepts the statue . People who do not like it need not look on it . When accepted , of course the public does not tax it . This analogy holds through the whole system of the diversion of prop . // erty from being private property to use for , or by , the public . The state , because it represents the public , encourages , and ought to encourage , such diversion . It does not ask whether the diversion is such as its best wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ceased to be private property , and whether , in good faith , it is administered for the public . It may be that the public does not receive the advantages with absolute freedom . Thus a man may endow a college , for the public good , and any student in that college may have to pay for a part of his education . Still * , in good faith , there have been a surrender of private property for the benefit of all , the state would and should recognize this as a public use . Such is the general policy , and , as we believe , it is the sound policy of ali our administrations . But , of course , a question wil constantly arise ,  --  whether it be for the public good that private property has been surrendered . When a thousand gentlemen associate and build a clubhouse ,  --  that they may have a common library and reading-room , - no one thinks that is a public purpose . When a rich landowner connects himself , in a private corporation , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of land , and opens a school upon it for pupils who pay all the charges of instruction ,  --  when he comes to the tax-assessors and says all this is a public institution of education , these assessors are very apt to grumble . They suspect that after twenty years - after that piece of land has become much more valuable-the school will fail , and the land be cut up for house-lots . And , in general , with regard to institutions of benevolence , the question always comes up  --  and should come up-whether the benevolence intended be that general benevolence which takes in all mankind , or whether it be a mere private benevolence , which cares only for the persons who themselves unite . Thus , the general benevolence of the Christian Church is one thing ; the benevolence of a mutual insurance company , or of a lodge of Free Masons or of Odd Fellows is quite another thing , however admirable in its way . There arose , therefore , centuries ago , in the very birth of the Roman law , the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charities . Public charities are open to all mankind who may be in need of their relief . Private charities are open only to certain subdivisions of mankind , indicated by their statutes or system . Of course it will not be easy , in every case , to // say whether a given enterprise of benevolence is a public charity or a private charity ; but , easy or not , the decision has to be made . And the whole question before onr legislatures to-day , regarding the taxation of churches in America , is an effort to decide whether they be public or private charities . Up to a recent time , as we have said , they were universally regarded as public charities . On the ground that they are public charities , they have been generally exempted from taxation . They and their ministers have been favored with other privileges , great and small , because of the recognized public service which they rendercd . So long as the public felt that , at every point , the church and its officers were engaged in distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to facilitate it . It is not what many people call a superstitious reverence for the clergy which makes a * at the West pass a clergyman free , if he ask for the privilege of a free passage . It springs from the sense of that community that , on the whole , the clergyman is engaged in public service . For if he do not preach in one place he preaches in another . Wherever people will come together to learn , he is willing to teach . It is not that the turnpike company establishes a debtor and creditor account with the church and the clergy , and calculates that the corporation has gained so much by church-bred honesty that it can and ought to remit so much in compensation . It is that , in that community , there is a general impression that church and clergy are in the public service , and that the public service must be helped forward by a corporation which exists only by the public permission . There are many parts of the country where this position of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old " First Congregational Church** of a country town in Massachusetts or Connecticut is still accounted , by old-fashioned people , as the minister or servant of the whole town , not simply of one congregation . If he is wise , he accounts himself so . The younger Leonard Bacon has published more than one spirited sermon , or other article , to show his brother ministers in his own communion that they must not abate one jot of this privilege of a New England minister . In almost any such town , the minister of this church would be asked to serve on the school committee , and he ought to have good reason to show if he decline . Till very recent times this " First Church " would feel bound to provide sufficient and comfortable seats for ali in the town who // wished to meet in the " meeting-house " for the Sunday services , without asking the ungracious question how far they contributed to the joint expunses , or , as the quaint Yankecism puts it , " whether they steal their preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a town-it goes " without saying " - that the minister of the First Church attends every funeral , of every stranger , or other persons without family , or of any person who dies " whose family are not connected with any religious organization , ** as the church records say . The church accounted itself , till within the memory of the present generation , not simply responsible for the morals or religion of certain persons who met to worship within its walis , but responsible for the highest well-being of the whole community-its education , its mauners , its morals* and its religion ; - we have a right to say , for its health , moral and physicaL But , all the same , it is certain that this condition of things will seem to some readers prehistoric . We could wish that it did not seem primitive and impossible to some ministers . In fact , however , we believe that faithful ministers cling to this position , and like to account themselves " servants unto all . " Still , the public begins to doubt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations called churches are . The disposition to refuse exemption from tax to churches springs from this doubt . We believe that the churches are themselves responsible for the growing change in the matter . When they begin to regard themselves as private charities , the public wil regard them so before the generation has passed by . And any change which the last generation has seen in the simple readiness with which , by one concession or another , the public acknowledged this service , has come from the gradual failure of churches to render general or public service . When it happens that a clergyman , asked to bury a poor actor , answers that it is none of his business , because the man does not belong to his parish ; when he says he believes there is a " little church around the corner " where they do such things , but that , really , he can not , nor his church ,  --  that remark of his indicates a new period , when churches are beginning to consider themselves private charities , and not public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the great Roman Catholic Church , in entire falsity to the idea of catholicity , has , in this country , dropped wholly into this narrow habit , which considers churches as clubs , instituted for the benefit of their // members . Thousands of Protestant clergymen have spent and been spent in the physical relief of poor persons belonging to the Roman communion . But who can name ten instances in America , where the Roman Catholic priest , in any neighborhood , has lifted a finger for a Protestant beggar ? This church worships in a foreign language , maintains a foreign clergy , and-by an almost affected isolation-stands apart from the school system , the lyceum system , the public hospitals , and all general charities of America . They must be Roman Catholic institutions , or this church will have none of them . Again : there has grown up a habit , in our large towns , of building up what in England would be distinctly called " private chapels , " where an attached , well-educated , and well-to-do parish engages the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve it . This habit runs in just this same direction . Men do not say it in words ,  --  nay , they do not think it systematically ,  - -  but in practice the thing amounts to this-that that chapel is their private religious club-house , and the minister is the consecrated steward of the club . True , he wishes to do work outside of it . He is always trying to make the mass of men understand that it is Christ 's church , and free as air to all comers . But it is not fi*ee as the air to all comers . It is built at the cost of certain persons , who own it . They have a right to enter it , above the right of those whom they invite to enter it . It is their property . I may ask all the world to enter my house . I may be as cordial as daylight to every one who comes . Still , every one who comes knows it is my house , and respects my property in it . Just that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordially invited , to the persons who have built a chapel , or church , or meeting-house , and at whose charge religious service is maintained in it . What happens at such a church every Sunday ? A. body of accustomed worshipers , taught by experience to attend promptly , do attend promptly , and take the seats to which they have attained a right . Perhaps they literally own these pews , nor is there anything wrong in their owniug them . A floating congregation of other persons , attracted by the earnestness of the preacher or the dignity of the ritual , attend as visitors . They are visitors . They call themselves visitors , and they are so called by their hosts . The most spirited efforts are made , very probably , to accommodate them with seats , and the service begins . // But all the world sees and knows that this is not the same thing which ali the world saw and knew fifty years ago . When the town built the meeting-house from its own treasury , and provided that the house should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town who chose to come , the condition was wholly different from what it is in such a private chapel as we have described . The public notes the difference ; and , in a form which challenges general attention , the public is reminded that such churches are no longer " public charities , " but that they have become " private charities . " It must be remembered that these churches , precisely because they are large , successful , and because the utterance from their pulpit goes far and wide , arrest much more of the public attention , and stimulate discussion on this subject we have in hand much more , than do the more primitive established congregations , which have survived from older generations , and , so far as they can , are pursuing the older way . But a hundred readers , even before they have come thus far , interrupt us by exclaiming that ali such iliustrations are exceptional , or do not describe the whole . In the churches they know best , the charity committees are on the alert to spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to those who are lost ; he is even too confident that the sheep who are folded do not need him . He does not put a fair amount of work on his Sunday duty , they say ; he is spending and spent on the schools , or on the drainage , or on the public library of the village . He gives himself up , and the officers of the church give themselves up , to the public duties to which Jesus Christ commissioned them . He came to save men from their sins , and that is what these churches are eager to do . He came to seek and save that which is lost , and that is what these ministers are working for . Such a protest , admirably well put , gives the force to Dr. Pitzer 's careful article , which appeared in this REVIEW a year ago . We are eager to admit all the fair force of such protests , and so , as we believe , is the public . But we call attention to the subject again ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  to suggest that such protests must not be left to rhetoric , to pulpit appeal , or to merely literary expression . Let us have them in statistics ; and the public-which , as we have said , is at bottom the constituency of the church-will accept them as readily as any synod of ecciesiastics. // What the public will not accept , and ought not to accept , is the condoning for the selfishness of some churches by the plea of generosity of others . We believe that there is no practical difficulty in arranging the details of a system by which those churches which really do public duty , and are , therefore , public institutions , should be respected as such ; by which , also , those which are virtually private clubs , and indifferent to the public as such , should be regarded as private , and taxed accordingly . We do not think this distinction is sufficiently made in such statutes as that of New Hampshire . That State discriminates between rich churches and poor . It taxes church property where it exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below that sum . There is no principle for the distinction . And , in the long run , such distinctions do not satisfy . In a more equitable distinction , we should tax all churches in form , and should exempt in practice those which proved their right to exemption . Let the test of this right be in the expenses of the charities of a church , outside the families of the organized corporation . What the social science people call " outdoor relief " is precisely the side of charity which most disturbs the public functionaries of the state . It is precisely the side of charitable work on which churches , from their very nature and traditions , can and ought to engage . Let every organized congregation , then , show to the assessing officers every year a precise account of the money it has spent in public charities-as in its poor relief , in its hospitals , or similar public cares . No account can be more easy to prepare and audit . Let every church be credited for this payment , and exempted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And let its exemption go no farther . The analogies for such exemption , in our common-sense legislation , are frequent . Thus , in many of the States , a man who maintains a water-trough where travelers may refresh their horses , is exempted from tax , in a sum determined on . Subdivided and simplified as is our admirable system of local taxation , the details of such a plan would be managed without any appreciable difficulty . The merit of the plan is its justice , which is so clear that every one ought to be satisfied with it . The rich churches , which have built large and costly edifices for their comfort , ought to pay largely in these outdoor charities . In the compar // ative leisure of their congregations they have a force , far more than sufficient , for organizing these charities so that they shall do more good than harm . They will carry to the work of relief the tenderness and intelligence combined , without which there is no relief . " You do a man no good , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him better . " This is just what churches are for . It is just what they claim even divine power to do . And they will have no right to complain , but rather to rejoice , when any dispositions of the public law of the country compel them , as organizations , to attempt such duties , if they have been tempted to leave such duties to the unorganized tenderness of their separate members . But if any church prefer to " enter into its rest , " and so declines organized and systematic effort for the improvement of its neighborhood , let it pay its tax to the community . This is the alternative . Ten years of discussion of this subject in almost every forum in America have failed to show any strong reason why such a tax should not be levied upon all private corporationseven though they be " private charities . " If a church can not prove itself a " public charity , " it must be taxed , as a private library would be taxed , even though it were held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though there be several teachers who unite in it . The church must be judged by its fruits , as the Master said and directed . Among those fruits which the commonwealth has a right to exact and to sit in judgment on , the most important is the higher life of the community in which it lives . Let us see what those theories of God and man are worth , which it teaches ; when they are squarely and distinctly applied , in its own practice , to reclaiming drunkards , to reforming criminals , to preventing pauperism , and , in general , to lifting up what has fallen down . We have no fear as to the unfavorable result of such gentle compulsion by the state , either on church architecture or the cause of missions ; that it may reduce the dignity of ritual or in any way hamper the freedom of our congregations , or that noble growth and strength which is the result of freedom . These things are always added , as they have always been added , to those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has still no better name than His Righteousness . EDWARD E. HALE.
