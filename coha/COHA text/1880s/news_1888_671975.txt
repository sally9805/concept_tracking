txt The proceedings of the Congressional Committee on Immigration have shown that the restrictions of the existing law are not enforced , but they have also shown that these restrictions are insufficient . The law against the importation of ? contract label : is , in some respects , a good measure , though capable of very absurd applications , which might perhaps be rendered impossible by amendment . It is only in the absurd cases that it has been enforced , while it is absolutely ineffective against the kind of immigration it was intended to keep out . Really to enforce the law would require a considerable increase in the inspecting force . Perhaps this increase should be provided , but in general it is idle to trust to any system which involves a detailed investigation of between a quarter and a half million of cases every year . We must trust to general rules and enforce them . It is not practically possible to determine whether an immigrant is an Anarchist or other criminal , nor even whether he is . a pauper , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is that immigration is too cheap and easy , and if we do not mean to have this country made an almshouse and penal colony for the whole planet , it behooves- us to make it more costly and difficult . A tax of $50 on every immigrant would somewhat more than double the cost of a steerage passage from any port in Europe , and would actually exclude the least desirable class of immigrants . Practically it would make the cost of immigration about what it was in the days when the business was done in sailing vessels . Such a regulation , by national enactment , could be readily enforced , its enforcement would put upon the immigrants themselves the burden of maintaining the institutions established for their benefit now defrayed by taxation , and it would restrict immigration in. the direction in which restriction is most needed . A simple rule like this is worth a dozen impracticable statutes attempting to make distinctions among immigrants that can not be enforced .                 @ @ @ @
