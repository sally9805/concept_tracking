// language , at the present moment , who has the effect of making us forget the extinction of the pleasant fashion of the literary portrait , it is certainly the bright particular genius whose name is written at the head of these remarks . Mr. Stevenson fairly challenges portraiture , as we pass him on the highway of literature ( if that be the road , rather than some wandering , sun-checkered by-lane that he may be said to follow ) , just as the possible model , in local attire , challenges the painter who wanders through the streets of a foreign town looking for subjects . He gives us new ground to wonder why the effort to fix a face and figure , to seize a literary character and transfer it to the canvas of the critic , should have fallen into such discredit among us and have given way to the mere multiplication of little private judgment-seats , where the scales and the judicial wig , both of them considerably awry and not rendered more august by the company of a vicious-looking switch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the kindly , disinterested palette and brush . It has become the fashion to be effective at the expense of the sitter , to make some little point , or inflict some little dig , with a heated party air , rather than to catch a talent in the fact , follow its line , and put a finger on its essence ; so that the exquisite art of criticism , smothered in grossness , finds itself turned into a question of " sides . " The critic industriously keeps his score , but it is seldom to be hoped that the author , criminal though he may be , will be apprehended by justice through the handbills given out in the case ; for it is of the essence of a happy description that it shall have been preceded by a happy observation and a free curiosity ; and desuetude , as we say , has overtaken these amiable , uninvidious faculties , which have not the advantage of organs and chairs .

It is sufficient to note , in passing , that if Mr. Stevenson had presented himself in an age or in a country of portraiture , the paintVOL . XXXV. -I i8. ers would certainly each have had a turn at him . The easels and benches would have bristled , the circle would have been close , and quick , from the canvas to the sitter , the rising and falling of heads . It has happened to all of us to have gone into a studio , a studio of pupils , and seen the thick cluster of bent backs and the conscious model in the midst . It has happened to us to be struck , or not to be struck , with the beauty or the symmetry of this personage , and to have made some remark which , whether expressing admiration or disappointment , has elicited from one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has ! " These words may be applied to Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson : in the language of that art which depends most on observation , character - character is what he has . He is essentially a model , in the sense of a sitter ; I do not mean , of course , in the sense of a pattern or a guiding light . And if the figures who have a life in literature may also be divided into two great classes , we may add that he is conspicuously one of the draped ; he would never , if I may be allowed the expression , pose for the nude . There are writers who present themselves before the critic with just the amount of drapery that is necessary for decency. but Mr. Stevenson is not one of these ; he makes his appearance in an amplitude of costume . His costume is part of the character of which I just now spoke ; it never occurs to us to ask how he would look without it . Before all things he is a writer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picturesque garments . It is by the cut and the color of this rich and becoming frippery- I use the term endearingly , as a painter might - that he arrests the eye and solicits the brush . That is , frankly , half the charm he has for us , that he wears a dress and wears it with courage , with a certain cock of the hat and tinkle of the supererogatory sword ; or , in other words , that he is curious of expression , and regards the literary form not simply as a code of signals , but as the keyboard of a piano and as so much plastic material . He has that vice deplored by Mr. Herbert Spencer , a mannera manner for a manner 's sake , it may sometimes doubtless be said . He is as different as possible from the sort of writer who regards words as numbers and a page as the mere addition of them ; much more , to carry out our image , // qwq brave deeds - which is simply Mr. Stevenson , s essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a charming , slightly sophistical ingenuity . " They served their guns merrily , when it came to fighting , and they had the readiest ear for a bold , honorable sentiment of any class of men the world ever produced . " The author goes on to say that most men of high destinies have even highsounding names . Alan Breck , in " Kidnapped , " is a wonderful picture of the union of courage and swagger ; the little Jacobite adventurer , a figure worthy of Scott at his best , and representing the highest point that Mr. Stevenson 's talent has reached , shows us that a marked taste for tawdry finery - tarnished and tattered , some of it , indeed , by ticklish occasions - is quite compatible with a perfectly high mettle . Alan Breck is , at bottom , a study of the love of glory , carried out with extreme psychological truth . When the love of glory is of an inferior order , the reputation is cultivated rather than the opportunity ; but when it is a pure passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Stevenson 's kindness for adventurers extends even to the humblest of all , the mountebank and the strolling player , or even the peddler whom he declares that in his foreign travels he is habitually taken for , as we see in the whimsical apology for vagabonds which winds up " An Inland Voyage . " The hungry conjurer , the gymnast whose maillot is loose , have something of the glamour of the hero , inasmuch as they , too , pay with their person . To be even one of the outskirters of art leaves a fine stamp on a man 's countenance . . . . That is the kind of thing that reconciles me to life ; a ragged , tippling. incompetent old rogue , with the manners of a gentleman and the vanity of an artist , to keep up his self-respect ! What reconciles Mr. Stevenson to life is the idea that in the first place it offers the widest field that we know of for odd doings , and that in the second these odd doings are the best of pegs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pages . As it is not odd , but extremely usual , to marry , he deprecates that course in " Virginibus Puerisque , " the collection of short essays which is most a record of his opinions- that is , largely , of his likes and dislikes . It all comes back to his sympathy with the juvenile , and that feeling about life which leads him to regard women as so many superfluous girls in a boy 's game . They are almost wholly absent from his pages ( the main exception is " Prince Otto , " though there is a Clara apiece in " The Rajah 's Diamond " and " The Pavilion on the Links " ) , for they do n't like ships and pistols and fights ; they encumber the decks and require separate apartments ; and , almost worst of all , have not the highest literary standard .

Why should he go to the altar when he might be polishing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my sense , fascinating inconsistencies that we encounter in Mr. Stevenson 's mind that , though he takes such an interest in the childish life , he takes no interest in the fireside . He has an indulgent glance for it in the verses of the " Garden , " but to his view the normal child is the child who absents himself from the family-circle , in fact when he can , in imagination when he can not , in the disguise of abuccaneer . Girls do n't do this , and women are only grown-up girls , unless it be the delightful maiden , fit daughter of an imperial race , whom he commemorates in " An Inland Voyage . " A girl at school in France began to describe one of our regiments on parade to her French schoolmates ; and as she went on , she told me the recollection grew so vivid , she became so proud to be the countrywoman of such soldiers , and so sorry to be in another country , that her voice failed her , and she burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she very nearly deserves a statue . To cnll her a young lady , with all its niminy associations , would be to offer her an insult . She may rest assured of one thing , although she never should marry a heroic general , never see any great or immediate result of her life , she will not have lived in vain for her native land . There is something of that in Mr. Stevenson . When he begins to describe a British regiment on parade ( or something of that sort ) he , too , almost breaks down for emotion , which is why I have been careful to traverse the insinuation that he is primarily a chiseler of prose . If things had gone differently with him ( I must permit myself this allusion to his personal situation , and I shall venture to follow it with two or three others ) , he might have been an historian of famous campaigns - a great painter of battle-pieces . Of course , however , in this capacity it would not have done for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a field of battle , and not a bed of roses , " he points out repeatedly that it is a terrible renunciation , and somehow , in strictness , incompatible even with honor - the sort of roving , trumpeting honor that appeals most to his sympathy . After that step there are no more by-path meadows where you may innocently linger , but the road lies long and straight and dusty to the grave . . . . You may t ) *ink you had a conscience and believed in God ; but what is a conscience to a wife ? To marry is to domesticate the Recording Angel .

It is better to face the fact and know , when you marry , that you take into your life a creature of equal if unlike frailties ; whose weak human heart beats no more tunefully than yours . If there is a grimness in that , it is as near as Mr. Stevenson ever comes to being grim , and we have only to turn the page to find the corrective - something delicately genial , at least , if not very much less sad : " The blind bow-boy " who smiles upon us from the end of terraces in old Dutch gardens laughingly hails his bird-bolts among a fleeting generation . But for as fast as ever he shoots , the game dissolves and disappears into eternity from under his falling arrows ; this one is gone ere he is struck ; the other has but time to make one gesture and give one passionate cry ; and they are all the things of a moment . That is an admission that though it is soon over , the great sentimental surrender is inevitable . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to quite another matter ) , geniality , at least , for the profession of letters , in the declaration that there is one thing you can never make Philistine natures understand ; one thing which yet lies on the surface , remains as unseizable to their wits as a high flight of metaphysics - namely , that the business of life is mainly carried on by the difficult art of literature , and according to a man 's proficiency in that art shall be the freedom and fullness of his intercourse with other men . Yet it is difficult not to believe that the ideal in which our author 's spirit might most gratefully have rested would have been the character of the paterfamilias , when the eye falls on such a charming piece of observation as these lines about children , in the admirable paper on Child 's Play ' ' If it were not for this perpetual imitation , we should be tempted to fancy they despised us outright , or onlyconsidered us in the light of creatures brutally strong and brutally silly , among whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a barbarous court . II . WE know very little about a talent till we know where it grew up , and it would halt terribly at the start any account of the author of " Kidnapped " which should omit to insist promptly that he is a Scot of the Scots . Two facts , to my perception , go a great way to explain his composition , the first of which is that his boyhood was passed in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle , and the second , that he came of a family that had set up great lights on the coast . His grandfather , his uncle , were famous constructors of light-houses , and the name of the race is associated above all with the beautiful and beneficent tower of Skerryvore . We may exaggerate the way in which , in an tinaginative youth , the sense of the " story " of things would feed upon the impressions of Edinburgh - though I suspect it would be difficult really- to do so . The streets are so full of history and poetry , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strange characters , that for my own part I find myself thinking of an urchin going and coming there as I used to think - wonderingly , enviously - of the small boys who figured as supernumeraries , pages , or imps in showy scenes at the theater ; the place seems the background , the complicated " set " of a drama , and the children the mysterious little beings who are made free of the magic world . How must it not have beckoned on the imagination to pass and repass , on the way to school , under the Castle rock , conscious acutely , yet familiarly , of the gray citadel on the summit , lighted up with the tartans and bagpipes of Highland regiments ! Mr. Stevenson 's mind , from an early age , was furnished with the concrete Highlander , who must have had much of the effect that we nowadays call decorative . I encountered somewhere a fanciful paper of our author 's * in which there is a reflection of half-holiday afternoons and , unless my own fancy plays me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the high-placed windows of the Old Town - a delightful rhapsody on the penny sheets of figures for the puppet-shows of infancy , in life-like position , and awaiting the impatient yet careful scissors . " If landscapes were sold , " he says in " Travels with a Donkey , " " like the sheets of characters of my boyhood , one penny plain and twopence colored , I should go the length of twopence every day of my life . " Indeed , the color of Scotland has entered into him altogether , and though , oddly enough , he has written but little about his native coun- - try , his happiest work shows , I think , that she has the best of his abiliLy . " Kidnapped " ( whose inadequate title I may deplore in passing ) breathes in every line the feeling of moor and loch , and is the finest of his longer stories ; and " Thrawn Janet , " a masterpiece in thirteen pages ( lately republished in the volume of " The Merry Men " ) , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter consists of a gruesome anecdote of the supernatural , related in the Scotch dialect ; and the genuineness which this medium - at the sight of which , in general , the face of the reader grows long - wears in Mr. Stevenson 's hands is a proof of how living the question of form always is to him , and what a variety of answers he has for it . It never would have occurred to us that the style of " Travels with a Donkey , " or " Virginibus Puerisque , " and the * Since reprinted in " Memories and Portraits . " // idiom of the parish of Baiweary could be a scene , and is not moved up to the measure of the occonception of the same mind . If it is a good casion ; and that some one is himself . . . . He seems have had such a * to himself to touch things with muffled hands and to fortune for a genThs qwq // and constantly touching - in this association of peculiarly restrictive conditions with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honorably picturesque career . Mr. Stevenson is , however , distinctly , in spite of his occasional practice of the gruesome , a frank optimist , an observer who not only loves life , but does not shrink from the responsibility of recommending it . There is a systematic brightness in him which testifies to this and which is , after all , but one of the innumerable ingenuities of patience . What is remarkable in his case is that his productions should constitute an exquisite expression , a sort of whimsical gospel , of enjoyment . The only difference between " An Inland Voyage , " or Travels with a Donkey * and The New Arabian Nights , " or " Treasure Island , " or " Kidnapped , " is , that in the later books the enjoyment is reflective ,  --  though it stimulates spontaneity with singular art ,  --  whereas in the first two it is natural and , as it were , historical . These little histories  --  the first volumes , if I mistake not , that introduced Mr. Stevenson to lovers of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the world as a not exactly refined , but glorified , pacified Bohemia . They narrate the quest of personal adventure- on one occasion in a canoe on the Sambre and the Qise , and on another at a donkey 's tail over the hills and *-valleys of the C*vennes . I well remember that when I read them , in their novelty , upward of ten years ago , I seemed to see the author , unknown as yet to fame , jump before my eyes into a style . His steps in literature presumably had not been many ; yet he had mastered his form - it had in these cases , perhaps , more substance than his matter - and a singular air of literary experience . It partly , though not completely , explains the phenomenon , that he had already been able to write the exquisite little story of Will of the Mill , ** published previously to " An Inland Voyage , " and now republished in the volume of " The Merry Men " ; for in " Will of the Mill " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that most fascinating quality a work of imagination can have , a dash of alternative mystery as to its meaning , an air - the air of life itself- of half inviting , half defying , you to interpret . This brief but finished composition stood in the same relation to the usual " magazine story " that a glass of Johannisberg occupies to a draught of table d'hôte yin ordinaire . One evening , he asked the miller where the river went . . . . " It goes out into the lowlands , and waters the great corn country , and runs through a sight of fine cities ( so they say ) where kings live all alone in great palaces , with a sentry walking up and down before the door . And it goes under bridges with stone men upon them , looking down and smiling so curious at the water , and living folks leaning their elbows on the wall and looking over too . And then it goes on and on , and down through niarshes and sands , until at last it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring parrots and tobacco from the Indies . " It is impossible not to open one 's eyes at such a paragraph as that , especially if one has taken a common texture for granted . Will of the Mill spends his life in the valley through which the river runs , and through which , year after year , post-chaises and wagons , an *pedestrians , and once an army , " horse and foot , cannon and timbrel , drum and standard , take their way , in spite of the dreams he has . once had of seeing the mysterious world , , and it is not till death comes that he goes on his travels . He ends by keeping an inn , where he converses with many more initiated spirits , and though he is an amiable man , he dies a bachelor , having broken off with more plainness than he would have used had he been less untraveled ,  --  of course he remains sadly provincial ,  --  his engagement to the parson 's daughter . The story is in the happiest key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in particular represent ? The advantage of waiting , perhaps- the valuable truth , that , one by one , we tide over our impatiences . There are sagacious people who hold that if one does n't answer a letter it ends by answering itself . So the sub-title of Mr. Stevenson s tale might be " The Beauty of Procrastination . " If you do n't indulge your curiosities your slackness itself makes at last a kind of rich element , and it comes to very much the same thing in the end . When it came to the point , poor Will had not even the curiosity to marry ; and the author leaves us in stimulating doubt as to whether he judges him too selfish or only too philosophic . I find myself speaking of Mr. Stevenson 's last volume ( at the moment I write ) before I have spoken , in any detail , of its predecessors , which I must let pass as a sign that I lack space for a full enumeration . I may mention two more of his productions as completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Silverado Squatters " describes a picnicking episode , undertaken on grounds of health , on a mountain-top in California ; but this free sketch , which contains a hundred humorous touches , and in the figqre of Irvine Lovelands one of Mr. Stevenson 's most veracious portraits , is perhaps less vivid , as it is certainly less painful , than those other pages in which , some years ago , he commemorated the twelvemonth he spent in America - the history of a journey from New York to San t*'rancisco in an emigrant-train , performed as the sequel to a voyage across the Atlantic in the same severe conditions . He has never // made his points better than in that half-humorous , half-tragical recital , nor given a more striking instance of his talent for reproducing the feeling of queer situations and contacts . It is much to be regretted that this little masterpiece has not been brought to light a second time , as also that he has not given the world - as I believe he came very near doing - his observations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , our author has a taste for the impressions of Bohemia , he has been very consistent and has not shrunk from going far afield in search of them . And as I have already been indiscreet , I may add that if it has been his fate to be converted in fact from the sardonic view of matrimony , this occurred under an influence which should have the particular sympathy of American readers . lie went to California for his wife ; and Mrs. Stevenson , as appears moreover by the titlepage of the work , has had a hand - evidently a light and practiced one - in " The Dynamiter , " the second series , characterized by a rich extravagance , of " The New Arabian Nights . " " The Silverado Squatters " is the history of a honeymoon - prosperous , it would seem , putting Irvine Lovelands aside , save for the death of dog Chuchu " in his teens , after a life so shadowed and troubled , continually shaken with alarms , and the tear of elegant sentiment permanently in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to the novel , on which he is to be congratulated , as any positive and genuine conviction of this kind is vivifying so long as it is not narrow . The breath of the novelist 's being is his liberty ; and the incomparable virtue of the form he uses is that it lends itself to views innumerable and diverse , to every variety of illustration . There is certainly no other mold of so large a capacity . The doctrine of M. Zola himself , so meager if literally taken , is fruitful , inasmuch as in practice he romantically departs from it . Mr. Stevenson does not need to depart , his individual taste being as much to pursue the romantic as his principle is to defend it . Fortunately , in England to-day , it is not much attacked . The triumphs that are to be won in the portrayal of the strange , the improbable , the heroic , especially as these things shine from afar in the credulous eye of youth , are his strongest , most constant incentive . On one happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he has seen them as they present themselves to a maturer vision . " Doctor Jekyll " is not a " boys ' book , " nor yet is " Prince Otto " ; the latter , however , is not , like the former , an experiment in mystification - it is , I think , more than anything else , an experiment in style , conceived one summer 's day , when the author had given the reins to his high appreciation of Mr. George Meredith . It is perhaps the most literary of his works , but it is not the most natural . It is one of those coquetries , as we may call them for want of a better word , which may be observed in Mr. Stevenson 's activitya kind of artful inconsequence . It is easy to believe that if his strength permitted him to be a more abundant writer he would still more frequently play this eminently literary trickthat of dodging off in a new direction-upon those who might have fancied they knew all about him . I made the reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that there is a kind of anticipatory malice in the subject of that fine story ; as if the writer had intended to say to his reader , " You will never guess , from the unction with which I describe the life of a man who never stirred five miles from home , that I am destined to make my greatest hits in treating of the rovers of the deep . " Even here , however , the author 's characteristic irony would have come in ; for - the rare chances of life being what he most keeps his eye on - the uncommon belongs as much to the way the inquiring Will sticks to his doorsill as to the incident , say , of John Silver and his men , when they are dragging Jim Hawkins to his doom , hearing , in the still woods of Treasure Island , the strange hoot of the Maroon . The novelist who leaves the extraordinary out of his account is liable to awkward confrontations , as we are compelled to reflect in this age of newspapers and of universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to give an instance - shall offer us a picture of astounding combinations of circumstance and behavior , and the annals of any energetic race are rich in curious anecdote and startling example . That interesting compilation , " Vicissitudes of Families , " is but a superficial record of strange accidents ; the familytaken , of course , in the long piece-is , as a general thing , a catalogue of odd specimens and strong situations , and we must remember that the most singular products are those which are not exhibited . Mr. Stevenson leaves so wide a margin for the wonderful - it impinges with easy assurance upon the text - that he escapes the danger of being brought *p by cases he has not allowed for . When he allows for Mr. Hyde he allows for everything ; and one feels , moreover , that even ifhe did not wave so gallantly the flag of the imaginary and contend that the improbable is what has most character , he would still insist that we ought to make believe . He would say we ocght to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if it were miot , an d to do so because the finest feelings - suspense , daring , // decision , passion , curiosity , gallantry , eloquence , friendship - are ibvolved in it , and it is of infinite importance that the tradition of these precious things should not perish . He would prefer , in a word , any day in the week , Alexandre Dumas to Honor* de Balzac ; and it is , indeed , my impression that he prefers the author of " The Three Musketeers " to any novelist except Mr. George Meredith . J should go so far as to suspect that his ideal of the delight ful work of fiction would be the adventures of Monte Cristo related by the author of " Richard Feverel . " There is some magnanimity in his esteem for Alexandre Dumas , inasmuch as in " Kidnapped " he has put into a fable worthy of that inventor a fineness of grain with which Dumas never had anything to do . He makes us say , Let the tradition live , by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time he is the cause of our perceiving afresh that a tradition is kept alive only by something being added to it . In this particular case - in * DoctorJekyll " and " Kidnapped " - Mr. Stevenson has added psychology . " The New Arabian Nights " offers us , as the title indicates , the wonderful in the frankest , most delectable form . Partly extravagant , and partly very specious , they are the result of a very happy idea , that of placing a series of adventures which are pure adventures in the setting of contemporary English life , and relating them in the placidly ingenious tone of Scheherezade . This device is carried to perfection in " The Dynamiter , " where the manner takes on more of a kind of high-flown serenity in proportion as the incidents are more " steep . " In this line " The Suicide Club " is Mr. Stevenson 's greatest success ; and the first two pages of it , not to mention others , live in the memory . For reasons which I am conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ineffaceably impressive- something really haunting - in the incident of Prince Florizel and Colonel Geraldine , who , one evening in March , are " driven by a sharp fall of sleet into an Oyster Bar in the immediate neighborhood of Leicester Square , " and there have occasion to observe the entrance of a young man followed by a couple of commissionaires , each of whom carries a large dish of creamtarts under a cover - a young man who " pressed these confections on every one 's acceptance with exaggerated courtesy . " There is no effort at a picture here , but the imagination makes one of the lighted interior , the London sleet outside , the company that we guess , given the locality , and the strange politeness of the young man , leading on to circumstances stranger still . This is what may be called putting one in the mood for a story . VOL . XXXV. - I 19 . But Mr. Stevenson 's most brilliant stroke of that kind is the opening episode of " Treasure Island " - the arrival of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Admiral Benbow , " and the advent , not long after , of the blind sailor , with a green shade over his eyes , who comes tapping down the road , in quest of him , with his stick . " Treasure Island " is a " boy 's book , " in the sense that it embodies a boy 's vision of the extraordinary ; but it is unique in this , and calculated to fascinate the weary mind of experience , that what we see in it is not only the ideal fable , but , as part and parcel of that , as it were , the young reader himself and his state of mind : we seem to read it over his shoulder , with an arm around his neck . It is all as perfect as a wellplayed boy 's game , and nothing can exceed the spirit and skill , the humor and the openair feeling , with which the whole thing is kept at the critical pitch . It is not only a record of queer chances , but a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the figures are not puppets with vague faces . If Jim Hawkins illustrates successful daring , he does so with a delightful , rosy good-boyishness , and a conscious , modest liability to error . His luck is tremendous , but it does n't make him proud ; and his manner is refreshingly provincial and human . So is that , even more , of the admirable John Silver , one of the most picturesque , and , indeed , in every way , most genially presented , villains in the whole literature of romance . Hehas a singularly distinct and expressive countenance , which , of course , turns out to be a grimacing mask . Never was a mask more knowingly , vividly painted . " Treasure Island " will surely become - it must already have become , and will remain - in its way a classic ; thanks to this indescribable mixture of the prodigious and the human , of surprising coincidences and familiar feelings . The language in which Mr. Stevenson has chosen to tell his story is an admirable vehicle for these feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old ballads and yarns , it touches all kinds of sympathetic chords . Is " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde " a work of high philosophic intention , or simply the most ingenious and irresponsible of fictions ? It has the stamp of a really imaginative production , that we may take it in different ways , but I suppose it would be called the most serious of the author 's tales . It deals with the relation of the baser parts of man to his noblerof the capacity for evil that exists in the most generous natures , and it expresses these things in a fable which is a wonderfully happy invention . The subject is endlessly interesting , and rich in all sorts of provocation , and Mr. // Stevenson is to be congratulated on having touched the core of it . I may do him injustice , but it is , however , here , not the proftindity of the idea which strikes me so much as the art of the presentation - the extremely successful form . There is a genuine feeling for the perpetual moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and the brutishness of being bad , but what there is above all is a singular ability in holding the interest . I confess that that , to my sense , is the most edifying thing in the short , rapid , concentrated story , which is really a masterpiece of concision . There is something almost impertinent in the way , as I have noticed , in which Mr. Stevenson achieves his best effects without the aid of the ladies , and " Dr. Jekyll " is a capital example of his heartless independence . It is usually supposed that a truly poignant impression can not be made without them , but in the drama of Mr. Hyde 's fatal ascendency they remain altogether in the wing . It is very obvious - I do not say it cynically - that they must have played an important part in his development . The gruesome tone of the tale is , no doubt , deepened by their absence ; it is like the late afternoon light of a foggy winter Sunday , when even inanimate objects have a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mystifying fiction more to the purpose than the episode of Mr. Uttersons going to Dr. Jekyll 's to confer with the butler , when the doctor is locked up in his laboratory and the old servant , whose sagacity has hitherto encountered successfully the problems of the sideboard and the pantry , confesses that this time he is utterly baffled . The way the two men , at the door of the laboratory , discuss the identity of the mysterious personage inside , who has revealed himself in two or three inhuman glimpses to Poole , has those touches of which irresistible shudders are made . The butler 's theory is that his master has been murdered , and that the murderer is in the room , personating him with a sort of clumsy diabolism . " Well , when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet , it went down my spine like ice . " That is the effect upon the reader of most of the story . I say of most rather than all , because the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in accepting the business of the powders , which seems to me too explicit and explanatory . The powders constitute the machinery of the transformation , and it will probably have struck many readers that this uncanny process would be more conceivable ( so far as one may speak of the conceivable in such a case ) , if the author had not made it so definite . I have left Mr. Stevenson 's best book to the last , as it is also the last he has given , at the present speaking , * to the public  --  the tales comprising " The Merry Men " having already appeared ; but I find that , on the way , I have anticipated some of the remarks that I had intended to make about it . That which is most to the point is that there are parts of it so fine as to suggest that the author 's talent has taken a fresh start , various as have been the impulses in which it had already indulged , and serious the impediments among which it is condemned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse humility in his keeping up the fiction that a production so literary as " Kidnapped " is addressed to immature minds ; and though it was originally given to the world , I believe , in a " boy 's paper , " the story embraces every occasion that it meets to satisfy the higher criticism . It has two weak spots , which need simply to be mentioned . The cruel and miserly uncle , in the first chapters , is rather in the tone of superseded tradition , and the tricks he plays upon his ingenuous nephew are a little like those of country conjurers ; in these pages we feel that Mr. Stevenson is thinking too much of what a " boy 's paper " is expected to contain . Then the history stops without ending , as it were ; but I think I may add that this accident speaks for itself . Mr. Stevenson has often to lay down his pen for reasons that have nothing to do with the failure of inspiration , and the last page of David Balfour 's adventures is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book deserve to stand by " Henry Esmond , " as a fictive autobiography in archaic form . The author 's sense of the English idiom of the last century , and still more of the Scotch , have enabled him to give a gallant companion to Thackeray 's four deforce . The life , the humor , the color of the central portions of " Kidnapped " have a singular pictorial virtue ; these passages read like a series of inspired foot-notes on some historic page . The charm of the most romantic episode in the world - though perhaps it would be hard to say why it is the most romantic , when it was intermingled with so much stupidity - is over the whole business , and the forlorn hope of the Stuarts is revived for us without evoking satiety . There could be no better instance of the author 's talent for seeing the actual in the marvelous , and reducing the extravagant to plausible detail , than the description of Alan Breck 's defense in the cabin of the ship , and the really magnificent chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson has , in a high degree ( and doubtless for * Since the above was written , " Underwoods , " as well as " Memories and Portraits , " has been published . // good reasons of his own ) , what may be called the imagination of physical states , and this has enabled him to arrive at a wonderfully exact notation of the miseries of his panting Lowland hero , dragged for days and nights over hill and dale , through bog and thicket , without meat or drink or rest , at the tail of an Homeric Highlander . The great superiority of the book resides , to my mind , however , in the fact that it puts two characters on their feet in an admirably upright way . I have paid my tribute to Alan Breck , and I can only repeat that he is a masterpiece . It is interesting to observe that , though the man is extravagant , the author 's touch exaggerates nothing ; it is , throughout , of the most truthful , genial , ironical kind , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moralizing satire . The figure is a genuine study , and nothing can be more charming than the way Mr. Stevenson both sees through it and admires it . Shall I say that he sees through David Balfour ? This would be , perhaps , to underestimate the density of that medium . Beautiful , at any rate , is the expression which this unfortunate though circumspect youth gives to those qualities which combine to excite our respect and our objurgations in the Scottish character . Such a scene as the episode of the quarrel of the two men on the mountain-side is a real stroke of genius , and has the very logic and rhythm of life - a quarrel which we feel to be inevitable , though it is about nothing , or almost nothing , and which springs from exasperated nerves and the simple shock of temperaments . The author's. vision of it has a profundity which goes deeper , I think , than " Dr. Jekyll . " I know of few better examples of the way genius has ever a surprise in its pocket - keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in this case it ebdears itself to us by making us reflect that such a passage as the one I speak of is in fact a signal proof of what the novel can do at its best and what nothing else can do so welL In the presence of this sort of success we perceive its immense value . It is capable of a rare transparency - it can illustrate human affairs in cases so delicate and complicated that any other vehicle would be clumsy . To those who love the art that Mr. Stevenson practices he will appear , in pointing this incidental moral , not only to have won a particular triumph , but to have given a delightful pledge . Henry James .
