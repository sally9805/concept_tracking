txt Yesterday afternoon a majority of the stock of the Central IQtrict Printing Telegraph Company was sold to the American Bell Telephone Company . The Pittsburg company controls the telephone rights in Western Pennsylvania , West Virginia , and Eastern Ohio , and has exchanges established in all the principal cities in the territory named . The negotiations have been pending for some time . N. Lest Wilson , who has been acting for the Pittaburgers , yesterday sent private dispatches from Boston stating that the sale had been closed with a profit to himself and friends of $650,000 . One of the gentlemen who disposed of his stock made a statement to your correspondent this afternoon which throws some light on the object of the Bell Compahy in receiving this and other franchises , and shows that there is war ahead for the Western Union Telegraph Company . He said : " This company , the Bell , has grown wealthy with unexpected rapidity and its desire to regain exclusive control of the telephone rights is not for the sake of the talk transmitters alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , a direct blow at the powerful Western Union Telegraph Company . When the telephones were introduced an agreement was entered into by the Western Union Telegraph , the Edison Telephone . and the American Bell Telephone Companies , which provided that neither of the telephone companies was to engage in the business of sending telegrams . This agreement has some time to run yet , but when it expires it will never be renewed . Quietly and steadily the American Bell Company has been buying up the telephone exchanges of the country , until it now controls the greater number of the prominent cities , and with them the adjacent territory and the countless telephone wires . Its object in this is to turn the telephone system into a telegraph system which for completeness will as greatly exceed the lines of the Western Union as that corporation now exceeds any of its rivals . The ease with which this can be done is astonishing . The telephone wires run into every business house of any magnitude in every city and town of any size of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary will he to run wires from one town to another , supplying the missing links , and put in the instruments . Without interfering with the telephones every merchant and manufacturer can be put in what would really be direct telegraphic communication with any other city . All this can be accomplished without any trouble worth mentioning . One of the big advantages which the American Bell Company has in forwarding this scheme is the comparatively light expense under which it can act . Good judges state that $7,000.000 will purchase the control of the telephone rights in the United States ; 81.000,000 will pay for the connecting lines from city to city , and $3,000,000 will pay for all expenses necessary to fit up the telephone exchanges for telegraph business . This would make a capital of $11,000,000 for a company which would have equal  --  in some respects better  --  facilities than the Western Union . The latter corporation has a capital amounting to 580,000,000 , built up by swallowing rivals and watering , and with such a load will not be in a position to fight a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which to pay dividends . The Western Union had an opportunity to buy the telephone exchanges , but it let the chance go by . and now can only stand and see the most formidable rival it ever had prepare to overthrow it .
