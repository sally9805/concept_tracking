txt The Hon. Thomas M. Marshall , of this city , who was a delegate to the Stalwart Republican State Convention held at Harrisburg on May 10 , and who was nominated for Congressman at Large and subsequently declined , to-day addressed the following open letter to the Dispatch , which explains itself : You have requested me to communicate in a public way my purpose touching a convention . which I learn by the newspapers is to be held on the 21st of this month . Having received no official notification of the assemblage , it may be proper that I give the reasons which control my action . The convention of the 10th of May nominated a candidate for Congressman at Large after positive and express notice that be would not accept office . The convention , as I understand , dispersed without a formal vote of adjournment , and without making provision for its own recall  --  dispersed without providing means to meet contingencies such as sometimes occur under the most careful management . If the convention , as has been suggested , has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality must exist in its own body , I should say in its executive  --  the Hon. George Lear . If this vitality exists , the sign of life should emanate from within and not be borrowed from an outside taper . It appears , however , that a stranger to the : convention has assumed authority in the premises and issued his call . Who is Mr. Cooper ? From whom does he derive his authority ? His name does not appear in the roll of the convention 's membership , nor was he ' one of its officers . He was Chairman of the State Committee which expired with the organization of the convention at the 10th of May . Mr. Cooper , having no authority from the convention . is acting beyond his sphere . A call from the Chairman of a dead committee is more than void . The fact that a new State Committee has been partially provided for does not help the case above its source , and the creature can not give life to the creator . Moreover , the new State Committee has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the call of Mr. Cooper does not exist in that direction . It seems to me that the gentleman who has assumed the grave reaponsibility of requiring 251 delegates to leave their homes and business at his pleasure has been swift to meddle in a matter not of his concern . It is an act not sustained even by the'usage of party machinery in Pennsylvania , and singularly unfortunate in view of the temper of the times . I shall treat this call as unauthorized and take no further notice of its demand . This is not a small matter . It is a vital question of power . I believe that self-respecting gentlemen who were delegates should refuse to sustain this call by their presence or co-operation on the 21st of June . Those desiring to fulfill the bidding of the projectors of this call may attend and enroll themselves in their service . In my judgment this kind of management has almost come to an end . If the dissatisfaction of the Republican vote , with those who meet in a hotel parlor and choose a Congressman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it may be gathered about the first Tuesday of November next . It is nearly five months until the voters will be called upon to vote for State officers . There is abundant time to give the Republican voters a chance to choose their own standard-bearers . Would it not be well to remit the grave dangers that imperil the party to the voters for their decision . see that this same Mr. Cooper proposes to submit the two tickets now in nomination to a voluntary poll . From whom does this gentleman derive his authority in this new matter ? Who would be bound by the result as declared by the machine ? Are the Republican voters of the Commonwealth to be limited in the election of their Governor to James A. Beaver or John Stewart ? I earnestly suggest that Mr. Cooper has let himself out beyond his measure , and be might with propriety retire from the front . The whole question is capable of a fair solution by a reference to the only source of power  --  the Republican voters of the State . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters is persisted in , there is but one remedy known to me . That is to be found in the free action of each individual voter .
