txt An attentive Republican observer of the course of President CLEVELAND 'S Administration writes to us from Nebraska that all the Federal appointments thus far made in that State have been made at the instance of " notorious spoilsmen , " and that the men appointed are " notorious partisans . " According to our correspondent Mr. JAMES E. BOYD , the Nebraska member of the National Democratic Committee , and Dr. MILLER , editor of the Omaha Herald , are the purveyors of Federal patronage in that State . Mr. BOYD 'S views upon public questions were recently given in a newspaper interview . He is a practical man , and he has very distinct notions about the value of the Federal offices to the Democratic Party . " Good Democrats , " says Mr. BOYD , " will be put in every office at the expiration of every incumbent 's term . Secretary LAMAR told me that in three years we will have a complete Democratic Administration . Federal offices influence one million and a half of votes , and in the face of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a certain victory . " We have no other information than our correspondent 's letter furnishes about the President 's appointments in Nebraska . We hope they are not so unworthy as he deems them . But we have a suggestion to make to our correspondent , who is a gentleman of intelligence and high standing in one of the busiest communities of his growing State . We suggest that he keep a watchful eye upon these notorious partisans who have been appointed to office ; and when he finds one using his office for partisan ends , or , as Mr .. BOYD puts it , for recruiting and ' strengthening the forces of the Democratic Party for " certain victory in 1888 , " or in any other year , let him report the case to the President , first making sure of his facts , and substantiating his report by the affidavits of respectable citizens . There is nothing in the nature of this suggestion which makes . it more applicable to Nebraska than to any other State in the Union . We should like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic officer appointed by President CLEVELAND shall " forfeit all just claim to retention by offensive partisanship and unscrupulous manipulation of local party management . " These are the President 's own words . They are distinct and unmistakable . Every Democratic public officer should look upon them as having the force of statute law . Equally clear is the President 's definition of the proper bounds of an office holder 's political activity . They should confine themselves to " the quiet and unobtrusive exercise of individual public rights as the measure of their party service . " With these authoritative utterances before their eyes our Republican friends in every State , and our Democratic friends as well , will be able to judge intelligently the conduct of the Government 's civil servants , and to give the President timely warning of partisan offenses deserving of his notice . We shall give some attention to the behavior of the Democratic office holders in this vicinity  --  including some quite recent appointments .                   @ @
