txt Scientific persons as a class have very little acquaintance with animals . They may know all about the bones and teeth and organs of animals , but it is rare that an animal admits a scientific person to friendly intimacy . What can a vivisectibg anatomist know of the mind and soul of the dog whom he cuts up ? A respectable dog would never dream of allowing such a man to catch the slightest glimpse of his thoughts and emotions . Just as one may learn the grammar of a language , and still be unable to read or speak it , so the scientific person may master the grammar of a dozen distinct animals and never be able to speak with one of them . This is why scientific persons assert that man is the only animal that laughs , and that the other animals have no sense of humor whatever . Of course , there is not a word of truth in this . There are hundreds of men who are well acquainted with animals  --  men whom our leading dogs and most eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only do many animals have a keen sense of humor , but that they can enjoy a hearty laugh . Tile parrot who has succeeded in gripping a careless scientific person by the nose or whiskers will often laugh at the top of his lungs for the next half-hour , and show his enjoyment of his innocent joke by standing head downward on his perch , and by writhing in the most fantastic attitudes . Why the scientific person never sees the fun of the thing is not so clear , and it is quite possible that there exists among parrots a conviction that no scientific person has any sense of humor . That cats laugh is evident from the familiar proverb in regard to Cheshire cats . It may be objected that Cheshire cats are said to grin , and that grinning and laughter are not the same . The answer to this is that the cat always laughs silently . It would be folly to require an animal to laugh aloud in the English language , just as it would be folly to expect the ordinary Englishman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar way , but the silent grin of the Cheshire cat is as true a laugh as is the roar of a large German who fancies he has discovered a joke in a Berlin comic paper . There was a public cat ? or , in other words , a cat without any private owner ? living in a suburban town a few years ago who was full of a grim sarcastic humor . She had frequently been chased in a rude and alarming manner by a local dog , and , naturally , had no love for her persecutor . One day the latter was chained up as a punishment for misconduct in connection with a clergyman 's leg , and the cat , finding that he could not break his chain , came and sat on the ground just beyond his reach with a broad grin on her face , which must have been to the last degree exasperating to the canine mind . Not content with this , the cat went in search of a large and tempting bone , which she deposited within two inches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself alternately on her hind and fore legs , with a display of hilarity which drove the dog frantic . There can be no possible doubt that the cat was playing a practical joke on her enemy , and that she enjoyed it to the utmost possible extent . And yet , if we are to believe the scientific persons , a cat is wholly devoid of humor . A dog laughs audibly . He opens his mouth as widely as possible , and , with his tongue hanging out , utters a sound somewhat resembling both a whine and a bark , but differing essentially from either . The expression of his face meanwhile shows that he is enjoying himself , and bears not the slightest resemblance to the look of pathetic melancholy which always accompanies a genuine whine . There is a dog in Stonington , Conn. , who is a horn humorist . The country in the neighborhood of Stonington is infested with snakes , some of which ? as , for ex-. ample , the copperhead  --  are not the sort of snakes with whom any gentleman- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of the dog* is . an indefatigable huntsman , and often spends whole days in wandering in search of game . The dog discovered long ago that his master had a great dislike of snakes , and accordingly the faithful animal  --  who belongs to the pointer denomination  --  made it a rule to point at every snake that came in his way . This gave the huntsman fair warning of the presence of snakes and enabled him either to avoid them altogether or to kill theta with due regard to his safety . The dog bad pointed at snakes without ever once making a mistake for three years , when one day last September he accompanied his master on a walk through a particularly stony field , where snakes were known to be plentiful . Suddenly the dog , who was walking just in front of the huntsman , stopped and pointed so earnestly that it was evident he had almost stepped on a snake . The huntsman sprang backward with immense celerity  --  for he was a very nervous man  --  and in so doing tripped and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to see what was the matter , resumed his point until his master had picked himself up , ' calmed his mind , and resolved to kill the snake . Advancing with that direful purpose , he discovered , not a snake , but a cast-off snake 's skin at which the dog had pointed . The moment the man discovered the trick the dog threw himself on his back , rolled over and over in an uncontrollable fit of laughter , and finally , sitting down on his haunches , laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks . He knew a snake 's skin from a live snake perfectly well , and his purpose in pointing at the skin was simply to give his master a good fright . But what is the use of citing evidence of what every man who has the honor to be well acquainted with dogs knows to be perfectly true ? It is only the scientific persons who say that dogs do not laugh , and they would continue to say so were they to be openly laughed at by dogs every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
