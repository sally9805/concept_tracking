A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT 'S ADVENTURE . " JT 'S abominable ! It 's outrageous ! I There is n't a thing on the table fit for a decent man to eat . The cook ought to be put to death . Hanging would be too good for her-for I 'll be bound it 's a woman ; no man would have the effrontery to send up such disgraceful stuff . She ought to be strangled , and with her own food . Bah ! that dreadful breakfast is sticking in my throat yet . " The above-uttered words , spoken with vehement emphasis of irritability , were accompanied by an energetic pushing aside of the various platters of leathery beef , underdone potatoes , and bullet-headed peas . For Mr. Hugh Wilder had arrived at an age and to proportions of rotundity when a man takes serious views of the dinner question . No wonder , then , that he found himself wholly unable to accept in the true spirit of resignation the scant accommodation in edibles offered the Mount Desert summer boarder . " Heavens ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust , " I shall die of indigestion if I stay here another week . " " But you know you would come , " bleated a lady by this protesting gentleman 's side , softly and inoffensively , as if Voi .. LXL-No. 564. - 40 fearing to excite him the more . She was presumably his wife , if one were only to infer such a conclusion from the general rule governing the matrimonial choice . She belonged to him by every law of contrast . She looked as mild as he was explosive , as bleached as he was highly colored , and had the air of being one of those marital moons that only shine by reflected light . A close observer might have discovered that the moral atmosphere of this moon-lit character was of a depressingly exhausted nature . There was a hopeless look of resignation emitted through the medium of her pale blue eye . She had an extinguished air , as if her previous efforts to throw cold water on the volcanic ebullitions of her lord had , so to speak , worn her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that carried no hope of success in it . " Would come , " the explosive gentleman replied , echoing her words . " Do you suppose I expected this I " with a comprehensive sweep of his fork over the halfcooked food before him . " I supposed at least we should be able to live like Christians ; but a Turk could n't stand this . Pie , do you say ? "  --  to the waitress , who was passing him various specimefis of that // truly characteristic American pastry . " Yes , I 'll take some pie . It 's the only good thing there is here . Some mince , please . One is sure of getting at least a bit of meat  --  and cooked-in a mince-pie . Coffee ? No , thank you . We make our own . There 's where we showed a grain of wisdom . Violet " - turning to a young lady at his left- " send for the hot water , will you ? Drink their coffee ! It 's the most infernal- " " Uncle ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of commanding remonstrance  --  a tone singularly soft , and of contralto richness . For all its softness , her single word produced its effect . The volcano was extinguished , and Mr. Wilder continued to eat his repast in silence ; with something , it is true , of that dejected air a man wears who has been successfully snubbed into silence by two women . This little domestic episode had served as the sauce piquante to the mid-day meal of a certain light-haired young gentleman who sat a few seats removed from the Wilder party . Mr. Rutherford Payson had , indeed , been so thoroughly entertained with the lively play of the gentleman 's ill-humor , the elder lady 's look of uneasy , helpless irritation , and the young girl 's air of composed disapproval , that he had quite forgotten to grumble on his own account . Upon seating himself at the table his eyes had naturally wandered to this party , Miss Violet 's attractions being , indeed , of an order to make her the focal point of observation . She was handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . It was the sort of beauty which made a little show of anger wonderfully becoming ; that hint of indignation had lent a smothered fire of splendor to the dark deep eye ; and to the rich chestnut hue of the cheek was added a color which made it wear the ripe , fruity , luscious bloom which so delights the eye in a Vandyck canvas . The young girl 's efforts to maintain an air of serene self-control made her square a little defiantly a pair of finely turned shoulders , and gave to her charming round head , with its masses of low-looped hair , a bird-like erectness . Altogether , Payson felt that the moment of observation had been a singularly fortuitous one . A closer observation revealed to Payson that the other features of the face were not up to the scale of beauty attained by the expressive character of her superb eyes . But one could hardly be coldly critical of the faults in the face when one was under the influence of its charm ; and the charm was one evoked by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This young gentleman was rather given to the interesting pastime of classifying pretty women 's faces , and he put Miss Violet 's along with those faces that had a soul in them . He suspected she might , upon acquaintance , be found to have a taste for a serious moment . She was anything but serious now . She was laughing heartily , and making the others laugh . The irascible uncle had lost all traces of his former irritability . He was leading the laughter with trumpet-like blasts of merriment , his anger being , presumably , like the rage of certain beasts of prey , confined to quarrelling over his food . Payson had his own reasons for being thoroughly out of humor with Mount Desert ; but his grievances were based on higher grounds than the dismal failures before him in the culinary art . After a five years ' absence abroad , he had returned hoping to find Mount Desert as primitive as he had left it . Fresh from the debris of ruins , there had been bred in him an appetite for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope of finding Mount Desert-that charming marriage of mountain and sea - still fresh with its perfume of savage sanctity . The very pines , he remembered , had waved with an air of virginal primeval grace . But behold ! the wilderness was a wilderness no longer . The place was swarming , not with the flannel - shirted mountaineers , but with myriads of charming girls and handsome women in irreproachable French toilets . The wilderness , indeed , might be said to blossom like the rose , in view of the fact of the number of pretty girls with whom it abounded . In re-adjusting his mental focus , Payson was forced to admit he lost nothing in point of amusement . He was conscious of being most delightfully entertained . If America was the country of surprises-indeed , the very genius of the unexpectedhis native land certainly yielded coinpensating stores of pleasure . Mount Deserts the discovered , the appropriated , the fash // jonable Mount Desert , was only another name for a carnival of pleasure , a Turk 's paradise of beauties . Wherever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sights and sounds . From the caves there came the echo of gay laughter ; through the forest there moved the flutter of French gowns . The rocks were made picturesquely alive with vivid , brilliant splashes of color , and a perfectly bewildering maze of loveliness was to be gazed upon at the hops and Germans . As for the naked little god , he did a most thriving business . Payson had not been many hours on the island before he made the interesting discovery that flirtation , that peculiarly American pastime , was the pivot on which swung all fashionable existence at Mount Desert . Flirtations , indeed , were being carried on in open court , so to speak . This summer operetta seemed to be universally sung in duets ; and to a fine ear the active flutter of Monsieur Cupidon 's fleet little wings was to be heard in brisk circulation beneath all those widely spread bandanna sun-shades , which Payson had come to look upon as an indispensable adjunct to Mount Desert scenery . To Payson there was something infectious in breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself thinking with flattering pertinacity of a certain dark-eyed , brown - haired young woman . And she was no other than the charming Miss Wilder . He was only happy when yielding to " the spirit in his feet " which led him to become the shadow of her movements . A glimpse of her on some distant bluff , as she stood , the high light of a perfect picture , the lines of her figure delightfully defined against the superb blue of sea and sky , the flutter of her scarf  --  a scarf he had grown to have a fondness for-flying in the breeze of some mountain altitude , were things he was beginning to feed on . Naturally what he longed for was more substantial diet . But the approaches to knowing her seemed all cut off . They appeared to have no mutual friends . And perhaps the fact that the Wilders caine from Boston was sufficient to account for a certain aloofness in their manner . There was , indeed , a touch of New England reserve about them all . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social amenities , by the consciousness that he came from the Hub . But to Payson , Boston carried no terrors . He had acquired that fine freemasonry of social spirit which comes to a travelled being , and was he to be chilled by a Boston east wind ? He recognized no such petty social impediments , and Miss Wilder might be twenty times the haughty Puritan maiden she gave evidence of being , and he would know her . The following day at dinuer he was in the very act of opening fire , when , chancing to look up at Miss Wilder 's charming face , an idea-an utterly absurd idea - struck him , and he began to smile . To his confusion , she was returning his look , and for the first time . To his horror , before he could check himself , his smile had broadened , and he was conscious of having very nearly laughed in her face . He had a vague sense that Miss Wilder 's eyes had flashed out at him in mingled surprise and indignation , and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable annoyance . But he had already hastily quitted the table . For the next few moments Mr. Rutherford Payson might have been found at the back door of the hotel apostrophizing the innocent mountains with great fluency of speech  --  a fluency which rarely comes to a man in trying moments unless he yield to the cheering effects of a discreet profanity . But he could not have helped it if he had tried . His rudeness had come from an uncontrollable attack of his sense of the ridiculous . That morning on the beach he had fallen into conversation with a native who was busily engaged in shovelling sea-weed . Payson fell to wondering how any man could eke out a living on this barren coast . Then he had asked the man how he managed to make a living at all . " Wa'al , neighbor , " the man had answered him , " there bea n't nuthin ' ter make hereabouts , an ' that 's a fact . But , yei ' see , in winter I haul logs , and in summer I haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squint along . " Be it added that in the elegant and realistic vernacular of Mount Desert the term " mealer " is applied to those boarders living outside in the cottages , for whom , in wet weather , the typical local vehicle  --  the buckboard - is sent by the hotel-keepers . When Payson had looked at Miss Wilder 's refined , aristocratic turn of feature , and then thought of her as classed under // the generic name of " hauled mealer , " it had proved too much for him . But at least he could repair his error ; he Would go and apologize ; he would go now . In his zeal to acquit himself , he rushed toward the piazza . But two ladies , with their arms linked in one another 's , blocked the doorway leading to it . As he stood behind them , he caught sight of the profile of one of the ladies . It was that of Miss Wilder 's aunt , and she was saying , " But you thought him so handsome . " And he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of careless disdain : " Which fact does n't preclude the possibility of his having the worst manners in the world . He is the rudest man I have ever seen . " With that , both ladies stepped out , and were soon slowly pacing the long length of the piazza . Of course , now , he could not have the face to present himself . She had condemned him unheard , and her verdict had been like a blow . All he could do was to keep away . He would see to it that at least she should not even be annoyed by his presence . Meanwhile he was walking , aimlessly , he hardly knew where . He was conscious only of having as his companions the lively play of his self-reproaches , his futile regrets . He had made a fool of himself  --  a fact he was communicating with more or less vehemence of utterance to every tree on the road-side . He had made an idiot of himself , and he was taking the very flowers into his confidence . Then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretty heads of these innocent offenders , after the fashion of the kings of old , who beheaded a man possessed of too dangerous a secret . After an hour 's walk or so he suddenly determined to turn back . What was the use of wandering about cursing one 's folly ? He would go back : something might happen . He might meet her , and thenwho knows ? He might ftnd courage to confront her with his excuses and repentance . As he was sauntering by the wharf , crowded with the usual number of parties about to set off for their afternoon sail , a man whom he knew-Clinton Youngsrushed hastily past him . Catching sight of Payson , he seized him by the arm , accosting him with : " Just the man ! For Heaven 's sake help us out , Payson . There is n't an inch of room in one of the boats for that pretty Boston girl , and there is n't a soul to row her over . We 're off for the Porcupines . Tea on the rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather jolly . Come , you must , " dragging him along . Before Payson could fairly begin his expostulatory refusal , Clinton Youngs had him confronting the entire party . " Here 's your boat . Do you know the girl-Miss Wilder ? No ? How awkward ! I supposed of course you knew her . She 's at your hotel . Miss Wilder , allow me to present Mr. Payson . He insists upon rowing you over " - by way of making things easier . Payson could have crushed him . " Remember , we 're to meet at the Rocks . I must go up for another pair of oars . " And Mr. Clinton Youngs was off . Payson stood still . He felt himself for the moment seized by a kind of masterly indecision . Miss Wilder had only acknowledged his presence by the slightest of slight inclinations : the most ingenious imagination could not call it a bow . Then she had gone on quietly amusing herself with her previous occupation of dabbling with her white fingers in the waters . What should he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , his opportunity . Fate had been kinder to him than his wildest dreams . He was hardly the man to fly now . He had certainly given Miss Wilder time and chance to object to his entering the boat had she so chosen . He had waited a full long moment . But there was no sign , either of consent or dissent , to be read from that down-sweeping glance . The next instant he had leaped in , and had pushed the boat off . A few vigorous strokes , and they were well out in the bay . " Miss Wilder , " he began , with a kind of desperate directness , after a few seconds of death-like silence-she had not even looked at him yet- " you have every right to think me the rudest man in the world . " She blushed at this , slowly raising her eyes . " But wo n't you suspend a severer judgment until you hear a little story ? " With deliberate frankness he related the history of his morning 's adventure , and its tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering of the situation . He was too terribly in earnest for that . Certain it is that Miss Wilder did not find anything in iL to cause her to smile . But when he began to upbraid himself with his dreadful , his inexcusable // rudeness , and to tell hei ' how hopeless he felt the situation to be , she smiled radiantly , and answered him , with a delightfully re-assuring mockery in her tone : " Yes , it is hopeless . Perfectly so . Had n't we better leave it alone ? And do n't you think , considering we 're off on a pleasure-jaunt , we ought to try to think of something a little more cheering than our mutual mistakes ? Is n't the weather superb ? In such a climate one can forgive its mention . " " I suppose Mount Desert is an old story to you ? " " Oh no . We 're just being introduced . " " Of course you like it I " " Oh , it 's a paradise  --  to be young in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is vile , " laughingly responded Payson . " Whose vileness , though , appears to have a saving charm , if one is to believe the evidence of one 's senses , " brightly retorted the girl . " But , " she continued , " I should hate to come ihere a middle-aged party , should n't you ? Imagine confronting this sentimental entourage with one 's worn-out illusions I " " It would be committing a kind of moral anachronism , " answered Payson , sweeping the boat along in easy sculling motion . He was hardly conscious of making any physical exertion to speed their going . He was only delightfully , sentiently stirred with an exhilarating sense of joy and an unwonted elation at carrying away with him over this wide waste of the summer sea so beautiful and charming a girl . " But where are you going ? " she was asking him . " Are you heading right ? Are n't you taking us out to sea * " " You can hardly have the heart to blame me for taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you say so , if you fear the motion of the waves . But this will bring us round all right , and we 'll have a fine view of the sea . " " I 'm not afraid ; and it is-oh , is n't it too beautiful 1 " ejaculated the girl , as she caught her first full glimpse of the open ocean . Btit what Payson preferred to look at was the girl herself . She certainly had the art , whether a conscious or an unconscious one , of making pictures for the eyes to delight in . She wore to-day the hat with the famous veil about it  --  the veil he had grown to be fond of  --  and its blue gauze wound round her throat was the only touch of color about her . All the rest was white and pale yellow . Her clinging white draperies were gathered close about her feet and knees , outlining the perfect proportions . In one hand she held a large creamy yellow sun-shade , against whose round disk of pale gold the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of a mediæval saint with its aureole of glory . Just now the enthusiasm of her delight had kindled the flame of a beautiful moment of emotion  --  a flame that lit the face into a glow of ardor . And this girl . was no mediaeval saint , but a breathing woman with a supremely human charm . Was it any wonder that Payson felt as if he had entered some charmed land ? that merely to listen to the lapping and beating of the waves was to hear the voices of enchantment ? " But what is that ? " suddenly cried the young girl . " See ! look ! Can it be a cave ? " - pointing to an opening in the great wall of rock beneath which they were passing . They were under the shadow of the Porcupine Cliff . " It looks suspiciously like one ; " and Payson rowed his boat farther out into the sea to be safe from the treachery of the rocks . " Oh , do n't go out 1 " the girl pleaded ; " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird . Do go just near enough to see what it is . " " I 'll cheerfully row you to ChinBut , good heavens ! there goes my oar ! " As Payson had turned the boat to head in toward the opening , one of his oars , catching between two submerged rocks , had snapped in two . " We 're in a pretty fix now. ** " And it 's all my fault . I 'm so sor " " My God ! we 're being sucked in I " It was true . The great swelling force of the inrushing waters was hurrying their frail bark into the dark cavernous depth . They both had a terrifying sense of the day turning to night , of a vast yawning chasm , of a deafening swash of waters , when the girl suddenly felt herself seized . Clasping her in his arms , Payson had but time for a swift , vigorous spring  --  a spring which landed them on a projecting ledge of rock  --  and the next instant there was a crash , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand splintered bits . " Good heavens ! what an escape 1 " Payson muttered , with a kind of gasp . But neither of them could speak quite yet . It had all been so sudden , the sense of their danger , and the horrible fate from which they had been delivered , that they were stunned for the moment , nerveless and dazed . Payson was the first to recover himself . He was brought back to acute consciousness by the shivering of the girl beside him . " Are you hurt ? are you cold ? " he asked , eagerly . " No , I 'm not hurt ; but I believe I am cold . There seems to be water somewhere " - with a glance at her feet , over which the incoming waters were breaking every few moments . " Come , we must go up higher . Give me your hand " - as he helped her to scale the rocks above them . " This is better . I-I hope you 're not going to suffer for this , " with an anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frail being . I shall not catch cold . What I 'm wondering at is how we 're ever to get out , " recovering some of her natural buoyancy , with a comprehensive glance about the great , dark , dismal rocky chamber in which they found themselves . " The situation does look appalling , I 'll allow . " " I suppose there 's no chance of our climbing up that cliff ? " pointing to the great facade of rock behind them . " No , it would be impossible . There is n't a foot-hold anywhere , " replied Payson , who had already scanned that loophole of escape with the eye of a practiced Alpine climber . " Miss Wilder , there 's no use of holding out to you false hopes . We 're in a pretty serious plight . We ca n't get back by water , since our boat 's gone ; and we ca n't climb to the earth 's surface , for the rocks are simply unscalable . The only thing we can do is to wait for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one comes after us ? " " I do . And the probabilities are , we sha' n't be kept waiting long . Our party will soon find us missing , and will begin to look us up . Meanwhile , what can I do to make you comfortable ? " " Nothing , thanks . I 'm as comfortable as I feel a right to be-under the circumstances . " What a blessing it was she took it all so sensibly ! Payson shuddered to think what it would have been with a hysterical young woman on his hands . " If that 's the case , the proper thing for me to do is to make a tour of inspection . My objective point is a pile of drift-wood , my intentions a fire , Miss Wilder . " " That 's as it should be . We must see to it we do the correct shipwrecked thing . " " Yes , I should hate to feel afterward that we had missed anything . " His efforts were rewarded beyond his hopes . He returned with his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Wilder , the advantage of having as your fellow-comrade an experienced ancient mariner . The sea yields up its treasures to the wise . " I do n't wish to dampen your ardor , " returned the girl , demurely , " but have you such a thing as a match about you ? Otherwise- " That was an appalling contingency ; but some furious dives into Payson 's vest pocket produced-three . " And I usually am laden down with a bushel , " he groaned . " With good management , we 'll make those three do the work of a bushel , " encouragingly responded the girl . Wrapping two of them for safe-keeping in her handkerchief , Violet faced about , spreading her skirts wide out to protect her from the wind , and struck the remaining match so close to the dry drift-wood that at the first spark the little pile was in a blaze . " That was beautifully done . As a shipwrecked mariner you 're an enormous success , Miss Wilder . " She laughed , seating herself close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to attract the eye of our discoverer , " continued Payson , pointing to the thin wisp of smoke curling upward , which was making its way to heaven through an opening in the rocks just above them . " Seeing that , they 'll begin to suspect our whereabouts . At present life has but two duties  --  the feeding of this fire , and making things as endurable for you as you will let me . " But , indeed , the girl 's cheerfulness was robbing the situation of all its objectionable features . Payson , naturally , found the adventure full of a certain charm-as well , indeed , it might be , with so admira // bly pretty and brave a girl as his companion . She met his lively sallies more than half way . She forestalled him in his attempts to take a humorous view of the affair . With sportive grace she gayly descanted upon the merits of cave scenery , the beauties of rocky elevations , and soliloquized upon the fact of what a really comfortable time witches must have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark I " suddenly asked the girl . " Why , look ! the stars are out . " Payson took out his watch . " It 's nearly nine , by Jove ! " " And  --  and they 've never come for us . They've- Oh , Mr. Payson , " cried the girl , starting wildly to her feet , with a ring of distress in her voice , " do you suppose-What if we should have to pass the night here ? " Payson grasped the girl 's trembling hands , hoping to calm her . " My dear Miss Wilder , there is no such possibility . Pray sit down , and let 's be reasonable . Our friends , when we failed to appear , concluded we had turned back . They are expecting to meet us at the hotel . Failing to find us there , they 'll then begin their search . And that smoke , " pointing to the circling column , " will sufficiently proclaim our dilemma . Before midnight you 'll be sleeping quietly in your bed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , you must wrap this about you , " proceeding to divest himself of his Knickerbocker jacket . " Mr. Payson , I 'll do nothing of the kind . Do you take me for an inhuman ? " " I take you to be what you are , a perfectly reasonable young woman . You 're about to prove your reasonableness by doing as I say . " " I will never wear it , " insistently , with something of the defiant look he had seen on her face the first day . " But you will . And now , at once . I 'm used to being obeyed . " He spoke in a tone not to be made light of . She could see the determination flaming in his eye . " Oh , well , if it 's as bad as that . If it 's become a habit " - submitting gracefully then to his putting it about her , with a touch of mock submission in her voice . But she was not wholly insensible to his thoughtful act of self-denial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when was a woman ever known to be coldly indifferent to the exhibition of man 's heroism ? And so the night wore on . They talked and chatted , and drew closer to the slowly dying fire ; and soon there was no denying the stubborn fact that there was indeed every prospect of their spending the night in their grewsome surroundings . When this fate stared them full in the face , Miss Wilder bore the unwelcome prospect with astonishing composure . She grew quite calm , and showed , to Payson 's thought , a surprising pluck . She was the first to suggest they should harbor their fuel resources , and herself extinguished the fire . Later , she submitted very acquiescingly to Payson 's suggestion to rest her head on a little pillow he made for her of the dried sea-weed . After a little the soft and gentle breathing that came from her lips told him that she slept . It seemed to the man who watched over her as if some invisible power guarded her slumbers . As if Nature herself lent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Triton , mayhap , had with his conch bade the waves be still . For the sea lay like a sleeping lake at their feet , and some spirit of peace seemed to have entered into the air . The night grew warmer , and the wind and the waves made but a soft lullaby of sound . A few hours later , when the dawn broke , it brought beauty and calm and cheer . All the hideousness of the night was gone . In its place was the sparkle of bright waters and the golden shimmer of the breaking sunlight . With the first rays of that rosy light Miss Wilder stirred . What Payson dreaded was her first awakening , fearing she might feel some sudden alarm . But when she opened her eyes there was no terror in them ; only the beautiful bright light that comes to youth after the rest of a long sweet sleep . " Have I really been asleep ? And-oh , is it- Why , it 's morning I " turning a glowing face to the daylight . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Wilder . You make your debuts at the same moment . Are you rested ? Do you feel better ? " " I never felt better . I 'm beginning to believe I have missed my true sphere , " she gayly responded . " I should have been born a gnome . Caves seem to be my natural element . But ought n't we to light the fire ? " // " With your permission . You are keeper of the matches , you know . " In another instant the fire was lighted , and the smoke curling in great wreaths up through the opening . " How long do you suppose it will be before- Surely I hear voices . Look ! Out there ! Do n't you see something ? " cried Miss Wilder , in uncontrollable excitement , pointing to the mouth of the cave . The " something " proved to be some men in a boat . Their rescuers had come at last . A few moments later there were several heads peering down through the cleft in the rocks . And next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sending us a rope  --  but what for ? You ca n't possibly be hauled up in that way . You 'd be afraid . " " Oh no , I sha' n't be a bit afraid , " cried the girl , to whom rescue in any shape meant a Heaven-sent deliverance . There really seemed to be no other way , and it was not many seconds before the girl was fairly seated , holding on bravely to two long ropes , securely tied and girded in by extra ones . " I must tie you once more about the shoulders . And remember , Miss Wilder , do n't look down . Keep your eyes fixed above you at the sky through the opening , " was his parting injunction . All went well till she had nearly reached the top , when , to protect herself against the jagged rocks that projected from the sides of the cleft* the girl used her hands and feet , pushing herself away from them . One particularly vigorous push loosened one of the great heavy stones . It detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terrific velocity , through the great fissure . Horror-stricken , Violet looked down . It was falling directly upon the spot where Payson was standing . But Payson 's thought , as he saw it coming , was as swift as the rock itself Before the stone had touched the place where he stood he had flung himself into the sea . In a few seconds he had scrambled back upon the rocks again , dripping , but safe . Upon the rope 's being again lowered , he was soon standing once more upon terra ftima . His first inquiries of the men about him-men he had never seen before , fishermen apparently-was for Miss Wilder . They told him that upon the stone 's falling she had fainted . She was still un conscious when her uncle had carried her off in the boat , but otherwise she was unharmed . When Payson reached his room at the hotel , two hours after , he found himself staggering about the room . His legs seemed to be parting company with his body , and his head to belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement had worn him out . But a light repast and a long twelve-hour sleep were all the medicine he needed . He awoke to find he had never felt in a more robust Or sound condition . He could hardly wait to fling on his garments to learn how his companion had fared . As he passed down the stairway , from the manner in which the servant-women and waiters eyed him he concluded that the story of their adventure had already become public property . He was convinced of it when , stepping out upon the piazza , ladies stopped in their promenade and their gossip to stare him out of countenance . He knew then he was a doomed man . The thing had started into its nine days ' wonder of life . For himself he cared little ; the battle of the tongues might wage . But he divined that Miss Wilder might not find the situation quite pleasant . The next moment he found himself face to face with that young lady 's uncle . Mr. Wilder greeted him with an outstretched hand and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been looking everywhere for you . We 've been greatly concerned about you . You got off scotfree , hey ? Not a scratch or a bruise ? And you slept like a top , you say ? That 's fine-that 's glorious . Yes , yes . Violet 's coming round all right . A little upset , you know-cold and a bit of fever . But that 11 wear off-that 11 wear off . She 'll be all right in a day or so . Now , my dear sir , let me make you my deepest thanks for your kindness , and for the care you took of her . She has told us everything ; how you made her take your coat , and how you kept her courage up . You behaved like a man , sir , and here 's my hand on it , " giving Payson an elephantine grasp . He was evidently bent upon treating Payson with the tenderest consideration . At supper , Mrs. Wilder 's manner was equally cordial , if less effusive . She // even linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a turn on the piazza with him , that she might deliver a message from Violet  --  a message full of kindness and friendliness . Payson divined Mrs. Wilder had noticed the questioning of those hundred inquisitive eyes , and had known how best to answer them . Payson went to bed that night in a happy dream of expectancy , the dream of seeing Violet on the morrow . At his late breakfast he found two notes awaiting his perusal . As they bore no postmarks , he felt an ominous thrill of foreboding . The Wilders had left ; and the notes were notes of courteous , kindly , friendly farewell . Mr. Wilder explained their abrupt haste of departure by the fact of his being suddenly recalled to Boston on important business . And Miss Violet had written a line of gratitude , coupled with the assurance that she was quite herself , and perfectly well able to bear the journey . And that was all . And Payson was left with a great ache in his heart . He had counted so on seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the walks they would take , on the talks they would have . Now it was all at an end . Even the hope of seeing her again was as faint and shadowy as the making of the dream a reality . That day and the following one seemed to Payson the longest he had ever passed . The place was becoming detestable . The truth dawned upon him that he was being profoundly bored . There was nothing left to be seen , nothing to be done , except to leave , and that he should do at once . Awaiting the next morning the arrival of the boat , Payson strolled about the rocks . Involuntarily his steps turned toward the cliffs where he had been wont to catch his earlier glimpses of Miss Violet before he knew her . As he stood there , thinking of her , recalling just how she used to look , with her robes afloat , and her scarf floating to the breeze , like the pennant of some beautiful craft , with the rapt dream in her eyes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft rapture of content , Payson found the ache in his heart turn to a passionate thrill-a thrill that electrified every fibre of his being . Then he knew that he loved her , and that the thrill was the conscious awakening of a deep and ardent passion . He was willing now to confess to himself it had been so from the first , from the moment he had seen her . But that nascent liking had , during the long hours they had spent in the cave together , when he had had revealed to him the beautiful traits of her charming character , grown to a deeper feeling . He must see her now ; he must find her , even if he went to the uttermost parts of the earth to seek her . He would start upon the lover 's pilgrimage-the pilgrimage which leads to confession . The modern Athens has been , as a rule , more looked upon as the shrine of the Muses than as the abode of the tenderer goddess . But to Payson , Boston meant only Violet Wilder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a halo of glory . Upon his arrival it was easy enough to discover the mundane residence of his divinity , but a much more difficult one to discover her actual whereabouts . Inquiries at a large forbidding-looking mansion frbnting on the lovely Public Gardens resulted in nothing more satisfactory than the tantalizing information that the Wilders had just left Boston-for Manchester , the man-servant thought , but was not quite sure . The nearest Manchester was the one down by the sea , and Payson went there by the next train . Manchester-West Manchester-was a lovely bit of shore , close to the half-moon beach of which had been built a really capital hotel . Payson found the air of the place most delicious , and the tints along the shore reminded him of the Mediterranean . But he had not come to make discoveries either in air or in tints . He had come to seek for that which he feared he should never find . His seeking her here was indeed beginning to seem a most senseless bit of folly . How could he hope , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide piazza of the hotel in the dawning moonlight-how could he hope , when , behold ! what he hoped for stood before him . The god of love had guided his steps aright . At the farther end of the piazza a party of people were in the act of alighting from a carriage . And among them Payson 's quick eye  --  the lover 's eye-had discerned Miss Wilder . She detached herself from the party , and the next instant was coming toward him with a swift and hurried footstep . In her haste she had almost passed him by . But Payson moved toward her . // " Miss Wilder 1 " She started , stopped , and turned upon him an almost wildly startled glance . When she fully recognized him , she paled visibly , shaming the white roses that drooped at her belt . But she recovered herself on the instant . " Mr. Payson , do you drop from the clouds ? " holding out her hand of greeting . " Only when I follow in the wake of a shooting-star , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How good it seems to see you again ! When did you come ? " " I 've been here a week . Ever sinceever since leaving Bar Harbor . " She paled again . But Payson would not spare her . " Do n't you think your going away was just a trifle cruel ? - without giving a fellow a chance to see you or to say goodby ? How was I to know whether you were really well or not ? " " I am sorry if you thought it rude or unkind . But " - with a slight chilI in her voice- we were obliged to go . My uncle was needed at home . Shall you be here long ? I am at a friend 's cottage . I must go in now . But you will come and see me , perhaps , " giving him her address . For the next week he saw her every day . But for all the progress he made , he might as well have been the other side of the moon . She seemed determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided him . On the contrary , she was not only approachable , but kind , adorably kind . She let no opportunity pass to make him the recipient of some pleasant favor . But , in spite of it all , Payson was vividly conscious he was made also the victim of a hundred subtle artifices , all of which succeeded so admirably that never by any hap-hazard or chance did he succeed in finding himself alone with her . But one evening Payson 's patiencethe lover 's patience that knows how to wait-was rewarded . Going to the cottage , on the pretense of borrowing a book , he found Miss Wilder on the veranda , looking out upon the moon-lit sea . And she was alone , and there was no escape . The others had gone out to tea , she explained as she greeted him . Perhaps it was because his chance had come , but for the first few moments Payson felt his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth . Perhaps it was the moonlight , and the lapping of those waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " Miss Wilder-Miss violet , " at last Payson burst out , " tell me-tell me what it is that I have done-of what crime am I guilty ? " " Crime ? Are you out of your senses , Mr. Payson ? " " No , not yet ; but your manner is fast driving me out of them . Do you think it is nothing to me to know you avoid me all you can , that you put me away- " " Oh , Mr. Payson , " cried the girl , with a thrill of contrition in her voice , " I-I do n't do that . I only thought-I meant- " " And what I mean is this , " said Payson , the wave of emotion so swollen it must break at last : " I mean that I have found out something since you went away from Mount Desert . I have found out that I love you as a man only can love the woman who is the one woman in the world for him . And that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , and stood up , stretching out her hands before her , as if to put him and his words the farther away . " Oh , you must not-you must not say - say such things to me ! " " Why ? For Heaven 's sake tell me , is there any reason ? You are not- " But Payson 's voice broke there . He had no courage to confront the thought of her not being free . " You must not , because , " the girl went on , with a passionate , tortured ring in her tone- " because- Oh , ca n't you see the reason ? You say this because you feel you must . You think-you think people may have said- Your sense of honor impels you . " " Violet , what madness are you talking ? Sense of honor I " almost dazed at the joy there was in him . Then grasping the girl 's hands in his trembling palm , he held them to his breast . " Listen : can a mere sense of honor make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face Payson saw the light of his own great joy reflected . " Ah ! you believe-and , Violet , you will ? " For a moment she only looked at him , a deep , unutterable look of love , and held him still away from her as she pressed her hands against his breast . Then her answer was the droop of her beautiful head upon his shoulder .
