txt The reports for the year ltidO show a decided revival in steam-ship building in Great Britain . During that period there were 508 steam-ships launched , with an aggregate tonnage of more than 600,000 tons , and as this must have included quite a number of small vessels intended for coastwise and Continental trade , it is obvious  --  for the average size would be 1,200 tons  --  that a considerable number of large ocean steamers were constructed . This is perhaps the most conclusive reply that could be made to those in this country who have argued that the reason why Americans did not build and sail ocean steam-ships was because the business yielded no profit to the foreigners who were engaged in it . The prosperity of a trade can almost always be determined by the willingness of those engaged in it to risk fresh capital in its continuance , and estimated on this simple basis it is tolerably clear that in spite of the relatively low rates of freight , the English ship owners have contrived to make their business a paying one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Great Britain for the last year is largely in advance of the reported aggregate of construction there in any of several previous years , it must be assumed that the line of profit in a freight charter has been considerably reduced . In other words , an English steam-ship can now profitably compete in ocean voyages under conditions which would have proved ruinous to her owners no longer ago than 1874 or 1875 . It is apart from our purpose to state at the present time several of the reasons which could be given for this change , but what we do desire to do is to call attention to the very serious blow that this change threatens to inflict upon the remnant of our ocean merchant marine . It is well known that the American merchant fleet now in service is chiefly engaged in trades where it is commonly supp osed that steam-ships can not compete ; that is , in distant voyages , such as that to California and to and from the East Indies . For a number of years past these voyages have not been uniformly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted by intervening seasons of high rates of freight . For the purpose of illustration the California trade will serve as well as any . Since the Pacific Railroad came into active operation , the outward freights have rarely sufficed to do more than pay running expenses , and frequently have not done even that , while in 1877 , 1878 , and 1879 , the rates of freight from San Francisco to Europe were so low that the round voyage usually netted a loss to the shipowner . Last year the situation was changed , and the vessels that were fortunate enough to be on the Pacific coast were able to secure profitable engagements , and thus far this season the balance of advantage has been in favor of the ship-owner rather than the shipper of produce . But the point which we wish to suggest is , is it not probable that in a year or two more these advantageous conditions for sailing tonnage will no longer exist ? At the present time not a few American ship-owners are confident that freights to Europe from San Francisco will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season is over , and with this payment they count upon recovering the losses made in several previous bad seasons . But they do not seem to be aware of the temptation which freight rates of these proportions hold out to the owners of steam-ships . A steamer load of grain has never been carried from California to Europe ; but everything has its beginning , and there are those who are bold enough to believe . that , with the offer of ? 4 per ton for the round voyage , it would be possible to charter a steam-ship in England to go to San Francisco and load with grain for Europe . Even if such a venture may be a trifle premature , we may be sure it will not be so considered in the immediate future . A vessel so employed could carry from England all the coal she needed for the outward and homeward voyages . As she would not depend upon the trade winds , her course would be much shorter than that taken by sailing vessels , and premising that she could steam , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day , with a daily consumption of from 16 to 18 tons of coal , she need not be at sea on the round trip more than ninety days , and need not consume more than 1,400 tons of coal . Under the ordinary conditions of port charges and the wages and keep of crew , a freight of ? 4 per ton ought to net a large carrying steamer a very fair profit on such a venture , and we hazard little in making the prediction that the time is soon coming when steam-ship owners will be willing to enter on a charter of this kind for a considerably smaller payment . Now , while such a change may be of great service to the grain shippers of California , in preventing violent fluctuations in their freight market  --  for it would be with them an easy matter to telegraph for all the steam transports they needed ? it would seriously interfere with the success of the owners of American sailing vessels . As we said above , they now depend on these exceptional years to make their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind comes around the profit were to be absorbed - by the owners of steam-ships , they would clearly , have no solid ground upon which to stand . There is an indefinite possible economy in running steamships . but with our sailing vessels the margin of economy  --  aside from governmental exactions ? can soon be reached , and nothing further in that direction can be hoped for under the present system . It is in anticipation of these forced changes that quite a number of those who have for years past been interested in American merchant shipping have taken the only path open to them if they desire to continue their connection with the shipping business ; that is , they have invested their money in English steam-ships . Several of the 508 steamers built last year in Great Britain were largely paid for by American capital , And quite a number more that arc to be built this year will owe their construction to contributions from the same source . This is one way of overcoming the difficulties which existing laws impose upon our ship merchants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate way ; but looked at from a national stand-point , it is a method that reflects very little credit on the commercial policy of our country .
