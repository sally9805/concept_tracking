txt The quarrel in the ranks of the Knights of Labor which has led to the expulsion of District Assembly No. 126 ( the carpet weavers ) and to the boycotting of E. S. HIGGI/sTS &; Co. ' s carpets is an old one , and . its history , like that of the contest with the cigarmakers , shows that the order has fallen into the hands of an ambitious , tyrannical , and short-sighted clique whose policy is destroying it and . at the same time building up the new order known as the Federation of Labor . In waging war upon the 4,000 Knights in this city who were cigarmakers District Assembly No. 49 , or the members of the Home Club who rule it , were moved . by a determination to suppress a trades union , for these cigarmakers maintained such a union and were at the same time Knights . The cigarmakers were driven into the streets and for some weeks were deprived of work . But in the end they were victorious and . Mr. POWDERLY/S order lost these thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the order , although Mr. POWDERLY had . declared that the Knights did not " stand as a menace to the trades unions , " and had said . in his annual address , after the termination of the contest , " I respect the man who , being a member of a trades union , does everything honorable to defend and perpetuate his organization . " Since that time the power that dominated District Assembly No. 49 has gained control of the order 's central government and of Mr. POWDERLY himself . The war against District AssemblyNo. 126 is now carried on , not for the purpose of suppressing a trades union  --  for the carpet weavers do not maintain one , but have been content to be Knights of Labor  --  but to break down an assembly whose leaders are not in sympathy with the ruling power , otherwise known as the Home Club . The present leaders of the order prefer a small body which shall be subservient to their wishes and ambitions rather than a larger one organized upon the original plan of POWDERLY and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 was a member of the Home Club before it took on the characteristics of a tyrannical ring . The development of its policy caused him to go out of it and to devote his energies to the interests of the carpet weavers , over whose assembly he presides . He has never been forgiven for vigorously protesting against the methods of his former associates . Inasmuch as about 2 per cent . of HIGGLYS &; Co. ' s employees have been members of District Assembly No. 49 , while the remaining workmen belong to District Assembly No. 126 , the power which rules the firstnamed assembly and . directs the central machinery of the entire order has been able to make a great deal of trouble in the company 's factory . The carpet weavers have been punished repeatedly because they and their leaders have seemed to stand . in the way of the ring . Although the firm has conducted its business in a manner satisfactory to tho Knights , it has not been able to reconcile the warring factions . Now it must suffer the penalty of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no fault of its own , but simply because the dominant ring desires to crush District Assembly No. 126 and deprive its members of work . " The factory , " says Master Workman MoRRISON , of District Assembly No. 126 , " is the best union factory in the United . States , and the hands are treated fairly . " Nevertheless it has been boycotted . Since the unsuccessful attack upon the cigarmakers the order has taken no action showing more clearly than does this boycott the suicidal policy which the ring has thrust upon it . Its course has been unsparingly condemned by a part of the labor press , by the Central Labor Union of this city , by several prominent labor organizations , and by all just men who are acquainted with the facts . As for the carpet weavers , they will doubtless join the Federation of Labor , following the example of so many other organizations that are not willing to submit to the clique that has been allowed to rule the Knights and . their chief . The Federation 's policy appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted . their ambition to run away with their sense . Unless the order of Knights shall soon throw off the incubus that is crushing the life out of it , and . shall substitute in its management brains in the place of blind ambition that holds the satisfaction of ' grudges above the welfare of the organization , it will become a wreck .
