txt Collector MAGONE has taken a step which is likely to have very important consequences for the Customs Service at this port and for the business community . He has selected a board of three members , two of whom are connected with the Custom House and one of whom is a special agent of the Treasury , to make a thorough examination of every part of the Collector 's office with reference both to the capacity and efficiency of the persons employed and to the methods of doing business . Of the gentlemen selected Mr. TINGLE entered the service of the Treasury nearly twenty years ago , and for the past fourteen years has been a " special agent , " and . has acquired an excellent reputation as an expert in all matters connected with the Customs Service . His character is high . Mr. COMSTOCK is the auditor of the Naval Office . He has been more than twentyftve years in the service , and is acknowledged to have no superior in integrity and knowledge , while he has been the most active man connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to all the details of this work he is an acknowledged authority . Mr. MASON is a young man who has only recently entered the service , but has shown ability and integrity that justify his selection . He is now a member of the Examining Board .

But there is a wide field outside the scope of the law which it is impossible for him to inspect personally . This embraces the entire personnel of the service already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger part , is made up of fairly good men , with a number of very excellent ones , nor is the excellence confined to those who have been brought in under the reform rules . The peculiarity of Americans is that they usually , when required or even permitted to do so , perform their work better than the system by which they may be selected would lead one to suppose that they would . But there is a certain number of unfit men in the service and another number who might do a great deal more and much better work if they were guided by simpler.and more suitable methods . A careful and impartial investigation by such a board as Mr. MAGONE has selected would put it in his power to weed out the incompe- tent persons and to revise the general regula. tions of the service in such way as to secure the best work from all . engaged in it . Mr. MAGONE has taken hold of his office in t. manner very promising of good results , and the appointment of this commission show : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistently .
