4 DURING the winter-time there is ordinarily but little work done among the cattle . There is some line riding , and a continual lookout is kept for the very weak animals ; but most of the stock are left to shift for themselves , undisturbed . Almost every stock-grower s - , - association forAN ARIZONA TYPE . bids branding any calves before the spring round*up . If great bands of cattle wander off the range , parties may he fitted out to go after them and bring them back ; but this is only done when absolutely necessary , as when the drift of the cattle has been towards Louise Vickroy Boyd . an Indian reservation or a settled granger country , for the weather is very severe , and the horses are so poor that their food must be carried along . The bulk of the work is done during the summer , including the late spring and early fall , and consists mainly in a succession of round-ups , beginning , with us , in May and ending towards the last of October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one s range . Frequently , too , herding will be practiced on a large scale . Still more important is the " trail* ' work ; cattle , while driven from one range to another , or to a shipping point for beef , being said to be " on the trail . " For years , the over-supply from the vast breeding ranches to the south , especially in Texas , has been driven northward in large herds , either to the shipping towns along the great railroads , or else to the fattening ranges of the North-west ; it having been found , so far , that while the calf crop is larger in the South , beeves become much heavier in the North . Such cattle , for the most part , went along tolerably well-marked routes or trails , which became for the time // being of great importance , flourishing - and extremely lawless - towns growing up along them ; but with the growth of the railroad system , and above all with the filling-up of the northern ranges , these trails have steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still travel them on their way to the already crowded ranges of western Dakota and Montana , or to the Canadian regions beyond . The trail work is something by itself . The herds may be on the trail several months , averaging fifteen miles or less a a day . The cowboys accompanying each have to undergo much hard toil , of a peculiarly same and wearisome kind , on account of the extreme slowness with which everything must be done , as trail cattle should never be hurried . The foreman of a trail outfit must be not only a veteran cowhand , but also a miracle of patience and resolution . Round-up work is far less irksome , there being an immense amount of dash and excitement connected with it ; and when once the cattle are on the range , the important work is done during the round-up . On cow ranches , or wherever there is breeding stock , the spring round-up is the great event of the season , as it is then that the bulk of the calves are branded . It usually lasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means implies rest for the stockman . On the contrary , as soon as it is over , wagons are sent to work out-ofthe-way parts of the country that have been passed over , but where cattle are supposed to have drifted ; and by the time these have come back the first beef round-up has begun , and thereafter beeves are steadily gathered and shipped , at least from among the larger herds , until cold weather sets in ; and in the fall there is another round-up , to brand the late calves and see that the stock is got back on the range . As all of these round-ups are of one character , a description of the most important , taking place in the spring , will be enough . In April we begin to get up the horses . Throughout the winter very few have been kept for use , as they are then poor and weak , and must be given grain and hay if they are to be worked . The men in the line camps need two or three apiece , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the rest are left out to shift for themselves , which the tough , hardy little fellows are well able to do . Ponies can pick up a living where cattle die ; though the scanty feed , which they may have to uncover by pawing off the snow , and the bitter weather often make them look very gaunt by spring-time . But the first warm rains bring up the green grass , and then all the live-stock gain flesh with wonderful rapidity . When the spring round-up begins the horses should be as fat and sleek as possible . After running all winter free , even the most sober pony is apt to betray an inclination to buck ; and , if possible , we like to ride every animal once or twice before we begin to do real work with him . Animals that have escaped for any length of time are almost as bad to handle as if they had never been broken . One of the two horses mentioned in a preceding article as having been gone eighteen months has , since his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the incessant and eruptive energy with which he bucks . Many of our horses , by the way , are thus named from some feat or peculiarity . Wire Fence , when being broken , ran into one of the abominations after which he is now called ; Hackamore once got away and remained out for three weeks with a hackamore , or breakinghalter , on him ; Macaulay contracted the habit of regularly getting rid of the huge Scotchman to whom he was intrusted ; Bulberry Johnny spent the hour or two after he was first mounted in a large patch of thorny bulberry bushes , his distracted rider unable to get him to do anything but move round sidewise in a circle ; Fall Back would never get to the front ; Water Skip always jumps mud-puddles ; and there are a dozen others with names as purely descriptive . The stock-growers of Montana , of the western part of Dakota , and even of portions of extreme northern Wyoming ,  --  that is , of all the grazing lands lying in the basin of the Upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Montana Stock-growers ' Association . Among the countless benefits they have derived from this course , not the least has been the way in which the various round-ups work in with and supplement one another . At the spring meeting of the association , the entire territory mentioned above , including perhaps a hundred thousand square miles , is mapped out into round-up districts , which generally are changed but slightly from year to year , and the times and places for the round-ups to begin refixed so that those of adjacent districts may be run with a view to the best interests of all . Thus the stockmen along the Yellowstone have one round-up ; we along the Little Missouri have another ; and the country lying between , through which the Big Beaver flows , is almost equally important to both . Accordingly , one spring , the Little Missouri round-up , beginning May 25 and working down-stream , was timed so as to reach the mouth of the Big Beaver about June i , the Yellowstone round-up beginning at that date and place . Both then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yellowstone men turned to the west // and we bent back to our own river ; thus the bulk of the strayed cattle of each were brought back to their respective ranges . Our own round-up district covers the Big and Little Beaver creeks , which rise near each other , but empty into the Little Missouri nearly a hundred and fifty miles apart , and so much of the latter river as lies between their mouths . The captain or foreman of the round-up , upon whom very much of its efficiency and success depends , is chosen beforehand . He is , of course , an expert cowman , thoroughly acquainted with the country ; and he must also be able to command and to keep control of the wild rough-riders he has under him - a feat needing both tact and firmness . At the appointed day all meet at the place from which the round-up is to start . Each ranch , of course , has most work to be done in its own round-up district , but it is also necessary to have representatives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen cowboys , or over , in the home district , and yet have nearly as many more representing its interest in the various ones adjoining . Smaller outfits generally club together to run a xvagon and send outside representatives , or else go along with their stronger neighbors , they paying part of the expenses . A large outfit , with a herd of twenty thousand cattle or more , can , if necessary , run a round-up entirely by itself and is able to act independently of outside help ; it is therefore at a great advantage compared with those that can take no step effectively without their neighbors ' consent and assistance . If the starting-point is some distance off it may be necessary to leave home three or four days in advance . Before this we have got everything in readiness ; have overhauled the wagons , shod any horse whose fore feet are tender , - as a rule , all our ponies go barefooted , - and left things in order at the ranch . Our outfit may be taken as a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon to carry the bedding and the food ; in its rear a mess*chest is rigged to hold the knives , forks , cans , etc . All our four team-horses are strong , willing animals , though of no great size , being originally just " broncos , " or unbroken native horses , like the others . The teamster is also cook a man who is a really first-rate hand at both driving and cooking - and our present teamster is both - can always command his price . Besides our own men , some cowboys from neighboring ranches and two or three representatives from other round-up districts are always along , and we generally have at least a dozen " riders , " as they are termed ,  --  that is , cowboys , or " cow punchers , " who do the actual cattle-work ,  - -  with the wagon . Each of these has a string of eight or ten ponies ; and to take charge of the saddle-band , thus consisting of a hundred odd head , there are two herders , always known as * one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be two wagons , one to carry the bedding and one the food , known , respectively , as the bed and the mess wagon ; but this is not usual . While traveling to the meeting-point the pace is always slow , as it is an object to bring the horses on the ground as fresh as possible . Accordingly , we keep at a walk almost all day , and the riders , having nothing else to do , assist the wranglers in driving the saddle-band , three or four going in front , and others on the side , so that the horses shall keep on a walk . There is always some trouble with the animals at the starting out , as they are very fresh and are restive under the saddle . The herd is likely to stampede , and any beast that is frisky or vicious is sure to show its worst side . To do really effective cow-work a pony should be well broken ; but many even of the old ones have vicious traits , and almost every man will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broncos , hardly broken at all . In consequence , very many of my horses have to this day traits not calculated to set a timid or a clumsy rider at his ease . One or two run away and can not be held by even the strongest bit ; others can hardly be bridled or saddled until they have been thrown ; two or three have a tendency to fall over backward ; and half of them buck more or less , some so hard that only an expert can sit them . In riding these wild , vicious horses , and in careering over such very bad ground , especially at night , accidents are always occurring . A man who is merely an ordinary rider is certain to have a pretty hard time . On my first round-up I had a string of nine horses , four of them broncos , only broken to the extent of having each been saddled once or twice . One of them it was an impossibility to bridle or to saddle single-handed ; it was very difficult to get on or off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved his hands or feet ; but he had no bad tricks . The second soon became perfectly quiet . The third turned out to be one of the worst buckers on the ranch : once , when he bucked me off , I managed to fall on a stone and broke a rib . The fourth had a still worse habit , for he would balk and then throw himself over backward : once , when I was not quick enough , he caught me and broke something in the point of my shoulder , so that it was some weeks before I could raise the arm freely . My hurts were far from serious , and did not interfere with my riding and working // qwq // designate some foreman to take charge of the work and let him parcel it out among his men to suit himself . The captain of the round-up or the foreman of a wagon may himself be a ranchman ; if such is not the case , and the ranchman nevertheless comes along , he works and fares precisely as do the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little knot , planning out the work , the others are dispersed over the plain in every direction , racing , breaking rough horses , or simply larking with one another . If a man has an especially bad horse , he usually takes such an opportunity , when he has plenty of time , to ride him ; and while saddling he is surrounded by a crowd of most unsympathetic associates who greet with uproarious mirth any misadventure . A may reserve all his energies for the rider . In the last case , the man , keeping tight hold with his left hand of the cheek-strap , so as to prevent the horse from getting his head down until he is fairly seated , swings himself quickly into the saddle . Up rises the bronco 's back into an arch ; his head , the ears laid straight back , goes down between his fore feet , and , squealing savagely , he makes a succession of rapid , stiff-legged , jarring bounds . Sometimes he is a " plunging " bucker , who runs forward all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , or " sunfish , " - that is , bring first one shoulder down almost to the ground and then the other ,  --  or else he may change ends while in the air . A first-class rider will sit throughout it all without moving from the sad- man on a bucking horse is always considered fair game , every squeal and jump of the bronco being hailed with cheers of delighted irony for the rider and shouts to " stay with him . " The antics of a vicious bronco show infinite variety of detail , but are all modeled on one general plan . When the rope settles round his neck the fight begins , and it is only after much plunging and snorting that a twist is taken over his nose , or else a hackamore - a snecies of severe halter , usually made of plaited hairslipped on his head . While being bridled he strikes viciously with his fore feet , and perhaps has to be blindfolded or thrown down ; and to get the saddle on him is quite as difficult . When saddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucking under the saddle , or dle , quirting * his horse all the time , though his hat may be jarred off his head and his revolver out of its sheath . After a few jumps , however , the average man grasps hold of the horn of the saddle - the delighted onlookers meanwhile earnestly advising him not to " go to leather " - and is contented to get through the affair in any shape provided he can escape without being thrown off . An accident is of necessity borne with a broad grin , as any attempt to resent the raillery of the bystanders - which is perfectly good-humored - would be apt to result disastrously . Cowboys are certainly extremely good riders . As a class they Quirt is the name of the short flexible riding-whip used throughout cowboy land . The term is a Spanish one .

Of course , they would at first be at a disadvantage in steeple-chasing or fox-hunting , but their average of horsemanship is without doubt higher than that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy would learn to ride across country in a quarter of the time it would take a crosscountry rider to learn to handle a vicious bronco or to do good cow-work round and in a herd . On such a day , when there is no regular work , there xx-ill often also be horse-races , as each outfit is pretty sure to have some running pony which it believes can outpace any other . These contests are always short-distance dashes , for but a few hundred yards . Horse-racing is a mania with most plainsmen , white or red . A man with a good racing pony will travel all about with it , often winning large sums , visiting alike cow ranches , frontier towns , and Indian encampments . Sometimes the race is pony against pony , ' ' the victor taking both steeds . In racing the men ride bareback , as there are hardly any light saddles in the cow country . There will be intense excitement and very heavy betting over a race between two well-known horses , together with a good chance of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oft3n race against each other as well as among themselves . I have seen several such contests , and in every case but one the white man happened to win . A race is usually run between two thick rows of spectators , on foot and on'horseback , and as the racers pass , these rows close in behind them , every man yelling and shouting with all the strength of his lungs , and all waving their hats and cloaks to encourage the contestants , or firing off their revolvers and saddle guns . The little horses are fairlymaddened , as is natural enough , and run as if they were crazy : were the distances longer , some would be sure to drop in their tracks . Besides the horse-races , which are , of course , the main attraction , the men at a round-up will often get up wrestling matches or footraces . In fact , every one feels that he is off for a holiday ; for after the monotony of a long winter , the cowboys look forward eagerly to the round-up , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and varied , and treated a good deal as a frolic . There is no eight-hour law in cowboy land : during round-up time we often count ourselves lucky if we get off with much less than sixteen hours ; but the work is done in the saddle , and the men are spurred on all the time by the desire to outdo one another in feats of daring and skillful horsemanship . There is very little quarreling or fighting ; and though the fun often takes the form of rather rough horse-play , yet the practice of carrying dangerous weapons makes cowboys show far more rough courtesy to each other and far less rudeness to strangers than is the case among , for instance , Eastern miners , or even lumbermen . When a quarrel may very probably result fatally , a man thinks twice before going into it : warlike people or classes always treat one another with a certain amount of consideration and politeness . The moral tone of a cow-camp , indeed , is rather high than otherwise . Meanness , cowardice , and dishonesty are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping one 's word , intense contempt for any kind of hypocrisy , and a hearty dislike for a man who shirks his work . Many of the men gamble and drink , but many do neither ; and the conversation is not worse than in most bodies composed wholly of male human beings . A cowboy will not submit tamely to an insult , and is very ready to avenge his own wrongs ; nor has be an overwrought fear of shedding blood . He possesses , in fact , few of the emasculated , milkand-water moralities admired by the pseudophilanthropists ; but he does possess , to a very high degree , the stern , manly qualities that are so valuable to a nation . The method of work is simple . The messwagons and loose horses , after breaking damp in the morning , move on in a straight line for some few miles , going into camp again before midday ; and the day herd , consisting of all the cattle that have been found far off their range , and which are to be brought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather , follows on afterwards . Meanwhile the cowboys scatter out and drive in all the cattle from the country round about , going perhaps ten or fifteen miles back from the line of march , and meeting at the place where camp has already been pitched . The wagons always keep some little distance from one another , and the saddle-bands do the same , so that the horses may not get mixed . It is rather picturesque to see the four-horse teams filing down at a trot through a pass among the buttes  --  the saddle-bands being driven along at a smart pace to one side or behind , the teamsters cracking their whips , and the horsewranglers calling and shouting as they ride rapidly from side to side behind the horses , urging on the stragglers by dexterous touches with the knotted ends of their long lariats that are left trailing from the saddle . The country driven over is very rough , and it is often necessary to double up teams and put on eight horses to each wagon in going up an unusually steep pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river crossing where there is quicksand . The speed and thoroughness with which a // country can be worked depends , of course , very largely upon the number of riders . Ours is probably about an average round-up as regards size . The last spring I was out , there were half a dozen wagons along ; the saddlebands numbered about a hundred each ; and the morning we started , sixty men in the saddle splashed across the shallow ford of the river that divided the plain where we had camped from the valley of the long winding creek up which we were first to work . In the morning , the cook is preparing breakfast long before the first glimmer of dawn . As soon as it is ready , probably about 3 o'clock , he utters a long-drawn shout , and all the sleepers feel it is time to be up on the instant , for they know there can be no such thing as delay on the round-up , under penalty of being set afoot . Accordingly , they bundle out , rubbing their eycs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if they have taken the latter off ,  --  roll up and cord their bedding , and usually without any attempt at washing crowd over to the little smoldering fire , which is placed in a hole dug in the ground , so that there may be no risk of its spreading . The men are rarely very hungry at breakfast , and it is a meal that has to be eaten in shortest order , so it is perhaps the least important . Each man , as he comes up , grasps a tin cup and plate from the mess-box , pours out his tea or coffee , with sugar , but of course no milk , helps himself to one or two of the biscuits that have been baked in a I ) utch oven , and perhaps also to a slice of the fat pork swimming in the grease of the frying-pan , ladles himself out some beans , if there are any , and squats down on the ground to eat his breakfast . The meal is not an elaborate one ; nevertheless a man will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the foreman sing out , " Come , boys , catch your horses " ; when he must drop everything and run out to the wagon with his lariat . The night wrangler is now bringing in the saddle-band , which he has been up all night guarding . A rope corral is rigged up by stretching a rope from each wheel of one side of the wagon , making a V-shaped space , into which the saddle-horses are driven . Certain men stand around to keep them inside , while the others catch the horses : many outfits have one man to do all the roping . As soon as each // has caught his horse - usually a strong , tough animal , the small , quick ponies being reserved for the work round the herd in the afternoon - the band , now in charge of the day wrangler , is turned loose , and every one saddles up as fast as possible . It still lacks some time of being sunrise , and the air has in it the peculiar chill of the early morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dancing about , the riders from the different wagons all assemble at the one where the captain is sitting , already mounted . He waits a very shQrt time - for laggards receive but scant mercy - before announcing the proposed camping-place and parceling out the work among those present . If , as is usually the case , the line of march is along a river or creek , he appoints some man to take a dozen others and drive down ( or up ) it ahead of the day herd , so that the latter will not have to travel through other cattle ; the day herd Meanwhile the two bands , a score of riders in each , separate and make their way in opposite directions . The leader of each tries to get such a " scatter " on his men that they will cover completely all the land gone over . This morning work is called circle riding , and is peculiarly hard in the Bad Lands on account of the remarkably broken , rugged nature of the country . The men come in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fan were curved . As the band goes out , the leader from time to time detaches one or two men to ride down through certain sections of the country , making the shorter , or what are called inside , circles , while he keeps on ; and finally , retaining as companions the two or three whose horses are toughest , makes the longest or outside circle himself , going clear back to the divide , or whatever the point may be that marks the limit of the round-up work , and then turning and working straight to the meet- itself being driven and guarded by a dozen men detached for that purpose . The rest of the riders are divided into two bands , placed under men who know the country , and start out , one on each side , to bring in every head for fifteen miles back . The captain then himself rides down to the new camping-place , so as to be there as soon as any cattle are brought in. ing-place . Each man , of course , brings in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift rides in the glorious spring mornings are not soon to be forgotten .

As we climb the steep sides of the first range of buttes , wisps of wavering mist still cling in the hollows of the valley ; when we come out on the top of the first great plateau , the sun flames up over its edge , and in the level , red beams the galloping horsemen throw long fantastic shadows .

When the men on the outside circle have reached the bound set them , - whether it is a low divide , a group of jagged hills , the edge of the rolling , limitless prairie , or the long , waste reaches of alkali and sage brush ,  --  they turn their horses ' heads and begin to work down the branches of the creeks , one or two riding down the bottom , while the others keep off to the right and the left , a little ahead and fairly high up on the side hills , so as to command as much of a view as possible . On the level or rolling prairies the cattle can be seen a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to drive them ; but in the Bad Lands stand the work well . The course out lies across great grassy plateaus , along knife-like ridge crests , among winding valleys and ravines , and over acres of barren , sun-scorched buttes , that look grimly grotesque and forbidding , while in the Bad Lands the riders unhesitatingly go down and over places where it seems impossible that a horse should even stand . The line of horsemen will quarter down the side of a butte , where every pony has to drop from ledge to ledge like a goat , and will go over the shoulder of a soapstone cliff , when wet and slippery , with a series of plunges and scrambles which if unsuccessful would land horses and riders in the bottom of the cationlike washout below . In descending a clay butte after a rain , the pony will put all four feet together and slide down to the bottom almost or quite on his haunches .

All the cattle are carried on ahead down the creek ; and it is curious to watch the different behavior of the different breeds . A cowboy riding off to one side of the creek , and seeing a number of long-horned Texans grazing in the branches of a set of coul6es , has merely to ride across the upper ends of these , uttering the drawn-out " ei-koh-h-h , " so familiar to the cattle-men , and the long-horns will stop grazing , stare fixedly at him , and then , wheeling , strike off down the coul*es at a trot , tails in air , to be carried along by the center riders when they reach the main creek into which the coul4es lead . Our own range cattle are not so wild , but nevertheless are easy to drive ; while Eastern-raised beasts have little fear of a horseman , and merely stare stupidly // THE 1W UA7D- UP at him until he rides directly towards them .

As soon as the riders are in , they disperse to their respective wagons to get dinner and change horses , leaving the cattle to be held by one or two of their number . If only a small number of cattle have been gathered , they will all be run into one herd ; if there are many of them , however , the different herds will be held separate . A plain where a round-up is taking place offers a pictures ( lue sight . I well remember one such . It was on a level bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an almost semicircular sweep . The bottom was in shape a long oval , hemmed in by an unbroken line of steep bluffs so that it looked like an amphitheater . Across the faces of the dazzling white cliffs there were sharp bands of black and red , drawn by the coal seams and the layers of burned clay : the leaves of the trees and the grass had the vivid green of spring-time . The wagons were camped among the cottonwood trees fringing the river , a thin column of smoke rising up from beside each . The horses were grazing round the outskirts , those of each wagon by themselves and kept from going // too near the others by their watchful guard . In the great circular corral , towards one end , the men were already branding calves , while the whole middle of the bottom was covered with lowing herds of cattle and shouting , galloping cowboys . Apparently there was nothing but dust , noise , and confusion ; but in reality the work was proceeding all the while with the utmost rapidity and certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last circle riders have come in and have snatched a few hasty mouthfuls to serve as their midday meal , we begin to work the herd - or herds , if the one herd would be of too unwieldy size . The animals are held in a compact bunch , most of the riders forming a ring outside , while a couple from each ranch successively look the herds through and cut out those marked with their own brand . It is difficult , in such a mass of moving beasts ,  --  for they do not stay still , but keep weaving in and out among each other ,  --  to find all of one 's own animals : a man must have natural gifts , as well as great experience , before he becomes a good brandreader and is able to really " clean up a herd " - that is , be sure he has left nothing of his own iii it .

Such an one enters thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , and finds out immediately the animal his master is after ; he will then follow it closely of his own accord through every wheel and double , at top speed . When looking through the herd , it is necessary to move slowly ; and when any animal is found it is taken to the outskirts at a walk , so as not to alarm the others . Once at the outside , however , the cowboy has to ride like lightning ; for as soon as the beast he is after finds itself separated from its companions it endeavors to break back among them , and a young , range-raised steer or heifer runs like a deer . In cutting out a cow and a calf two men have to work together . As the animals of a brand are cut out they are received and held apart by some rider detailed for the purpose , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the men holding the herd have their hands full , for some animal is continually trying to break out , when the nearest man flies at it at once and after a smart chase brings it back to its fellows .

Then the riders surround the next herd , the men holding cuts move them up near it , and the work is begun anew . If it is necessary to throw an animal , either to examine a brand or for any other reason , half a dozen men will have their ropes down at once ; and then it is spur and quirt in BRANDING A HORSE . // the rivalry to see which can outdo the other until the beast is roped and thrown .

Usually , however , one man ropes the animal by the bead and another at the same time gets the loop of his lariat over one or both its hind legs , when it is twisted over and stretched out in a second . In following an animal on horseback the man keeps steadily swinging the rope round his head , by a dexterous motion of the xvrist only , until he gets a chance to throw it ; when on foot , especially if catching horses in a corral , the loop is allowed to drag loosely on the ground . A good roper will hurl out the coil with marvelous accuracy and force ; it fairly whistles through the air , and settles round the object with almost infallible certainty .

If on the drive , such a beast usually is simply dropped out ; but if they have time , nothing delights the cowboys more than an encounter of this sort , and the charging brute is roped and tied down in short order . Often such a one will make a very vicious fight , and is most dangerous . Once a fighting cow kept several of us busy for nearly an hour ; she gored two ponies , one of them , which was , luckily , hurt but slightly , being my own pet cutting horse . If a steer is hauled out of a mudhole , its first act is Psually to charge the rescuer . As soon as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXXV. - 1I7. the animals that are to be driven along have been put in the day herd , attention is turned to the cows and calves , which are already gathered in different bands , consisting each of all the cows of a certain brand and all the calves that are following them . If there is a corral , each band is in turn driven into it ; if there is none , a ring of riders does duty in its place . A fire is built , the irons heated , and a dozen men dismount to , as it is called , " wrestle " the calves . The best two ropers go in on their horses to catch the latter ; one man keeps tally , a couple put on the brands , and the others seize , throw , and hold the little unfortunates . A first-class roper invariably catches the calf by both hind feet , and then , having taken a twist with his lariat round the horn of the saddle , drags the bawling little creature , extended at full length , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make a struggle . A less skillful roper catches round the neck , and then , if.the calf is a large one , the man who seizes it has his hands full , as the bleating , bucking animal develops astonishing strength , cuts the wildest capers , and resists frantically and with all its power . If there are seventy or eighty calves in a corral , the scene is one of the greatest confusion . The ropers , spurring and checking the fierce little horses , drag the calves up so quickly that a dozen men can hardly hold them ; the men with the irons , blackened with soot , run to and fro ; the calf-wrestlers , grimy with blood , dust , and sweat , work like beavers ; while with // the voice of a stentor the tally-man shouts out the number and sex of each calf . The dust rises in clouds , and the shouts , cheers , curses , and laughter of the men unite with the lowing of the cows and the frantic bleating of the roped calves to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns vicious and puts every one out of the corral . Or a maverick bull ,  --  that is , an unbranded bull ,  --  a yearling or a two-years-old , is caught , thrown , and branded ; when he is let up , there is sure to be a fine scatter . Down goes his head , and he bolts at the nearest man , who makes out of the way at top speed , amidst roars of laughter from all of his companions ; while the men holding down calves swear savagely as they dodge charging mavericks , trampling horses , and taut lariats with frantic , plunging little beasts at the farther ends . Every morning certain riders are detached to drive and to guard the day herd , which is most monotonous work , the men being on from 4 in the morning till 8 in the evening , the only rest coming at dinner-time , when they change horses . When the herd has reached the camping-ground there is nothing to do but to loll listlessly over the saddle-bow in the blazing sun , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not spread out too much . Plodding slowly along on the trail through the columns of dust stirred up by the hoofs is not much better . Cattle travel best and fastest strung out in long lines ; the swiftest taking the lead in single file , while the weak and the lazy , the young calves and the poor cows , crowd together in the rear . Two men travel along with the leaders , one on each side , to point them in. the right direction ; one or two others keep by the flanks , and the rest are in the rear to act as " drag-drivers " and hurry up the phalanx of reluctant weaklings . If the foremost of the string travels too fast , one rider will go along on the trail a few rods ahead , and thus keep them back so that those in the rear will not be left behind . Generally all this is very tame and irksome ; but by fits and starts there will be little flurries of excitement . Two or three of the circle riders may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cattle , which at once start for the day herd , and then there will be a few minutes ' furious riding hither and thither to keep them out . Or the cattle may begin to run , and then get " milling " - that is , all crowd together into a mass like a ball , wherein they move round and round , trying to keep their heads towards the center , and refusing to leave it . The only way to start them is to force one 's horse in among them and cut out some of their number , which then begin to travel off by themselves , when the others will probably follow . But in spite of occasional incidents of this kind , day-herding has a dreary sameness about it that makes the men dislike and seek to avoid it . From 8 in the evening till * in the morning the day herd becomes a night herd . Each wagon in succession undertakes to guard it for a night , dividing the time into watches of two hours apiece , a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious ; but at times it is accompanied by intense excitement and danger , when the cattle become stampeded , whether by storm or otherwise . The first and the last watches are those chosen by preference ; the others are disagreeable , the men having to turn out cold and sleepy , in the pitchy darkness , the two hours of chilly wakefulness completely breaking the night 's rest . The first guards have to bed the cattle down , though the day-herders often do this themselves : it simply consists in hemming them into as small a space as possible , and then riding round them until they lie down and fall asleep . Often , especially at first , this takes some time - the beasts will keep rising and lying down again . When at last most become quiet , some perverse brute of a steer will deliberately hook them all up ; they keep moving in and out among one another , and long strings of animals suddenly start out from the herd at a stretching walk , and are turned back by the nearest cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally they have lain down and are chewing their cud or slumbering , the two night guards begin riding round them in opposite ways , often , on very dark nights , calling or singing to them , as the sound of the human voice on such occasions seems to have a tendency to quiet them . In inky black weather , especially when rainy , it is both difficult and unpleasant work ; the main trust must be placed in the horse , which , if old at the business , will of its own accord keep pacing steadily round the herd , and head off any animals that , unseen by the rider 's eyes in the darkness , are trying to break out . Usually the watch passes off without incident , but on rare occasions the cattle become restless and prone to stampede . Anything may then start them - the plunge of a horse , the sudden approach of a coyote , or the arrival of some outside steers or cows that have smelt them and come up . Every animal in the herd will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric shock , and off with a rush , horns and tail up . Then , no matter how rough the ground nor how pitchy black the night , the cowboys must ride for all there is in them and spare neither their own nor their horses ' necks . Perhaps their charges break away and are lost altogether ; perhaps , by // desperate galloping , they may head them off , get them running in a circle , and finally stop them . Once stopped , they may break again , and possibly divide up , one cowboy , perhaps , following each band . I have known six such stops and renewed stampedes to take place in one night , the cowboy staying with his everdiminishing herd of steers until daybreak , when he managed to get them under control again , and , by careful humoring of his jaded , staggering horse , finally brought those that were left back to the camp several miles distant . The riding in these night stampedes is wild and dangerous to a degree , especially if the man gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently necessitates an immense amount of work in collecting the scattered animals . On one such occasion a small party of us were thirty-six hours in the saddle , dismounting only to change horses or to eat . We were almost worn out at the end of the time but it must be kept in mind that for a long spell of such work a stock-saddle is far less tiring than the ordinary Eastern or English one , and in every way superior to it . Py very hard riding , such a stampede may THE HERD AT EIGHT . // sometimes be prevented . Once we were bringing a thousand head of young cattle down to my lower ranch , and as the river was high were obliged to take the inland trail . The third night we were forced to make a dry camp , the cattle having had no water since the morning . Nevertheless , we got them bedded down without difficulty , and one of the cowboys and myself stood first guard . But very soon after nightfall , when the darkness had become complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to break out . The only salvation was to keep them close together , as , if they once got scattered , we knew they could never be gathered ; so I kept on one side , and the cowboy on the other , and never in my life did I ride so hard . In the darkness I could but dimly see the shadowy outlines of the herd , as with whip and spurs I ran the pony along its edge , turning back the beasts at one point barely in time to wheel and keep them in at another . The ground was cut up by numerous little gullies , and each of us got several falls , horses and riders turning complete somersaults . We were dripping with sweat , and our ponies quivering and trembling like quaking aspens , when , after more than an hour of the most violent exertion , we finally got the herd quieted again . On another occasion while with the roundup we were spared an excessively unpleasant night only because there happened to be two or three great corrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long it had been raining heavily , and we were well drenched ; but towards evening it lulled a little , and the day herd , a very large one , of some two thousand head , was gathered on an open bottom . We had turned the horses loose , and in our oilskin slickers cowered , soaked and comfortless , under the lee of the wagon , to take a meal of damp bread and lukewarm tea , the sizzling embers of the fire having about given up the ghost after a fruitless struggle with the steady downpour . Suddenly the wind began to come in quick , sharp gusts , and soon a regular blizzard was blowing , driving the rain in stinging level sheets before it . Just as we were preparing to turn into bed , with the certainty of a night of more or less chilly misery ahead of us , one of my men , an iron-faced personage , whom no one would ever have dreamed had a weakness for poetry , looked towards the plain where the cattle were , and remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannobie Lea ' now , sure . " Following his gaze , I saw that the cattle had begun to drift before the storm , the night guards being evidently unable to cope with them , while at the other wagons riders were saddling in hot haste and spurring off to their help through the blinding rain . Some of us at once ran out to our own saddleband . All of the ponies were standing huddled together , with their heads down and their tails to the wind . They were wild and restive enough usually ; but the storm had cowed them , and we were able to catch them without either rope or halter . We made quick work of saddling ; and the second each man was ready , away he loped through the dusk , splashing and slipping in the pools of water that studded the muddy plain . Most of the riders were already out when we arrived . The cattle were gathered in a compact , wedgeshaped , or rather fan-shaped mass , with their tails to the wind - that is , towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of this fanshaped mass of frightened , maddened beasts was a long line of cowboys , each muffled in his slicker and with his broad hat pulled down over his eyes , to shield him from the pelting rain . When the cattle were quiet for a moment every horseman at once turned round with his back to the wind , and the whole line stood as motionless as so many sentries . Then , if the cattle began to spread out and overlap at the ends , or made a rush and broke through at one part of the lines , there would be a change into wild activity . The men , shouting and swaying in their saddles , darted to and fro with reckless speed , utterly heedless of danger-now racing to the threatened point , now checking and wheeling their horses so sharply as to bring them square on their haunches , or even throw them fiat down , while the hoofs plowed long furrows in the slippery soil , until , after some minutes of this mad galloping hither and thither , the herd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more brought up standing . We always had to let them drift a little to prevent their spreading out too much . The din of the thunder was terrific , peal following peal until they mingled in one continuous , rumbling roar ; and at every thunder-clap louder than its fellows the cattle would try to break away . Darkness had set in , but each flash of lightning showed us a dense array of tossing horns and staring eyes . It grew always harder to hold in the herd ; but the drift took us along to the corrals already spoken ofi , whose entrances were luckily to windward . As soon as we reached the first we cut off part of the herd , and turned it within ; and after again doing this with the second , we were able to put all the remaining animals into the third . The instant the cattle were housed five-sixths of the horsemen started back at full speed for the wagons ; the rest of us barely waited to put up the bars and make the corrals secure before galloping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth of the driv // IN A STAMPEDE . ing storm ; and once at the wagons we made small delay in crawling in under our blankets , damp though the latter were , for we were ourselves far too wet , stiff , and cold not to hail with grateful welcome any kind of shelter from the wind and the rain . All animals were benumbed by the viulencc of this gale of cold rain : a prairie-chicken rose from under my horse 's feet so heavily that , thoughtlessly striking at it , I cut it down with my whip ; while when a jack rabbit got up ahead of us , it was barely able to limp clumsily out of our way . But though there is much work and hardship , rough fare , monotony , and exposure connected with the round-up , yet there are few // men who do not look forward to it and back to it with pleasure . The only fault to be found is that the hours of work are so long that one does not usually have enough time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men are good-humored , bold , and thoroughly interested in their business , continually vying with one another in the effort to see which can do the work best . It is superbly health-giving , and is full of excitement and adventure , calling for the exhibition of pluck , self-reliance , hardihood , and dashing horsemanship ; and of all forms of physical labor the easiest and pleasantest is to sit in the saddle . The scenery is often exceedingly striking in character , especially in the Bad Lands , with their queer fantastic formations . Among the most interesting features are the burning mines . These are formed by the coal seams that get on fire . They vary greatly in size . Some send up smoke-columns that are visible miles away , while others are not noticeable a few rods off . The old ones graduallyburn away , while new ones unexpectedly break out . Thus , last fall , one suddenly appeared but half a mile from the ranch house . We never knew it was there until one cold moonlight night , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravine and saw in our path a tall white column of smoke rising from a rift in the snowy crags ahead of us . As the trail was over perfectly familiar ground , we were for a moment almost as startled as if xve had seen a ghost . The burning mines are uncanny places , anyhow . A strong smell of sulphur hangs round them , the heated earth crumbles and cracks , and through the long clefts that form in it we can see the lurid glow of the subterranean fires , with here and there tongues of blue or cherry colored flame dancing up to the surface . The winters vary greatly in severity , however . During some seasons men can go lightly clad even in January and February , and the cattle hardly suffer at all ; during others there will be spells of bitter weather , accompanied by furious blizzards , which render it impossible for days and weeks at a time for men to stir out-of-doors at all , save at the risk of their lives . Then line rider , ranchman , hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have known of several cases of men freezing to death when caught in shelterless places by such a blizzard , a strange fact being that in about half of them the doomed man had evidently gone mad before dying , and had stripped himself of most of his clothes , the body when found being nearly naked . On our ranch we have never had any bad accidents , although every winter some of us get more or less frost-bitten . My last experience in this line was while returning by moonlight TRAILING CATTLE . // from a successful hunt after mountain sheep . The thermometer was 260 below zero , and we had had no food for twelve hours . I got numbed , and before I was aware of it had frozen my face , one foot , both knees , and one hand . Luckily , I reached the ranch before serious damage was done . About once every six or seven years we have a season when these storms follow one another almost without interval throughout the winter months , and then the loss among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 88o-8 i . The grass was then so good that the few cattle raised on the range escaped fairly well , but even then the trail herds were almost destroyed . This was when there were very few ranchmen in the country . The next severe winter was that of 1886-87 , when the rush of incoming herds had overstocked the ranges , and the loss was in consequence fairly appalling , especially to the outfits who had just put on cattle . The snow-fall was unprecedented , both for its depth and for the way it lasted ; and it was this , and not the cold , that caused the loss . About the middle of November the storms began . Day after day the snow came down , thawing and then freezing and piling itself higher and higher . By January the drifts had filled the ravines and coul*es almost level . The snow lay in great masses on the plateaus and river bottoms ; and this lasted until the end of February . The preceding summer we had been visited by a prolonged drought , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; the snow covered what pasturage there was to the depth of several feet , and the cattle could not get at it at all , and could hardly move round . It was all but impossible to travel on horseback , except on a few wellbeaten trails . Even on the level it was very tiresome to try to break through the snow , and it was dangerous to attempt to penetrate the Bad Lands , whose shape had been completely altered by the great white mounds and drifts . The starving cattle died by scores of thousands before their helpless owners ' eyes . The bulls , the cows who were suckling calves , or who were heavy with calf , the weak cattle that had just been driven upon the trail , and the late calves suffered most ; the old range animals did better , and the steers best of all ; but the best was bad enough . Even many of the horses died . An outfit near me lost half its saddle-band , the animals having been worked so hard that they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock got some shelter and sustenance . They gnawed every twig and bough they could get at . They browsed the bitter sage brush down to where the branches were the thickness of a man 's finger . When near a ranch they crowded into the out-houses and sheds to die , and fences had to be built around the windows to keep the wild-eyed , desperate beasts from thrusting their heads through the glass panes . In most cases it was impossible either to drive them to the haystacks or to haul the hay out to them . The deer even were so weak as to be easily run down ; and on one or two of the plateaus where there were bands of antelope , these wary creatures grew so numbed and feeble that they could have been slaughtered like rabbits . But the hunters could hardly get out , and could bring home neither hide nor meat , so the game went unharmed . It would be impossible to imagine any sight more dreary and melancholy than that offered by the ranges when the snow went off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a green thing to be seen ; the dead grass eaten off till the country looked as if it had been shaved with a razor . Occasionally among the desolate hills a rider would come across a band of gaunt , hollow-flanked cattle feebly cropping the sparse , dry pasturage , too listless to move out of the way ; and the blackened carcasses lay in the sheltered spots , some stretched out , others in as natural a position as if the animals had merely lain down to rest . It was small wonder that cheerful stockmen were rare objects that spring . Our only comfort was that we did not , as usual , suffer a heavy loss from weak cattle getting mired down in the springs and mud-holes when the ice broke up - for all the weak animals were dead already . The truth is , ours is a primitive industry , and we suffer the reverses as well as enjoy the successes only known to primiti* e peoples . A hard winter is to us in the north what a dry summer is to Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples . We still live in an iron age that the old civilized world has long passed by . The men of the border reckon upon stern and unending struggles with their iron-bound surroundings ; against the grim harshness of their existence they set the strength and the abounding vitality that come with it . They run risks to life and limb that are unknown to the dwellers in cities and what the men freely brave , the beasts that they own must also sometimes suffer .
