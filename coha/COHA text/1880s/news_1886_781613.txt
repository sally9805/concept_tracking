txt At present it looks as if the feeling-of the House of Commons were opposed to any scheme of land purchase and to any scheme of home rule laid out on a scale liberal enough to be acceptable to the Irish people . Mr. GLADSTONE has , however , on more than one occasion showed that he could foretell the feeling of the House more accurately than all the London organs of opinion : Out together . It must be remembered that accounts of English opinion come mostly from London and are colored by the sentiments prevailing in the capital , which may or may not be the sentiments of the country at large . Not until Mr. GLADSTONE 'S measure has actually been presented and debated can it be told what its chances - of success are . The question is indeed beset with difficulties which would appall anybody except Mr. GLADSTONE , but which seem to stimulate him as a challenge to his ingenuity and to his powers of persuasion .

But a Federal union between a mother country and one of its dependencies , leaving out the others , or establishing ' with them an entirely different modus vivendi , is almost impossible . If the " Imperial Parliament " were really an imperial body , like Congress or the German Reichstag , Ireland and the colonies might be admitted to representation in it on equal terms with England , Scotland , and Wales . But the original differences between England , Scotland , and Wales in race and religion do not now prevent their constituting for all practical purposes one people , and the allowance of local self-government and a local legislature to each , because Ireland needs one , would be a barren piece of pedantry . On the other hand , the grant to Ireland of the powers with which it has been found quite safe to intrust Canada and Australia would be extremely hazardous , because Ireland is within a fewer hours of Great Britain than the nearest of the great colonies is days , and because the Irish are animated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will not be to the advantage of Ireland to injure England , when Ireland has everything she can reasonably ask for is to forget the intensely sentimental nature of Irish politics . During the lifetime of the generation of Irishmen now in the vigor of life , at least , it is probable that any injury , humiliation , or annoyance inflicted upon England would be greeted with satisfaction in Ireland . The demand that England shall retain in her own hands the power of nullifying Irish legislation , when it trenches upon the " Imperial " prerogatives , is therefore a demand of reasonable prudence . Every contingency in which such a conflict may arise can not be looked out for and specified in the act giving Ireland the power of local self-government .
