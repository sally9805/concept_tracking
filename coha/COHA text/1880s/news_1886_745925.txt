The theatre building , which was known as the old Masonic Temple , belonged to William M. Singerly and was insured for $100,000 , about one-fourth of its value . There was only $27.000 insurance on the entire contents . The - wax figures alone cost $60,000 . The Washington Hotel was damaged to the excut of about $25,000 by falling walls and water . Two firemen were buried early in the afternoon in the interior of the theatre by falling - walls . Another fireman was badly injured , and a number were cut by cracked glass and falling bricks . The fire burned stubbornly from 11 o'clock in the morning until midnight . A curtain which draped awax figure in the ** in the cellar of the building , caught fire from a lamp . Three young men who have charge of the street advertising , named Cavanaugh , Kane , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the first to discover the fire . It was only a little blaze , and looked as if a bucketful of water would extinguish it , but the well hole of a partly completed passenger elevator sucked a strong draught from the cellar to the top of the building , and while the young men attempted to put out the fire by throwing coats on the flames , the strong draught of air fanned the flames , and they shot up licking the wooden partition that separated the tableaus and reaching the ceiling . Manager George C. Brotherton was in the theatre , and had just taken the receipts of Christmas Day out of the safe , when one of the Muse men rushed to the box office and told him the basement was on fire . Manager Brotherton , Francis P. Haggerty , the publisher of the theatre programme , and James O'Neil , an attache ' of the theatre . hurried down into the " chamber of horrors , " and Mr. Brotherton forced upon the cellar doors that open on to Jayne-street , for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . to tell the engineer to bring a stream of water . The northwest wind that blew hi the open collar door caused the flames to spread like a lightning flash , and by the time the fire extinguisher was put in use the flames were traveling like a prairie fire to the front of the house . While an alarm was being sent out Manager Brotherton . Francis P. Haggerty , and James O'Neil , and the theatre employes were trying to put out the fire , but the blinding smoke soon drove them out into Jayne-street , where they waited till the firemen came . Manager Brotherton , with the Christmas Day receipts stuffed in the pockets of his overcoat. handed the coat to a strange man to hold . The pockets contained $5,000 in cash . The man in the excitement threw the coat down . Brother-ton missed it , and tore through the black smoke and blaze back into the basement and groped about until he found the overcoat on the floor . He staggered out onto Jayne-street with the overcoat thrown over his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raged fiercely within the great building a long time before the flames burst through the roof . It was about noon when the roof of the front part of the building began to go , and at 1:45 o'clock the whole interior of the theatre was a mass of fire . Ten minutes later the gallery and the balcony fell with a sharp crash . Following close came another crash and the corrugated iron roof on the rear of the building covering the theatre proper curled up with the heat like a huge shaving , and the roof went down , leaving the naked timbers hi long strings of flame . Then came a mountain of flame that shot up out of the inside of the building with the noise of an explosion , and the flames kept leaping skyward , growing fiercer and more furious in the strong northwest wind . The rear part of the east wall of the building began to totter when the roof fell iu , and then came another crash , and 20 tons of smoking bricks crushed through the roof of the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel were only an old dry goods box . At 2:15 part of the west wall tumbled over on to the adjoining building , No. 723 Chestnutstreet , occupied by Hubbard Brothers , publishers . Hubbard Brothers ' roof was crumbled up as if it had been a piece of wet cardboard . All the time the treacherous high stone-front , with its score of pinnacles was growing weaker and the high side walls on the front part of the building seemed to sway in the wind and everybody expected them to fall . From 2:30 until 5:30 big blocks of blazing floors crashed down from the upper stories to the cellar . Stage Manager Daly succeeded in saving most of the valuable costumes used in " The Little Tycoon . " While the fire was raging in the rear of the building at 1:50 , a number of firemen standing on Chestnut-street saw flames In Fairbanks &; Co. ' s scale store on the ground floor of the theatre building . Assistant Chief Engineer Mooney gave the word to run a line of hose into the store . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firemen crawled through the locked doors with the hose . It was like the charge of the " Light Brigade , " Everybody wondered at the order , but the men went straight ahead dragging the hose into the blinding smoke . Then one of the members of Truck D smashed the store doors in with an axe , and the next moment ' 20 or 30 tons of the interior brick walls came crashing down into the scale store , and the firemen inside came running out into the street half blinded and almost suffocated with smoke . John Johnson , of Truck D , and Jacob Gibson , of Engine No. 4 , who had the nozzle , were missing . They had gone down into the cellar through the store floor with the tons of bricks . They were pinned down by burning timbers and scorching bricks , and were either crushed to death or suffocated . Hugh Colgan , of Engine No. 4 , was the last to get out alive . He reeled out into Chestnutstreet bareheaded , with the blood streaming from a ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rubber boot was cut clean to the foot as If a knife had ripped it with one clean sweep . Colgan 's right knee was badly cut . He stood in the street dazed and unnoticed in the excitement . He started back in a moment ? to see if he could save his comrades , and then lie was pulled back by Police Captain Quirk , who cried out to everybody to run for their lives . Robert Reed , of Engine No. 4 , had two of the fingers of his right hand torn out from the sockets . James Pidgeon , of Engine No. 26 , took an axe and broke the iron gratings , and , plunging down the steps into the cellar , called out for his companions , but there was no answer , only the roaring of flames and the crackling of burning timbers . No one expected to save the lives of the two firemen , but the men wanted to rescue their dead bodies before the flames got to them . Several times futile attempts were made by rescue parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat and smoke , and at midnight a stream was being thrown on the spot where the two men were buried . Gibson 's hat was found by one of the firemen , and the cap that Johnson wore was recovered just before dark . Gibsouwas 32 years old , and leaves a widow and three children . Johnson was also married , and leaves a widow and several children . The theatre occupied a lot 100 feet wide and 175 feet deep . Mr. Singerly says he can not tell yet whether he will rebuild the theatre . He is worth several millions . Manager Brotherton says his own loss is $75,000 and that he has lost every dollar he has in the world . He was completely unmanned to-night and shed tears when he spoke of the tire . He said if his wife was here he could stand it . His wife died about two weeks ago .
