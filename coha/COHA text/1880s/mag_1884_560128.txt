DEFECTIVE NATURALIZATION LAWS . IT is a common remark that citizenship of the United States is a greater political privilege than is citizenship of any other nation . It not only constitutes its possessor a constituent member of a great community , gives him a title to all the civil rights asserted and secured by our institutions , and to the protection of the Government at home and abroad , but , as it makes him also a citizen of the State wherein he may reside , it enables him to participate in the Government itself . Even if he be a person of foreign birth , when naturalized he stands on the same plane on which all native-born citizens stand , except that he can not be a President or Vice-President of the United States . He may have a voice in the choice of governmental officers , may share in making the laws of the land , and in administering or executing them . But if citizenship is valuable to the person who has it , it is more important to the Government that acknowledges it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental action are peculiarly dependent upon the character , intelligence , and conscientiousness of the citizens . More than elsewhere the Government is , and it must ever be , what the citizens make it . Hence it is of the highest importance that , so far as possible , all who are citizens should be fitted for the discharge of the trust VOL . CXXXVIII. - NO. 330. 29 // which citizenship confers upon them . Especially is it desirable that the laws which regulate the admission of foreign-born persons into citizenship should be wisely framed and executed , if the beneficent working of our institutions is to be preserved . In no other country on earth does so large a proportion of the population consist of immigrants from foreign lands , untrained in early life under its institutions , unaccustomed to its social habits , ignorant of its history , often unacquainted with its language , but admitted to control its institutions and its laws . Yet our naturalization laws have always been more liberal and less exacting than those of any other civilized nation . There were reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their severance from Great Britain the colonists were spread over an immense territory , of which nearly the whole was susceptible of cultivation , but only a small portion cultivated . In all parts of it there were tribes of Indians , restless and often hostile , imposing upon the colonists the necessity of being ever prepared for defense . Considering the large extent of territory occupied and claimed , the colonists were few and weak in resources . It was obviously desirable that their number should be greatly increased , alike to strengthen them for defense and to develop their material interests . If development and growth $ are always coveted by civilized communities , there were special reasons why they were desirable for the colonies in their infancy . Very naturally , therefore , and reasonably , they sought to invite immigration . They welcomed every fresh arrival from Europe , and held out all possible inducements to increase the incoming . One of these inducements was the offer of speedy naturalization . Each colony prescribed rules for obtaining citizenship , compliance with which was easy , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , or to enjoy freedom and equal rights with all others , strong inducements to seek a home in this new country . The rules for obtaining naturalization differed in the several colonies ; but they were all exceedingly liberal , - so liberal that they encountered opposition from the British Crown . That opposition caused much irritation in the colonies , and in the Declaration of Independence it was included in the catalogue of wrongs charged against the Crown , that the king had " endeavored to prevent the population of the States by obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners , refusing to pass others to encourage their // migration hither , and raising the conditions for new appropriations of lands . " Snch was the condition of things , and such the popular feeling , when the Constitution was framed in 1787 . There was then the same need for an increase of the population , and the same desire for it ; and , as the people of the several States were about to be included in one nationality , it was necessary that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Constitution therefore conferred upon Congress power to establish such rules , and by the earliest Congress they were established . At first , two years ' residence within the limits of the United States only was recmuired to enable a foreign-born person to obtain naturalization . In 1795 the period of residence was enlarged to five years , and in 1798 , to fourteen years ; but in 1802 all prior acts of Congress upon the subject were repealed , and an act was passed which has ever since been in substance the law . Omitting reference to some slight modifications , all of which tend to greater liberality , the law as it now exists allows any alien white person or person of African nativity or African descent to be admitted to citizenship on the following conditions : First . He shall declare on oath , before a Circuit or District Court of the United States , or a District or Supreme Court of the Territories , or a Court of Record of any of the Territories having common law jurisdiction , having a seal and a clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , bona fide , his intention to become a citizen of the United States , and to renounce all other allegiance . ( This declaration need not now be made before a court . It may be made before a clerk of any of the courts. ) iS*econd . He shall , at the time of his application to be admitted , declare on oath , before some one of the courts above specified , that he will support the Constitution of the United States , and that he absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to every foreign prince , potentate , state , or sovereignty . Third . It shall be made to appear , to the satisfaction of the court admitting such alien , that he has resided within the United States five years at least , and within the State or Territory where such court is at the time held one year at least , and that daring that time he has behaved as a man of good moral character , attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness of the same ; but the oath of the applicant is not allowed to prove his residence . Such are the rules regulating the admi3sion of foreign-born persons to citizenship , under which such multitudes of aliens have been admitted . Aliens who are honorably discharged soldiers may be admitted after a residence of one year , and seamen in some cases after three years ' service . These regulations present two subjects for consideration , - the qualifications for admission to citizenship , and the process required . The principal qualification is residence within the limits of the United States five years , one of which must be in the State where the court sits to which application for admission is made . Another requisite is an oath to support the Constitution of the United States , and to renounce other allegiance . A third requisite is its being made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the applicant has behaved as a man of good moral character , attached to the principles of the Constitution , and well disposed to the good order and happiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first . It may be that in the early history of the Government it was wise to admit to citizenship immigrants from foreign countries after a residence here of not more than five years . The necessities of the country may have demanded such a stimulus to immigration . Besides , at first the number was comparatively small , and most of those who did come were Englishmen , or English-speaking . There were , indeed , some Germans , or Dutch , or Swedes , or Huguenots ; but the entire number of men , women , and children who came from foreign lands to make their homes here , between the close of the Revolutionary war and 1820 , has been estimated as not more than two hundred and fifty thousand . The population of the United States in 1820 was nearly ten millions . The immigrants down to that period were too few to affect materially our national character . If they were all living in 1820 , they were only two and one-half per cent . of the whole . Subsequent to that time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850 they constituted nearly ten per cent . of the entire population of the country . This does not include children of aliens , born after the immigration of their parents . Down to this time more than two-thirds of those who came were Englishspeaking . In 1860 the foreign-born element had reached to the // proportion of 13.16 per cent. ; in 1870 , to 14.44 ; and in 1880 it was 13.33 per cent . of our entire population . In 1880 the total of foreign-born inhabitants was 6,679,943-almost seven milk ions . What it is now we have no means of ascertaining ; but we know that since 1880 immigration has immensely increased . A general war in continental Europe would probably send over hundreds of thousands more . It is worthy of particular observation , also , that in later years a far greater proportion have come from countries outside the British Isles than came prior to 1850 ; and this though the great famine in Ireland greatly stimulated emigration from that country during several years . A large majority now come from Germany , Austria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians . There is every reason to expect that this will continue to be the case . In view of these facts , gathered largely from the last census , a very grave question is presented . It is whether the time has not come when the period of residence , as a qualification for citizenship , should not be greatly prolonged . Citizenship of the United States is a much more important matter to the Government , and to the general welfare of our people , than is citizenship of any other nation to that nation . The naturalized alien becomes immediately , by force of the Constitution , not only a citizen of the United States , but also a citizen of the State in which he resides . Thus he becomes , like nativeborn citizens , a qualified voter in the State , entitled to vote at all elections , including those for members of Congress . He becomes a participant in the government of the State , and in the government of the United States . He thus is empowered to mold and , possibly , control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in his hands the perpetuity of our institutions It is even now notorious that citizens of foreign birth in some districts , cities , and perhaps even States , have the control of parties . They are sufficient in number to hold the balance of power . The voice of cities and of large sections of the country is their voice . Is this a state of things to be desired for the future ? Let it be assumed that thus far neither our institutions nor our governmental policy has suffered ; is the country assured for all time to come ' ? How will it be with the increase of immigration from countries where the English language is not understood ? Or , if the best interests of the country at large be not imperiled , may not local interests sustain // damage ? Almost manhood suffrage everywhere prevails . Judges , city councils , township supervisors , and even school directors , are elected by a popular vote . Is five years ' residence in the country sufficient to instruct the masses of foreigners who come among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , and in the policy which the Government may wisely pursue , but in the management of local affairs , and in the conduct of our schools ? Many of them have to learn the English language . Very many can not read any language , and most of them are so occupied in obtaining the means of subsistence that they have neither time nor disposition to acquire that information they need to take part in the government intelligently . It may also be said with truth that five years are too short a time to wean many from controlling attachment to their fatherlands , where perhaps their kindred dwell . In case of international difficulties this attachment may interfere with full-hearted allegiance to the home of their adoption . This is illustrated in the conduct of some Irish immigrants , who have exhibited a readiness to violate our laws and embroil the country in controversy with England for the sake of their native land , and this though they are our naturalized citizens . Naturalization does not necessarily change the affections or expel an old love . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his relations to government be altered . If the condition of the country were what it was fifty years ago , it might be well to bear the evils and encounter the danger of intrusting to a multitude of foreign-born persons a share in the government . But the time has gone by when hasty naturalization is necessary either for purposes of defense or for the development of material interests . The unstimulated increase of our population , it is believed , is sufficient for all the country 's needs , without holding forth , as an inducement for aliens to come among us , easy access to a share in the government , to participation in legislation , in the choice of our judges , and in the conduct of our schools . The true greatness of a nation , the beneficent working of its institutions , and the well-being and prosperity of its people are not measured by the number of its citizens , but by their intelligence , conscientiousness , and obedience to law . Prolonging the period of residence required prior to naturalization would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve their civil or religious condition or their mat&amp;rial interests . The oppressed of other lands , invited by our free institutions , by religious liberty , by social equality , and by superior advantages for obtaining subsistence and property , would still seek a home here . Extension of the period would take from them no rights . It would , however , lessen possible dangers to the country . It would only withhold for a reasonable time the gift of a most important trust . We are accustomed to hear suffrage spoken of as a right . It is so only in an inferior sense . More properly may it be said that every person allowed to vote is a trustee of precious interests . He acts for others , as well as for himself . Caution is nowhere more needed than in the selection of a trustee . The immigrant does not need the trust of suffrage . In nearly all the States an alien may purchase and own lands , and transmit them by will or descent . He has all the facilities which a citizen has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights to the advantages of our schools . There is no civil right which he does not enjoy in common with native-born citizens . The right to participate in the government , and the right to claim the protection of the United States when he is in foreign lands , are alone withheld from him . More than this . In many of the States , strangely enough , he is accorded political rights . In fourteen States he is allowed to vote for members of the State legislature , and consequently for members of Congress , after he has declared his intention to become naturalized , though he has never applied for naturalization , and never may . Thus he is allowed to participate in the government of a country of which he is not a citizen . This is a striking anomaly , believed to have no parallel in any other country . There are in the present Congress ninety-five members elected in part by such a constituency . This , however , if it be an evil , can be corrected only by the States , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fault of the naturalization laws ; it is rather an exhibit of an undervaluation of the vital importance of intelligent suffrage in comparison with growth of population . In what has been said it has not been intended to call into question the undoubted fact that some foreign-born persons admitted to citizenship after a residence of only five years have been valuable members of the body politic . Their understanding of our peculiar institutions , their just appreciation // of them , their general intelligence , and their genuine and paramount attachment to the country have contributed to the general welfare . They have been safe depositaries of political power . Some such accessions may be expected in the future . But what are they among so many ? Can they outweigh the vast army of immigrants who have everything to learn , as well as much to unlearn , and who , in the struggle for bread , have little opportunity to acquire what is needful to enable them to discharge the trust of citizenship usefully ? The vote of an untrained man is as potent for good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good . With ns it is numbers that count for power . The other qualifications demanded by the law for admission to citizenship may best be considered in connection with an examination of the process of admission . The foreign-born person , having made his declaration of intention to become naturalized ( which he may make before the clerk of any court of record in any State or Territory ) , presents himself to any court he may select , either State or National . He has a choice among a thousand , scattered over all the States in which he has resided one year . He may have spent the first year of his residence in New York , and during the other four years have had a roving residence in Arizona , Utah , or Montana , and yet he may make his application to a court in New York . The law does not require that the last year of his residence shall be within the State where the court is held . At the time of his application he must swear that he will support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his native and all foreign allegiance . This is an oath easily and readily taken . It may be well to require it , but to what does it amount ? To a vast majority of those who are applicants for naturalization it is unmeaning . They have never read the Constitution ; some are unacquainted with the English language ; and many , perhaps most of them , can not read any language . What can they know of the principles they swear to support ? To what , then , does the oath they take bind their consciences ? But further , it must appear to the satisfaction of the court that the applicant has behaved , during his residence , as a man of good moral character , attached to the principles of the Constitution , // and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States . How is that to be made to appear ? The statute does not declare . It does not require that it shall be proved by witnesses . May it be attested by the oath of the applicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence to the contrary , adopt the presumption that all men are of good moral character , and have so conducted themselves ? Undoubtedly good moral character is a reasonable requirement of any one who asks to be adopted into citizenship ; but in practice who ever heard of an application for nattiralization being rejected because the applicant did not possess it , or because he was not attached to the principles of the Constitution ? No doubt , good character ought to be satisfactorily proved , as well as good conduct , and it ought to be proved by those who have had an opportunity to observe and know what the character and conduct have been . The law , however , makes no such requirement . It does prescribe that residence within the limits of the United States five years , and within the State one year , shall be made to appear by other evidence than the oath of the applicant ; but not so in regard to the other qualifications . Moreover , the residence is not required to have been continuous . It may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful what constitutes residence within the meaning of the law . If a man has a family living in his house in Germany or Ireland , and he spends five years in this country , engaged in business here , interrupted only by occasional visits to his family home , is that such a residence here as the law contemplates ? Or if his home and his family are here , and he spends a large portion of the five years abroad , and away from his family , but intending to return , is that a sufficient residence here ? Such queries might be multiplied , and to them the statutes give no answer . The residence may be a roving one , like that of many miners and prospectors in the Rocky Mountains , of no value as a preparation for the trust of citizenship , and difficult of proof . It is a defect in the naturalization laws that they do not require a settled residence during the last year of the five in the State where the application is made . Such a provision was once made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens residing in the United States prior to January 29 , 1795 , an act of Congress required the one yeaa9s residence of the applicant in the State or Territory // where the court is held to be immediately preceding the application . But those cases and that provision were exceptional . The general law makes no such demand . It is another very serious defect in the naturalization laws that the proceedings prescribed on the application for admission to citizenship are entirely ex parte . The applicant makes his own case when and where he wills . He needs no witness , except to prove his residence ; and that proof may be , and generally is , made by an ex parte affidavit . The affiant is selected by the applicant . There is nothing in the law that requires the witness to be a citizen . There is no cross-examination , no opportunity to introduce counter testimony . The United States are not represented , nor is any State . Neither of them has any notice of the proceeding , though they are profoundly interested in its results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government an additional obligation . This is a matter of no small importance . The ex parte nature of the proceedings invites fraud , and furnishes great facilities for accomplishing it . It vitally affects the highest political interests . The residence of multitudes of foreign immigrants is so roving , so unsettled , it affords so little opportunity or disposition to acquire knowledge of our institutions , or to exhibit attachment to them , that it would appear to be reasonable to require that the evidence offered to establish it be subject to thorough examination , and to the tests which are usuafly applied in cases of much less importance . It must be conceded there is a difficulty in the way of making the proceedings for naturalization other than ex jparte , so long as State courts are permitted to take jurisdiction of applications , and to adjudge conclusively that applicants be admitted to citizenship . But that is itself an anomaly , permitted originally , no doubt , because there were few United States courts , and State courts were more convenient for applicants . Now there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are several districts . To take care of the interests of the Government , there are United States district attorneys in all the districts , who could represent the Government in all naturalization proceedings . It certainly is remarkable and without precedent that the courts of one government are empowered to make citizens for another , without the knowledge of that other . It contributes , we can not but think , to the laxity of the proceedings , and to the frauds which , it is currently believed , are very numerous . // The seriousness of the evils resulting from the fact that the proceedings to obtain naturalization are ex jparte , will be better understood after observation of the practice in courts . Most of the applications are made in the State courts , and they are made in our large cities , where immigrants largely congregate . They are generally made shortly before an election . The immigrants are sought out by agents of political parties , in order to secure their votes . Then they are brought in great numbers into the courts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has bargained for the votes . The witnesses to prove the residence of the applicants are produced by the agents . These witnesses are very frequently themselves foreign-born , and not infrequently unnaturalized . They may have , they often do have , very slight acquaintance with those for whose residence five years in the United States and one year in the State , or perhaps for whose character and disposition , they vouch . Very often the same person vouches for scores on the same day . The affidavits he makes are general , entering into no details . The witness is not asked what are his means of knowledge . The proceedings in the court are hurried , and often conducted by one of the clerks at side bar , while the Court is attending to other matters . It is notorious that in this way hundreds of persons are naturalized in a single court , and on one day , almost every year , the papers and affidavits ali having been previously prepared . Could any system be devised more efficient to facilitate fraud or to cheapen citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in it which is fitted to impress them with convictions of the importance of the trust conferred upon them or of the responsibilities which attend it . It can not be that such a system is consistent with the public welfare , or even safety . A person thus naturalized can hardly be expected to look beyond paying his debt to the party agent with his vote at the coming election . Very probably he would have made no application for naturalization had he not been stimulated thereto by some party agent , or if naturalization did not give him an immediate right to vote . Unfortunately , in all the States except two , immediately on the admission of an alien to citizenship all the political as well as civil rights of American-born citizens become his . The Massachusetts Constitution ordains that no person of foreign birth shall be allowed to vote , or shall be eligible to office , unless he // shall have resided within the jurisdiction of the United States for two years subsequent to his naturalization , and shall be otherwise qualified according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elective franchise to aliens not naturalized ninety days prior to any election . Such provisions can be made only by the States , but when made , they must tend to diminish the evils accompanying and following the practices we have described , and which are possible under the law as it now exists . They lessen the temptation , now so effective with warm partisans , to bring into the naturalization courts so many persons unfit for citizenship . In many cases , it is believed , the residence of such persons would be prolonged , with increase of knowledge and fitness , before they would , unsolicited , apply . That the loose and easy mode of admission to citizenship , and the carelessness with which even that mode is pursued , facilitate the commission of frauds , can not be denied . No doubt there have been a vast number of fraudulent naturalizations . Small as the requirements are , they have been evaded , or certificates of naturalization have been forged . In our intercourse with foreign nations , the question is often raised , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found difficult to answer it . No registry is anywhere kept of those who have been adopted into citizenship ; and as the courts have decided that a record of naturalization need not show that the legal prerequisites have been complied with , because the admission itself conclusively shows that they have been , it is almost impossible to show fraud even where it existed . This is the more important , because the law contains no provision for revoking or vacating the record of a naturalization fraudulently obtained . President Grant more than once called the attention of Congress to this defect , but no action was taken in pursuance of his recommendation . In his messages he stated that provisions regarding uniformity in the records and certificates , and providing against the frauds which frequently occur , and for the vacating of a record of naturalization obtained by fraud , were greatly needed . They are needed for the protection of the honest citizen of foreign birth , and for the want of them he is made to suffer not infrequently . It may be added that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are due to foreign nations . We have always insisted upon the // right of expatriation , and claimed that naturalization absolves the person naturalized from allegiance to any foreign power . Most governments whose subjects come among us now acquiesce in our claims , though reluctantly . It is due to them that they should not be defrauded by false certificates , and that they should have the means of knowing certainly which of their subjects have transferred their allegiance and become citizens of the United States . It is due to the naturalized citizen also . It may save him from annoyance when he visits his fatherland . A provision to vacate the record in cases of fraud , uniformity in the records and certificates , and a properly kept registry , would doubtless prevent many international difficulties like those which the past has witnessed . Some such regulations are becoming more and more necessary every year , in view of the large and probably increasing immigration from the German and Austrian empires , as well as from Italy and the north of Europe . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not space to notice . One , however , may be mentioned . At common law , citizen ship is incident to birth in the country . The child of an alien , if born in the country , is as much a citizen as the child of a citizen . This is an acknowledged principle here , as well as in England . It can be altered only by statute . Hence , children of American citizens , born in foreign countries , are citizens of those countries , and not of the United States , except so far as Congress has changed the common law rule . But the rule has been only partially changed . The statute declares that minor children of naturalized persons , if dwelling in the United States at the time of the naturalization of their parents , are to be considered as citizens thereof ; and it adds that " the children of persons who now are ( December 1 , 1873 ) or have been citizens of the United States , shall , though born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of this clause embraces only children of parents who were citizens of the United States in 1873 , or who had been . It makes no provision for others . This defect has not escaped attention . In 1841 a bill was reported in the Senate , which provided that " persons heretofore or hereafter born out of the limits of the United States , whose fathers were at the time of their birth citizens of the United States , shall be deemed and considered citizens of the United States . " The bill did not become a law . There have been two subse // quent attempts to correct the law in this particular , both of which failed . It is quite surprising that in the revision of the Acts of Congress in 1873 the manifest defect was not corrected . Upon the whole , it is very evident that the naturalization laws much need revision and amendment , if not repeal . Few , if any , subjects can be of greater interest to the country than the question , Who are to be its citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
