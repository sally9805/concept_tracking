Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : O God ! while generations flee from " O God ! While generations flee " ( 1881 ) O God ! while generations flee Like leaves before Thy face , Through endless ages Thou wilt be Thy children 's dwelling-place . Great Shepherd of the countless flock , Where'er they rest or roam ; Their cheering sun , their sheltering rock , Their everlasting home ! Our sainted fathers , where are they ? They slept , they woke in Thee , And here in memory 's light , to-day , They walk serene and free . Roll back , O Time , thy ceaseless wave , Bring round the day once more , When first they trod , the free and brave , This wild and wood-crowned shore . In God 's first temple here they stood , His breath inspired the air ; And through the green , o'erarching wood Uprose their song and prayer . When days grew dark , they sowed in trust , In patience , and in peace , Assured that God , the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large-armed tree , behold it now ! God 's word its living root ; To children 's children each broad bough Brings healing , shade , and fruit . O Thou who led'st our sires of old , Their grateful children lead ; Thy flock in shelter safe enfold , In sunny pastures feed ! Still guide our footsteps in the way That climbs the morning height , Thy law , O God ! our cloud by day , Thy love our fire by night !
