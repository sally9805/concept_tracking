THE MONMOUTH AND NEWPORT CAMPAIGNS . DURING the dreary winter at Valley Forge , Washington busied himself in improving the organization of his army . The fall of the Conway cabal removed many obstacles . Greene was persuaded , somewhat against his wishes , to serve as quartermaster-general , and forthwith the duties of that important office were discharged with zeal and promptness . Conway 's resignation opened the way for a most auspicious change in the inspectorship of the army . Of all the foreign officers who served under Washington during the War for Independence , the Baron von Steuben was in many respects the most important . Member of a noble family which for five centuries had been distinguished in the local ann*ds of Magdeburg , Steuben was one of the best educated and most experienced soldiers of Germany . His grandfather , an able theologian , was well known as the author of a critical treatise on the New Testament . His uncle , an eminent mathematician , had been the inventor of a new system of fortification . His father had seen half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had himself held the rank of first lieutenant at the beginning of the Seven Years ' War , and after excellent service in the battles of Prague , Rosshach , and Kunersdorf he was raised to a position on the staff of Frederick the Great . At the end of the war , when the thrifty king reduced his army , and Bliiicher with other officers afterward famous left the service , Steuben retired to private life , with the honorary rank of General of the Circle of Swabia . For more than ten years he was grand marshal to the Prince of HohenzollernHechingen . Then he went traveling about Europe , until in the spring of 1777 he arrived in Paris , and became acquainted with Franklin and Beaumarchais . The American alliance was already secretly contemplated by the French ministry , and the astute Vergennes , knowing that the chief defect of our armies lay in their want of organization and discipline , saw in the scientific German soldier a most efficient instrument for remedying the evil . After much hesitation Steuben was persuaded to undertake the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-burning b among the American officers , the honorary rank which he had held in Germany was translated by Vergennes into the rank of lieutenant-general , which the Americans would at once recognize as more eminent than any position existing in their own army except that of the commander-in-chief . Knowing no English , Steuben took with him as secretary and interpreter the youthful Pierre Duponceau , afterward famous as a lawyer , and still more famous as a philologist . One day , on shipboard , this gay young Frenchman laid a wager that he would kiss the first Yankee girl he should meet on landing . So as they came ashore at Portsmouth on a frosty December day , he gravely stepped up to a pretty New Hampshire maiden who was passing by , and told // her that before leaving his native land to fight for American freedom he had taken a vow to ask , in earnest of victory , a kiss from the first lady he should meet . The prayer of chivalry found favor in the eyes of the fair Puritan , and the token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party with sleighs , drivers , and saddlehorses for the inland journey of more than four hundred miles to York . During this cheerful journey , which it took three weeks to perform , Steuben 's heart was warmed toward his new country by the reminiscences of the Seven Years ' War which he frequently encountered . The name of Frederick was everywhere deservedly popular in America , and his familiar features decorated the signboard of many a wayside inn , while on the coffee-room walls hung quaint prints with doggerel verses commemorating Rossbach and Leuthen along with Louisburg and Quebec . On arriving at York , the German general was received by Congress with distinguished honors ; and this time the confidence given to a trained European soldier turned out to be well deserved . Throughout the war Steuben proved no less faithful than capable . He came to feel a genuine love for his adopted country , and after the war was over , retiring to the romantic woodland near Oriskany , where so many families of German lineage were already settled , and where the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres in acknowledgment of his services , he lived the quiet life of a country gentleman until his death in 1794 . A little village some twelve miles north of the site of old Fort Stanwix still bears his name and marks the position of his estate . After his interview with Congress , Steuben repaired at once to Valley Forge , where Washington was not slow in recognizing his ability ; nor was Steuben , on the other hand , at a loss to perceive , in the ragged and motley army which he passed in review , the existence of soldierly qualities which needed nothing so much as training . Disregarding the English prejudice which looked upon the drilling of soldiers as work fit only for sergeants , he took musket in hand and showed what was to be done . Alert and untiring , he worked from morning till night in showing the men how to advance , retreat , or change front without falling into disorder , - how to perform , in short , all the rapid and accurate movements for which the Prussian army had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American troops . Generals , colonels , and captains were fired by the contagion of his example and his tremendous enthusiasm , and for several months the camp was converted into a huge training - school , in which masters and pupils worked with incessant and furious energy . Steuben was struck with the quickness with which the common soldiers learned their lessons . He had a harmlessly choleric temper , which was part of his overflowing vigor , and sometimes , when drilling an awkward squad , he would exhaust his stock of French and German oaths , and shout for his aid to come and curse the blockheads in English . " Viens , mon ami Walker , " he would say , - " viens , mon bon ami . Sacre - blen - Gott - verdam de gaucherie of dese badauts . Je ne puis plus ; I can curse dem no more ! " Yet in an incredibly short time , as he afterward wrote , these awkward fellows had acquired a military air , had learned how to carry their arms , and knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with precision . In May , 1778 , after three months of such work , Steuben was appointed inspector-general of the army , with the rank and pay of major-general . The reforms which he introduced were so far-reaching that after a year they were said to have saved more than 800,000 French livres to the United States . No accounts had been kept of arms and accoutrements , // and owing to the careless good-nature which allowed every recruit to carry home his musket as a keepsake , there had been a loss of from five to eight thousand muskets annually . During the first year of Steuben 's inspectorship less than twenty muskets were lost . Half of the arms at Valley Forge were found by Steuben without bayonets . The American soldier had no faith in this weapon , because he did not know how to use it ; when he did not throw it away , he adapted it to culinary purposes , holding on its point the beef which he roasted before his camp-fire . Yet in little more than a year after Steuben 's arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , storm the works at Stony Point in one of the most spirited bayonet charges known to history . Besides all this , it was Steuben who first taught the American army to understand the value of an efficient staff . The want of such a staff had been severely felt at the battle of Brandywine ; but before the end of the war Washington had become provided with a staff that Frederick need not have despised . While busy with all these laborious reforms , the good baron found time to prepare a new code of discipline and tactics , based on Prussian experience , but adapted to the peculiar conditions of American warfare ; and this excellent manual held its place , long after the death of its author , as the Blue Book of our army . In this adaptation of means to ends , Steuben proved himself to be no martinet , but a thoroughly military scholar ; he was able not only to teach , but to learn . And in the art of warfare there was one lesson which Europe now learned from America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found desirable to act in loose columns , which could easily separate to fall behind trees and reunite at brief notice ; and in this way there had been developed a kind of light infantry peculiar to America , and especially adapted for skirmish VOL . LXIV. - NO. 384. 30 ing . It was light infantry of this sort that , in the hands of Arnold and Morgan , had twice won the day in the Saratoga campaign . Reduced to scientific shape by Steuben , and absorbed , with all the other military knowledge of the age , by Napoleon , these light-infantry tactics have come to play a great part on the European battle-fields of the nineteenth century . Thus from the terrible winter at Valley Forge , in which the accumulated evils of congressional mismanagement had done their best to destroy the army , it came forth , nevertheless , stronger in organization and bolder in spirit than ever before . On the part of the enemy nothing had been done to molest it . The position at Valley Forge was a strong one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to play a strategic game against Washington in the depths of an American winter . When Franklin at Paris first heard the news that Howe had taken Philadelphia , knowing well how slight was the military value of the conquest , he observed that it would be more correct to say that Philadelphia had taken General Howe . And so it turned out , in more ways than one ; for his conduct in going there at all was roundly blamed by the opposition in Parliament , and not a word was said in his behalf by Lord George Germaine . The campaign of 1777 had been such a bungling piece of work that none of the chief actors , save Burgoyne , was willing frankly to assume his share of responsibility for it . Sir William Howe did not care to disclose the secret of his peculiar obligations to the traitor Lee ; and it would have ruined Lord George Germaine to have told the story of the dispatch that never was sent . Lord George , who was never noted for generosity , sought to screen himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burgoyne , who sat in Parliament , defended himself ably and candidly ; // and when Howe heard what was going on , he sent in his resignation , in order that he too might go home and defend himself . Besides this , he had grown sick of the war , and was convinced that it must end in failure . On the 18th of May , Philadelphia was the scene of a grand farewell banquet , called the Mischianza , - a strange medley , combining the modern parade and regatta with the mediaival tournament , wherein seven silk-clad knights of the Blended Rose and seven more of the Burning Mountain did amicably break lances in honor of fourteen blooming damsels dressed in Turkish trousers , while triumphal arches , surmounted by effigies of Fame , displayed inscriptions commemorating in fulsome Latin and French the glories of the departing general . In these curious festivities , savoring more strongly of Bruges in the fifteenth century than of Philadelphia in the eighteenth , it was long after remembered that the most prominent parts were taken by the illstarred Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to become the wife of Benedict Arnold . With such farewell ceremonies Sir William Howe set sail for England , and Sir Henry Clinton took his place as commander-in-chief of the British armies in America . Washington 's position at Valley Forge had held the British in check through the winter . They had derived no advantage from the possession of the " rebel capital , " for such poor work as Congress could do was as well done from York as from Philadelphia , and the political life of the United States was diffused from one end of the country to the other . The place was worthless as a basis for military operations . It was harder to defend and harder to supply with food than the insular city of New York ; and , moreover , a powerful French fleet , under Count d'Estaing , was approaching the American coast . With the control of the Delaware imperiled , Philadelphia would soon become untenable , and , in accordance with instructions received from the ministry , Sir Henry Clinton prepared to evacuate the place and concentrate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by water ; but finding that he had not transports enough for his whole army , together with the Tory refugees who had put themselves under his protection , he changed his plan . The Tories , to the number of 3000 , with their personal effects , were sent on in the fleet , while the army , encumbered with twelve miles of baggage wagons , began its retreat across New Jersey . On the morning of the 18th of June , 1778 , the rear-guard of the British marched out of Philadelphia , and before sunset the American advance marched in and took possession of the city . General Arnold , whose crippled leg did not allow him to take the field , was put in command , and after a fortnight both Congress and the state government returned . Of the Tories who remained behind , twenty-five were indicted , under the laws of Pennsylvania , for the crime of offering aid to the enemy . Two Quakers , who had actually conducted a party of British to a mid . night attack upon an American outpost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other twenty-three were either acquitted or pardoned . Across the river , seventeen Tories , convicted of treason under the laws of New Jersey , all received pardon from the governor . The British retreat from Philadelphia was regarded by the Americans as equivalent to a victory , and Washington was anxious to enhance the moral effect of it by a sudden blow which should cripple Sir Henry Clinton 's army . In force he was about equal to the enemy , both armies now numbering about 15,000 , while in equipment and discipline his men were better off than ever before . Unfortunately , the American army had just received one addition which went far to neutralize these advantages . The // 46 ' * mischief-maker Lee had returned . In the preceding summer the British Major-General Prescott had been captured in Rhode Island , and after a tedious negotiation of nine months Lee was exchanged for him . He arrived at Valley Forge in May , and as Washington had found a lenient interpretation for his outrageous conduct before his capture , while nothing whatever was known of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestioned to bis old position as senior major-general of the army . It was a dangerous situation for the Americans to have such high command entrusted to such a villain . When Philadelphia was evacuated , Lee first tried to throw Washington off on a false scent by alleging reasons for believing that Clinton did not intend to retreat across New Jersey . Failing in this , he found reasons as plentiful as blackberries why the British army should not be followed up and harassed on its retreat . Then when Washington decided that an attack must be made he grew sulky , and refused to conduct it . Washington was marching more rapidly than Clinton , on a line nearly parallel with him , to the northward , so that by the time the British general reached Allentown he found his adversary getting in front of him upon his line of retreat . Clinton had nothing to gain by fighting , if he could possibly avoid it , and accordingly he turned to the right , following the road which ran through Monmouth and Middletown to Sandy Hook . Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly and cut off the enemy 's rear , while he designed to come up and support the operation with the rest of his army . To Lee , as second in rank , the command of this advanced party properly belonged ; but he declined to take it , on the ground that it was sure to be defeated , and Washington entrusted the movement to the youthful Lafayette , of the soundness of whose judgment he had already seen many proofs . But in the course of the night it occurred to Lee , whatever his miserable purpose may have been , that perhaps he might best accomplish it , after all , by taking the field . So he told Washington , next morning , that he had changed his mind , and was anxious to take the command which he had just declined . With extraordinary forbearance Washington granted his request , and arranged the affair with such tact as not to wound the feelings of Lafayette , who thus , unfortunately , lost the direction of the movement . On the night of June 27th the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded by Lord Cornwallis , encamped near Monmouth Court House , on the road from Allentown . The right wing , of about equal strength , and composed chiefly of Hessians under Knyphausen , lay just beyond the Court House , on the road to Middletown . In order of march the right wing took the lead , convoying the immense baggage train . The left wing , following in the rear , was the part exposed to danger , and with it stayed Sir Henry Clinton . The American advanoe under Lee , 6000 strong , lay about five miles northeast of the British line , and Washington , with the main body , was only three miles behind . Lee 's orders from Washington were positive and explicit . He was to gain the flank of the British left wing and attack it vigorously , while Washington was to come up and complete its discomfiture . Lee 's force was ample , in quantity and quality , for the task assigned it , and there was fair ground for hope that the flower of the British army might thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war began there had hardly been such a golden opportunity . Sunday , the 28th of June , was a day of fiery heat , the thermometer showing 960 in the shade . Early in the morning Clinton moved cautiously . Knyphausen made all haste forward on the // Middletown road , and the left wing followed till it had passed more than a mile beyond Monmouth Court House , when it found itself outflanked on the north by the American columns . Lee had advanced from Freehold church by the main road , crossing two deep ravines upon causeways ; and now , while his left wing was folding about Cornwallis on the north , occupying superior ground , his centre , under Wayne , was close behind , and his right , under Lafayette , had already passed the Court House , and was threatening the other end of the British line on the south . Cornwallis instantly changed front to meet the danger on the north , and a detachment was thrown down the road toward the Court House to check Lafayette . The British position was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander now became very extraordinary . When Wayne began his vigorous attack , he was ordered by Lee to hold back and simply make a feint , as the main attack was to be made in another quarter . While Wayne was wondering at this , the British troops coming down the road were seen directing their march so as to come between Wayne and Lafayette . It would be easy to check them , but the marquis had no sooner started than Lee ordered him back , murmuring something about its being impossible to stand against British soldiers . Lafayette 's suspicions were now aroused , and he sent a dispatch in all haste to Washington , saying that his presence on the field was sorely needed . The army was bewildered . Fighting had hardly begun , but their position was obviously so good that the failure to make prompt use of it suggested some unknown danger . One of the divisions on the left was now ordered back by Lee , and the others , seeing this retrograde movement , and understanding it as the prelude to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus retreated , though without flurry or disorder , to the high ground just east of the second ravine which they had crossed in their advance . All the advantage of their offensive movement was thus thrown away without a struggle , but the position they had now reached was excellent for a defensive fight . To the amazement of everybody , Lee ordered the retreat to be continued across the marshy ravine . As they crowded upon the causeway the ranks began to fall into some disorder . Many sank exhausted by the heat , though few were slain by the enemy . No one could tell from what they were fleeing , and the exultant ardor with which they had begun to enfold the British line gave place to bitter disappointment , which vented itself in passionate curses . So they hurried on , with increasing disorder , till they approached the brink of the westerly ravine , where their craven commander met Washington riding up , pale with anger , looking like an avenging deity . " What is the meaning of all this ? " shouted Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening that the traitor shook in his stirrups , and could make no answer . When the question was repeated with yet greater fierceness , and further emphasized by a tremendous oath , he flew into a rage , and complained at having been sent out to beard the whole British army . " I am very sorry , " said Washington , " that you undertook the command , if you did not mean to fight . " Lee replied that he did not think it prudent to bring on a general engagement , which was , however , precisely what he had been sent out to do . " Whatever your opinions may have been , " said Washington sharply , " I expected my orders to be obeyed ; " and with these words he wheeled about to stop the retreat and form a new front . There was not a moment to lose , for the British were within a mile of them , and their fire began before the line of battle could be formed . To throw a mass of disorderly fugitives in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of doing , was to endanger the organization of the whole force . It was now that the admirable results of Steuben 's teaching were to be seen . The retreating soldiers immediately wheeled and formed under fire with as much coolness and precision as they could have shown on parade , and while they stopped the enemy 's progress Washington rode back and brought up the main body of his army . On some heights to the left of the enemy Greene placed a battery which enfiladed their lines , while Wayne attacked them furiously in front . After a brave resistance , the British were driven back upon the second ravine which Lee had crossed in the morning 's advance . Washington now sent word to Steuben , who was a couple of miles in the rear , telling him to bring up three brigades and press the retreating enemy . Some time before this he had again met Lee and ordered him to the rear , for his suspicion was now thoroughly aroused . As the traitor rode away from the field he met Steuben advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to persuade Steuben to halt , alleging that he must have misunderstood Washington 's orders ; but the worthy baron was not to be trifled with , and doggedly kept on his way . The British were driven in some confusion across the ravine , and were just making a fresh stand on the high ground east of it when night put an end to the strife . Washington sent out parties to attack them on both flanks as soon as day should dawn ; but Clinton withdrew in the night , leaving his wounded behind , and by daybreak had joined Knyphausen on the heights of Middletown , whither it was useless to follow him . The British loss in the battle of Monmouth was about 416 , and the American loss was 362 . On both sides there were many deaths from sunstroke . The battle has usually been claimed as a victory for the Americans ; and so it was in a certain sense , as they drove the enemy from the field . Strategically considered , however , Lord Stanhope is quite right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington undertook it was foiled by the treachery of Lee . Nevertheless , in view of the promptness with which Washington turned defeat into victory , and of the greatly increased efficiency which it showed in the soldiers , the moral advantage was doubtless with the Americans . It deepened the impression produced by the recovery of Philadelphia , it silenced the cavilers against Washington , and its effect upon Clinton 's army was disheartening . More than 2000 of his men , chiefly Hessians , deserted in the course of the following week . During the night after the battle , the behavior of Lee was the theme of excited discussion among the American officers . By the next day , having recovered his self-possession , he wrote a petulant letter to Washington , demanding an apology for his language on the battle-field . Washington 's reply was as follows : - " SIR , - I received your letter , expressed , as I conceive , in terms highly improper . I am not conscious of making use of any very singular expressions at the time of meeting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was dictated by duty and warranted by the occasion . As soon as circumstances will permit , you shall have an opportunity of justifying yourself to the army , to Congress , to America , and to the world in general ; or of convincing them that you were guilty of a breach of orders , and of misbehavior before the enemy on the 28th instant , in not attacking them as you had been directed , and in making an unnecessary , disorderly , and shameful retreat . " To this terrible letter Lee sent the following inipudent answer : " You can not afford me greater pleasure than // in giving me the opportunity of showing to America the sufficiency of her respective servants . I trust that temporary power of office and the tinsel dignity attending it will not be able , by all the mists they can raise , to obfuscate the bright rays of truth . " Washington replied by putting Lee under arrest . A court-martial was at once convened , before which he was charged with disobedience of orders in not attacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary and shameful retreat , and , lastly , with gross disrespect to the commander - in - chief . After a painstaking trial , which lasted more than a month , he was found guilty on all three charges , and suspended from command in the army for the term of one year . This absurdly inadequate sentence is an example of the extreme and sometimes ill-judged humanity which has been wont to characterize judicial proceedings in America . Many a European soldier has been ruthlessly shot for less serious misconduct and on less convincing evidence . A general can be guilty of no blacker crime than knowingly to betray his trust on the field of battle . But in Lee 's case , the very enormity of his crime went far to screen him from the punishment which it deserved . People are usually slow to believe in criminality that goes far beyond the ordinary wickedness of the society in which they live . If a candidate for Congress is accused of bribery or embezzlement , we unfortunately find it easy to believe the charge ; but if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should find it very hard indeed to believe it . In the France of Catherine de ' Medici or the Italy of Ciesar Borgia the one accusation would have been as credible as the other , but we have gone far toward outgrowing some of the grosser forms of crime . In American history , as in modern English history , instances of downright treason have been very rare ; and in proportion as we are impressed with their ineffable wickedness are we slow to admit the possibility of their occurrence . In ancient Greece and in mediaeval Italy there were many Benedict Arnolds ; in the United States a single plot for surrendering a stronghold to the enemy has consigned its author to a solitary immortality of infamy . But unless the proof of Arnold 's treason had been absolutely irrefragable , many persons would have refused to believe it . In like manner , people were slow to believe that Lee could have been so deliberately wicked as to plan the defeat of the army in which he held so high a command , and some historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than adopt the only clue by which it can be explained . He might have been bewildered , he might have been afraid , lie might have been crazy , it was suggested ; and to the latter hypothesis his well-known eccentricity gave some countenance . Perhaps it was well enough for the courtmartial to give him the benefit of the doubt , though in any case it should have been obvious that he had proved himself permanently unfit for a command . Historians for a long time imitated the clemency of the court-martial by speaking of the " waywardness " of General Lee . Nearly eighty years elapsed before the discovery of that document which obliges us to put the worst interpretation upon his acts , while it enables us clearly to understand the motives which prompted them . Lee was nothing but a selfish adventurer . He had no faith in the principles for which the Americans were fighting , or indeed in any principles . He came here to advance his own fortunes , and hoped to be made commander-in-chief . Disappointed in this , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sought to thwart his purposes , while at the same time he intrigued with the enemy . He became infatuated with // the idea of playing some such part in the American Revolution as Monk had played in the Restoration of Charles II . This explains his conduct in the autumn of 1776 , when he refused to march to the support of Washington . Should Washington be defeated and captured , then Lee , as next in command and at the head of a separate army , might negotiate for peace . His conduct as prisoner in New York , first in soliciting an interview with Congress , then in giving aid and counsel to the enemy , is all to be explained in the same way . And his behavior in the Monmouth campaign was part and parcel of the same crooked policy . Lord North 's commissioners had just arrived from England to offer terms to the Americans , but in the exultation over Saratoga and the French alliance , now increased by the recovery of Philadelphia , there was little hope of their effecting anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be suffered to rise too high , else they will never listen to reason . So he wished to build a bridge of gold for Clinton to retreat by ; and when he found it impossible to prevent an attack , his second thoughts led him to take command , in order to keep the game in his own hands . Should Washington now incur defeat by adopting a course which Lee had emphatically condemned as impracticable , the impatient prejudices upon which the cabal had played might be revived . The downfall of Washington would perhaps be easy to compass ; and the schemer would thus not only enjoy the humiliation of the man whom he so bitterly hated , but he might fairly hope to succeed him in the chief command , and thus have an opportunity of bringing the war to a " glorious " end through a negotiation with Lord North 's commissioners . Such thoughts as these were , in all probability , at the bottom of Lee 's extraordinary behavior at Monmouth . they were the impracticable schemes of a vain , egotis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great statesman been still alive , might have brought the war to an honorable close through open and frank negotiation was perhaps not impossible . That such a man as Lee , by paltering with agents of Lord North , should effect anything but mischief and confusion was inconceivable . But selfishness is always incompatible with sound judgment , and Lee 's wild schemes were quite in keeping with his character . The method he adopted for carrying them out was equally so . It would have been impossible for a man of strong military instincts to have relaxed his clutch upon an enemy in the field , as Lee did at the battle of Monmouth . If Arnold had been there that day , with his head never so full of treason , an irresistible impulse would doubtless have led him to attack the enemy tooth and iiail , and the treason would , have waited till the morrow . As usually happens in such cases , the selfish schemer overreached himself . Washington won a victory , after all ; the treachery was detected , and the traitor disgraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now began writing scurrilous articles in the newspapers . He could not hear Washington 's name mentioned without losing his temper , and his venomous tongue at length got him into a duel with Colonel Laurens , one of Washington 's aids and son of the president of Congress . He came out of this affair with nothing worse than a wound in the side ; but when , a little later , he wrote an angry letter to Congress , he was summarily expelled from the army . " Ah , I see , " he said , aiming a Parthian shot at Washington , " if you wish to become a great general in America , you must learn to grow tobacco ; " and so he retired to a plantation which he had in the Shenandoah Valley . He lived to behold the triumph of the cause which he had done so much to injure , and in October , 1782 , // he died in a mean public-house in Philadelphia , friendless and alone . His last wish was that he might not be buried in consecrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting-house , because he had kept so much bad company in this world that he did not choose to continue it in the next . But in this he was not allowed to have his way . He was buried in the cemetery of Christ Church in Philadelphia , and many worthy citizens came to the funeral . When Washington , after the battle of Monmouth , saw that it was useless further to molest Clinton 's retreat , he marched straight for the Hudson River , and on the 20th of July he encamped at White Plains , while his adversary took refuge in New York . The opposing armies occupied the same ground as in the autumn of 1776 ; but the Americans were now the aggressive party . Howe 's object in 1776 was the capture of Washington 's army ; Clinton 's object in 1778 was limited to keeping possession of New York . There was now a chance for testing the worth of the French alliance . With the aid of a powerful French fleet , it might be possible to capture Clinton 's army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not to be . The French fleet of twelve ships-of-the-line and six frigates , commanded by the Count d'Estaing , sailed from Toulon on the 13th of April , and after a tedious struggle with head-winds arrived at the mouth of the Delaware on the 8th of July , just too late to intercept Lord Howe 's squadron . The fleet contained a land force of 4000 men , and brought over M. G6rard , the first minister from France to the United States . Finding nothing to do on the Delaware , the count proceeded to Sandy Hook , where he was boarded by Washington 's aids , Laurens and Hamilton , and a council of war was held . As the British fleet in the harbor consisted of only six ships-of-the-line , with several frigates and gun-boats , it seemed obvious that it might be destroyed or captured by D'Estaing 's superior force , and then Sir Henry Clinton would be entrapped in the island city . But this plan was defeated by a strange obstacle . Though the harbor of New York is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most harbors situated at the mouths of great rivers , a bar at the entrance , which in 1778 was far more troublesome than it is to-day . Since that time the bar has shifted its position and been partially worn away , so that the largest ships in the world can now freely enter , except at low tide . But when the American pilots examined D'Estaing 's two largest ships , which carried eighty and ninety guns respectively , they declared it unsafe , even at high tide , for them to venture upon the bar . The enterprise was accordingly abandoned , but in its stead another one was undertaken , which , if successful , might prove hardly less decisive than the capture of New York . After their expulsion from Boston in the first year of the war , the British never regained their foothold upon the mainland of New England . But in December , 1776 , the island which gives its name to the State of Rhode Island had been seized by Lord Percy , and the enemy had occupied it ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound , it assisted them in threatening the Connecticut coast ; and on the other hand , should occasion require , it might even enable them to threaten Boston with an overland attack . After Lord Percy 's departure for England in the spring of 1777 , the command devolved upon Major - General Richard Prescott , an unmitigated brute . Under his rule no citizen of Newport was safe in his own house . He not only arrested people and threw them into jail without assigning any reason , but he encouraged his soldiers in plundering houses and offering gross insults to ladies , as well as in cutting down shade-trees and wantonly defacing the beautiful lawns . A great // loud - voiced , irascible fellow , swelling with the sense of his own importance , if he chanced to meet with a Quaker who failed to take off his hat , he would seize him by the collar and knock his head against the wall , or strike him over the shoulders with the big gnarled stick which he usually carried . One night in July , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles from Newport , a party of soldiers rowed over from the mainland in boats , under the very guns of three British frigates , and , taking the general out of bed , carried him off in his night-gown . He was sent to Washington 's headquarters on the Hudson . As he passed through the village of Lebanon , in Connecticut , he stopped to dine at an old inn kept by one Captain Alden . He was politely received , and in the course of the meal Mrs. Alden set upon the table a dish of succotash , whereupon Prescott , not knowing the delicious dish , roared , " What do y*ou mean by offering me this hog 's food ? " and threw it all upon the floor . The good woman retreated in tears to the kitchen , and presently her husband , coming in with a stout horsewhip , dealt with the boor as he deserved . When Prescott was exchanged for General Lee , in April , 1778 , he resumed the command at Newport , but was soon superseded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison was increased to 6000 men . New York and Newport were now the only places held by the enemy in the United States , and the capture of either , with its army of occupation , would be an event of scarcely less importance than the overthrow of Burgoyne . As soon as the enterprise was suggested , the New England militia began to muster in force , Massachusetts sending a strong contingent under John Hancock . General Sullivan had been in command at Providence since April . Washington now sent him 1500 picked men of his Continental troops , with Greene , who was born hard by and knew every inch of the island ; with Gbver , of amphibious renown ; and Lafayette , who was a kinsman of the Count d'Estaing . The New England yeoinanry soon swelled this force to about 9000 , and with the 4000 French regulars and the fleet , it might well be hoped that General Pigott would quickly be brought to surrender . The expedition failed through the inefficient cooperation of the French and the insubordination of the yeomanry . D'Estaing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , and had a conference with Sullivan . It was agreed that the Americans should land upon the east side of the island while the French were landing upon the west side , thus intervening between the main garrison at Newport and a strong detachment which was stationed on Butt 's Hill , at the northern end of the island . By such a movement this detachment might be isolated and captured , to begin with . But General Pigott , divining the purpose of the allies , withdrew the detachment , and concentrated all his forces in and around the city . At this moment the French troops were landing upon Conanicut Island , intending to cross to the north of Newport on the morrow , according to the agreement . Sullivan did not wait for them , but seeing the commanding position on Butt 's Hill evacuated , he rightly pushed across the channel and seized it , while at the same time he informed D'Estaing of his reasons for doing so . The count , not understanding the situation , was somewhat offended at what he deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far nothing had happened to disturb the execution of their scheme . He had only to continue landing his troops and blockade the southern end of the island with his fleet , and Sir Robert Pigott was doomed . But the next day Lord Howe appeared off Point Judith , with thirteen ships-of-the-line , seven frigates , and several small vessels , and D'Estaing , // reembarking the troops he had landed on Conanicut , straightway put out to sea to engage him . For two days the hostile fleets maneuvred for the weathergage , and just as they were getting ready for action there came up a terrific storm , which scattered them far and wide . Instead of trying to destroy one another , each had to bend all his energies to saving himself . So fierce was the storm that it was remembered in local tradition as lately as 1850 as " the great storm . " Windows in the city were incrusted with salt blown up in the ocean spray . Great trees were torn up by the roots , and much shipping was destroyed along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that D'Estaing brought in his squadron , somewhat damaged from the storm . He now insisted upon going to Boston to refit , in accordance with general instructions received from the ministry before leaving home . It was urged in vain by Greene and Lafayette that the vessels could be repaired as easily in Narragansett Bay as in Boston harbor ; that by the voyage around Cape Cod , in his crippled condition , he would only incur additional risk ; that by staying lie would strictly fulfill the spirit of his instructions ; that an army had been brought here , and immense stores collected , in reliance upon his aid ; that if the expedition were to be ruined through his failure to coöperate , it would sully the honor of France and give rise to hard feelings in America ; and finally , that even if he felt constrained , in spite of sound arguments , to go and refit at Boston , there was no earthly reason for his taking the 4000 French soldiers with him . The count was quite disposed to yield to these very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself overruled by his officers . D'Estaing was not himself a naval officer , but a lieutenant-general in the army , and it has been said that the officers of his fleet , vexed at having a land-lubber put over them , were glad of a chance to thwart him in his plans . However this may have been , it was voted that the letter of the royal instructions must be blindly adhered to , and so on the 23d he weighed anchor for Boston , taking the land forces with him , and leaving General Sullivan in the lurch . Great was the exasperation in the American camp . Sullivan 's vexation found indiscreet expression in a general order , in which he hoped the event would prove America " able to procure that by her own arms which her allies refuse to assist in obtaining . " But the insubordination of the volunteers now came in to complicate the matter . Some 3000 of them , despairing of success and impatient at being kept from home in harvest time , marched away in disgust and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same size as that of the enemy . The investment of Newport by land had already been completed , but the speedy success of the enterprise depended upon a superiority of force , and in case of British reinforcements arriving from New York the American situation would become dangerous . Upon these grounds , Sullivan , on the 28th , decided to retreat to the strong position at Butt 's Hill , and await events . Lafayette mounted his horse and rode the seventy miles to Boston in seven hours , to beg his kinsman to return as soon as possible . D'Estaing despaired of getting his ships ready for many days , but , catching a spark of the young man 's enthusiasm , he offered to bring up his troops by land . Fired with fresh hope , the young marquis spurred back as fast as he had come , but when he arrived on the scene of action all was over . As soon as Sullivan 's retreat was perceived the whole British army gave chase . After the Americans had retired to their lines on Butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position by storm , and there // ensued an obstinate battle , in which the conditions were in many respects similar to those of Bunker Hill ; but this time the Americans had powder enough , and the British were totally defeated . The next day Sullivan received a dispatch from Washington , with the news that Clinton had started from New York with 5000 men to reinforce Sir Robert Pigott . Under these circumstances , it was rightly thought best to abandon the island . The services of General Glover , who had taken Washington 's army across the East River after the defeat of Long Island , and across the Delaware before the victory of Trenton , were called into requisition , and all the men and stores were ferried safely to the mainland ; Lafayette arriving from Boston just in time to bring off the pickets and covering-parties . The next day Clinton arrived with his 5000 men , and the siege of Newport was over . The failure of this enterprise excited much indignation , and seemed to justify the distrust with which so many people regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a riot on the wharves between French and American sailors , and throughout New England there was loud discontent . It required all Washington 's tact to keep peace between the ill-yoked allies . When Congress passed a politic resolution approving the course of the French commander , it met with no cordial assent from the people . When , in November , D'Estaing took his fleet to the West Indies , for purposes solely French , the feeling was one of lively disgust , which was heightened by an indiscreet proclamation of the count inviting the people of Canada to return to their old allegiance . For the American people regarded the work of Pitt as final , and at no time during the war did their feeling against Great Britain rise to such a point as to make them willing to see the French restored to their old position on this continent . The sagacious Vergennes understood this so well that D'Estaing 's proclamation found little favor in his eyes . But it served none the less to irritate the Americans , and especially the people of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the West Indies was concerned , the American complaints were not wholly reasonable ; for the operations of the French in that quarter helped materially to diminish the force which Great Britain could spare for the war in the United States . On the very day of D'Estaing 's departure , Sir Henry Clinton was obliged to send 5000 men from New York to take part in the West India campaign . This new pressure put upon England by the necessity of warding off French attack went on increasing . In 1779 England had 314,000 men under arms in various parts of the world , but she had so many points to defend that it was difficult for her to maintain a sufficient force in America . In the autumn of that year , Sir Henry Clinton did not regard his position in New York as secure enough to justify him any longer in sparing troops for the occupation of Newport , and the island was accordingly evacuated . From this time till the end of the war , the only point which the British succeeded in holding , north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the Rhode Island campaign of 1778 , no further operations occurred at the North which could properly be said to constitute a campaign . Clinton 's resources were too slender for him to do anything but hold New York . Washington 's resources were too slender for him to do anything but sit and watch Clinton . While the two commanders-in-chief thus held each other at bay , the rapid and violent work of the war was going on in the Southern States , conducted by subordinate officers . During much of this time Washington 's army formed a cordon about Manhattan Island , from Danbury in Connecticut to Elizabethtown in New Jersey , and thus // blockaded the enemy . But while there occurred which demand consideration were no decisive military operations in before we go on to treat of the great the Northern States during this period , Southern campaigns which ended the many interesting and important events war .
