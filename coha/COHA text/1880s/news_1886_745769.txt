Catching ! his babies in his arms be ran up stairs and jumped with them from a second-story window . The second floor of No. 733 was occupied by the Durkin and Murphy families . No member of either of these families escaped . The firemen in searching the ruins of the houses came WW2 the most harrowing scenes . Some were lying in their ha.f-burned beds , and others , who were awakened before death came upon them , were clutching each other in groups on the floor . They were all evidently overcome by the smoke before any effort could be made to escape . The upper floor was occupied by William Hand . His father lived with him . They were aroused by the smell of smoke , and the young man caught up the children and jumped from the secondstory window with them after assisting his wife to the street .

This box is of the keyless ? pattern , and when the handle is turned rings a bell which is intended to notify people in the neighborhood of its being tampered with . Schlier , on hearing the belt , concluded that the alarm was sent in. and left to awaken the inmates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to do with the fatal results of the fire . The origin of the fire was at first a mystery , until a tub containing clothes saturated with coal oil was discovered in the basement . The articles in the tub burned from the top , and a strong smell of the oil could be detected on raising the contents . The scene of the fire is in the midst of that quarter occupied by the poorer ueople , or working classes , and to-day coorly clad men , women , and children stood around the place discussing the tragedy . But few persons were allowed to enter the house unless they were friends of the former occupants . One woman , who had gained entrance through the courtesy of a man in charge , allowed the tears to flow unchecked as . she stood in the little bedroom where seven bodies were found a few hours before . Little Johnny Durkin , aged 6 weeks , lies in Ward No. 10 at the county hospital .

At a late hour this afternoon it was reported dying . Charles Murphy , a brother of Michael Murphy . shed bitter tears as he touched the hands and faces of his relatives . " I heard about the tire at 5 o'clock , " he said , " and went over to the house . I had not heard that all were dead and expected to find a few who had not been murdered , " he continued , " but a policeman told me that their bodies had all been taken to the Morgue . " " Why do you say murdered ? " asked a reporter . " Why do I say it ? Because I am sure my brother and his family died because of the willful deed of some fiend . " John Raleigh , who 13 landlord , of both the burned houses , said : " When I heard the shouting I jumped out of bed and dressed myself . It was about 3:30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get a ladder up to one of the windows of Murphy 's room . The heat here was too 1ntense  --  nobody could stand it . I then grabbed the ladder and made round to the back window . I placed it on the sill and climbed up , but was met at the window by a sheet of flame that nearly knocked me down into the yard . I shouted and hallooed , but got no response . I did not even hear a cry or a moan . In a tow minutes the engines came along , and I told the firemen there were two families inside . They could do nothing until they subdued the fire . When they got in the only member of the two families  --  the Durkius and the Murphys  --  they found alive was little Johnny Durkin , a child of about six weeks . In my opinion the fire was the work of Incendiaries. though what their object could have been I can not divine . I do n't know that I have an enemy on earth , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unoffending . They were sober , industrious people . " " Were there not two attempts made upon you before this ? " " Yes . On the night of the election in April , 1835 , a fire broke out in the basement , just as tale did , but we got it under control . Two nights afterward a fire was again started in the rear room of the building , but we got It under control in time also . "
