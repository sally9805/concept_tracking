txt Mr. GLADSTONE 'S speech at Edinburgh is one of the important speeches of his career . The orator 's leadership of his party was never so well established as it is now , when it is not disputed by any English politician . His first " great speech " of the recess will accordingly be accepted as an authentic exposition of the Liberal programme . It is perhaps significant that the tone held in the speech toward the House of Lords is much milder than the admonition with which he concluded the last speech upon the Franchise bill , which was , indeed , of a truculent and bullying character . The difference may , however , be only the difference between words uttered in the excitement of debate and words carefully chosen to make good to the reason of England the case of the Commons against the Lords . The point at issue is scarcely a point of principle , though it is represented as such on both sides . It is a point of policy . It would have been a gross tactical blunder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redistribution bill in one measure . By doing so he would have arrayed against the combined measure all the members whose political interests were threatened by the change in their " districts . " This is what the Lords would have liked to see him do , simply because it would have been a gross tactical blunder , and would have endangered the bill and very likely secured its defeat in the House of Commons . The leaders in the Lords are as well aware as anybody else that they have no chance of winning in an avowed contest with the Commons . In that case they would be compelled to back down with as much grace as they could command . But if they could have thrown an apple of discord into the Commons by forcing every Liberal member to consider at the same time the principle of an enlarged suffrage and the prospect of his retaining his own seat with an enlarged and otherwise changed constituency , their work would have been done for them by the alarm which such a prospect would excite in the Commons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . This is really the political issue in Great Britain just now . Mr. GLADSTONE ohcumambulated it with his usual ' impressiveness in his two hours ' speech at Edinburgh . He pointed out that the subject of complete electoral reform was too complicated to be contained in one measure , that the Government meant to bring in a Redistribution bill , that the Franchise bill would not go into operation until after there had been ample time in which to pass a Redistribution bill , and so forth . In the House of Commons he was franker , saying , in effect , in answer to a question upon his speech introducing the Franchise bill why he did not at the same time introduce the Redistribution bill , that he was too old and wary to be caught in that trap . The tone of the speech at Edinburgh , we repeat , is strikingly apologetic compared with that of the speeches in the Commons . But the main fact to be borne in mind is that the division between the parties in England is not upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer venture openly to oppose . It is simply whether Mr. GLADSTONE shall gratify his opponents by introducing a bill which is sure to create dissensions in his own party while the Franchise bill is still pending .
