txt The Civil Service Commissioners are not embarrassed , as some of their newspaper critics would lead people to believe , by the new questions brought before them through the change of Administration . Nor do they discover that the President has changed his views about the civil service or that he has any desire to change the Civil Service Commissioners . The Post , which generally sustains the merit system , found in the appointment of Joseph B. Fowler , recently dismissed from the office of Chief of the Pension Division , Third Auditor 's Office , Treasury Department , a case suggesting a break from the civil service rules and a possible opening of the doors to let in a great many new employes . If the civil service rules had been consulted it would have been found that Mr. Fowler 's appointment to a third class clerkship in the division from which he had been dismissed was an entirely proper one . Rule 16 , clause 5 , prevides that any person appointed to or employedin any part of the classified service . after due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dismissed or separated therefrom without fault or delinquency on his part may be reappointed or re-employed in the same part or grade of such eery ice in the same department or office within one year next following such dismissal or separation , without further examination , on such certification as the commission may provide . Mr. Fowler was in office at the time the civil service rules went into effect , and it . is assumed in such oases that the persons in office are Qualified , and the rules apply to them as if they had been recommended by the commission for appointment . Another question has been bropght up by the Interior Department , which still " remains to he decided . According to the manual of the department there are 11 divisions , each with its chief , who is designated and set apart from the clerks . In the appropriation bill providing for the payment of the department employes the chiefs of divisions in all but three instances are classed as clerks . The question to be decided apparently is whether the manual or the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is followed the chiefs who are held to be outside the civil service rules can be removed summarily . If the law is followed all but three of them must be regarded as clerks in the classified service , and if removed their places would be open to candidates presented by the certification of the Commission . The decision will affect seven employes in the Interior Department . The President yesterday , upon the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners . amended rule 11 so as to provide that no Person who has not been ... , absolutely appointed or employed after probation shall be admitted to examination within two years thereafter . This amendment was suggested by the reappearance before the commission for examination of persons who had been appointed on probation and who had been dismissed as unsatisfactory . The exclusion of such persons from the examinations for two years was regarded as a just provision by those candidates for appointment who have not bad opportunity to prove by service their qualifications for service beyond those shown in the examination .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
