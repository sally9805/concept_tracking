LIFE IN FLORENCE . I HAVE SO often expressed an indifference to art , or to the antique , that friends incessantly ask me ( with a touch of indignation in their tone ) why I chose to live for fifteen years in Florence  --  a place of which the chief attractions were these very things . I have always replied , " Because I loved it . " " But why love it , if you are blind to its charms ? " The question is a natural one , and my answer a womanly one . I loved it because I loved it . I felt an affection for every dirty old broken-down house , merely because it was in Florence ; I loved the pigeons that walked about the streets ; I loved the air I breathed there , I loved the stones , I loved the streets , the old macaroni stores , and , in fact , everything that was connected with it . And yet there was no particular virtue in these separate items , nor did I love them as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned closely , I should condemn the broken-down houses as most unsightly , the pigeons as being like other pigeons ( only a shade dirtier , perhaps ) , the air as being decidedly raw the greater part of the winter , and the streets as too crowded with one 's fellowcreatures - bumping and hustling each other with no sort of ceremony ; and yet all these are a part of Florence , and help to make it what it is , one of the most fascinating , lovable cities in the world . Once caught there , but very few are able to extricate themselves from the web of its allurements . The foreign society is always shifting and changing , but faces seen there once are sure to be seen twice , and those who go there for a few weeks ' visit , are rarely satisfied with less than as many months ; and often a stay of a few years is apt to end in a permanent residence , for after close acquaintance no place on earth can give one such entire satisfaction . Visitors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to pay her relatives a week 's visit and staid thirty years . Now , why is this ? I could name a score of disagreeable traits characteristic of Florentines , and the most prominent are to be found amongst the lower class , who are lazy , ignorant , and totally innocent of truth . Lying is a real pleasure to them , and they do not half enjoy the attainment of an object unless by some roundabout means , probably entirely unnecessary . They sweep truth off the face of the earth as a superfluous commodity too tame and commonplace to he endured . However , reaching the point it does with them , falsehood becomes a virtue by reason of its consistency . One of their marked peculiarities is dislike to water , either for washing or drinking . In fact , I scarcely understand why nature should have provided it in that region at all , they avoid it so studiously . The American and English residents , according to their ancient rites , insist upon the use of it once a week for the washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the same purpose twice a year ! I do not by this mean to imply that they wear the same garments for six months , and so must explain that when married the bride is provided with an unconscionably large trousseau , which enables her to avoid the weekly washes prevalent in most other countries . Being a most economical race , their idea , probably , is that too much washing wears out and tears , and also , being lazy , that it gives trouble . As to the drinking of water , they look upon that as downright insanity . The water in Florence is not as pure and wholesome as in America , but it is not so bad as to make it dangerous . Their home-made red wine is so cheap as to bring it within the means of all , even the poorest beggar , who will manage to scrape together a few centimes to buy his " daily " wine . They even think it a risk to give children water alone , and , from the time they are weaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is strange to see children scarcely three years old seated at dinner each with his tumbler of wine . And yet , probably , there is no more temperate race in the world ,  --  a drunken man being a very rare sight in Florence . Lately , however , drunkenness has begun to show itself . Some years ago the grape crop failed , and for that year the people , of course not being able to drink water , were obliged to have recourse to rum punch . This was too strong for their unaccustomed heads , and , worse than all , gave them a taste for liquor , which they had not previously had , making them unwilling to return to their comparatively insipid vino nos/rale ( domestic wine ) . Florentines are very fond of gambling , but in the smallest kind of a way . They become as much excited over a two-sous // stake as others would be over two thousand francs . The public lottery is their " true , true love . " Such infatuation and superstition I never saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe from that villainous institution . Year after year of constant loss never serves to convince this confiding people that they can gain nothing , unless by a great stroke of most exceptional luck . The lottery consists of ninety numbers , five of which are drawn every Saturday , at two o'clock , in the public square . During the week the gambler selects his number , staking his money upon the chance of that number being one of the five drawn . According to the amount risked , is the sum won . He may also bet on two numbers , or three , or four , or all five . This , naturally , lessens his chances of winning , but it increases the amount he would win , should his numbers be drawn . However , one rarely bets on all five numbers , as winning in such a case would be almost a miracle . And yet , most curiously , such a thing once happened . First , let me explain that with the Florentines every occurrence in life has its own especial number-as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should any public calamity or rejoicing take place , its number is immediately selected in the lottery by all these superstitious people . Each one owns a book wherein is published the number belonging to every heard-of , or unheard-of incident that can by any possibility occur to the human race . This is their daily oracle , unless , as I said before , some great national event supersedes the necessity of such a divining-book . A few years ago , all Florence arose in one great superstitious body , *nd put its money on certaiiY five numbers relating to the anniversary of the late Pope 's birthday . One of the numbers was nine , another was the year of his birth ( taking the last two figures only ) , a third was , the day of the month , a fourth his age , and a fifth the number of years he had reigned . Strange to say , every number came up , and the excitement all over the city was tremendous . This was temporarily a fearful stroke of ill-luck for the National Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the people 's credulity having been so strengthened by this extraordinary coincidence as to cause them to bet more rashly and blindly than ever . A few months after this event , while the circumstance was fresh in every mind , a story got about that a monk had made his appearance in Florence , and with great solemnity and impressiveness had predicted five other numbers that would be infallible . Of course , the whole town rushed pell-mell to the lottery office , and th , e result was as might be expected-disappointment . Not one of the numbers predicted was drawn . The excitement was so intense that there were rumors of mobbing the monk , but the next thing heard was that he had quietly left Florence on the day of the drawing . So long as this outrageous system of gambling is legalized , so long will the Italians be poor , for every centime is saved to be hopelessly swallowed up in this accursed institution . Winning by it is so rare that the exceptional cases are known far and wide . One peculiar case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home late one night from his weary round , conceived the thought of enter-. ing a caf6 for refreshment . He did so , but , the refreshment being strong , it got into his head . In this state he staggered off to the lottery office to stake his weekly franc , but , in the condition of things , being unable to see plainly , he drew from his pocket a twenty-franc piece , his savings for many a weary month , and his cherished treasure . The next morning , discovering his loss , he was almost beside himself . Conjecturing at once the whole state of the case , he rushed headlong to the office and there implored the ticket-seller to restore it to him . He cried like a baby ( Italians all do that , however , on the smallest provocation ) , he tore his hair , he raved , he threw himself upon the ground , but all in vain . Nothing could move the hard heart of the ticket-seller , who had got twenty francs and intended keeping it . The poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week went about like one possessed , unable to work , unable to do anything but howl aloud over his stupidity and ruin . On the next drawing of the lottery he was the triumphant possessor of 20,000 francs . The Florentines are an economical race , and can live on less , probably , than any other people in the world . They are content with a very little-not requiring even what we should call the necessaries of life . Their diet is principally dry bread ( butter they rarely eat ) , coffee , macaroni , " lesso " ( boiled beef ) , and " minestra , "  --  the weakest of wishy-washy soups . The last two are daily inevitable ; no matter what else theyeat , " lesso " and " minestra " they must have , or they would consider themselves defrauded of their rights . It is easy to live in Florence economically , for marketing is // arranged to suit purses of any size , and one can buy any part of a chicken , even to a slice of the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only enough for one day 's consumption is ever provided . it is really amusing to see the Florentines bargain . They would not consider a thing properly bought under a half an hour 's talking and argument . Buying and selling is reduced to a system and a regular routine , which , if neglected , would make them unhappy , and consider themselves as cheated beings . Their greatest triumph is the purchase of an article at the lowest rate possible , and this is a source of boasting for the next twenty-four hours . They will haggle over two or three centimes until an American looker-on could cry aloud in desperation at their absurdity . They gesticulate , both talk at the same time , and lash themselves into such a state of excitement that one would think they were concocting no less a plan than to dethrone the king . Von Biilow tells a story apropos of Italian trading , very amusing , and scarcely exaggerated . A man , observing in a shopwindow an article marked twelve francs , thus reasoned to himself : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shopman will offer it for eight . It is not worth more than six . I do n't want to give more than four-so I 'll offer him two ! " This suggests the principles upon which trade is carried on . I venture to give an illustration of the process , in the words that I have heard so often that they glide off the end of my pen without an instant 's hesitation : Buyer : " What 's the price of that hat ? " Seller : " Twelve francs , sir . " B. ( In a tone of astonishment . ) " Twelve francs ? Heavens ! What a price ! " S. " It 's not dear , sir . You could n't get it as cheap anywhere else in town . " B. " Nonsense ! What 's the lowest price you 'll take for it ? S. " Well , as it 's you , I 'll give it for eleven . " B. " Per Bacco . Why , it 's not worth half that . " S. " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wont give a centime over six francs . " ( This very decidedly , as *f he really meant it . ) S. " Six francs ! Why , it cost me more than that B. " Go along ! " ( Tries on the hat , which is very becoming , and continues , in a oaxing tone . ) " Come , now , let 's finish this affair . Name your price . " S. " Well , well , take it for ten . " ( Seizing it as though everything was settled , and hurriedly wrapping it up . ) B. " Stop , stop ! I 'm not going to give that price . " ( Makes for the doo5 as though he also thought the affair ended . ) S. " Stop , sir ! Tell me now , frankly , the highest price you will give . " ( This in an encouraging tone , with head on one side and a sweet smile . ) B. " Come , I 'll give you seven . " ( Makes show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome offer that would be snapped at . ) S. ( Now beginning to get excited . ) " This is more than I can bear ! We will talk no more about it ! " B. ( Seeing too much decision in adversary 's manner . ) " Well , come now ! How much will you take ? I 'll give you eight - there ! " S. " No , no , no / I wont sacrifice the hat ! " This is the right moment for the buyer to rush from the shop , sometimes even getting to the corner of the street , when the excited seller will dash after him , imploring him to come back and take it for nine and a half . Then work begins in earnest , and they rise and fall alternately by half-francs , and sometimes fight over the last two sous , when the bargain is completed amidst a torrent of words and wild gestures and glaring of eyes , which , to the uninitiated , would look very like a blood-thirsty combat . The conqueror ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as proud as the victor of a score of battles , to show his hard-won treasure to admiring friends , who turn it over and peer at it and examine it critically , praising him for his shrewdness in making such a bargain . This hat will be a source of happiness to him for two or three days , making him a hero to a circle of admirers , to whom he will go over the same old story twenty times , relating his powers at bargain-making with as much interest and energy the twentieth time as the first . The English merchants in Florence say that when they see an Italian coming into the store to buy , they at once add a few francs to the price of their goods , knowing that those few francs must be taken off before he will buy . By this means , they get the price they would originally ask an Englishman . With all this , the Florentines are not avaricious . They only look upon a shopkeeper as their natural enemy for the time they are dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutches as so much added to the store to be saved for amusements . For the sake of an evening at the theater , or a few hours at a masked ball during the months of carnival , the Florentines will pinch and save for months , and their enjoyment of these things is as intense as a child 's . Their histrionic taste generally inclines to the old melodrama , in which the villain is the intensest kind of a villain ; is secret and dark , and ready for any iniquitous proceeding , and in which Innocence is of the most saint-like order , which appeals constantly and in a loud voice to heaven , with virtuous indignation , and which comes off triumphant in the end , causing the villain to shrivel up into a small heap of baffled rage and spite . This style of performance will cause these excitable people to shout and hoot in derision at the unfortunate actor representing the scoundrel , and to applaud with loud " bravos " the sallow , dirty-looking girl who , under the guise of Virtue , flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out " Hafatto bene / ( you have done well ) , or to the ruffian " Birbone I " ( rascal ) , or shout out a little timely counsel to persecuted Virtue . With such child-like qualities as I have described , a propensity to murder would scarcely be consistent , and yet the general impression in America , I find , is that the entire lives of Italians are given up to creeping about in a stealthy manner , for the purpose of finding some one to kill . There are even a few  --  a very few , though-who always picture to themselves an Italian as a dark , frowning ruffian wearing a slouch felt hat , ornamented with a long black plume , a loose cloak wrapped around him , one end being thrown over his shoulder , and with a dagger  --  a good old conventional daggerclutched firmly and desperately . Now , of all peoples , I really must give the Florentines credit for being the most peaceable . In a densely packed crowd  --  a position probably more conducive to strong language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger or quarreling-nothing but laughter and good-natured jokes against one another . They take everything easy , and find something to enjoy in every position in which they happen to be placed . Respect for rank is part of the education of the lower classes . Their superiors can not exact too much , but are born to be waited on , and should do nothing but amuse themselves or lounge in an ele gant way in their drawing-rooms , and ring for the servants on the smallest pretense , such as wanting a book from a table at the other end of the room . Your servants are apt to lose respect for you and think you no better than themselves , should you demean yourself by opening a window or helping yourself in any other small way to save them trouble . This is the one thing that makes them such capital servants . They are taught , not only to do everything that is told them , whether it is their business or not , but to do it with a cheerful face and polite manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night to sweep every room in the house , he would look so happy , when you gave him the order , as to impress you with the feeling that sweeping the house in the middle of the night was the one thing he had eagerly looked forward to all the days of his life . Their respect is shown in the smallest things ; in their very way of standing in your presence , or in the tones of their voice when taking your orders . They are carefully instructed in every movement when in the presence of their superiors . I once heard a Florentine lady angrily complaining of the stupidity of a new butler ; she said she had been trying to teach him how to enter a room and hand her a note with the proper blending of grace , elegance and respect , and was obliged to make him repeat this ceremony one day , with an imaginary note , six or eight times before he succeeded in doing it to her satisfaction . With all this subserviency on the part of the Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most annoying proceeding , the reverse of respect being shown her . This is accounted for by the fact that ladies are never expected to be seen but in their carriages , or sauntering about the cascine , followed by their footmen ; therefore , the Florentines can not understand the independent ways of American ladies , and in the street look upon us as belonging to their own class . A lady has to fight her way heroically , and must expect to get shoved about and hustled into the muddiest places . This is. of course , exasperating , and at times I would lose all patience and occasionally attempt to get the better of my assailants . I never shall forget how ingloriously I came off in one of these encounters . The day was damp , the streets muddy , and the sidewalks too narrow for two persons to pass each other easily . I had been hopping down off the pavement all day , to make way for these men , until // at last my temper rose and I resolved to put up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met down into the mud . Accordingly I came face to face with a goodnatured-looking creature , whom I thought it would be easy to overthrow , and resolutely took my stand , showing , by a determined and unconquerable expression of face , that nothing could induce me to move from that spot . He stopped , looked at me a moment with some surprise , then , seizing me suddenly , he waltzed me round to the other side of him , and continued on his way . I stood there looking after him ,  - -  on the spot he had whirled me to ,  --  entirely speechless with rage , and I felt that I was drawn up to my full height and flashing lightning from my eyes . But it was quite thrown away upon him , as he went on entirely unconscious of offense , and , if he thought of it at all , only pleased with himself as having hit upon so clever an expedient to save us both from the mud . Only one other time did I assert my rights upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not step down from the sidewalk . This time my grand manner and imposing appearance had effect , and my opponent hurriedly made way for me , evidently laboring under the impression , in a bewildered , weak-minded way , that I was some great state dignitary , who chose to be eccentric for that occasion and rove about Florence alone . On a rainy day , the men would always keep close to the sides of the houses under their broad eaves ,  --  the only dry part of the pavement ,  --  until I finally hit upon an expedient to rout them , which was simply carrying my open umbrella close before my face , and charging at them with the points . They would hop nimbly out of the way as they saw me dashing recklessly along , supposing I did not see them coming , and only on one occasion was I obliged to scratch the sticks of my weapon across the face of a man who attempted making a stand in front of me ; but I did it with such an innocent air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it accidental . Rudeness toward women is not confined to the lower classes , for I have seen ladies again and again subjected to such conduct , from the young nobles of Florence , as an American man of any class would blush to think of . They will stand in crowds about the door of their club , filling the whole sidewalk , and unless a lady passing be personally known to them they will not stir a step to make room for her , not only allowing her to go into the middle of the street , but staring and smiling at her in the most insulting way , as she tries to shrink by unnoticed , and often calling her " angela , " or " be/la , " or " carliza . " Such rudenesses and other annoyances are only experienced by ladies who walk alone . When a lady is accompanied by one of the muscular sex , none more weak than the Florentines , they being by no means a courageous race . They are , indeed ,  --  not to put too fine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady spoken to by a street loafer who supposed her alone , and when the husband stepped forward and faced him with an angry glare , it was amusing to see his attempts at looking unconscious , his cough of unconcern and vacant gaze into the sky . That the Italians are lazy , in every class , high and low , it is scarcely necessary for me to state . Those of the lower classes will work , of course , being obliged to do so , but in a very unenergetic way and by fits and starts , as they require a little money . Go to your shoemaker , order a pair of boots , and you will get them in two days , should he at that time have need of a few francs for the lottery or theater ; otherwise you may as well make up your mind to have your old boots blackened up , and to make the best of them for another month . You need not send to him , nor go to him , nor scold him , nor reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high state of indignation every day for weeks , and only wear out your temper and your boots more than ever , gaining nothing thereby . He would meet you with the same good-natured smile , exasperating you with his invariable " Pazienza " ( patience ) , an admonition which will never fail to make you lose the little of that meritorious quality that may remain . You might perhaps be inclined to wait with some attempt at good nature , could you be sure that your boots would be satisfactor*r when you did get them . But as surely as the sun rises in the east will they be nowhere near your size , your measure having been forgotten in the lapse of time , and the whole experience has to be repeated again . This may seem like exaggeration , but , on the contrary , is a rather mild statement of the fact . I remember a very severe battle I had with a book-binder , who was six months doing a small piece of work for me . During the first few weeks , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound and sent home . The invariable answer was , " The signora shall have them to-morrow . " Toward the end of the fifth month I sent almost every day , not for the bound books , but merely for the two volumes in their original state , as they were first put into his hands . All in vain . Then I sent threats of claiming my property by means of the police , and several times sent a servant with orders not to leave the shop without them . There is an intensity of rage which causes extreme outward calm , and even suavity of manner ; I had now reached that stage , and was determined to conquer or die . I decided to try the effect of a personal interview . As I entered his shop he approached me with a sweet smile , supposing me a new customer . At sight of him , my rage becoming greater , my manner became , proportionately blander , and I said , with an equally sweet smile : " I am the proprietor of two books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His smile took a sickly hue , but , true to his colors , he said : " Oh , yes , you shall have them to-morrow . " My only reply was , " Give me a pen and paper . " He did so wonderingly , and with a slight look of alarm , as though he espied gleams of insanity . " Now , " I said , sternly but quietly , " write these words : " I promise to send to-morrow to their rightful owner two hooks , which I have had in my possession , for the purpose of hinding , since May 2d . L. MorroNl . " He demurred at this proceeding as being a little out of the usual course , but I merely said , " Write , or I will go at once for the police , " whereupon he hurriedly complied . So I got my books and bound , too , but he was true to himself to the last-not sending them the next day , but the day after that . He was as difficult to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle , partly because labor is cheap , and partly because it is not considered elegant nor befitting a high station to be occupied in anything that bears the remotest resemblance to usefulness . Their ideas are exclusively confined to dress , amusements of all kinds and flirting . Their chief delight is the theater or opera , where they go every night , not to be interested or amused by the play or the music , but to meet one another . However , let me do them the justice to say that inattention to the opera is scarcely to be wondered at , as there is so little worth listening to in that way . New or even good operas are rarely put upon the stage , and the singing , as a general rule , is mediocre . The reason of this is obvious , viz. : no great singer will condescend to take the very small compensation offered by the Florentine managers , consequently only de'butanfes are heard . Many of these poor struggling girls , far from expecting even a moderate sum for their exertions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first few months , without compensation . They merely sing as a trial , that their future may be decided on . The critics of whom they are most afraid , and who really are the makers or marrers of their musical reputation , are those of the middle class-mechanics , shopkeepers , etc . I was very much astonished , a few days after my arrival in Florence , to hear our butler , a gray-haired , respectable person for his class , criticise the singer of the evening before with nice judgment , seeing small defects , and using language you would expect only from an educated musician . " She had a good voice , " he said , " but her method was bad-her vocalizahon only tolerable , " etc . It is sad , indeed , to see a nation once so musical , and still with the natural gift of music in their souls , thus sinking into mediocrity . Too jealous and too swallowed up in self-conceit to keep in the line of progress with other nations , the Italians are content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent as the opera is there , it is always patronized . Each lady has her own private box ( which is among the things stipulated for in the marriage settlement by her father ) ; here she sits and receives the gentlemen of her acquaintance , who visit from box to box  --  a nightly New Year 's - until the end of the play . Then she repairs to her house , and at midnight her reception begins again  --  the hour at which most of the fashionable women open their doors . Until two or three o'clock , or even later , this entertainment lasts , consisting of card-playing , smoking and love-making . Then the party breaks up , and these intellectual beings retire to their beds , where they remain until twelve o'clock the next day . Then they rise and breakfast , smoke a cigarette and dress for visiting  --  a lengthy occupation , as the minutest details must be perfectly carried out , each gentleman being especially particular to see that the flowers for his button-hole harmonize with the color of his coat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " swells " upon this subject . Then comes visiting , and after that the event of the day , viz. , the drive to the cascine , where the band plays in the open square , and where people drive up and down in their carriages , perpetually meeting each other . This is their daily routine , and all that they live for . They have no resources , and , when the early dinners of summer begin , they fill the air with lamentations of ennui , and say they have nothing to do between dinner and the hour for driving . The trouble is , very distinctly , want of education . They are superficially brilliant-quick at repartee and society small-talk , but deeper than that they can not go . They have no solid education and are deplorably ignorant . They do not even get the knowledge acquired by travel , for they live and die in their beloved Florence , never imagining that they can be happy out of it , and so not trying the experiment . As to crossing the ocean , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower classes carry their ignorance to a point that is quite charming . They have rather a feeling of patronage toward Americans as being a sort of Italian creation . They say that , had it not been for one of them , we never should have been discovered . My maid once asked me , quite earnestly , if America was as large as the Baths of Lucca  --  a village of a few hundred inhabitants . I brought to this country with me an Italian girl , as child 's nurse , who was sublime in her knowledge of nothing at all . While making preparations for the voyage her mind was ever on the stretch , fearing that she might forget to lay in some common , necessary article that it would be impossible to find in the small town of America . She asked me if it would not be advisable to get herself a pair of india-rubber shoes before leaving Italy , and I could scarcely convince her that the very shoes she purchased there were sent from America . She also wanted soda , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common buttons strung on a thread . She confessed to me , one day , after having been here several months , that she had expected to find us all with monkey heads . She had been told by a friend , she said , that such was our physiognomy . Even royalty is not so well informed as it might be on points of general knowledge . This I discovered upon the occasion of my presentation at court , when Tuscany was under the rule of its last Grand Duke . I stood in the long line of ladies , waiting my turn to be honored with a word or glance from his Highness , feeling a little nervous lest I should fail in some court etiquette , to which , naturally , a an American , I was unaccustomed . I watched closely as the Grand Duke spoke to each one , and noticed one marked rule that he must not be spoken to first . His chamberlain , who followed him closely , pfesented the lady , who courtesied to the ground , and then stood respectfully awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great man stood fairly in front of me , and the moment of my trial had come . I braced myself to do all things required of me with the utmost propriety and rigidity of demeanor , when , to my horror , I was pushed aside by an old gentleman who had accompanied me ' and had been standing behind me , and who , in a loud tone and with a pompous ring to the voice ( as who should say , Listen , Grand Duke , and humble your haughty head ) , exclaimed in English : " This young lady , your Highness , is the grand-daughter of Washington 's aid-decamp . " Heavens ! Was there no mouse-hole that I could creep into and be no more seen ? Could I not gather up my skirts about my feet and make one good run for it , and get out of the view of all those faces looking at me with a half-perplexed , half-amused smile ? The poor Duke looked utterly bewildered , seeming at a loss what to do . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an abrupt presentation addressed to the sovereign himself , and not through the grand chamberlain ; in the next place , the language employed was English-an unknown tongue ; and in the third place , even had he understood , Washington 's aid-de-camp was of no importance in his mind , and , indeed , one might doubt strongly if he had ever even heard of Washington himself . However , after a minute or two , which seemed to me weeks in duration , he bowed to me , muttering something about " happy to meet you , " and " fine day , " and passed on . When the presentations were past , the good Duke evidently thought the matter over and made some historical inquiries , finally coming to the conclusion that Washington had been a great man somewhere or other , and that his aid-decamp was entitled to honor . The consequence was that the next thing I was aware of was the hurrying to and fro of the great court dignitaries in search of Washington 's aid-de-camp , who was to be found at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with due formality . Naturally their search was fruitless , but for months afterward I went , among my friends , by the name of " Washington 's aid-de-camp . " The old gentleman who got me into this dilemma was General M , a man well known , of southern birth , who had been in the war of 1812 . He was a gentleman df the old school , and most attractive in every way , but unused to European customs , as one may suppose . After the frightful incident just recorded , General M- distinguished himself still further , in the course of the evening , but fortunately this time only to his own detriment . He had never seen " the German " danced , and consequently saw no reason why he should not seat himself in one of the chairs which he saw vacant in that charmed circle . He did so , but was rather astonished when he was requested to leave it by the gentleman to whom it belonged , and who had just been dancing in one of the figures . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty , he got up and took that . The rightful owner of that one , also , soon returned , claiming his proprietorship with a polite bow . General Mbegan to look vexed , and muttered something not complimentary to the dancer ; however , again he moved . And so the thing went on : as each couple left to dance in turn he would take the empty seat , until , finally , his patience o'er-leaped its bounds , and he sturdily refused to vacate the premises , in these remarkable words : " I 'll be damned if I move another peg ! " His adversary , being Italian , understood not one word of this uncourtly speech , but seeing by General M- 's manner that there was rage in the room somewhere , he became a little fierce himself . Thereupon the General burst into a torrent of words , saying he would not be chased about the room by a pack of whipper-snappers , and using at the same time a little strong language . At last he handed his card to the foe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this point , a young American , seeing the trouble , came to the rescue , and with great tact smoothed it all over , by interpreting the savage expressions in each language as apologies and regrets , whereupon the antagonists shook hands , both accepting the excuses which neither had made . The general impression in this country seems to be that the Italian women are all very beautiful ; nothing could be more erroneous . In the lower classes one sometimes sees an uncommonly lovely face , with true classic features , reminding him of the madonnas and saints of the old masters ; but he scarcely recognizes it as handsome until some little time passed in Italy has accustomed his eye to that peculiar style , so different from that of our own countrywomen , who are now universally acknowledged to be the most beautiful women in the world . With the regular features of the Italians there will always remain the sallow complexion and coarse hair . Among the upper classes , eyes are all that are possessed in the way of beauty . Those features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know well how to use them to advantage . Their features must be regular if they expect to lay claim to any beauty , for they never have-what will make many a woman pretty who has nothing in the way of features but a turned-up nose and largish mouth , and eyes of no particular charm  --  the beauty of youth . A young face is rarely seen . I am firmly persuaded that they are thirty years old when they are born ; at any rate , I have never seen a woman in Florence look a day younger , but very many several days older . These remarks refer entirely to the female portion . The men are handsome ,  --  never very manly in appearance , but with very uncommon beauty of coloring , expression and features . In manner the Italians are a polished race , with a gloss of refinement which goes no deeper than the surface , their true nature being coarse , with not so much delicacy of thought and feeling as you would find in the most uneducated American . The men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , to be wondered at , for their loose , unhinged ideas of propriety do not serve to make them objects of respect . Fashionable life in Italy is undoubtedly most corrupt , and the least said about it the better . Religion in Italy is fast dying out , and a very large part of the Florentines are not far removed from infidels . Rome has been edging on , and arrogating so much to herself , that even the ignorant have been startled into a bewildered feeling that all was not as it should be . I one day saw a young man in the open streets of Florence put his thumb to his nose at the Pope 's Nuncio , who was passing in his carriage . The common priests have no respect at all shown them , and , on the day of Victor Emmanuel 's entrance into Rome , not one dared show himself in the // street for fear of being killed . One of the Archbishops of the Church had not illuminated his house on the evening of that day , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of an awakened people . The mob surrounded his palace , shouting for him in most peremptory and threatening style , forcing him , finally , not only to appear upon the balcony , but to shout , " Viva L'I/alia ! Viva Vi/torlo Emmanuele I " Having mentioned many traits in the Florentine character that are far from attractive , it is time to acknowledge any merit that they may have . Their conduct during the revolution of 1859 was noble in its moderation and gentle forbearance . The whole affair was carried through quietly but determinedly-no threatenings , no violent outbreaks , no assassinations , no lawlessness of any kind . A committee went to the Grand Duke , and politely but firmly requested him to leave Florence , with all the royal family . The poor old man quietly accepted what he saw was inevitable , simply bowing his head in acquiescence . The next day the ducal carriages were seen driving through the streets , carrying the saddened and outcast family past the gates they would never more enter . They drove by our villa  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole scene was most touching ; inside the carriage , the old Duke , sad and hopeless , his head bowed in utter dejection ; outside , the people lining the road to witness his departure , and taking their hats off in respectful and courteous silence . Not one word of derision or triumph was heard ; they had gained their point , and with true generosity of heart forbore to insult the fallen . Why is it that so many Americans choose Florence as their residence ? Why , I ask again , do foreigners who live there enjoy every moment of their existence , knowing only light-heartedness and catching the spirit of the Italians themselves , entering into everything gaily and joyously , letting the morrow take care of itself ? There is no doubt in the world that it is chiefly owing to the absence of small worries in the housekeeping line . There the house takes care of itself ; and rolls along on the easiest of casters . The extent of your housekeeping in Florence is to look over the cook 's accounts once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very particular , you can lock up your candles and sugar , giving them out when required . Your cook goes to market daily , choosing provisions to the amount that he VOL . XX. - 2o. knows you wish to lay out for one day 's consumption , each item of which he puts down in a book for your inspection . You are never obliged to order your dinner , or , in fact , give it any thought . The utmost labor you will undergo is the eating of it when cooked . Think of that , you poor heartbroken American housekeeper , whose mind can rarely soar above beef ,  --  one-half of your day being occupied in buying your food and the other half in trying to teach your obstinate or ignorant cook how to prepare it . Some people make an arrangement with their cook to serve them for a certain sum weekly , but this is not a common custom , for experience has taught that one does not fare as well nor as cheaply in the long run , the cook generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he can save . Few servants are required for an averagesized family , as they know their place and work for you indiscriminately and promiscuously , not informing you every hour of the , day that such and such a thing is " not their business . " And what wonder that women , old before their time from constant conflicts for the sake of house and home , fly in despair to that refuge of rest and peace , where , in a few years , they regain all their freshness and spirits , and " servants " form no longer a topic of conversation , only being thought of at all when an order is to be issued . Suppose you expect a dinner-party of eight guests . You merely send word to the cook to have a good dinner ready for that number , and tell your waiter , to whom you pay from $xo to $12 a month , to lay so many plates . Perhaps you intend having a " conversazwne " of sixty or seventy people . Instead of providing oysters , salads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will all have to be prepared out of the house , you have a table set with tea , sandwiches and cake-that is all ; and any one who wants such refreshments in the course of the evening can help himself at any moment . Of course , for a ball supper is required , particularly as the guests always stay until daylight . One memorable ball , a most magnificent affair altogether , was kept up until eleven o'clock the next morning . The dancing-room was only opened at one o'clock , supper was at four , the German commenced at six , breakfast ( chocolate , etc. ) was served at eight , when dancing recommenced and continued until eleven o'clock . To return to the housekeeping : a small family can often live comfortably with only two servants , as // you can engage the cook to take care of the parlors and wait on table , while a woman will see to the bed-rooms and very likely take care of a child or two , and mend their clothes , etc . Everything is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three children and three servants , can live comfortably and yet not pay more than $25 or $30 a week for all the food consumed in the house . This will include meat , vegetables , butter , bread-everything , in fact , even red wine and coal for cooking . These are prices of five years ago ; what they are now I should not venture to say , as every year makes a difference . Indeed , before we left there we were obliged to raise our cook 's wages from $6 to $8 , and felt that we were ruined . A woman , too , who had been with us for several years , who was nurse , chamber-maid , lady's-maid , seamstress , and anything else that she was told to be , had her wages raised to $6 , which we felt was more than we could stand . Mere passing travelers can not live as cheaply as this , for the Florentines have two distmct prices-one for Italians and one for Americans . This they do not hesitate to acknowledge . I would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I am a Florentine . " " Ah , I did not know that , " would be the response ; " then , of course , you shall have it for less . " One suffers intolerably from cold in Florence , not so much on account of the outside air , but owing to the inadequate arrangements for heating the houses , and to the stone floors , the chillness of which will penetrate to your feet through the thickest carpet . There is small doubt that the absence of fumace-heat is most desirable as regards health , but it seems cruel that no happy medium can be struck between that and no heat at all ,  --  between floating about one 's house in a light costume and thin slippers , and huddling over a few small sticks of wood , smouldering in a most minute fire-place , wrapped up in the thickest clothes , with shawls on , and your feet clad in the heaviest walking-boots . The only true way to keep warm there is to go outdoors and stay out , and this probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be acceptable , if it were only used to light up the dark entrances to houses , in many of which one is *obliged almost to grope his way up the prison-like stone stairs  --  the common property of each set of apartments on the different stories . The charming society of the resident Americans and English , of which there is quite a large circle , is a very great attraction , but Florence suits all tastes , and those who like variety can get it to perfection in the traveling society . As it is impossible to get the natives to move from it , so in due proportion , making the most accurate balance , do the Americans fly in and out , hither and thither , until one is almost dazed . These restless mortals never seem able to stay in one place a week . You scarcely get acquainted with their names before they have gone , and another Jack-in-the-box jumps up at you . You would scarcely be astonished to see one of these unsettled beings in the course of an introduction fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . It requires a constant , painful effort of memory to distinguish and remember names and faces . Every sort of person from every sort of motive goes to Florence , making the close observation of men and manners there a most amusing study . Some go there for their health , some for gayety , some for rest and some for excitement ; some because they have lost money and wish to economize , and others because they have made a fortune and want to spend it . Among the last-named came a lady of newly acquired wealth , wishing to purchase copies of the old masters to ornament her New York residence . She was much pleased with the picture of " Judith and Holofernes , " and stood entranced before it , watching the grand pose of Judith , as shestands erect and daring , with the sword in one hand and the bloody head of Holofernes suspended in triumph in the other . She at once went to an artist and ordered a copy of this renowned work , with only one " slight " alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous and uncomfortable , so she desired that Judith should hold a basket of flowers instead . I was walking one day through the Uffizzi Palace , when I heard a voice calling out : " Papa , come here , and look at Titian 's Flora . " ' I turned , and beheld one of the commonest sights in Florence-an American family dutifully going through the orthodox wonders of the place , with no glimmer of real appreciation for the works of art about them . The reply of the worthy man I shall never forget , nor its tone of mildly reproaching astonishment : " My dear , I do n't want to see that . I have a copy of it at home , you know . " But as a display of real and unblushing // ignorance , what I am now about to relate is entirely satisfactory . An American youth , who was " doing " the sights under the escort of a friend residing in Florence , was shown , among other works of art , the famous group of " The Rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , and unable to see its meaning , his friend explained it , telling him briefly the historical event which the marble figures represented . He listened with rapt attention and with evident interest , and then , stroking his chin with a thoughtful air , he exclaimed : " Ah ! Did that occur lately ? " These anecdotes serve as specimens to show one sort of traveling foreigner in European lands . It was my fortune to know of a tourist of a different stamp , one of the most remarkable characters of his kind . During our residence in Florence a young man suddenly arose in the social horizon who took the city by storm-not owing to his appearance , certainly , which was rather common , nor to his manners , which were so easy that an enemy might incline to call them impertinent . He was high-born and rich , therefore no enemy appeared . He was high-born , for he announced himself to be of the English Douglases ; he was rich , for he gave grand entertainments , at which all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic magnificence . He gave splendid presents to the ladies , kept a running account at all the l ) rincipal stores , was seen everywhere dashing about , and was regarded with envy by thousands . He was honored by notice from high places , was one of the two or three selected as fit guests to meet Lord Russell at dinner while the latter was on a visit to the English embassador , and was even requested to dance with the daughter of the Grand-Duchess Marie , of Russia . He was allowed to do many things which would be considered in ordinary mortals , to put it mildly , discourteous ,  --  such as lying on the sofa in the presence of ladies . The excuse , however , for this peculiar proceeding was ill-health . He said his lungs were affected , and if by accident his pocket-handkerchief fell to the ground , he would hurriedly pick it up , " for fear , " he would say in a low voice to some one near him- " for fear the ladies should see the blood upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the novelist , who was always amiably inclined to rank , and at whose house one was always sure of meeting every celebrity passing through Florence , whether aristo cratic or literary . A word here about the writer of the well-known " Charles O'Malley " would not be out of place . We knew him well , and a more genial , warm-hearted man or a more brilliant talker it would be hard to meet . He was essentially a good companion , full of wit and humor , with a fluency and command of language most remarkable . He could go on indefinitely with amusing stories or appropriate anecdotes , told with a piquant Irish accent , until hearers would fairly cry with laughing , and beg him to stop . It is said he wrote as easily as he talked , his pen never stopping for an instant . His ruling passion was whist , which he played every night of his life until nearly daylight . With all Lever 's worldly knowledge , he was a man of almost child-like credulity , and was easily duped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time , by a man whose name presented the incredible combination of Napoleon Finn , and who , after deceiving Lever for years , was caught and imprisoned at Trieste . To return to Douglas . As the spring came on , the Florentine mind began to bud and put forth ideas , and at last became suspicious of this society favorite . Although many bills were run up , none seemed to be fully paid . He always had a plausible reason why he was out of money . He resorted to the cleverest expedients to blind those about him . A few days after his arrival in Florence he deposited several valuable articles of jewelry at the principal jeweler 's , as he feared , he said , to keep such things at a hotel , where he might be robbed . Of course this deceived the jeweler , who was delighted to give credit to so rich a man , and Douglas bought bracelets and rings to an alarming extent , which he presented to different ladies as little tokens of friendship or love . His credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pretense of wishing to wear them . The man 's unblushing coolness and entire fearlessness , combined with such rare powers of invention , made him a genius . He managed to make Count 13 , a man of high rank in Florence , believe him to be his own cousin , whom he had never seen , owing to a long residence in India . The Count was connected with the Douglases , and , the relationship being most satisfactorily proved , invited this precious youth to stay at his house , and introduced him into the best society . The ladies all ran after him , young men of rank and wealth // made him their boon companion , and he was gazed at with envy by admiring crowds . Once he contrived to borrow a large sum from the head of one of the principal restaurants , to whom already he owed enormous sums , on the excuse that ladies had commissioned him to get gloves , etc. , in Paris , where he was going for a few days , and had not advanced the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidentially , " I could not ask them for it , or tell them that my remittance from England did not arrive yesterday as I had expected . " It is almost unnecessary to state that the ladies had given him the money , which , in addition to that extorted from the restaurantkeeper , made a very respectable sum to pay his traveling expenses and start credit in a new field , which he did . As some time elapsed and he did not return from " Paris , " suspicions crept reluctantly into the hearts of his adorers , but more especially into the heads of his bankers , until one adventurous soul , feeling his absence more keenly , perhaps , than the others pecuniarily , took the bold resolution of sending a detective after him to Genoa , where it had been discovered he was residing . For some reason entirely inexplicable , no description of him was taken , and the detective set off with a bland confidence in his own unassisted powers . Upon reaching Genoa he went to the principal hotel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging about the hall and overhearing the question , stepped forward , and told him that the person in demand was not at this hotel but at one not far off and that , feeling himself some interest in Douglas 's capture , he would like to have a conversation on the subject with him , adding that he thought he himself might be of some assistance in tracing this cunning impostor . " But first , " the gentleman said , " I must have my breakfast . I will order it now , and should be glad if you would join me . This will give us time to talk matters over , and I will tell you what I know of him . " Accordingly , during a sumptuous deez*ner *i la fourchefte , consisting of endless courses and expensive wines , they did talk the matter over , most exhaustively . When breakfast was at an end , the host rose from the table and went into his bed-room adjoining to get his hat , telling his guest he would join him in a few moments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he got impatient , went to the bed-room door , opened it , found it was not a room , but merely another exit into the hall , and then gradually , but surely , awoke to the fact that he had breakfasted with Douglas himself , who had decamped and left him to pay the breakfast bill ! The most amusing incident in this man 's Florentine career was one which caused much merriment at the expense of Lever , who went off to Trieste one day with Douglas ; the arrangement having been made between them before starting that Douglas should " do the ordering " on the way and Lever the paying , and that all accounts should be settled upon their return home . The consequence was that the ordering was on a very extensive scale , and one which Lever was unaccustomed to and unable to afford . He , however , had not the moral courage to moderate the great Douglas , and so continued meekly paying frightful bills wherever they went , for which , of course , no settlements were made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gusto of the Napoleon Finn swindle , entering into details , and telling the joke against himself most good-humoredly . Whereupon Douglas expressed a wish to see such a clever fellow . Accordingly they sauntered off to the prison , and were at once admitted to the prisoner 's cell . Lever introduced the two men , who at once displayed the most cordial feeling for each other . Napoleon Finn lamented his fate , sighing over the fact that , when his term of imprisonment should end , he would be an " outcast and friendless , with no means of getting an honest living , " etc . Douglas grasped him by the hand and said , " You shall never want a friend while I am alive . Come to me when you are free , and I will give you work , and do all in my power to assist you .. I can thoroughly sympathize with your feelings , "  --  and I really think he could . Poor Lever 's life after this was scarcely worth having , so cruelly was he laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence holds peculiar people of its own and of every other nation . Peculiarly good people and peculiarly bad , and peculiarly peculiar . Taking it all in all , there is an inexplicable charm about it making it unique . It is a bright , cheerful , gay , easy-going , lazylounging , dear old town that , once known and lived in , can never be forgotten , or thought of with indifference .
