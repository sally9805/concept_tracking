AFTER a periodical discussion , covering nearly ten years , Congress has finally taken decisive action in the matter of the distribution of the money obtained by the Government through the arbitration at Geneva . The delay has seemed needless and unexplainable to everybody except those who have been familiar with the progress of the controversy and the causes which lcd to the protracted delay . It is unnecessary to review the causes which led to the arbitration , the proceedings , at Geneva and the debates which preceded it both in the United States and Great Britain . Our purpose is simply to give a r4surn6 of the action of Congress in the premises , and a statement of the existing law in reference to the distribution of the money and of the classes of claims that have been paid and are now entitled to a hearing in the new Court of Commissioners of Alabama Claims . The money was paid by Great Britain through the State Department , on the eighth of September , 1873 . It was deposited in the Tr*asury Department of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draft therefor of fifteen millions and a half in gold , being indorsed in due form by the Secretary of State* It was paid by Great Britain through three banking-houses , one British and two American . It is necessary to state clearly the fact of the mode of payment of this money in order to understand subsequent legislation in reference to it , and clear up certain misty views that are entertained by persons in Congress and out as to the precise legal status of the balance of the fund . As has been said , the money was paid to the Government of the United States through the State Department , and has technically gone to the credit of the State Department , and , consequently , the balance stands as an item on the books of the Treasury Department , to the credit of the State Department , as a deposit // in the Treasury of the United States would stand to the credit of an individual in whose name it was deposited . There was distributed in the payment of judgments rendered by the former Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by authority of the Act of Congress of the twenty-third of June , 1874 , about seven millions of dollars in gold . At that time gold was at a premium of nearly twenty per cent . The judgments that were rendered in favor of the various claimants were paid in currency at four per cent . interest from the date of the loss up to the time of the payment of the respective judgments . The theory and principle of distribution set up by Congress in the law of 1882 , is that the Government , receiving this money from Great Britain in a lump sum , took it without any direction , hint , or limitation as to how or to whom it should ultimately authorize it to be paid . The advocates of the underwriters , both in Congress and in certain newspapers of the country , have endeavored to convince Congress that it was under a legal obligation , in the technical sense , to direct the fund to be handed over to a total of forty-one insurance companies that paid losses , aggregating a little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruisers . The assertions that they have made constitute their argument one reductio ad absurdum . Asserting their legal right to the money pro rata , according to their respective Losses , they have asked , beleaguered , and besieged Congress to pass a law giving them a right to the money . If , as they say , a legal right existed , where is the reason or necessity for asking Congress to enact a law ? If the legal right existed , plainly it was not necessary for Congress to pass such a law . This would seem to have sufficiently disposed of their argument , even before the ultimate action of the Senate , when out of a total membership of seventy-six senators only six were obtained to sustain this view , leaving a total of seventy that did not adopt it . The underwriters further asserted their right to this money , on the ground that , when they insured their policy-l*iolders against war losses , and took a premium note , and issued the policy , in some cases-ouly a few-they took assignments from the assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only apply to the ordinary case of a loss by the action of the elements , storms , rocks , foundering , lightning , or some casualty of nature . In these cases of captures // and destrnctions by the Confederate cruisers the loss was total . Vessels and cargoes were usually burned or sunk . Hence , there could have been nothing left to assi* . Where there is nothing to assign , any formal or pretended assignment passes only what the assignor has ; and the assignor having nothing , the assignee takes nothing . The claim of the nnderwriters to the assigmuents of the owners ' rights against the Government of Great Britain is without foundation , fallacious and deceptive . No right in the sense of a claim , or in any sense save the most abstract moral right , ever existed on the part of these owners . It was finally conceded by the Government of the United States in the treaty of Washington , adopted on the 8th of March , 1871 , that no such right , either by international law , international equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States against the Government of Great Britain to recover for the losses or captures by the Confederate cruisers . This statement and assertion has become a formal part of the first article of this treaty . Consequently it at once and forever set at rest and disposed of this assertion that the existing rights on the part of ship-owners , merchants , or underwriters , who lost property at the hands of the Confederate cruisers , lay against the Government of Great Britain . The special and sole condition on which the Government of Great Britain consented to enter into an arbitration and be bound by the award of the arbitrators , was on the ground that no legal liability existed by any statute law , any municipal law , any international law , or any international comity , that even in the most vague and indefinite legal sense bound the Government of Great Britain to pay to the Government of the United States any money whatever for loss by these Confederate cruisers . The position of the two governments in framing the treaty was simply this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States asserted had been violated by England in the building , escape and equipment of the " Alabama , " the " Shenandoah , ' * the " Florida , " and other cruisers , was merely a municipal regulation of the United States , which she had set up for her own guidance in the matter of defining and limiting her neutral relations when other nations were belligerent and the United States was at peace . It was in no sense an international rule . There being no rule , no national law , no formal compact of any kind , that bound the Government of Great Britain by the rules governing the conduct of nations , there , of course , was no law // 286 to violate on the part of Great Britain . If no law exists to regulate the conduct of individuals in a State , there can be none to violate . If no international law , rule , or compact exists between nations there can be none to violate . The three rules set up in the treaty of Washington defining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations of neutrals , have established now an international rule of conduct which binds both governments hereafter in case any similar controversy arises . The very fact that these rules were incorporated into the treaty , they not being quoted or adopted from any precedent , shows their prior non-existence . The theory which underlay all the negotiations between the two governments in framing the treaty was simply this : There being no law existing between the two countries , there could be none to violate : hence , Great Britain was guilty of no violation . But for the sake of maintaining friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries , and in the interest of peace and to avert the dire calamities of war , Great Britain consented , humiliating as it was , to enter into an arbitration , and to be bound by the acts or award of the arbitrators , which she ultimately and honorably did , fulfilling her treaty obligations both in spirit and in letter . The spirit of the treaty was the spirit of equity in the largest , most general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened , humane , and liberal conscience . The two nations , divorced from law , separated from all legal obligations , entered into a compact of conscience in the forum of conscience . This being the taproot of the proceedings , the spirit which led to the treaty , which governed its formation , which framed its articles , it is very clear that whatever might result in the form of funds from such negotiations , would be utterly and totally clear from all legal limits or liabilities , from all technical obligations on the part of either government , and especially on the part of the United States . The United States in these proceedings , and at Geneva , acted as the voluntary guardian and sole possible protector of the rights of their citizens . They went before the International Tribunal by their agent , by their counsel , in their pleadings , and in their statements of facts , and asked judgment in their own name , in their own behalf , to make such use of any payment that might be made in the judgment rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might see fit . The advocates of the owners of vessels and cargoes , and the ship-owners // and shippers , who paid war premiums against the risk of capture , have always presented and urged their claims upon Congress from this stand-point and upon these principles : that no legal liability existed on the part of the United States for these losses , any further than might grow out of the measure of protection which the Government of the United States owes to all its citizens and all the property under its flag . It is a liability and an obligation which , if enforcible at all , is probably not within the jurisdiction of the courts exceptiug as they are created , and jurisdiction specially given to them at the hands of the National Legislature . They went to Congress and plead their cause on the ground of justice , on the ground of national duty , on the ground of national obligation , to protect the property of its citizens floating upon the high seas . In this spirit they conceived and pressed their arguments to ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last eight or nine years in carrying on this discussion to meet and dispose of the technical arguments of the underwriters . Their position was technical from first to last . They had nothing but technicalities . Justice certainly was not on their side . They said they had claims . Clearly there can be no claim in the proper sense where there has been no loss . The underwriters paid losses , to be sure , aggregating , as has been said before , about four millions of dollars . But they got their pay for it . The dealers with those companies who paid their premiums for a period of five years , paid just what rates the underwriters saw fit to charge them , and those payments formed the different funds out of which not only the losses were paid , but profits in all but four instances were made . There was a total of forty-one companies that paid losses as the result of captures by the Confederate crisers . The former court gave them an opportunity to come in and show what they received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in losses to the assured , where losses took place . If the payments for the losses on account of captures exceeded the total amount they had received from premiums for insurance , then they took a judgment for the difference , and the balance was paid in 1876 . There were three companies in New Bedford and one in Newburyport only that could show a loss . The doors of the court were open to all the companies for nearly three years . Each one had an opportunity to come in and show its balance-sheet . Only // four did so . The logical conclusion is that the rest had no loss to show ; in other words , that they had made money out of the business of insuring against war risks . To have paid these companies for what they paid out for war losses would have been to have added a second profit to that already made out of their policy-holders . It is but fair to state , in justice to the marine insurance interest of the United States , that the preposterous and absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few . The reason why they ever gained any foothold in Congress was because the arguments were technical , specious , and fallacious . Congress is in a large part made up of lawyers , men trained at the bar , and of long experience on the bench . The greater portion of them are from the interior States , where there is no ocean commerce , who necessarily have had no personal familiarity with shipping , maritime law , or admiralty practice . It is a singular fact in this whole discussion , that with probably one or two exceptions , not a single member of Congress from any State where his practice had brought him in contact with a knowledge of shipping and maritime matters , has been found to advocate the cause of the underwriters . The largest vote the insurance companies ever obtained in the House was in the summer of 1876 , when out of a total membership of two hundred and ninety-two , they got thirty-five votes . Nearly all these were from the Southern States , a few from the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . The longer the discussion proceeded , the fuller the information that was acquired , and the clearer the light that was thrown upon the subject , the less headway the underwriters made , and the more progress was achieved on the part of their opponents . For the last four or five years the advocacy of the insurance companies* claims has been confined almost entirely to two or three companies in the city of New York . The one having the largest claim , the Atlantic Mutual , whose total amount of principal and interest was some three millions and a half dollars , has been through its advocates , directly or indirectly , the principal opponent of the distribUtion of this money in the mode that Congress finally has adopted . The law of June , 1882 , re*nacts the law of 1874 , except so far as it may be modified by this act ; creates a court of three judges and not five , as in the former tribunal , and gives to the court jurisdiction of two general classes of claims . The first class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , // personal effects , and wages of officers and crews for the time they were unemployed after capture , until they got re*mployed , and their incidental expenses , for a period not exceeding twelve months after capture . Many of these captures were made in distant waters , and in not a few cases officers and men were unable to obtain employment for not only months , but years . The writer had in charge one case of the steward and stewardess of a vessel captured in 1863 in the South Pacific ; and after long wanderings in China and Japan and upon the Pacific coast of the United States , it was nearly four years before they reached their homes in New England . The next class of claims includes the losses by any Confederate cruiser during the rebellion , whether that cruiser had ever entered a British port or sailed under British auspices . The simple test is whether the cruiser carried the Confederate flag , or sailed under Confederate authority by virtue of a Confederate commission . If it did , then the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel are entitled to enter a case for indemnity and recovery of compensation , provided they file their claims within six months from the organization of the court . This time for filing claims expires January 14 , 1883 . The other class of claims is generally known by a short term of definition as " war premiums . " This brief definition amplified means simply this : In time of peace , when a vessel goes to sea , the insurance , if any , is generally effected only against risk by sea , peril of storm , or rock , or foundering , or any casualty of the elements , or any act of nature . The ordinary clause in policies of this kind against the acts of pirates , as decided in a test case , that of the ship " Golden Rocket , " by the Supreme Court of the United States , did not cover a loss by capture through Confederate cruisers . These cruisers in a technical , legal sense , were not pirates . Pirates are the roving banditti , the highwaymen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized power whatever . A pirate is a mere highwayman , the unauthorized plunderer of the ocean . The Confederate cruisers were not pirates . To be sure they performed acts in the nature of piracy , but in the sense known to the law their acts were not piratical . Their seizures and captures were , by the laws of war , legal captures . Their acts , by the rules governing belligerents , were lawful acts . The United States blockading the ports of the Confederacy prevented the possibility of taking to // any port , for trial in admiralty , the lawfulness of those seizures , and prevented any formal act of condemnation by a prize court . This obliged them to destroy their prizes at sea by burning or scuttling . If they had had any port of their own , or any friendly port , these prizes would have been taken before a prize court for release or condemnation . But the blockade by the United States of all the ports of the Confederacy , precluded them from the possibility of any prize courts of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " overt act , " for the sympathizing friendship for the Confederacy , existing in the British colonial ports , to allow a prize court , and prize proceedings there . That , clearly , on the part of Great Britain , would have created a legal liability , which she did not see fit to assume . Some expressions of sentiment have been made that the Gov. eminent of the United States had no right whatever to give to a court of its own creation jurisdiction to pay losses out of what is known as British money , where the loss was caused by a cruiser that was neither from , nor had friendly assistance in , a British harbor . But this is a mere sentiment growing out of a misapprehension of the history of the proceedings , the nature and spirit and purpose of the treaty , and the eupreme and decisive ri* lit which the United *tcttcs Government has , and has exercised inreference to the distribution of this money . The " Alabama " and " Florida " were the parents of all the other cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and captured the property of American citizens . It made no difference whether they came from , or had support and assistance in British waters or not . As has been said before , the United States , as a sovereign power , exercising sovereign discretion , endowed with authority to enact simple justice for the benefit of their citizens , have determined ( and wisely so ) that if the loss was a loss on the high seas by a cruiser carrying the Confederate flag , and acting under Confederate authority , the owner of the loss , so to speak , is entitled to his pro rata share out of this fund . The greater portion of this money will return immediately to investments in ocean commerce . Its distribution will assist rapidly and in more ways than is generally understood , the revival of American commerce upon the high seas . The very passage of this act is an indication that Congress is realizing the necessity of legislative relief to the shipping interests of the country . The detention of this money for so many years // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-builders and ship-owners , to exporters and importers , whether Congress had the remotest interest , or regard , for the ocean commerce of its citizens . But now that it has taken action , and inawise , liberal , and certainly just and beneficent manner , it will revive hope , and increase the expectation that Congress will continue in the good course in which it has begun ; that it will modify its ancient and obstructive navigation laws ; and will attend to the regulation of the tariff , so that the shipping interests of citizens of the United States will have a fair field in competition with the citizens or subjects of other powers . At present we are at an immense disadvantage . Every foreigner who puts his money into shipping can compete with an American with many points in his favor , and the result is that American ports are crowded with foreign flags , and that American shipping is disappearing and diminishing , in number and tonnage , in foreign ports . The important question arises : Will there be money enough to go round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever it may turn out to be , dependent upon the rate and time of interest , be sufficient to pay everybody in full for his claim , or must there be a general scaling down , and each one take his pro rata srm , depending upon these elements ? It is impossible to answer this question definitely . When the time expires for filing claims , the clerk of the court can easily give a summary of the amount claimed , but this will not detern*ine it accurately , because there will be claims which can not be proven ; there will be estimates of values of vessels and cargoes and personal effects which can not be sustained . There will be quite a large cutting down in these directions ; necessarily so . The claimant will not recover more than he claims , and , asar*e , he*be certain to claim all that he is entitled to , and perhaps considerably more than the court will think the evidence warrants it in paying . The estimate , well founded , is that at least one-fourth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment for want of competent and sufficient proof . It is now twenty years and over since these losses began . The experIence of the former tribunal shows impediments and difficulties impossible to overcome . Numerous questions of law will arise : nice questions of jurisdiction and legal right to be passed upon . The Government will be ably represented by the counsel-in-chief at the trial of // causes before the court in Washington . It will be ably represented by associate counsel in cities and places where the claimants reside . The President has called to the head of the new commission the Hon. Hezekiah G. Wells , of Kalamazoo , Michigan , the Presiding Justice of the former commission . His associates are the Hon. James M. Harlan , of Iowa , formerly in the Senate of the United States from that commonwealth , and at one time Secretary of the Interior under President Lincoln . The other member is the Hon. Asa P. French , of Massachusetts , eminent in his profession . The occasion seems to present a proper opportunity for some reflections and suggestions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole proceedings-treaty , Geneva arbitration , the act of Congress , the Alabama claims- are results , in various forms , of the war of the rebellion . These losses , that have been and are to be indemnified , were war losses . They would not have occurred , but as a consequence of the war upon land . Supposing any situation arises in the future , similar to that which existed from 1860 to 1866 , what course shall the " powers that be " pursue ? What action shall they take , in reference to the ocean commerce of the United States ? During the war period , there were transferred to foreign flags , almost solely to the British , nearly eight hundred American vessels . In the aggregate , about two-thirds of the American tonnage passed from under the American flag to foreign flags , and none of it has ever returned . The statutes of the United States prevent the re-registration of an American vessel that has been transferred by the voluntary act of the owner . One of the first things Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner of a vessel to transfer her to any flag he pleases in times of public necessity . This right is given to the subjects of Great Britain , and to tLe subjects of nearly all the other maritime powers of Europe . Those powers recognize both its wisdom and its necessity , its direct benefit to the owner , and its indirect benefit to the Government under which the property belongs , and by which it is protected . If capital is invested in land or buildings , a municipal tax , in the theory of municipal regulation , protects it against the violence of the mob . The municipal tax is a consideration paid by the citizen for the support of police and militia forces , as a defense against the violence of mobs . A recent instance , two or // three years ago , occurred at Pittsburg , Pennsylvania , where a mob destroyed a large amount of property in the custody of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company . Here the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania , after careful consideration , held that the County of Alleghany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these losses , aggregating nearly two millions of dollars , and it was held liable to pay them . The only difference , so far as taxation goes , between protecting property on land , and upon the high seas , is , simply , that in the former instance the consideration for the protection is a municipal tax paid to the State , insuring State protection ; Whereas , in the case of vessels it is a Federal tax , insuring Federal protection , where the State power can not possibly reach . Theoretically , the money paid for the registry fees on vessels , for the annual tonnage taxes and other imposts of various kinds , goes through the Treasury Department to the credit of the Navy Department , for the purpose of building , equipping and maintaining a navy for the protection of vessels and their cargoes , persons and their effects upon the high seas , where forts and land forces can not extend any shelter or defense . The municipal tax is for the police and for the militia . By the very theory upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State for the police and militia protection of the property upon the land . The various taxes assessed and levied by authority of Federal statutes go to and are to be used by the Federal power for protection upon the ocean . If from inability , neglect , or inefficiency on the part of the municipal authorities , the property of the citizen upon the land is lost , the law provides , through the courts , indemnity and compensation . Special statutes in various States make these provisions . Unfortunately we are not aware of any provision of a similar tenor and purpose , by which the citizen losing his property upon the high seas is entitled to indemnity and compensation from the Federal power . Nevertheless , if the strict technical legal obligation does not exist , the moral obligation upon the part of the Government toward the citizen , and the equitable right of the citizen as against the Government , certainly do exist . It can not be denied that it is the part of a wise and efficient government to do all within its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , and especially in times such as existed during the late rebellion , or during any international conflict . The chief sources of revenue to the United States are 21 // directly or indirectly from the property invested in shipping by its citizens . A wise self-interest , a prudent foresight , a policy that looks to the utmost economy of power , would naturally and inevitably lead to the adoption of measures best calculated to promote and foster the shipping interests of the country , and especially in time of war . There should be no restraint put upon the citizen by the legal power of the Government that is not compatible with the most economical and efficient use of the capital invested in maritime adventures . History shows that Great Britain has paid more careful attention to this department than to any other . The result is that her merchant marine is at the head of the maritime powers of the world . The total complement of officers and men , in vessels sailing from home and from colonial ports , is in the vicinity of three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain in this department is a field that should be explored by the laymen and legislators of the United States . The practice and policy which have succeeded so well with our English cousins can not fail to meet with like results if adopted by us . There are no real or practical differences existing between vessels sailing under the Cross of St. George and those sailing under the Stars and Stripes . That force which has increased the fleets of Great Britain would inevitably increase those of the United States . We have far more extended sea-coasts , better harbors , longer , larger and deeper rivers , larger mines of coal and iron , better and heavier forests of timber , than they have or can draw upon outside of the British Dominions . Scarce any limit can be placed upon the natural resources of the United States that can be utilized and are ready at hand , developed out of the great arcana of nature . Another reflection arising from the history of these proceedings-the formation of the treaty , the arbitration at Geneva , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding that arbitration is a very desirable substitute for war , and its loss of life and property , yet it is a very uncertain , unwieldy , and inefficient method of settling international disputes . Each treaty settlement of international questions is a special compact to cover the special circumstances of existing cases at the time . In their very nature they have no permanent character , as in the case of the Treaty of Washington . They are so framed that disputes as to their meaning , and disputes as to jurisdiction , inevitably arise under them . When the // United States presented its claim before the Geneva tribunal , and set ont five different connts in its declaration , and the case was published in the British press , an outcry from her newspapers and her rostrums shook England to its center . There was a sndden and appalling fear that the United States had presented a cause of action against Great B*ta* , the indemnity for which would be about equal to the total British public debt . What was the case ? Simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well-nigh impossible to determine the kind and extent of jurisdiction that the tribunal of five arbitrators had under the provisions of the treaty . The British counsel immediately raised in formal manner this question of jurisdiction , presented it by a demurrer properly filed with the tribunal in due form , just as a question of jurisdiction would be raised under a statute in a Federal or State court . The objections of the British Government , though its counsel , were aimed directly and generally at what were known as the indirect claims . It was a phrase coined out of the existing circumstances , and for the convenience of the hour . It meant nothing , and defined less . For a time it appeared as though , from this discussion , the two nations would separate and the arbitration prove abortive . But , as has been said , true statesmanship is ever equal to the emergencies of the time . For the final judgment , for the satisfaction of both sides of this troublesome dispute , we are largely indebted to the trained sagacity and wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the government of the United States before the tribunal . It was his mind that moved the wires which finally brought the two governments together in harmony before the arbitrators . The result of this dispute has been the chief bone of contention for the last six or eight years before the Congress of the United States , as to whether the tribunal rejected the so-called war premium claims as outside of and beyond its jurisdiction , or whether it included them in the amount of the award . From a close study of the protocols which led to it , of the demurrer filed by the British Government , of the pleadings of both powers before the arbitrators , the whole thing becomes a sort of harp of many strings , from which almost any argument or conclusion can be deduced . Only one thing can be made certain , and that is that the war premiums were objected to by the British Government ; that they were demurred to by the British counsel as not within the // jurisdiction of the tribunal , and that the tribunal took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope and legal effect of that action was , it is somewhat difficult to determine . It is very certain , however , that when the arbitrators finally determined the amount of the award , fifteen millions and a half they did not specifically exclude war premiums by name . They did , however , specifically exclude by name five other classes of claims . They gave a reason for exclusion in each specific case . Now , it is only fair to the arbitrators , and logical also , to infer from that conclusion , that , inasmuch as they did not , when they fixed the amount of the award , exclude war premiums by name , these were fairly included in determining that amount . But , whether so or not , it can make no difference as to what course Congress shall pursue in distributing the money , because we start with the proposition , and pursue the theory all the way along , that the United States in distributing the money are not to be governed in the least by what governed the arbitrators at Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the United States is sovereign , and exclusively supreme . The point is , that the provisions of the treaty had such a looseness and indefiniteness about them that it led to dispntes - that it was very difficult to avoid the absolute estrangement of these two great powers . When we come to the Fisheries Commission at Halifax , to settle the right to fish within a certain line along certain provinces of Great Britain , we find the same looseness and indefiniteness of expression that at one time threatened trouble between the two countries . The arbitrators at Geneva were five , at Halifax three . Only two of the arbitrators at Halifax signed the award of two millions and a half . Hon. Ensign H. Kellogg , of Massachusetts , declined to sign . Straightway arose a discussion in the public press and in the Congress of the United States whether by the terms of the treaty an award signed by only two of three arbitrators was binding upon the debtor Government of the United States , and consequently it was an open question whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question was settled by the payment of the amount , although there are precedents to show that the United States were not lawfully bound by the terms of the treaty to make the payment on an award signed by only two of the arbitrators . A similar question arose as to the North-west Boundary line many years ago , between Great Britain and the // United States , and the commission to determine that boundary was totally abortive , failed to accomplish its purpose , and went to pieces-did nothing . The question was left an open one for many years , until it was taken up and definitely settled by the treaty of Washington . So we find historical instance after instance of remote and recent dates , where treaties have failed ; where international commissions have been abortive , on account of the uncertainty of the language authorizing the action . The question arises , What shall be done ? What is the wise and proper course to guard against these contingencies ? What policy shall be adopted to make these things certain and definite ? We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A treaty is a special and temporary contract between powers , the same as agreements or bargains are between individuals . Now , it would be as wise for the State , within its own dominions , to attempt to settle disputes between individuals as they arise from time to time , by special statutes , special arbitrations , or references under those statutes , as for nations to attempt to settle their differences by the present mode of temporary treaties and temporary international contracts . The only safe , efficient , and permanent remedy is an international code , such as has been mapped out from time to time by various publicists , and especially by the Honorable David Dudley Field , in his volume entitled " An International Code . " To this we must ultimately come , or the civilization of the nineteenth century retrogrades . Here is a field which thoughtful men , which students , which citizens having a wise and prophetic interest in the future welfare of the republic , in its relations to the other States of Christendom , should explore , examine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into particulars . We have no design now other than to seize upon the present occasion as a fitting opportunity for general suggestion . J. F. MANNING .
