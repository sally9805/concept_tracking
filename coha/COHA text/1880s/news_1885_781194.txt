The John Gibson was taken from her moorings at the Anglo-American Stores in Brooklyn at 9 o'clock and towed out into the Bay by orders of Health Officer Smith , preparatory to a thorough fumigation and cleansing at Quarantine to-day . The bark came through Quarantine last Friday on the strength or a bill of health given by Assistant Surgeon William P. Orr at the Delaware Breakwater , and until last evening was unloading her cargo of molasses at the Anglo-American Stores . She left Cienfuegos , Cuba . with all well on board , but when some days at sea yellow fever broke out among the crew . The master , Nickerson , was taken sick , and in spite of all that could be done for him ho died Aug. 1 , when the vessel was 80 miles south of Cape Henry . He was buried at sea . The first mate , the cook , and two sailors were also sick , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowaways were discovered on board , and through their help the vessel was worked into the breakwater in charge of the mate . She was thoroughly inspected by the health officers there , ' carefully fumigated , and given a clean bill of health by Assistant Surgeon Orr , who added in a foot note to the regular printed blank : " The bark John Gibson has been cleansed and fumigated , and leaves one man at this port with yellow fever . " Leaving the cook at the Breakwater , the vessel came up to New-York , arriving at Quarantine last Thursday evening . She was boarded by the Quarantine officers , and as all on board appeared to be well she was allowed to come up to her dock on the day following . While the bark was discharging cargo Henry Ryners , one of the stowaways who had proved useful on the voyage , went to live at No. 27 State-street , Brooklyn . On Tuesday he was taken ill , and the symptoms were such that a telephone call was sent to the Health Department headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's division , found the man in a hallway , and he was able to say disconnectedly that he was a stowaway on the bark John Gibson . from Cienfuegos , Cuba , whose agent is J. F. Whitney , of State-street . Dr. Conant could not diagnose the case as one of yellow fever , and he was not disposed to so regard it , as the period of incubation had passed , the man not having been exposed to the disease , or what was supposed to be yellow fever , since Aug. 3 . He . however , followed the standing instructions of Dr. Taylor and had the man transferred to the Riverside Hospital through the Reception Hospital , and reported the case as a doubtful one for the reasons given . It was thought advisable to send word to Health Officer Smith , of Quarantine , who late in the afternoon arrived in his boat and made an examination of the patient .

Dr. Smith was so well convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel to be towed to Quarantine and fumigated . The cargo will be discharged , the vessel washed and fumigated , the crew inspected , and the bedding and clothing thoroughly aired . At Quarantine last evening it was said by the physician in charge that no doubt existed in the minds of Dr. Smith and his assistants that the disease was yellow . fever . The exact condition of the patient could not be learned for the reason . that he has been sick only three days , and that yellow fever requires five days in which to develop . It was thought that Reyners had caught the fever at the Breakwater , but had not shown the symptoms until after his arrival in Brooklyn . In response to questions touching the danger from patient or vessel , it was said that no danger existed . The cargo already unloaded was on the wharf , and would be thoroughly fumigated by the air . Any germs of yellow fever that might then be lurking in the hogsheads of molasses and sugar would disappear in the refinery . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person only through bad air , or by the action of the sun or other heat upon decaying vegetable matter , a person sick with the fever could not give the disease to any one else if the clothing had bean thoroughly disinfected.
