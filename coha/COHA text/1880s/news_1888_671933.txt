txt THE SUGAR TRUST TO BE SUED . The Attorney-General of this State heard arguments on May 14 in support of petitions in which he was urged to bring suit against the Sugar Refineries Company , commonly called the Sugar Trust , and against one of the corporations absorbed by that organization . Ho has now decided that it is important to ascertain by judicial investigation whether the allegations set forth in the petitions are true . It is stated that application will at once be made to the Supreme Court for leave to bring an action in the name of the people against the North River Sugar Refining Company . The permission of the court is not required in the case of the Trust , and for that reason it is possible for the Attorney-General to proceed against the Trust without much delay . Since we began in THE TIMES to expose the trade conspiracies whose aim is to kill competition , restrict production , and . extort high prices from consumers , we have repeatedly pointed out that the laws of this State and . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual Trusts are concerned . There are combinations whose greed can be restrained more speedily and effectively by a reduction of the tariff duties under the shelter of which consumers are robbed . The best weapons that can be used against some of the Trusts are the laws of the States relating to corporations . The Sugar Trust is open to attack in either of these two ways * -- by a reduction of the duties on refined sugar or by the enforcement of the laws concerning corporations . It is desirable that these State laws should be tested , and consumers everywhere will rejoice when they know that in this State they are to be tested in proceedings against a fully-developed Trust which exacts tribute in all parts of the land . The North River Refining Company ceased to do business after it had been absorbed . by the ring . The Attorney-General was asked to bring suit against it under the statute which empowers him to take such action " for the Purpose of vacating the charter or annulling the existence of a corporation whenever such corporation shall have forfeited its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forfeited its privileges or franchises by failure to exercise its powers , or shall have done or omitted any act which amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights , privileges , and franchises . " He was asked . to bring suit also upon the ground that the corporation had broken the law by engaging in. such a combination as the courts have always declared to be unlawful , and had entered into a conspiracy to commit an act " injurious to trade or commerce . " The law also says that the Attorney-General may sue in the name of the people and upon his own information , or upon the complaint of any private party , any person who has usurped any franchise in this State , or any association or number of persons who act within the State " as a corporation without being duly incorporated . " This is the statute which is to be used against the Trust itself , whose operations clearly fall under the provisions of the same . The corporations which have been merged into and absorbed by the Sugar Trust have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the people . They asked for certain privileges and powers , and the people grantea their applications under the restrictions which have been mentioned . They have grossly abused those privileges and . ' powers , to the injury of the people who granted them , and now the charters should be recalled . or annulled . Does any one believe that these associations of . sugar refiners could have obtained franchises if they had . said : " We intend to unite these corporations in a monopoly organization in order that the people shall be deprived of the benefits of competition and shall be compelled to pay the prices we may choose to exact ? " Unquestionably the franchises would have been withheld . Now that the corporations have united %o ' oppress the people , those who granted the franchises should take them away . They have been robbed by a ring of corporations which they themselves created , and these corporations have clearly broken the agreement under which they obtained their privileges . The people reserved ,  --  the right to Punish them " for a violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted .
