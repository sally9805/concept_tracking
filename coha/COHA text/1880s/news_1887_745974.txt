txt Among the bills introduced and supported at Albany last year by the Gilbert committee was one creating a Gas Commission . This bill was passed , together with the bill reducing the price of gas in this city to $1 25 per thousand feet . On May 12 , 1886 , it was killed by a veto , to the great disappointment of thousands of consumers . There was introduced in the Senate on the 14th ult. by Mr. WORTH a , bill " to establish a Board of Gas Commissioners for the State of New-York . " . After introducing this bill Mr. WORTH opposed with all his power the Griswold bill reducing the price of gas in Brooklyn . It is true that on the final passage of that bill he voted . in the affirmative , but not until he had savagely attacked its supporters , and . had explained that he desired " to keep within the atmosphere of hypocrisy " in which they lived . His labors in behalf of the gas companies and his attitude toward bills for a reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission bill that he supports . An examination of the bill which he has introduced shows that it is a measure which should be promptly rejected . It is a bill to allow the payment of 10 per cent . dividends on watered stock . The members of the Gilbert committee were profoundly impressed by the manner in which consumers in this city had been - deceived and plundered by the watering of capital . They said. : " Fictitious capitalization tends to increase the price everywhere . Stock watering must be prohibited . It must be looked upon as an instrument of extortion . " They had discovered that when the gas companies in this city were consolidated they raised . their capital from $15 , 500 , - 000 to $39,078,000 without adding a dollar to the sum invested , and that of the $15,500 , - 000 only $11,215,300 at the most had been paid in . They saw that this fiat capital had been . created in order that the real size of the dividends might be concealed from the public . They were convinced that corporations doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per cent . dividends on the money actually invested , and their commission bill was prepared in accordance with this principle . It provided that the Commissioners should ascertain the amount of capital actually paid in by stockholders and . bondholders and . expended by any company under their jurisdiction , and should not allow the annual dividends to exceed 10 per cent . of this sum " actually paid in and expended . and employed in the business . " Earnings in excess of 10 per cent . dividends were to be allowed to accumulate until they should amount to 10 per cent . of the capital , and . beyond that limit they were to be used . in reducing the price of gas . But the Worth bill was framed for the protection of watered stock . It requires the companies to report annually the amount of their " authorized capital , " and declares that the dividends " shall not exceed the rate of 10 per cent . in any one year . " That is , they shall not exceed . 10 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " authorized capital " may be whatever the Directors of the company choose to make it . If any company has watered its stock from $11,215,300 to $39,078,000 , there is nothing in this bill to restrain it from declaring 10 per cent . dividends on nearly $28,000,000 of water . A paragraph providing that earnings in excess of such dividends shall be used . in reducing the price of gas was inserted to mislead the unwary , and . another paragraph forbidding a company to increase its capital " hereafter " except for construction , would have no terrors.for the companies in whose interest the bill appears to have been introduced .. The difference between this bill and the Gilbert committee 's bill can easily be seen . One was intended for the benefit and protection of consumers and the other for the benefit of gas companies who desire to pay dividends on watered stock . The Worth bill is such a measure as one would expect to be introduced by a Senator who opposed the reduction of the price of gas in a city where a rate of $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exacting . , company sells gas at a good . profit to other companies for only 76 cents a thousand . No member of the Legislature ' should be deceived by the Worth bill or by any other bill containing its provisions concerning dividends on " authorized capital . "
