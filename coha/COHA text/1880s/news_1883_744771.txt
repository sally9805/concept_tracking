txt We printed yesterday morning a notice from Mr. Wnitaw , Treasurer of the United States , which is , unfortunately , not without precedent , but which , considering all the circumstances , is certainly one of the racist remarkable documents ever emanating from the Finance Department of the Government of a great commercial country like our own . It was in substance an offer to exchange silver certificates for gold in sums of $500 or any multiple thereof , at the office of any Assistant Treasurer in the Union , or to ship such certificates , by e.xpress , at the consignee 's expense , to any point designated by the latter . So far as the Government is concerned , regarding the Government as a corporation , having certain outstanding obligations to meet and certain limited resources with which to meet them , this offer , whenever accepted , would be clearly advantageous . The obligations of the Government , payable on demand , are of four kinds : its legal-tender notes , and its certificates of deposit for gold , for silver , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ; old , not technically perhaps , but in practice and according ' to unvarying precedent long established . The currency certificates are redeemable in notes , which in their turn are redeemable in gold . As a matter of fact , therefore , all the demand obligations of the Government are redeemable either in gold or in standard silver dollars . The latter are intrinsically worth , at the present price of bullion , rather less than 85 cents on the dollar . If . therefore , the Government , taking advantage of a temporary demand for currency in the South and West  --  and it is announced from Washington that such a demand has made itself felt there ? can induce the public to exchange gold for certificates redeemable in the depreciated silver dollars . it is a clearly profitable transaction . Any individual in the land who could exchange for gold his demand notes payable in a commodity which he could furnish at 85 per cent . of the face of the notes would very properly think that he had made a good bargain . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding that every one must look out for himself , and that all profits ' are legitimate which are legal and not won by deception , an individual driving this kind of bargain would be free from censure as to his honesty , and would be justly regarded as shrewd . But can the Government of the United States deal with its citizens on this basis ? It is not in reality a corporation , with distinct revenues , resources . and interests of its own . It is the agent and trustee of the people . Its revenues come from the people 's pockets , and while any profits which its action may secure may relieve the people to that extent , they are very dearly purchased by any departure from the strictest fair dealing . They are purchased still more dearly by any proceeding which tends to depreciate or confuse the currency . That is precisely the case in the present instance . Silver certificates are not as good as the gold for which they are exchanged . The substitution of them for gold , in answer to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonorable act . The only benefit which the person obtaining them gets is that they are in smaller denominations than the gold certificates which he could procure as well . They are redeemable in coin worth only 85 per cent . of that which is surrendered for them . The more there are of them in the circulating medium the worse it is for every honest man and for every legitimate enterprise . Sooner or later the time must come when they will be worth in daily use no more than the coin they represent is intrinsically worth . When they reach that point , and at every stage of their approach to that point , the sufferers by them will , in the main , be thosewho have received no advantage , not even . any convenience , from their present use , and who are least able to bear the loss . It will fall largely upon the wageearners and upon those living on salaries or small fixed incomes , such as widows and orphans , Or those dependent on the return , from trust investments . These classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whatever source , and , by the uncertainty and ultimate paralysis of the business activity on which they are dependent . It may be argued that the holders of gold are free to either keep it or exchange it for silver certificates as they may elect . That is true . But the Government is not at liberty to take advantage of their present necessity in this fashion . Nor can such necessity be regarded as pressing . There is no such lack of currency as would warrant the intervention of the Government . Money is plenty and cheap for good security , and notes of national banks could be supplied at sufficiently short notice to meet any real demand . For the time being-the silver certificates serve all the purposes of such notes ; but once issued they are never returned , and precisely as their volume is increased the time is hastened for that depreciation which they will inevitably undergo in the long run . This fact is not generally recognized by the business community , but it is a fact , nevertheless . The Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows it to be so . One or , the other of these high officers should stop the proceeding in which the Treasurer - is engaged . It is conspicuously discreditable , injurious , and dangerous .
