txt In legislative bodies the interests of the people sometimes suffer , while those of speculators and . jobbers are promoted , by the introduction and enactment of bills whose purpose and effect are plainly shown neither in their titles nor in the sections over which the titles are placed . For example , bill No. 1,174 , introduced in the Assembly by Mr. HAGAN , is entitled " An act to amend chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882 , entitled ' An act to consolidate into one act and to declare the special and local laws affecting public interests in the city of New-York , " while the body of the proposed act is as follows : " Section 354 of chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882 is hereby repealed . This act shall take effect immediately . " It will be seen that there is nothing either in the proposed act or in its title , when examined apart from the existing statute , to show what the effect of the act would be . The object of the proposed legislation is not set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reported favorably by the Cities Committee . If such a bill should be taken up for passage in the hurly-burly of the closing hours of a session , how many members would know anything about its merits ? Section 354 of the Consolidated act is as follows : ? " No patent hydrant , valve , or stopcock shall be used by the Department of Public Works unless the patentee or owner of said patent shall allow the use of the patent by said department without royalty . " It is reported that Gen. SPINOLA. is lobbying at Albany for the bill repealing this provision , and that he is interested in a patent hydrant which he longs to impose upon the taxpayers of this city under conditions that will yield royalties which the department is now forbidden to pay . The approval of Mr. MCCARTHY 'S committee should not be sufficient to insure the enactment of this measure . We do not suppose that the department , while under the management of the present Commissioner , will be used by speculators who desire that section 354 shall be repealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of a bill of this kind , in view of the influences by which it is said to be supported .
