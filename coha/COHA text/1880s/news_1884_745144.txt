txt The Tammany opponents of CLEVELAND 'S nomination are trying desperately to make it appear that the ' workingmen of the State are hostile to the Governor . This is a common trick of demagogues of their class , and they are putting grievances in the mouths of workingmen in the hope of having them accepted . The grounds given for this alleged hostility are the Governor 's vetoes of certain bills said to be in the interest of working men . No mention is made of the bills which have been cheerfully signed by the Governor , such as the Tenement-house Cigar bill , that creating the Bureau of Labor Statistics , and that virtually abolishing the contract system of prison labor . On the latter subject the Governor displayed a good deal of zeal in a direction opposed to a pretty strong conservative sentiment , but we have no doubt that he acted from a sincere conviction that the demand of the labor . organizations was just . Most stress has been laid on his veto of the Five-cent Fare bill , but this measure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the elevated roads have always been at five cents during the hours when they are used by workmen in going to and from their labor . Those who would benefit by an extension of the hours are chiefly shopping and business travelers and amusementseekers . We did not agree with the Governor 's reasoning in his disapproval of the bill , but we never entertained any doubt of the honesty of his own convictions on the subject , and it required much more courage to act in accordance with them than it would have required to disregard them . Mr. CLEVELAND has never shown any disposition to favor one class at the expense of another , and he has frequently displayed his sympathy for tile working classes in any real grievance that they had to present . The Mechanics ' Lien bill is spoken of as a measure in the interest of working men which the Governor failed to sign , but the reason which he gave was that it repealed other lien laws of wider scope and more real value . It also included in its benefit any person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done , which practically destroyed the workman 's preference . He also stated that he did not sign the Conductors and Drivers ' bill because he could not see that it was in the interest of the working men , a , 1 it would not prevent a reduction of wages corresponding to the reduction of hours or preclude special contracts for this kind of labor . In fact , while open to the objection of being class legislation , it would accomplish no good to any class . In no way has Gov . CLEVELAND shown greater care and industry , or a more conscientious regard for all public interests , than in his treatment of legislation . If anybody has cause of complaint against him on this score it is not the working man , but the political jobber who wastes the substance which is the fruit of the labor of the community . The opposition comes really from that class , and it is wonderful how little ground for it there is that can be presented in a shape to command respectable assent . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case against him that has led to the despicable trick of attempting to father their hostility upon the working men . Let any one try to gather from the allegations of the politicians whose enmity Gov . CLEVELAND has won by refusing to yield to their selfish demands any real reason for not trusting him with the care of public interests , . and he will find the effort futile , and conclude that their opposition springs from ; " causes altogether creditable to the Governor 's integrity and - courage . The facts which make him objectionable to the Tammany leaders are the real sources of his strength with honest and intelligent people , who favor a man with - whom the great interests of the country would be safe . Those who are influenced by the sordid and selfish considerations which control Joing KELLY and his ' henchmen include but a small class of voters , though they make a good deal of noise when congregated together . Against them is to be set the great mass of the voting population , who have no interests to serve that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
