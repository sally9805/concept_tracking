IHERE is quite a large race or Class of people in America for whom we scarcely seem to have a parallel in England . Of pure white blood they are unknown or unrecognizable in towns ; inhabit the fringe of settlements and the deep , quiet places of the Country ; rebellious to all labor and pettily theftuous , like the English gypsies ; rustically ignorant , but with a touch of wood-lore and the dexterity of the savage . Where they came from is a moot-point . At the time of the war they poured north in crowds to escape the conscription ; lived during summer on fruits , wild animals , and petty theft ; and at the approach of winter , when these supplies failed , built great fires in the forest and there died stoically by starvation . They are widely scattered , however , and easily recognized . Loutish but not ill-looking , they will sit all day , swinging their legs , on a field fence , the mind seemingly as devoid of all reflection as a Suffolk peasant 's , careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with a rebellious vanity and a strong sense of independence . Hunting is their most congenial business or , if the occasion offers , a little amateur detection . In tracking a criminal , following a particular horse along a beaten highway , and drawing inductions from a hair or a foot-print , one of these somnolent , grinning hodges will suddenly display activity of body and finesse of mind . By their names ye may know them : the women figuring as Loveina , Larsenia , Serena , Leanna , Orreana ; the men answering to AlYin , Alva , or Orion , pronounced Orrion , with the accent on the first . Whether they are indeed a race , or whether this is the form of degeneracy common to all back-woodsmen , they are at least known by a generic by-word as Poor Whites , or Low-downers . I will not say that the Hanson family was Poor White ; but I may go as far as this : they were , in many points , not unsimilar to the people usually so called . Rufe himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hunter and an amateur detective . It was he who pursued Russel and Dollar , the robbers of the Lake Port stage , and captured them , the very morning after the exploit , while they were still sleeping in a hayfield . Russel , a drunken Scotch carpenter , was even an acquaintance of his own , and he expressed much grave commiseration for his fate . In all that he said and did , Rufe was grave . I never saw him hurried . When he spoke , he took out his pipe with ceremonial deliberation , looked east and west , and then , in quiet tones and few words , stated his business or told his story . His gait was to match ; it would never have surprised you if , at any step , he had turned around and walked away again ; so warily and slowly , and with so much seeming hesitation , did he go about it . He lay long in bed in the morning , rarely , indeed , rose much before noon . He loved all games from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croquet-ground I have seem him laboring at the latter with the devotion of a curate . He took an interest in education , was an active member of the local schoolboard , and when I was there he had recently lost the school-house key . His wagon was broken , but it never seemed to occur to him . to mend it . Like all other truly idle people , he had an artistic eye ; he chose the print stuff for his wife 's dresses , and counseled her in the making of a patchwork quilt - always , as she thought , wrongly - but , to the more educated eye , always with bizarre and admirable taste  --  the taste of an Indian . With all this he was a perfect , unoffending gentleman in word and act . Take his clay pipe from . him , and he was fit for any society but that of fools . Quiet as he was , there burned a deep , permanent excitement in his dark blue eyes ; and when this grave man smiled , it was like sunshine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please-Lovelands ) was more commonplace than her lord . She was a comely woman , too , plump , faircolored , with wonderful white teeth ; and , in her print dresses ( chosen by Rufe ) and with a large sun-bonnet shading her valued complexion , made , I assure you , a very agreeable figure . But she was on the surface , what there was of her ; outspoken and loud-spoken . Her noisy laughter had none of the charm of one // of Hanson 's rare , slow-spreading smiles ; there was no reticence , no mystery , no manner about the woman ; she was a first-class dairymaid , but her husband was an unknown quantity between the savage and the nobleman . She was often in and out with us ; merry and healthy and fair ; he came far seldomer ; only , indeed , when there was business , or now and again to pay us a visit of ceremony , brushed up for the occasion , with his wife on his arm , and a clean clay pipe in his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of an event , and turned our red cai*on into a salon . Such was the pair who ruled in the old " Silverado Hotel , " among the windy trees , on the mountain shoulder overlooking the whole length of Napa Valley , as the man aloft looks down on the ship 's deck . There they kept house , with sundry horses and fowls , and a family of sons , Daniel Webster , and I think George Washington , among the number . Nor did they want visitors . An old gentleman of singular stolidity and called Breedlove- I think he had crossed the plains in the same caravan with Rufe-housed with them for awhile during our stay ; and they had besides a permanent lodger in the form of Mrs. Hanson 's brother , Irvine Lovelands . I spell Irvine by guess ; for I could get no information on the subject ; just as I could never find out , in spite of many inquiries , whether or not Rufe was a contraction for Rufus . They were all cheerfully at sea about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their descendants , the George Washingtons and Daniel Websters , will be clear upon the point . Any way , and however his name should be spelt , this Irvine Lovelands was the most unmitigated Caliban I ever knew . Our very first morning at Silverado , when we were full of business , patching up doors and windows , making beds and seats , and getting our rough lodging into shape , Irvine and his sister made their appearance together-she for neighborliness and general curiosity-he , because he was working for me , if you please - cutting fire-wood at I forget how much a day . The way that he set about cutting wood was characteristic . We were at that moment patching up and unpacking in the kitchen . Down he sat on one side , and down sat his sister on the other . Both were chewing pinetree gum , and he , to my annoyance , accompanied that simple pleasure with profuse expectoration . She rattled away , talking up hill and down dale , laughing , tossing her head , showing her brilliant teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , now putting his head back and uttenng a loud , discordant , joyless laugh . He had a tangle of shock hair , the color of wool ; his mouth was a grin ; although as strong as a horse , he looked neither heavy nor yet adroit , only leggy , coltish , and in the road ; but it was plain he was in high spirits , thoroughly enjoying his visit , and he laughed frankly whenever we failed to accomplish what we were about . This was scarcely helpful ; it was , even to amateur carpenters , embarrassing ; but it lasted until we knocked off work and began to get dinner . Then Mrs. Hanson remembered she should have been gone an hour ago , and the pair retired , and the lady 's laughter died away among the nutmegs down the path . That was Irvine 's first day 's work in my employment  --  the devil take him ! The next morning he returned , and , as he was this time alone , he bestowed his conversation upon us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked us , if we knew the school-ma'am . He did n't think much of her any way . He had tried her , he had . He had put a question to her : if a tree a hundred feet high were to fall a foot a day , how long would it take to fall right down ? She had not been able to solve the problem . " She do n't know nothing , " he opined . He told us how a friend of his kept school with a revolver , and chuckled mightily over that ; his friend could teach school , he could . All the time , he kept chewing gum and spitting . He would stand awhile , looking down ; and then he would toss back his shock of hair , and laugh hoarsely , and spit , and bring forward a new subject . A man , he told us , who bore a grudge against him had poisoned his dog . " That was a low thing for a man to do , now , was n't it ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got even with him-I* poisoned his dog . " His clumsy utterance , his rude , embarrassed manner , set a fresh value on the stupidity of his remarks . I do not think I ever appreciated the meaning of two words until I knew Irvine-the verb , loaf , and the noun , oaf . Between them , they complete his portrait . He could lounge , and wriggle , and rub himself against the wall , and grin , and be more in everybody 's way than any other two people that I ever set my eyes on . Nothing that he did became him ; and yet you were conscious that he was one of your own race , that his mind was cumbrously at work revolving the problem of existence like a quid of gum , and in his own cloudy manner enjoying life and passing judgment on his fellows . Above all things , he was delighted with himself . You would not have thought it , from his uneasy manners and troubled , struggling utterance ; but he loved himself to the marrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail . // His self-esteem was indeed the one joint in his harness . He could be got to work , and even kept at work , by flattery . As long as my wife stood over him , crying out how strong he was , so long exactly he would stick to the matter in hand ; and the moment she turned her hack , or ceased to praise him , he would stop . His physical strength was wonderful , and to have a woman stand by and admire his achievements warmed his heart like sunshine . Yet he was as cowardly as he was powerful , and felt no shame in owning to the weakness . Something was once wanted from the crazy platform over the shaft , and he at once refused to venture there ,  --  " did not like , " as he said , " foolin ' round them kind o ' places , "  --  and let my wife go instead of him , looking on with a grin . Vanity , where it exists , is usually more heroic ; but Irvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  rather looked down upon my wife , and decidedly expected her to look up to him , on the strength of his superior prudence . Yet the strangest part of the whole matter was perhaps this , that Irvine was as beautiful as a statue . His features were , in themselves , perfect ; it was only his cloudy , uncouth , and coarse expression that disfigured them . So much strength residing in so spare a frame was proof sufficient of the accuracy of his shape . He must have been built somewhat after the pattern of Jack Sheppard ; but the famous house-breaker , we may be certain , was no lout . It was by the extraordinary powers of his mind , no less than by the vigor of his body , that he broke his strong prison with such imperfect implements , turning the very obstacles to service . Irvine in the same case would have sat down and spat and grumbled curses . He had the soul of a fat sheep ; but , regarded as an artist 's model , the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persons less favored in their birth , that this creature , endowed , to use the language of the theaters , with extraordinary " means , " should so manage to misemploy them that he looked ugly and almost deformed . It was only by an effort of abstraction , and after many days , that you discovered what he was . By playing on the oaf 's conceit , and standing closely over him , we got a path made around the corner of the dump to our door , so that we could come and go with decent ease ; and he even enjoyed the work , for in that there were bowlders to be plucked up bodily , bushes to be uprooted , and other occasions for athletic display ; but cutting wood was another pair of shoes . Anybody could cut wood ; and besides , my wife was tired of supervising him and had other things to attend to . And in short , days went by , and Irvine came daily and talked and lounged and spat ; but the fire-wood remained intact as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain-side . Irvine , as a woodcutter , we could tolerate ; but Irvine as a friend of the family , at so much a day , was too coarse an imposition ; and at length , in the afternoon of the fourth or fifth day of our connection , I explained to him , as clearly as I could , the light in which I had grown to regard his presence . I pointed out to him that I could not continue to give him a salary for spitting on the floor ; and this expression , which came after a good many others , at last penetrated his obdurate wits . He rose at once and said , if that was the way he was going to be spoken to , he reckoned he would quit . And no one interposing , he departed . So far , so good . But we had no fire-wood . The next afternoon , I strolled down to Rufe 's and consulted him on the subject . It was a very droll interview , in the large , bare , north room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patchwork on a frame , and Rufe , and his wife , and I , and the oaf himself all more or less embarrassed . Rufe announced there was nobody in the neighborhood but Irvine who could do a day 's work for anybody . Irvine thereupon refused to have any more to do with my service ; he " would n't work no more for a man as had spoke to him s I had done . " I found myself on the point of the last humiliation : driven to beg the creature whom I had just dismissed with insult ; but I took the high hand in despair , said there must be no talk of Irvine coming back unless matters were to be differently managed , that I would rather chop fire-wood for myself than be fooled ; and in short , the Hansons being eager for the lad 's hire , I so imposed upon them with merely affected resolution that they ended by begging me to reemploy him , on a solemn promise that he should be more industrious . The promise , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine pile of fire-wood at our door ; and if Caliban gave me the cold shoulder and spared me his conversation , I thought none the worse of him for that , nor did I find my days much longer for the deprivation . The leading spirit of the family was , I am inclined to fancy , Mrs. Hanson . Her social brilliancy somewhat dazzled the others ; and she had more of the small change of sense . It was she who faced Kelmar , for instance ; and perhaps , if she had been alone , Kelmar would have had no rule within her doors . Rufe , to be sure , had a fine , sober , open-air attitude of mind , seeing the worldwithout exaggeration . Perhaps we may even say without enough ; for he lacked , along with the others , // that commercial idealism which puts so high a value on time and money . Society itself is a kind of convention ; perhaps Rufe was wrong ; but looking on life plainly , he was unable to perceive that croquet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , mending his wagon . Even his own profession , hunting , was dear to him mainly as a sort of play ; even that he would have neglected , had it not appealed to his imagination . His hunting suit , for instance , had cost I should be afraid to say how many bucksthe currency in which he paid his way ; it was all befringed after the Indian fashion , and it was dear to his heart . The pictorial side of his daily business was never forgotten ; he was even anxious to stand for his picture in those buckskin hunting clothes ; and I remember how he once warmed almost into enthusiasm , his dark blue eyes growing perceptibly larger , as he planned the composition in which he should appear " with the horns of some real big bucks , and dogs , and a camp on a crick " ( creek , stream ) . There was no trace in Irvine of this woodland poetry . He did not care for hunting , nor yet for buckskin suits . He had never observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was almost obliterated by his own great grinning figure in the foreground : Caliban-Malvolio . And it seems to me , as if in the persons of these brothers-in-law , we had the two sides of rusticity fairly well represented : the hunter living really in nature , the clod-hopper living merely out of society ; the one bent up in every corporal agent to capacity in one pursuit , and doing at least one thing keenly and thoughtfully , and thoroughly alive to all that touches it ; the other , in the inert and bestial state , walking in a faint dream , and taking so dim an impression of the myriad sides of life that he is truly conscious of nothing but himself . It is only in the fastnesses of nature , forests , mountains , and the backs of man 's beyond , that a creature endowed with five senses can grow up into the perfection of this crass and earthy vanity . hi towns or the busier country-sides , he is roughly reminded of other men 's existence ; and if he learns no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Irvine had come scathless through life ; conscious only of himself of his great strength and intelligence ; and in the silence of the universe , to which he did not listen , dwelling with delight on the sound of his own thoughts . THE SEA FOGS . A CHANGE in the color of the light usually called me in the morning . By a certain hour the long , vertical chinks in our western gable* where the boards had shrunk and separated , flashed suddenly into my eyes as stripes of dazzling blue , at once so dark and so splendid that I used to marvel how the qualities could be combined . At an earlier hour the heavens . in that quarter were still quietly colored ; but the shoulder of the mountain which shuts in the cahon already glowed with sunlight in a wonderful compound of gold and rose arid green ; and this , too , would kindle , although more mildly and with rainbow tints , the fissures of our crazy gable . If I were sleeping heavily , it was the bold blue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come to myself in that earlier and fairer light . One Sunday morning , about five , the first brightness called me . I rose and turned to the east , not for my devotions , but for air . The night had been very still ; the little private gale that blewr every evening in our cafion for ten minutes , or perhaps a quarter of an hour , had swiftly blown itself out ; in the hours that followed not a sigh of wind had shaken the tree-tops ; and our barrack , for all its trenches , was less fresh that morning than of wont . But I had no sooner reached the window than I forgot all else in the sight that met my eyes ; and I made but two bounds into my clothes , and down the crazy plank to the platform . The sun was still concealed below the opposite hill-tops , though it was shining already not twenty feet above my head on our own mountain slope . But the scene , beyond a few near features , was entirely changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes and woody foot-hills of the range ; and in their place , not a thousand feet below me , rolled a great level ocean . It was as though I had gone to bed the night before , safe in a nook of inland mountains , and had awakened in a bay upon the coast . I had seen these inundations from below ; at Calistoga I had risen and gone abroad in the early morning , coughing and sneezing , under fathoms on fathoms of gray sea vapor like a cloudy sky : a dull sight for the artist , and a painful experience for the invalid . But to sit aloft one 's self in the pure air and under the unclouded dome of heaven , and thus look down on the submergence of the valley , was strangely different and even delightful to the eyes . Far away were hill-tops like little islands . Nearer land , a smoky surf beat about the foot of precipices and poured into all the coves of these rough mountains . The color of that fog ocean was a thing never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrides and just about sundown , I have seen something like it on the sea itself . But the white was not so // opaline , nor was there , what surprisingly increased the effect , that breathless , crystal stillness over all . Even in its gentlest moods , the salt sea travails , moaning among the weeds or lisping on the sand ; but that vast fog ocean lay in a trance of silence , nor did the sweet air of the morning tremble with a sound . As I continued to sit upon the dump , I began to observe that this sea was not so level as , at first sight , it appeared to be . Away in the extreme south , a little hill of fog arose against the sky above the general surface ; and as it had already caught the sun , it shone on the horizon like the top-sails of some giant ship . There were huge waves , stationary , as it seemed , like waves in a frozen sea ; and yet , as I looked again , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow and august advance . And while I was yet doubting , a promontory of the hills some four or five miles away , conspicuous by a bouquet of tall pines , was in a single instant overtaken and swallowed up . It re-appeared in a little with its pines , but this time as an islet , and only to be swallowed up once more , and then for good . This set me looking nearer hand , and 1 saw that in every cove along the line of mountains the fog was being piled in higher and higher as though by some wind that was inaudible to me . I could trace its progress , one **uie tree first growing hazy and then disappearing after another ; although sometimes there was none of this forerunning haze , but the whole opaque white ocean gave a start and swallowed a piece of mountain-side at a gulp . It was to flee these poisonous fogs that I had left the seaboard and climbed so high among the mountains . And now , behold , here came the fog to besiege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully that my first thought was of welcome . The sun had now gotten much higher , and through all the gaps of the hills it cast long bars of gold across that white ocean . An eagle , or some other very great bird of the mountain , came wheeling over the nearer pine-tops , and hung , poised and something sideways , as if to look abroad on that unwonted desolation , spying , perhaps with terror , for the eyries of her comrades . Then , with a long cry , she disappeared again toward Lake County and the clearer air . At length , it seemed to me as if the flood were beginning to subside . The old landmarks by whose disappearance I had measured its advance , here a crag , there a brave pine tree , now began , in the inverse order , to make their re-appearance into daylight . I judged all danger of the fog was over for this little while . This was not Noah 's flood ; it was but a warning spring , and would now drift out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal exhilarated by the sight , I went into the house to light the fire . I suppose it was nearly seven when I once more mounted the platform to look abroad . The fog ocean had swelled up enormously since last I saw it ; and a few hundred feet below me , in the deep gap where the Toll House stands and the road runs through into Lake County , it had already topped the slope , and was pouring over and down the other side like driving smoke . The wind had climbed along with it ; and though I was still in calm air , I could see the trees tossing below me , and their long , strident sighing mounted to me where I stood . Half an hour later , the fog had surmounted all the ridge on the opposite side of the gap , though a shoulder of the mountain still warded it out of our cahon . Napa Valley and its bounding hills were now utterly blotted out . The fog , snowy white in the sunshine , was pouring over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing tree-tops appearing and disappearing in the spray . The air struck with a little chill , and set me coughing . It smelt strong of the fog , like the smell of a xvashing-house , but with a shrewd tang of the sea-salt . Had it not been for two things ,  --  the sheltering spur which answered as a ( lyke , and the great valley on the other side which rapidly ingulfed whatever mounted ,  --  our own little platform in the caflon must have been already buried a hundred feet in salt and poisonous air . As it was , the interest of the scene entirely occupied our minds . We were set just out of the wind , and but just above the fog , and could listen to the voice of the one as to music on the stage ; we could plunge our eyes down into the other as into some flowing stream from over the parapet of a bridge ; thus we looked on upon a strange , impetuous , silent , shifting exhibition of the powers of nature , and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream . The imagination loves to trifle with what is not . Had this been indeed the deluge , I should have felt more strongly , but the emotion would have been similar in kind . I played with the idea , as the child flees in delighted terror from the creations of his fancy . The look of the thing helped me . And when at last I began to flee up the mountain , it was , indeed , partly to escape from the raw air that kept me coughing , but it was also part in play . As I ascended the mountain-side , I came once more to overlook the upper surface of the fog ; but it was a different appearance from what I had beheld at day-break . For , first , the sun now fell on it from high overhead , // and its surface shone and undulated like a great nor'land moor country sheeted with untrodden morning snow . And next , the new level must have been a thousand or fifteen hundred feet higher than the old , so that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me still stood out . Napa Valley was now one with Sonoma on the west . On the hither side , only a thin scattered fringe of bluffs was unsubmerged ; and through all the gaps the fog was pouring over , like an ocean , into the blue , clear , sunny country on the east . There it was soon lost , for it fell instantly into the bottom of the valleys , following the water-shed ; and the hill-tops in that quarter were still clear cut upon the eastern sky . Through the Toll House gap and over the near ridges on the other side , the deluge was immense . A spray of thin vapor was thrown high above it , rising and falling and blown into fantastic shapes . The speed of its course was like a mountain torrent . Here and there a few tree-tops were discovered and then whelmed again ; and for one second the bough of a dead pine beckoned out of the spray like the arm of a drowning man . But still the imagination was dissatisfied , still the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as it seemed so , to the eye ) , with what a plunge of reverberating thunder would it have rolled upon its course , disemboweling mountains and deracinating pines ! And yet water it was , and sea water at that ; true Pacific billows , only somewhat rarefied , rolling in mid-air among the hill-tops . I climbed still higher , among the red rattling gravel and dwarf underwood of Mount Saint Helena , until I could look right down upon Silverado , and admire the favored nook in which it lay . The snowy plain of fog was several hundred feet higher ; behind the protecting spur a gigantic accumulation of cottony vapor threatened , with every second , to blow over and submerge our homestead ; but the vortex setting past the Toll House was too strong ; and there lay our little platform , in the arms of the deluge , but still enjoying its unbroken sunshine . About eleven , however , thin spray came flying over the friendly buttress , and I began to think the fog had hunted out its Jonah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind veered while we were at dinner , and began to blow equally from the mountain summit ; and by half-past one all that world of sea-fogs was utterly routed , and fleeing here and there into the south in little rags of cloud . And instead of a lone sea1 ) each , we found ourselves once more inhabiting a high mountain-side , with the clear , green country far below us , and the light smoke of Calistoga blowing in the air . This was the great Russian campaign for that season ; now and then , in the early morning , a little white lakelet of fog would be seen far down in Napa Valley ; but the heights were not again assailed , nor was the surrounding world again shut off from Silverado . A STARRY DRIVE . IN our rule at Silverado , there was a melancholy interregnum . The queen and the crown prince with one accord fell sick ; and as I was sick to begin with , our lone position on Mount Saint Helena was no longer tenable , and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . By that time we had begun to realize the difficulties of our position ; we had found what an amount of labor it cost to support life in our red cafion ; and it was the dearest desire of our hearts to get a China boy to go along with us when we returned . We could have given him a whole house to himself selfcontained , as they say in the advertisements , and on the money question we were prepared to go far . Kong Sam Kee , the Calistoga washerman , was intrusted with the office ; and from day to day it languished on , with protestations on our part and mellifluous excuses on the part of Kong Sam Kee . At length , about half-past eight of our last evening , with the wagon ready harnessed to convey us up the grade , the washerman , with a somewhat sneering air , produced the boy . He was a handsome , gentlemanly lad , attired in rich dark blue and shod with snowy white ; but alas ! he had heard rumors of Silverado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountainside , with no friendly wash-house near by , where he might smoke a pipe of opium o nights , with other China boys , and lose his little earnings at the game of tan ; and he just backed out for more money , and then , when that demand was satisfied , refused to come point-blank . He was wedded to his washhouses ; he had no taste for the rural life ; and we must go to our mountain servantless . It must have been near half an hour before we reached that conclusion , standing in the midst of Calistoga high street under the stars , and the China boy and Kong Sam Kee singing their pigeon English in the sweetest voices and with the most musical inflections . We were not , however , to return alone ; for we brought with us Joe Strong , the painter , a most good-natured comrade and a capital hand at an omelette . I do not know in which capacity he was most valued , as a cook or a companion ; and he did excellently well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unduly ; it must have been half-past // nine before we left Calistoga , and night came fully ere we struck the bottom of the grade . I have never seen such a night . It seemed to throw calumny in the teeth of all the painters that ever dabbled in starlight . The sky itself was of a ruddy , powerful , nameless , changing color , dark and glossy like a serpent 's back . The stars , by innumerable millions , stuck boldly forth like lamps . The milky way was bright , like a moonlit cloud ; half heaven seemed milky way . The greater luminaries shone each more clearly than a winter 's moon ; their light was dyed in every sort of color , red like fire , blue like steel , green like the tracks of sunset ; and so sharply did each stand forth in its own luster , that there was no appearance of that flat , star-spangled arch we know so well in pictures , but all the bottom of heaven was one chaos of contesting luminaries-a hurly-burly of stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redly dark . As xve continued to advance , the lesser lights and milky ways first grew pale and then vanished ; the countless hosts of heaven dwindled in number by successive millions ; those that still shone had tempered their exceeding brightness and fallen back into their customary wistful distance ; and the sky . declined from its first bewildering splendor into the appearance of a common night . Slowly this change proceeded , and still there was no sign of any cause . Then a whiteness like mist was thrown over the spurs of the mountain . Yet awhile and , as we turned a corner , a great leap of silver light and net of forest shadows fell across the road and upon our wandering wagonful ; and swimming low among the trees , we beheld a strange , misshapen , waning moon , half tilted on her back . " Where are ye when the moon appears ? " as the old poet sang , half taunting , to the stars , bent upon a courtly purpose . " As the sunlight round the dim earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide portals , Viewless to the eyes of mortals , Till it floods the moon 's pale islet on the morning 's golden shores . " So sings Mr. Trowbridge , with a noble inspiration . And so had the sunlight flooded that pale islet of the moon ; and her lit face put out , one after another , that galaxy of stars . The wonder of the drive was over ; but by some nice conjunction of clearness in the air and fit shadow in the valley where we traveled , we had seen for a little while that brave display of the midnight heavens . It was gone , but it had been ; nor shall I ever again behold the stars with the same mind . He who has seen the sea commoved with a great hurricane , thinks of it very dif ferently from him who has seen it only in a calm . The difference between a calm and a hurricane is not greatly more striking than that between the ordinary face of night and the splendor that shone upon us in that drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tropics ; but even that bears no comparison ,  - -  the nameless color of the sky , the hues of the star-fire , and the incredible projection of the stars themselves , starting from their orbits , so that the eye seemed to distinguish their positions in the hollow of space , these were things that we had never seen before and shall never see again . Meanwhile , in this altered night , we proceeded on our way among the scents and silence of the forest , reached the top of the grade , wound up by Hanson 's , and came at last to a stand under the flying gargoyle of the chute . Sam , who had been lying back , fast asleep , with the moon on his face , got down with the remark that it was pleasant " to be home . " The wagon turned and drove away , the noise gently dying in the woods , and we clambered up the rough path , Caliban 's great feat of engineering , and came home to Silverado . The moon shone in at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . The one tall pine beside the ledge was steeped in silver . Away up the cafion , a wild-cat welcomed us with three discordant squalls . But , once we had lit a candle and begun to review our improvements , homely in either sense , and count our stores , it was wonderful what a feeling of possession and permanence grew up in the hearts of the lords of Silverado . A bed had still to be made up for Strong , and the morning 's water to be fetched , with clinking pail ; and as we set about these household duties , and showed off our wealth and conveniences before the stranger , and had a glass of wine , I think , in honor of our return , and trooped at length , one after another , up the flying bridge of plank , and lay down to sleep in our shattered , moon-pierced barrack , we were among the happiest sovereigns in the world , and certainly ruled over the most contented people . Yet , in our absence , the palace had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in and carried off a side of bacon , a hatchet , and two knives . TOILS AND PLEASURES . I MUST try to convey some notion of our life , of how the days passed , and what pleasure we took in them , of what there was to do , and how we set about doing it , in our mountain hermitage . The house , after we had repaired the worst of the damages , and // filled in some of the doors and windows with white cotton cloth , became a healthy and a pleasant dwelling-place , always airy and dry , and haunted by the outdoor perfumes of the glen . Within , it had the look of habitation , the human look . You had only to go into the third room , which we did not use , and see its stones , its sifting earth , its tumbled litter , and then return to our lodging with the beds made , the plates on the rack , the pail of bright water behind the door , the stove crackling in a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and man 's order , the little clean spots that he creates to dwell in , were at once contrasted with the rich passivity of nature . And yet our house was everywhere so wrecked and shattered , the air came and went so freely , the sun found so many port-holes , . the golden outdoor glow shone in so many open chinks , that we enjoyed , at the same time , some of the comforts of a roof and much of the gayety and brightness of al-fresco life . A single shower of rain , to be sure , and we should have been drowned out like mice . But ours was a Californian summer , and an earthquake was a far likelier accident than a shower of rain . Trustful in this fair weather , we kept the house for kitchen and bedroom , and used the platform as our summer parlor . The sense of privacy , as I have said already , was complete . We could look over the dump on miles of forest and rough hill-top ; our eyes commanded some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little county townships sat so close together along the line of the rail ; but here there was no man to intrude . None but the Hansons were our visitors . Even they came but at long intervals , or twice daily , at a stated hour , with milk . So our days , as they were never interrupted , drew out to the greater length ; hour melted insensibly into hour ; the household duties , though they were many and some of them laborious , dwindled into mere islets of business in a sea of sunny day-time ; and it appears to me , looking back , as though the far greater part of our life at Silverado had been passed propped upon an elbow or seated on a plank , listening to the silence that there is among the hills . My work , it is true , was over early in the morning . I rose before any one else , lit the stove , put on the water to boil , and strolled forth upon the platform to wait till it was ready . Silverado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mountain higher up . A clean smell of trees , a smell of the earth at morning , hung in the air . Regularly , every day , there was a single bird , not singing , but awkwardly chirruping among the green madronas ; and the sound was cheerful , natural , and stirring . It did not hold the attention nor interrupt the thread of meditation like a blackbird or a nightingale ; it was mere woodland prattle , of which the mind was conscious like a perfume . The freshness of these morning seasons remained with me far on into the day . As soon as the kettle boiled , I made porridge and coffee ; and that , beyond the literal drawing of water and the preparation of kindling , which it would be hyperbolical to call the hewing of wood , ended my domestic duties for the day . Thenceforth , my wife labored single-handed in the palace , and I lay or wandered on the platform at my own sweet will . The little corner near the forge , where we found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed connected in my mind with some nightmare encounters over Euclid and the Latin grammar . These were known as Sam 's lessons . He was supposed to be the victim and the sufferer ; I ) ut here there must have been some misconception . For , whereas I generally retired to bed after one of these engagements . he was no sooner set free than he dashed up to the Chinaman 's house , where he had installed a printing-press , that great element of civilization , and the sound of his labors would be faintly audible about the cafion half the day . To walk at all was a laborious business . The foot sank and slid , the boots were cut to pieces among sharp , uneven , rolling stones . When we crossed the platform in any direction , it was usual to lay a course , using as much as possible the line of wagon-rails . Thus , if water were to be drawn , the watercarrier left the house along some tilting planks that we had laid down and not laid down very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway , and the railway served him as far as to the head of the shaft . I3ut from there to the spring and back again he made the best of his unaided way , staggering among the stones and wading in low growth of the calcanthus , where the rattlesnakes lay hissing at his passage . Yet I liked to draw water . It was pleasant to dip the gray metal pail into the clean , colorless , cool water ; pleasant to carry it back , with the water lipping at the edge and a broken sunbeam quivering in the midst . But the extreme roughness of the walking confined us in common practice to the platform , and , indeed , to those parts of it that were most easily accessible along the line of rails . The rails came straight forward from the shaft , here and there overgrown with little green bushes . but still entire , and still carrying a truck , which it was Sam 's delight to trundle to and fro by the hour with van- // ous ladings . About midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving our house and coasting along the far side within a few yards of the madronas and the forge , and not far off the latter ended in a sort of platform on the edge of the dump . There , in old days , the trucks were tipped and their loads sent thundering down the chute . There , besides , was the only spot where we could approach the margin of the dump . Anywhere else , you took your life in your right hand when you came within a yard and a half to peer over ; for , at any moment , the dump might begin to slide and carry von ( lown and bury you below its ruins . Indeed , the neighborhood of an old mine is a place beset with dangers ; for , as still as Silverado was , at any moment the report of rotten wood might tell us that the platform had fallen into the shaft , the dump might begin to pour into the road below , or a wedge slip in the great upright seam , and hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already compared the dump to a rampart , built certainly by some rude people and for prehistoric wars . It was likewise a frontier . All below was green and woodland , the tall pines soaring one above another , each with a firm outline and full spread of bough . All above was arid , rocky , and bald . The great spout of broken mineral , that here dammed the cafion up , was a creature of man 's handiwork ,  --  its material dug out with pick and powder , and spread by the service of the trucks . But Nature herself in that upper district , seemed to have had an eye to nothing besides mining ; and even the natural hill-side was all sliding gravel and precarious bowlder . Close at the margin of the well , leaves would decay to skeletons and mummies , which at length some stronger gust would carry clear of the cafion and scatter in the subjacent woods . Even moisture and decaying vegetable matter could not , with all nature 's alchemy , concoct enough soil to nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , in the neighborhood of all silver mines ,  --  the nature of that precious rock being stubborn with quartz and poisonous with cinnabar . Both were plenty in our Silverado . The stones sparkled white in the sunshine with quartz ; they were all stained red with cinnabar . Here , doubtless , came the Indians of yore to paint their faces for the war-path , and cinnabar , if I remember rightly , was one of the few articles of Indian commerce . Now , Sam had it in his undisturbed possession , to potind down and slake , and paint his rude designs with . But to me it had always a fine flavor of poetry , compounded out of Indian story and Hawthornden 's allusion : 9 ' " Desire , alas , desire a Zeuxis new , From Indies borrowing gold , from eastern skies Most bright cinoper Yct this is but half the picture ; our Silverado platform had another side to it . Though there was no soil and scarce a blade of grass , yet out of these tumbled gravel heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservatory . Calcanthus crept like a hardy weed all over our rough parlor , choking the railway and pushing forth its rusty , aromatic cones from between two blocks of shattered mineral . Azaleas made a big snow-bed just above the well . Thc shoulder of the hill waved white with Mediterranean heath . In the crannies of the ledge , and about the spurs of the tall pine , a red flowering stone-plant hung in clusters . Even the low , thorny chaparral was thick with pealike blossom . Close at the foot of our path , nutmegs prospered , delightful to the sight and smell . At sunrise and again late at night , the scent of the sweet bay-trees filled the cafion and the down-blowing night wind must have borne it hundreds of feet into the outer air . All this vegetation , to be sure , was stunted . The madrona was here no bigger than the manzanita ; the bay was but a stripling shrub : the very pines , with four or five exceptions , in all our upper cafion were not as tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them came lower than to my waist . For a prosperous forest tree , we must look below where the glen was crowded with green spires . But for flowers and ravishing perfume , we had none to envy ; our heap of road metal was thick with bloom like a hawthom in the front of June ; our red , baking angle in the mountain a laboratory of poignant scents . It was an endless wonder to my mind , as I dreamed about the platform , following the progress of the shadows , where the madrona with its leaves , the azalea and calcanthus with their blossoms , could find moisture to support such thick , wet , waxy growths , or the bay tree collect the ingredients of its perfume . But there they all grew was it only vegetable life that prospered . We had indeed few birds , and none that had much of a voice , or anything worthy to be called a song . My morning comrade had a thin chirp , unmusical and monotonous , hut friendly and pleasant to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ostentatious cry of near an octave descending , not one note of which properly followed another . This is the only bird I ever knew with a wrong ear . But there was something enthralling about his peribrmance ; you listened and // listened , thinking each time he must surely get it right . But no ; it was always wrong , and always wrong the same way . Yet he seemed proud of his song , delivered it with execution and a manner of his own , and was *harming to his mate . A very incorrect , incessant human whistler had thus a chance of knowing how his own music pleased the world . Two great birds , eagles we thought , dwelt at the top of the cai*on , among the crags that were printed on the sky . Now and again , but very rarely , they wheeled high over our heads in silence , or with a distant , ( lying scream ; and then , with a fresh impulse , winged fleetly forward , dipped over a hill-top , and were gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ,  --  perhaps co*val with the mountain where they haunted , perhaps emigrants from Rome , where the glad legions may have shouted to behold them on the morn of battle . But if birds were rare , the place abounded with rattlesnakes  --  the rattlesnakes ' nest , it might have been named . Whenever we brushed among the bushes , our passage woke their angry buzz . One dwelt habitually in the wood-pile , and , sometimes , when we came for flre-xvood , thrust up his small head between two logs , and hissed at the intrusion . The rattle has a legendary credit ; it is said to be awe-inspiring , and , once heard , to stamp itself forever in the memory . But the sound is not at all alarming . The hum of many insects and the buzz of the wasp convince the ear of danger quite as readily . As a matter of fact , we lived for weeks in Silverado , coming and going , with rattles sprung on every side , and it never occurred to us to be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain pleasant walk among azalea and calcanthus , the rattles whizzing on every side like spinning-wheels , and the combined hiss or buzz rising louder and angrier at every sudden movement ; but I was never in the least impressed , nor ever attacked . It was only toward the end of our stay that a man down at Calistoga , who was expatiating on the terrifying nature of the sound , gave me at last a very good imitation ; and it burst on me at once that we dwelt in the very metropolis of deadly snakes , and that the rattle was simply the commonest noise in Silverado. immediately on our return , we attacked the Hansons on the subject . They had formerly assured us that our cafion was favored , like Ireland , with an entire absence of all poisonous reptiles ; but , with the perfect inconsequence of the natural man , they were no sooner found out than they went off at score in the contrary direction , and we were told that in no part of the world did rattlesnakes attain to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Silverado . This is a contribution rather to the natural history of the Hansons than to that of snakes . One person , however , better served by his instinct , had known the rattle from the first , and that was Chuchu , the dog . No rational creature has ever led an existence more poisoned by terror than that dog 's at Silverado . Every whiz of the rattle made him bound . His eyes rolled ; he trembled ; he would be often wet with sweat . One of our greatest mysteries was his terror of the mountain . A little way above our nook , the azaleas and almost all the vegetation ceased . Dwarf pines , not big enough to be Christmas-trees , grew thinly among loose stones and gravel seams . Here and there a big bowlder sat quiescent on a knoll , having paused there till the next rain , in his long slide down the mountain . There was here no ambuscade for the snakes ; you could see clearly where you trod ; and yet the higher I went the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie was an excellent master of that composite language in which dogs communicate with men ; and he would assure me , on his honor , that there was some peril on the mountain ,  - -  appeal to me , by all that I held holy , to turn back ,  --  and at length , finding all was in vain , and that I still persisted , ignorantly foolhardy , he would suddenly whip round and make a bee-line down the slope for Silverado , the gravel showering after him . What was he afraid of ? There were , admittedly , brown bears and California lions on the mountain and a grizly visited Rupe 's poultry-yard not long before , to the unspeakable alarm of Caliban , who dashed out to chastise the intruder and found himself , by moonlight , face to face with such a tartar . Something , at least , there must have been ; some hairy , dangerous brute lodged permanently among the rocks a little to the north-west of Silverado , spending his summer thereabout , with wife and family . Crickets were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , each with a corner of his own , who used to make night musical at Silverado . In the matter of voice they far excelled the birds , and their ringing whistle sounded from rock to rock , calling and replying the same thing , as in a meaningless opera . Thus , children in full health and spirits shout together , to the dismay of neighbors ; and their idle , happy , deafening vociferations rise and fall like the song of the crickets . I used to sit at night on the platform and wonder why these creatures were so happy , and what was wrong with man that he also did not wind up his days with an hour or two of shouting ; but
