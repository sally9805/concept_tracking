txt In an interview this afternoon , General Master Workman Powderly , when asked what he thought of Mr. Gould 's reply to his manifesto , said : " I have not had much time to think of it for this has been an unusually busy day with me . I do n't think , however , that Mr. Gould has answered my letter . His reply is a quibble and an evasion and he fairly slops over on some points . All there is in his communication has been said before . He evidently wants to pose before the country in the light of a martyr , but the Knights of Labor do n't propose to honor him with martyrdom . we have Invited him to carry his threats of prosecution into the courts and we are ready to meet him there . He announced sometime ago his intention to commence a series of prosecutions against the Knights of Labor and we want him to proceed at once . We shall not be swayed from our course by anything be may say or do . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to investigate the Southwestern trouble , from root to branch all along the line from St. Louis to the Mexican border . The result of this investigation will be published to the world , and if the Knights of Labor who struck ? are at fault they will not be screened . We are anxious , however , to have a Congressional committee investigate the strike first , ascertain the causes leading to it . then make them public without delay . Mr. Gould acts , or rather talks , like a man who fears that he will be injured . If be should be punished legally for unlawful acts of his , that would not be unjustly injuring him . It would merely be upholding the law . If any of our men are amenable let them also suffer the punishment due their acts and lot the law be uphold . " Continuing Mr. Powderly said : " This matter is now in the hands of our General Executive Board , and nothing must he done without their consent so far as the Knights of Labor are concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find lawless characters enough to commit acts of violence and to resort to all sorts of incendiary methods , but we will not countenance such a thing nor anything likely to lead to violence .
