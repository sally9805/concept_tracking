txt The Brewers ' Convention , ? held on Monday at Rochester , was signalized by an unusually rational and temperate appeal to public opinion in the speech of the President , Mr. SCHARMANN . It is not praising the address very highly to say that it evinced much more temperance in the use of language than we are accustomed to in the appeals of the professed advocates of temperance in the use of liquor , who are simply , in fact , the advocates of enforced abstinence . The point which Mr. SCHARMANN labored to bring out was that , as a political and social question , the practical question is not between indulgence and abstinence , but between the use of fermented liquors and the use of distilled liquors . An advocate of prohibition must be an extreme zealot who will not admit . that it is better for a man who drinks habitually to drink beer than to drink ardent spirits . In point of fact , a man who confines his drinking to sound beer will find it difficult to injure himself very seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilious tendency ; while it is difficult for any man habitually to drink even good spirits without injury ; and bad beer is distinctly less injurious than bad whisky . Nobody who remembers what the drinking habits of this country were thirty or forty years ago is ever found to deny that there has been in the interval a great change for the better . This change has not been wrought by the influence of temperance orators or of prohibitory statutes . It has been wrought by the establishment of German breweries , and by the substitution of lager beer for ardent spirits as the common drink of drinking men . It is scarcely too much to say that if malt liquors had been the exclusive beverage of the people a temperance agitation would never have been heard of . It is certain that it would never have gained force enough to secure the adoption of a prohibitory law in a single State , Beer-drinking being thus at least a palliative of the evils of intemperance , it seems obvious that the worst course legislation can take is to discourage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. SCHARMANN insists , and adduces statistics to prove , that this has been the effect , and almost the only effect , of prohibitory laws . The contraband sale of beer is not a profitable industry , and can therefore , be suppressed , while the contraband sale of spirits can not be suppressed . A rational legislator who really wished to mitigate . the evils of intemperance would discriminate in favor of the milder and less injurious potation by a system of graduated licenses . This was the object aimed at by the High License bill introduced into the last Legislature . Such a measure will be opposed by the zealots of prohibition and by the sellers of rum , but it ought to be supported by all persons who belong to neither class . Another safeguard that should be adopted is a guarantee of the soundness and wholesomeness of the beer manufactured , and this is a purpose which can be attained by the action of the brewers themselves . It is not creditable to them that , with the proportions to which their industry has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fastidious concerning the quality of their beverage confine themselves to imported beer .
