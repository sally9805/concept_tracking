txt The English illustrated Magazine is a distinct attempt by the well-known house of MacitirLIAN &; Co. to meet the competition of American magazines in England with one devised on a very similar plan and selling at the low price of sixpence . The experience of the house in this country , together with its high standing at home , makes it peculiarly fitted for a venture of this sort , and the result will be watched with interest . That the new magazine , if successful , will supplant the Century and Barper 's in England is hardly among the probabilities , since on the one hand it is adapted to a different field , and , on the other , all really good work  --  and the work in this magazine is certainly good  --  of this kind is likely to increase the demand for similar work . The Illustrated differs radically from the type of periodical which has of late years been most successful in England , and of which Macrnalan 's is a fair representative , not only from the fact that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to address a lower , it addresses a broader class , of readers . The prospectus announces that it is intended " to satisfy the tastes of all who are interested in literature and art . " Science will not be neglected , and industry , travel , national sports , and social topics will receive attention , but politics is not mentioned , and the first number of the magazine contains nothing referring to it . The field of the new magazine is , therefore , different in scope from , and only in small part identical with , that of the older ones in England , which derive much of their value from political and semi-political discussions , and which , on that account , have to a great extent replaced the reviews which until within a dozen years played so important a part . Judged by comparison with the older magazines , the new one has the advantage of cheapness . Published at one-half the price , it contains about the same amount of reading matter as the older periodicals , with the added attraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilarper 's , this advantage is not so obvious . The first number , for instance , has seven articles , of which four are illustrated , three of them profusely , and there is , besides , a full-page print of one of ALMA-TAM/MA 'S paintings . Comparing this with a recent number of the Century , we find that the latter contains about two and one-half times the printed matter , in twenty articles , of which eight are illustrated , with three full-page prints , and there are two " departments " of varied contents , one being lightly and cleverly illustrated . A recent number of Lraiper 's shows about the same quantity of reading matter as the ' Century , divided among fourteen articles and three departments , of which seven are largely illustrated , and there is a full-page print for frontispiece . Obviously the purchaser of these gets more for his money , the difference in price included , than tue purchaser of the illustrated Magazine . If we compare the quality , we think it is fair to say that the standard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American houses . Inevitably there is much greater variety in the larger publications . The full-page print of ALMA-TADEMA 'S " Shy " is much better done than most English work of the kind . The subject is well chosen , and the engraving is skillful and effective . The result is extremely pleasing , but hardly so satisfactory as similar work in the magazines of this country . It lacks in refinement and in delicacy and precision . The engravings of the illustrations of the article on " Rossetti 's Influence in Art , " made by J. D. Cooran , are better , and that of " Lady Liilette " is , on the whole , as good work as the Americans have yet given . In the smaller engravings , such as the illustrations to the article on the " Law Courts , " the engraver 's work is not equal to that of the designer , who shows greater cleverness and aptitude for rendering character in small figures than we often meet with , A peculiar and very charming feature of the Eng . lish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L ' Art . is the friezes. initial letters , and tail-pieces , engraved mostly from designs of the old Dutch and French schools . These are selected with nice taste , and are well executed . They may not contribute largely to the sale of a sixpenny magazine , but they can not fail to give pleasure to many of its readers . The literary standard of the new magazine is high  --  quite as high , all things considered , as that of the American , and far higher than that of any illustrated magazines heretofore to he had from England . The article " From the Old Law Courts to the New , " by F. W. MAITLAND , is a model in its kind , easily read but ingeniously and genuinely instructive . The scientific articles seem to occupy a disproportionate space . That on " The Dormouse a0Home , " by the indefatigable GRANT ALLEN , is one which must find many readers , but that on " Oysters and the Oyster Question , " which is " to be continued , " by Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at least , we are not familiar . It is too elaborate for general reading , and hardly enough so for a scientific reader . Art is given ample representation in a judicious and thoughtful article by J. COMYN8 CARR , the English editor of L ' Art , which is above the level of most such work here , and is excellently illustrated . Fiction is introduced with a light sketch by WILLIAM BLACK and the opening chapters of a medieval romance by Miss YONGE , which one involuntarily compares to SCOTT 'S work of this sort , to its own great disadvantage . The only poetry of the number is a rather long poem by SWINBURNE , which has much of his unapproachable richness of diction and simile , and is tenderly and even deeply felt , but which would be a sombre piece de resistance for an American magazine if it stood , as this does , alone . As we have said , this new enterprise will be watched with great interest . It is undertaken with vigor and judgment , and while it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways the most substantial possible tribute to their merit and influence .
