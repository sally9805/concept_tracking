CO*PERATION and profit-sharing are the two expedients by which it is now most often proposed to avoid undesirable antagonism between the employer and the employed , or , as it is commonly phrased , between Capital and Labor . Co6peration , although by no means the panacea which its more ardent advocates would have us believe , has this much in its favor , that when it is properly organized it is a legitimate and logical method of conducting business enterprizes. lit is then simply the contribution of the small savings of persons of moderate means to a fund which forms the capital for a business undertaking , in the prosecution of which the contributors may or may not be themselves employed , if the business is one of production , as manufacturing , the contributors to the capital are expected to be the employees of their own establishment . If the business is one of distribution , as in the case of coöperative stores , they are not employees , but are expected to be purchasers . In the one case , in addition to such ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also receive a share of such profits as may result , proportioned to the amount of their contribution to capital . In the other case they expect to reap their advantage parlAy in the form of profits on their investment , and partly in the way of purchases of what they need , at prices somewhat lower than the prevailing market rates . The only question then of importance to be considered in regard to cooperation is , can the contributors afford to take the risks of the business ? And the success of the undertaking depends on the ability of the management , and on the chances which attach to all business enterprises , and is subject in all respects to ordinary business laws . I know of no better example of a legal provision for true codperation than the Joint Stock law of Connecticut // which was framed with special reference to men of moderate means , the shares being allowed ( and by the law as originally framed , required ) to be but $25 each . Under this law coöperative enterprises have been conducted in Connecticut for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to attain under any circumstances . In England , where the idea a few years since was a novel one , some experiments having met with rather marked success , the people were led to believe that they had at length discovered the philosopher 's stone , and a glamour was thrown over the whole subject which has been reflected on this side of the Atlantic , and has bewildered the vision of many good but inexperienced people who did not appreciate that they had long had at their own doors , and in active operation , a legalized system combining all the advantages of this new-found English scheme . Prqflt-sharing proposes to pay the laborer by giving him : first , a stipulated fixed sum as wages , and second , a proportion of the profits of the business in which his employer is engaged in addition to his fixed wages . The advantages of this system are supposed to be : 1 . That the laborer will be better paid . 2 . That being interested in , and partly d*p*udent on , the pecuniary success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better and more faithful workman. 3 . That on this account his employer can afford to pay him more . 4 . That , as anything which he gets beyond his fixed wages is paid out of profits and in proportion to profits , therefore his employer can well afford this extra compensation . 5 . That it cultivates friendly relations between the employer and the employed . 6 . That it increases industry and stimulates self-respect in the workingmen . The first thing we note is that the scheme is based on the assumption that the workingman is now underpaid . We will not therefore discuss this question , but , admitting the assumption , the inquiry is whether this is the best way , or , at any rate , a fairly good way , to raise the standard of wages . The second point is , that , being interested in the pecuniary success of the business , the employee will be a better and more faithful workman . This is one of the strong points with the advocates of the system , and , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter not susceptible of demonstration , and in regard to which we can not resort to statistics . I can only say that from my experience and from my knowledge of the experience of others , I have not much confidence in the theory that because the workman has this small pecuniary interest in the result he will therefore be a better workman . The connection in his mind seems to be too indirect , if not too slight , to produce any such result . A workman of any energy and ambition is far more likely to be influenced by a desire for success and a sense of success in the immediate result of his work ; a good tool ; a well-finished product ; a successful manipulation of any kind , which shows at once for itself ; and a word of praise , a feeling of loyalty , or the e8prit du cor of his class will go much farther in stimulating and in compensating effort than any feeling that his daily work will at the year 's end slightly enhance his wages . Even small stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that account , any more desirable as workmen , or to have the success of the business any more at heart . A right to grumble and find fault or an endeavor to use their position in some indirect way , for their advantage is far more likely to be the result . Workmen as a rule when well treated , and especially American workmen , I have found to be a faithful and loyal set of people . And with them I have no fault to find . But I wish to put the thing precisely as it is , neither exaggerate nor set down aught in malice , and the result of my observation is that I would not give one penny more for a man as a workman simply because he had a slight pecuniary interest in the profit accruing to me , as the result of his labors . There is an enthusiasm and an interest which may be aroused among any organized body of men , by a leader or a manager who has a genius for it , that is of the greatest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combined effort of numbers , whether it be storming a fortress or running a factory . The basis of this is very largely that power of sympathy which we call magnetism , combined with a certain will power , which makes a man a leader . And the man of enthusiastic temperament and ready sympathy who would try profit sharing as an experiment would also be likely to be // a man who would have this sort of power , and would be led to attribute results to his profit-sharing scheme which were really wholly due to other causes . To my mind this accounts largely for those rose-colored reports which we occasionally get of the success of experiments of this kind . As to the pecuniary advantage to be derived by the workman himself . The reasoning in favor of the value of the plan in this respect seems usually to proceed on the assumption that all business undertakings are profitable . We know , when brought face to face with this statement , that it is not so . But the extent to which it is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I fancy very much lost sight of , or greatly disregarded as an element to be considered in judging the value of this method of remuneration . A few statistics bearing on the subject may not be amiss . There are in the State of Connecticut twenty-three or twentyfour railroads . Now if we except a few that for reasons of policy have been leased by stronger roads , there are not more than four or five that are paying dividends to holders of the original stock . Now profit-sharing on the other nineteen , or say four-fifths of the whole , as a method of getting workman 's wages would have been a very poor investment for the workman . Again , when in 1880 , the joint stock law of Connecticut was revised , twelve hundred corporations were wiped out of existence at one time , because they had utterly failed to answer the hopes of their projectors , and had ceased to do business . How many non-corporate experiments showing failures of a similar sort this may represent we have no means to determine ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . If I remember rightly the commercial reports give us an average of about two hundred failures for each week in the year ; and these are bankruptcies where the business has come to an end , and are probably only a tithe of those that struggle on in a precarious existence without profit , waiting for something to turn up to save them from bankruptcy . Can the laborer wisely afford to take these risks ? If any one says we do not mean that the laborer shall get any less regular wages , but shall receive an addition thereto by sharing in the profits , that reasoning seems to me fallacious . For while I do not put full // faith in lai8sez-faire , and think it worth while to make an effort that every man should get his just due , yet , the fact remains that , on the whole , supply and demand and competition will regulate the price of all things , labor included , no matter how you may try to measure it . And again , I regard the moral influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nncertain , as it must be under this system , as very bad . If the workman succeeds in getting for a time extra pay he will be very sure to gange his expenses by his hopes and will form habits of expenditure that can only be shaken off by pain and self-denial , and will be much more likely not to be shaken off at all . It seems to me that what the workman needs above all things for his moral and financial good is a definite price aud a certainty of getting it . Suppose you are hiring a workman . He says , what wages do you offer ? You say , *$50 a month , and such a proportion of net profits . He very naturally asks , what will that be ? Well , last year it was 3 per cent . on wages ; year before 10 per cent . Year before that , nothing . Ca n't tell till the year is through . Yon take your chance with the rest of ns . Now , if he is a sensible man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Add 5 per cent . to the wages and say nothing about the profits . " This makes the wages a fixed sum and we come back to the old method . In these days of excitement , when walking delegates infest the earth and men 's heads are turned on the labor question , employers will fall in with popular whims to avoid strikes and other troubles , and by adopting profit-sharing or other popular devices , may succeed in doing so to their advantage ; but these are temporary expedients and are not founded in business laws . It may be said that experiments of this sort have been successful . Doubtless this is so ; but before measuring their value , as determining principles , we must endeavor to eliminate the personal equation . I once knew a school teacher , a man of remarkable success in his profession . His influence over his scholars and under-teachers was almost unbounded . " There is but one rule here , " he used to say to them , " and that one is not a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school there // are no rules . " Another favorite remark was : " We use text books here because they help to measure our work and keep us together , and they save some trouble , and besides , it is the fashion . But I hope no one puts much confidence in them . They are full of mistakes , and you have to be all the while on the watch . " Now that man 's personal influence was so great and the atmosphere of neatness and order which he induced so pervading that the pnpils and under-teachers would pick up chance scraps of paper from the school room floor and put them in their pockets lest he should see them , or because they had themselves become unable to endure any infraction of the general order which prevailed . But who would recommend this system , or lack of system , for general adoption , or how many teachers if they tried could make it work successfully ? It might be an inspiration or a suggestion of value , but not a method . The case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so often quoted to show the benefit of profit sharing , is a perfect illustration of mistaking the power of personal influence for the effect of a system . This was the case of a man prosecuting a business very simple in its nature , giving up his life with enthusiasm to a mingling of sentiment , business , philanthropy , and charity , able to impress his own will and methods on all about him , a sort of benevolent business despot who amused his people by letting them play at self-government while he really held the reins . A man so actuated , and so acting , could work out results highly praiseworthy in many respects , but of no value what ever as permanent and universal methods of business administration . It is a most excellent thing to induce workmen to practice economy , to learn temperance and to cultivate thrift ; to have libraries and burial clubs and night schools and savings banks , and debating societies and private theatricals and church suppers ; but that whole subject belongs to the domain of philanthropy or Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinite relation to questions of work and wages . If the plan of profit-sharing has the merit which some have supposed , it is destined to become general , or it should be ; and // we must try to look at it as it would be if it were universal and legal and compulsory , at least to this extent , that when the workman was to receive a share of profit as a part of his wages he should have the power to enforce the demand . This must be a necessary part of the scheme , otherwise the profit-sharing becomes mere almsgiving . A Christmas tnrkey presented to a workmen at the end of a profitable year is a very excellent thing but it is not profit-sharing ; and yet I think many people regard the two as being precisely the same in principle . Now , suppose the plan of profit-sharing to be universal , and it simply comes to this , that it is an attempt to raise the wages of the country by a method which introduces an element having au interest strongly antagonistic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one being strength , permanency and growth , while the interest of the other is to abstract each year the largest possible portion of earnings . It may be said that this is always virtually the relative position of employer and employed ; but here , when as I am supposing , the system has been legalized , we have an interest coupled with a power ; an element of annoyance , disturbance and positive danger ; a lever for the demagogue , an opportunity for the business rival , a harvest ripe for the sickle of the pettifogger . And , so far as the workman is concerned , it offers him a remuneration not according to his industry or his ability or his deserts , but according to the success in business of the person or corporation which employs him ; a condition of things as it seems to me likely to be fatal to all our old fashioned notions of loyalty and to place both workman and wages on a speculative basis . When , too , this method of remuneration becomes general it becomes by universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diminutions that attach to the present system of wages , and in obedience to these laws the amount paid as wages , as a whole , will settle down upon the same scale of proportion to production as would obtain under the ordinary method . There is considerable difficulty in treating this question satisfactorily in the form of an essay . This grows out of the fact that the objections to the scheme are largely , in fact , mainly ,  --  *of a practical character , and have to do with matters of // detail in business management . Sentiment and rhetoric are pleasing to our ears , while arithmetic , bookkeeping , legal problems and the investigations of the minute details of business generally are dry and wearisome , and in short , make us tired . Yet in order to understand the probable effect of the application of any untried system we must imagine so far as is possible all the situations which will grow out of it and endeavor to anticipate their arithmetical , financial , and legal results . In a small way , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is simple , profit-sharing may be adopted with success . As for instance in the common case of raising crops on shares . Here there can be no deterioration of plant , and in fact the capitalist really agrees to receive part of the product as a rent . It is not very infrequent to employ a salesman or other agent where an interest in profits constitutes a part of his compensation , and these cases are cited as a proof of the practicability of profit-sharing . It is , however , usual in such cases to fix by contract some arbitrary method of estimating profits which relieves the subject of some of its embarrassments , and even then it is not free from difficulty and is usually only adopted to avoid a strike or something akin to it , or to reward special skill . Humanly speaking , it is impossible to lay down a rule for the estimation of profits in a complicated manufacturing business which would be likely to be accepted by those who were endeavoring to carry on and build up the business and also by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a participation in the profits as a method of payment for their labor . So long as the parties interested in the business all have the same kind of interest , that is as stockholders or partners , each in proportion to his investment , differences may be waived and difficulties bridged over and a certain amount of patience and hope fulness excrcised , in the feeling that all are sharing alike , but so soon as you introduce this foreign element by which the workman regards the profit as a fund in part belonging to him , you lay the foundation for infinite trouble . It is not altogether easy to explain exhaustively in general terms why this should be so , especially to persons who have had no experien*e in the // conduct of complicated business , but I think I would feel pretty sure of assent to my proposition from any one who had . Let us take the case of a woolen mill working on goods designed for spring garments . It has a capital of $200,000 , $100,000 is invested in plant . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do so to work profitably . These goods must all be sold within a few weeks time in the fall . During all the rest of the year the mill is running and accumulating the goods . The commission merchant or selling agent in the city has stored the goods in a warehouse and the labor and material have been paid for by drawing drafts against the goods which are accepted by the agent and discounted by banks . The fiscal year of the mill ends in July . Eight or nine months ' production are on hand . Now , no one can tell at what price these goods will sell or even whether they may not have to be carried over to another season , with a heavy interest account running against them . The mill manager will make up its accounts , putting in these goods at such a price as he thinks prudent , perhaps at cost , perhaps at the price he thinks they will bring . This is merely for the purpose of accounting . The risk is not over yet , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends are paid from these earnings and only stockholders are interested , no one is wronged . But now by the terms of the bargain the workmen are absolutely entitled in law to their proportion of these profits . They have finished their year 's labor and they want their reward . Here is material for difference of opinion , for litigation , for ruin . This is only one sample from an endless variety . Take another . A mill takes out an old engine-only worth its weight for old iron when once out-say $300 , and puts in a new one costing $10,000 . This was a necessity , because the old one was wearing out and in danger of giving out . Yet it has run the mill . The new one can do no more . The earning power is no greater . Common business sense says , charge this new engine to repairs . This is what would ordinarily be done ; but that will take $10,000 , or at least $9,700 , out of profit account for that year . The workman says , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year for a new engine which // will last for eight or ten years ? And , viewed from his stand . point , he has reason in his question . Yet it is doubtful whether from the manager 's point of view a single penny of that cost should appear in profit . He can not afford to pay his stockholder nor his workmen for the privilege of putting in a new engine , for he knows that system of bookkeeping would end in grief . Every manufacturer understands that when he builds his plant and when he buys or makes a new tool or machine , he to a large extent sinks the cost of what he thus invests . Except for the one purpose for which it is designed it is almost , and in many instances entirely , worthless . Any failure of success therefore involves substantially the loss of all that he has invested . He makes allowance for this , and his earliest profits under sound management will be used to make good that risk by charging off a liberal portion of his investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a new business and the course dictated by prudence . But this would be in direct opposition to the interest of the profit-sharing workman . Suppose again that on the last day of the year an establishment is destroyed by fire . It is insured for three quarters of its value , but the one quarter loss more than wipes out all the profit of the year . What are the rights of the workman ? Then there is the question of allowance for bad debts and contingent losses , and many others of a similar nature . But I think I have said enough to indicate where the trouble lies . The special instances every one of experience can furnish for himself . That there is something fascinating in the idea that the laborer shall share in the profits of his work is not to be denied . That there are cases where it can be safely done is also true ; but that as a general method of regulating wages , or a safe , successful , or satisfactory plan of general application to the conduct of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimerical . We all know how much there is in the " art of putting things . " We sometimes get an altogether new and unexpected light by a slight variation in the form of statement . The SuL // tan in the story beheaded the unfortunate vizier who interpreted his dream to mean that he should die before his sons , while he rewarded with gifts him who interpreted it that his sons should flourish in splendor after he had gone to his rest . Let us try a little change of statement in the profit-sharing problem . Suppose instead of sayiug that the workman shall have his wages and a portion of the profit , we say , he shall have his wages unless there is a loss , in which case he shall suffer a proportionate deduction . How many subscribers would you find to that theory . You see the hardship of it at once . And yet , if there is any such thing as a wage fund or a point towards which the price of labor gravitates , what else is this scheme of profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workman 's wages , maximum and minimum , depend on the success of the business . The raison d'etre of profit-sharing is that in some way the workman should get higher wages because they are rightfully his ; because he earns them . The added portion is as much his by right as the fixed portion ; otherwise it is charity . And the operation of natural laws in case of the general adoption of any such plan would so regulate prices that in the cost of living the increment would be reckoned with the original sum as a part of the wages due ; and yet profit-sharing proposes that he shall lose a part of this , his lawful due , unless his employer so manages his business as to make enough to pay him in full out of a portion of the profits . No body of workingmen could safely take the risks of such a system , nor would they when they once saw clearly where it led . The practical difficulty in the application of profit-sharing to anything more than a very limited number of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , both interested in the profits , but whose interests are of a very diverse nature . Only one party is interested in the preservation of the capital . Only one party is interested in such a way that it can afford to submit to any present deprivation for the sake of future advantage , or at any rate will be likely to see the advantage of such submission . Yet this is frequently a matter of vital importance . And because their interests are diverse , one party will naturally be jealous and suspicious of // the other , and discord will ensue . So long as the workman is earning more than his neighbors he will be pleased and happy . If he receives less , which in any general application of the theory must frequently happen , he will be discontented . And it must never be lost sight of in all considerations of this sort that only a moderate proportion of business undertakings are successful . I began with admitting the assumption , for the purpose of the present paper , that our workingmen were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and important question , but wholly aside from the one herein discussed , which is simply whether profit-sharing is a practicable and desirable method of increasing wages . When , however , one reads the elaborate statistics of Mr. Edward Atkinson , showing that a day 's work will buy more to-day than almost ever before in the history of the world , in which I believe his conclusions to be correct , although his methods have been criticized ; when one notes the lavish extravagance in dress of our shop-girls and domestic servants ; when we remember that patches , those homely evidences of domestic thrift , are now a matter of history , and that our laboring people have bought their clothing ready made and thrown it aside when it needed mending until the use of the needle is almost a lost art among them ; when we see every species of amusement supported by funds drawn from the working people , and when we further reflect that a large majority of the great capitalists of to-day were twenty and twenty-five years ago working for less wages per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , furthermore , when we find that complaints of wages do not come from the industrious and prudent class but from the lazy and shiftless , have we not reason to suspect that there are other factors besides the amount of wages in the problem of success . Our working people see and desire and envy the result , but they wish to get it without the exertion and self-denial by which it has been achieved . They want the chestnuts of success , but they have no notion of burning their fingers at the fire of exertion . The problem with the workman or workwoman of to-day seems very largely to be how to render the least possible service and get the greatest possible pay . // I saw not long ago three men take hold of a bench of some weight to move it . it did not stir . They looked at each other . It was too much . They langhed . " Did ye lift ? " says one . " Not a hap'orth , " says the other . " Nayther did I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift , " says one . So they lifted and the bench was moved . This is modern labor . On the other hand I look back to the early days of manufactnring in New England , and I am old enough to remember before the times had changed , when our workmen and workwomen were our native born population . When the manufacturer , if his credit was good enough , frequently borrowed his capital from the man whom he hired as a workman , who preferred his fixed day 's wages to the risks of business , but was very glad that some one else was willing to take that risk and to give him employrnent and interest for his money . When strikes and strikers would have been scouted with contempt , when the workman was a man , or a woman . as the case might be , who had his own plans for the present and the future , who lived in his own house and knew what to do with his money . He had read in Poor Richard 's Almanac , " Spend one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw the point of it . Where are these men now ? They arid their sons are the capitalists and financiers and bankers and merchants and clergymen and professors and lawyers and doctors of to-day , and the women are their wives and mothers . And what had they that the present generation of laborers lack ? Only three things , and they are these : Industry , Honesty , Thrift . FREDERICK J. KINGSBURY .
