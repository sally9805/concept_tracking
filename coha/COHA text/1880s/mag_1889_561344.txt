I WISH to remind the reader of these articles on the Civil War that they deal only with the information supplied by The Century magazine 's history of that struggle . The story there told so graphically is treated from the military student 's and the military critic 's point of view , and it is earnestly trusted that no one may be offended with anything dontained in these articles . Many may differ from the conclusions arrived at , and the views expressed may be often or always mistaken ; but they are , at least , the honest opinions of one who has the most sincere admiration for the combatants on both sides , and for the many great soldiers and statesmen who then directed the destinies of the United States of America . The readers of these ( entury magazine papers owe a debt of gratitude to the editors for the pains with which they have collected the various documents . The references to the parts of other papers on the same subject , and to the official publications of the losses and numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one respect in which I would venture to suggest improvement , if any future edition should afford an opportunity . It seems ungracious , where we have been supplied with such a large and costly number of maps , plans , and pictures , to find fault with this aspect of the series . Unfortunately , however , there is one thing needful for a military reader which has not been adequately provided . - The text does not seem to have been carefully read by any editor who is in the habit of following , upon the corresponding maps , the movements described . The consequence is , it frequently happens that names of places are mentioned // in the text which do not appear in the maps . It is not too much to say that for all purposes of intelligent military study , if the reader had to depend solely on these maps , there is much in the text which might almost as well be omitted . Even when , after much search , the place named is discovered in some map or other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which has been prepared to elucidate that part of the narrative . One does not , consequently , get the place shown in relation to other localities described . From time to time references are given to particular maps , but these references are not sufficiently frequent . The references required to other portions of the text , in support of evidence educed , are good and ample , and it is much to be regretted that similar care has not been taken to guide the reader to the map required to elucidate the text upon all occasions . The third volume covers a series of the most deeply interesting operations of the war . These are , in the East , Fredericksburg , Chancellorsville , and Gettysburg ; in the West , Perryville , Vicksbnrg , Port Hudson , Chickamauga , Chattanooga , and Knoxville ; to which I may add , for the purposes of this article , the papers at the end of Volume II . on the Mexican campaign and the battles of Juka and Corinth . To these battles no reference was made in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are closely connected with the general sequence of events in the West , which are recorded in this third volume . For many reasons the three great battles in the East will be considered first . General Longstreet has made certain comments upon the whole series of papers on those events , which serve as a convenient basis for a discussion of the interesting questions which rise out of them . He himself had a brilliant share in the victory at Fredericksburg . He was absent from Chancellorsville , but he tells us that on his return to the army , prior to the invasion of Pennsylvania , he propounded certain views and principles to General Lee with regard to the general conduct of future operations . I have already quoted Jackson* s views as to what he considered to be the guiding principles of war . It is worth while to compare them with those that are laid before us by *General Longstreet . Neither general would probably wish to have a few sentences , such as are here given , taken to represent his whole mind on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of some value to // notice what are the aspects of the art and science of war which are most forcibly and most constantly present to the mind of an able soldier , for he is almost sure to insist on them , rather than on others , when he has to decide between the advisability of certain plans and methods . I must , however , express a feeling , which will , I think , be shared by many of those who fought against Generals Lee and Longstreet , that it is not pleasant to read reports by the surviving general of conversations between the two in which he seems to have treated , not to say reprimanded , his great leader more like a school-boy under instruction than like one of the most brilliant commanders and remarkable men of his own , if not of all , time . Whatever other great qualities as a soldier General Longstreet may possess ,  --  and he certainly does possess some very brilliant qualities ,  --  that of appreciating the military genius of the commander under whom he served can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one commander has seldom been more thoroughly outgeneralled by another than General Hooker was by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville . No one has expressed that view more strongly than have the distingnished soldiers who served under Hooker in that battle . Even those who express the warmest appreciation of the skill which Hooker displayed in the manoeuvres which brought the army to Chancellorsville think very strongly that it was the difference between the two commanders which sent the Federal Army in retreat back over the IRappabannock , as the result of that battle . In that battle at least one Federal corps bad been utterly broken up and disorganized , though the Federal Army , much better armed , and with an artillery overwhelmingly powerful , numbered 130,000 , and the Confederates only 60,000 , men . With such a disproportion of force , that the effect of the battle should have been , not merely to stop the invasion of the South , but to open the way for the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania , would seem , one would say , to imply that the Federals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the army , General Longstreet 's only view , not alone of this campaign , but of that in the Shenandoah Valley under Jackson , of the first and second Bull Run , and of the Peninsula campaign , appears to have been expressed by saying that " one mistake of the Confederacy was in pitting force against force . The only hope we had was to outgeneral // the Federals . " " The time had come ( sic ) when it was imperative that the skill of generals and the strategy and tactics of war should take the place of muscle against muscle . " " We " - that is , Longstreet and Lee- " talked on that line from day to day , and General Lee , accepting it as a good military view , adopted it as the key-note of the campaign . " I do not know how it will strike others , but to me there is something unspeakably pathetic about the picture of Lee-that man alike of marvellous modesty and marvellous genius , who by his skill and daring was then exciting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-thus closeted with his carping lieutenant . How ciould Lee do otherwise than accept it as the key-note of his campaign that he must endeavor to compensate for the numerical weakness of his army by the skill of his dispositions ? On what else had he to rely than the devotion of his soldiers and their confidence in him ? But how cruel a blow to such a man must it have been to discover that , after all their campaigns together , the general who was now left him as the right arm on which he must rely had formed this conclusion as to all his handling of the army in the past ! Apart altogether from mere personal feeling , which , seeing that Lee was human , must have been sore enough , how serious a weakness did this disclose in one of the most important elements of his possible strength ! Imagine the difference between having to rely for the carrying-out of your plans upon a soldier whose judgment and estimate of you were of this kind , and upon one who had for you the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That man is a phenDmenon . I would follow him blindfold anywhere . " Yet it was from the same campaigns that the two great lieutenants of Lee had drawn these opposite conclusions . We are not , however , left in any doubt as to the nature of the strategy which Longstreet desired to see adopted , or the nature of the experience on which he founded it . He writes " I then accepted his proposition to make a campaign into Pennsylvania , provided it should be offensive in strategy , but defensive in tactics , forcing the Federal Army to give us battle when we were in strong position and ready to receive them . . I stated to General Lee that , if he would allow me to handle my corps so as to receive the attack of the Federal Army , I would beat it off without calling on him for help except to guard my right and left , and called his attention to the battle of Fredericksburg as an instance of defensive warfare , where we had thrown not more than five thousand troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Army , with great loss to them and slight loss to my own troops . I also called his attention to Napoleon 's instructions to Marmont at the head of an invading army . " V. // Now , it is certainly not wished to disparage the advantages of this method , where it can be adopted , of offensive strategy and of defensive tactics . Most generals believe distinctly in the possibility and advisability , under certain circumstances , of taking up such a position tbat by your doing so your enemy will be forced to elect between an attack under very great disadvantages upon your strong position and the abandonment of some most important object . But as the wise man has said of " every purpose under the sun , " so it may be said of war , there is a time to attack and a time to refrain from attack , a time to defend and a time to abandon the defensive . Judged by the criticism General Longstreet offers of the action of others , his principle would appear to imply that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blows against isolated fragments of its enemy , it ought to refrain from taking advantage of them in order to adopt the policy he advocates . It is needless to point out how directly that principle brings him into conflict with the admirable views on war of Stonewall Jackson , which were quoted in the article on this subject published in the July REVIEW . Of the Fredericksburg campaign , apart from the battle , we unfortunately get very little account in these papers . Most students of war will , it is thought , consider the especial brilliancy of that campaign to have depended upon the mode in which Lee succeeded in bringing up Jackson exactly at the right moment . This was done so cleverly that the Federal commander committed himself to the attack . on the Confederate Army under the impression that he had little more than Longstreet 's corps to deal with . Without that application of Jackson 's principle , Longstreet would have intrenched at Fredericksburg in vain . It is not often you can induce your antagonist to attack straight to his front the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially where it is a position upon which he can bring no adequate artillery fire to bear . To quote Napoleon as meaning that , when an opportunity presents itself , you ought not to strike with your own concentrated army that of your enemy before it is concentrated ; that you ought not , as Jackson did at Chancellorsville , to bring an overpowering force upon the flanks and rear of an exposed wing which can be dealt with before it is supported , will seem absurd to any one who knows what Napoleon did , and why it was he so severely criticised Marruont 's proceedings . // Indeed , it is difficult to believe that an able soldier like General Longstreet can really mean this . There is often an indisposition , not uncommon aniong able men , to play second fiddle , and to be very critical of the first fiddle . It is easiest to account for General Longstreet 's proceedings by assuming that he was no stranger to this feeling . In order to enforce the wisdom of the advice he gave his chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the battle of Sedan . He would appear not to have closely studied the circumstances of that battle , for otherwise he would be aware that , while he was quite right in predicting that " MacMahon 's army would be prisoners of war in ten days " from the time at which he spoke , he was entirely wrong as to the method by which that result would be brought about . The Prussians at Sedan did not " force MacMahon to attack , " but attacked him on all sides . They carried Bazeilles after fierce and bloody attacks . They carried by attack LSL Moncelle , Daiguy , Givonne , the plateaus above Floing and lily , and the Bois de la Garenne . They only refrained from an actual attack with their infantry upon the immediate neighborhood of Sedan because , having already secured by attack all the positions which commanded the valley , they were able to bring such an overwhelming artillery fire to bear that the French position became untenable . In no sense whatever is the battle of Sedan an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l8*'O and the principles of war followed by the German leaders are most unfortunate authorities for General Longstreet to appeal to in support of his special views . The modern German writers on war seem to enforce a theory the exact opposite to that of General Longstreet , to an exaggeration as extreme on their side as his appears to be on the other . They for the most part seem to admit as little as he does " that there is a time for every purpose under heaven** there is , however , this one great difference between them that , whereas he assumes the one great method of war to be that of offensive strategy and defensive tactics , they , most of them at least , continually urge that offensive strategy implies offensive tactics . They are also very strongly impressed with a view which , if we may judge from their conduct of war , appears to have been that of both Stonewall Jackson and of Grant , and perhaps that of Lee also-that defensive tactics carried on behind intrenched positions have a very dangerous tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a serious element in the whole question which must be taken into account . It is completely ignored in General Longstreet 's criticism of Lee . In these remarks , the actions of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsyille have been taken together , as the story of those battles seems admirably to illustrate Lee 's principles and method , and to clear the way for the discussion of Gettysburg also . I can not , however , pass on to the Gettysburg campaign without calling attention to Lee 's mistake in allowing the Federal Army to escape across the iRappahannock after the battle of Fredericksburg . To command in war for many campaigns and make no mistakes is impossible . General Lee , great in strategy and able in tactics , is no exception to the wisdom of this saying . Military history can only be made of use to the student of war by a close criticism of every operation , and the critic , no matter how humble , should not shrink from pointing out what he conceives to be the errors and mistakes made by even the most renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant career , but the greatest was after the battle of Fredericks-. burg . The more closely his conduct then is studied , the more inexplicable it appears . The reasons he gives in his published despatches for having failed either to push the Federal Army into the river or to compel its surrender are most unsatisfactory , most insufficient . ( Page 82-note . ) When the last Federal attack was repulsed on that eventful 13th December , Burnside 's army was at Lee 's mercy . It is , however , easy to be wise after the event , and to point out what might or ought to have been done . When Wellington realized that the battle of Waterloo was won , he is proverbially reported to have suddenly shut up the telescope through which he had been looking , and to have given the order , " Up , Guards , and at em . " He felt that the time had come for passing from the defensive to the active offensive , for he saw that Napoleon 's army had been delivered into his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRappahannock , immediately behind it . Had the French army on the evening of the 18th June , 1815 , been situated as Burnside 's army was on the evening of the 13th December , 1862 , none of it could ever have succeeded in recrossing the Belgian frontier into France . It has always seemed to me that , if Burnside 's army had been destroyed , as it ought to have been , after its crushing repulse at // Fredericksburg , the struggle between North and South would have assumed an entirely different aspect , and subsequent events would not have been as they were . That army was by far and in every way the finest under the Federal flag , and was the nucleus of that which afterwards fought at Gettysburg , and which eventually forced General Lee to surrender . The prize in front of the great Confederate general was enormous . He would doubtless have lost very heavily had he left his position of vantage to push the defeated Federals into the iRappahannock , but the losses at Chancellorsville and by many other subsequent battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have realized how great was the Federal loss and how serious the demoralization of their army on the evening of the 13th December . He made up his mind that Burnside would renew the fight next morning , and the pages of The Century magaziue tell us how fairly justified he was in thinking this , as they show that Burnside meant to have done so . Had the Federals attacked again on either the 14th or 15th December , judging from Lee 's general mode of fighting , I think we are entitled to assume that he would , without doubt , have followed up a second repulse of the Federal attack by such an immediate and vigorous offensive as would have annihilated Burnside 's army . It must be admitted that , whilst Lee 's position was admirable for a passive defence , it was very bad for the sudden assumption of an active forward offensive when the enemy 's attacks upon it had been even crushingly repulsed . During the course of this long war some great opportunities were lost by the Confederacy for the delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other occasion was the opportunity so apparent , or the results that would have attended success so evident , as at Fredericksburg . That battle was a brilliant success . Lee ought to have made it a crushing , if not a final , victory . Burnside 's retreat to the North bank of the IRappahannock during the stormy night of the 15th December was admirably conducted , and most creditable to the Federal generals and staff officers who carried it out . Every one is agreed that the first day 's fight of Gettysburg was brought on without Lee 's having expected it . On that day two Federal corps had been severely handled by very superior Confedcrate forces , The Federal Army was neither ConQentrated nor // were its corps near enough to the battle-field to be concentrated by the time that the Confederate Army ought to have been able to attack them . The evidence adduced as to the position of the Confederate corps is incontrovertible . Colonel Allen , in his reply to General Longstreet ( page 355 ) , has shown conclusively , not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are directly against General Longstreet 's assertion that his divisions were " fifteen or twenty miles away from the battle-field on the night between the 1st and 2d July , " but that General Longstreet 's own official report at the time contradicts his recent statement on this point . The soldier instinctively admires the fine fighting qualities of General Longstreet , but the student of war called upon to express an opinion upon his conduct , when second in command to General Lee , sees much to find fault with . General Longstreet tells us ( page 340 ) of his somewhat fierce discussion with his chief on the afternoon of the 1st July as to the plans that should be followed in the next day 's battle . The account we have already had of his earlier conversations with Lee upon the general conduct of the war throws an interesting light upon what must have passed through Lee 's mind during those discussions . That Lee felt the necessity of keeping on the kindliest terms with his able , but . argument-loving , lieutenant is evident , He bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of mind towards him of the man on whom he was obliged to rely for the most important stroke of the whole war . But that all the time Lee 's own mind remained clearly fixed on the policy of adopting either offensive or defensive tactics , according to circumstances , is manifest from the firmness with which he rejected Longstreet 's proposed plans . He was determined not to lose the opportunity which chance had thrown in his way , for the very doubtful possibility of being able to manouvre round the Federal army-an operation which would , at least , certainly afford that army time to concentrate against him . By all that is recorded in this volume of General Longstreet , by his whole conduct on the 2nd and 3rd July , and by the tone and temper of his present writings , it seems very evident that he quitted Lee on the night between those two days with his mind filled with the fixed idea of defensive tactics . His thoughts were apparently too much absorbed with his own plans to admit // of his paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chief . Yet upon their prompt and accurate execution depended the success of Lee 's far more brilliant and far wiser scheme of action . General Longstreet has appealed to Napoleon . Those who have most carefully studied Napoleon 's methods and habit will think , I believe , that Napoleon in Lee 's place would have attacked in the early morning of July 2 , as Lee intended to do . Those who have closely followed the history of this war will also be inclined to think that , if Jackson had been in Long.street 's place , the attack would have been delivered before 10 A. *i. at the latest . With the evidence given in this volume before us , few can doubt the truth of Colonel Allan 's statement ( page 356 ) that " General Longstreet , though knowing fully the condition of things on the night of the 1st , knowing that Lee had decided to attack that part of the Federal Army in his front , knowing that every hour strengthened Meade and diminished the chances of Confederate success , and knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main assault , consumed the time from daylight to nearly 4 p . M. , on July 2 , in moving his troops about four miles over no serious obstacle and in getting them into battle . " The evidence now laid before us goes far to show that General Longstreet was not only responsible for the fact that his own wing attacked so late that almost the whole Federal Army was concentrated before the stroke was delivered , but also for the fact that he was , when the attack was delivered , not properly supported by the other parts of the army detailed to coöperate in the attack . When the principal attack , on which all others depend , is delivered at least six hours later than it is ordered to be delivered , it is impossible that co&amp;perating corps should time their movements so as to support it . General Longstreet has clinched the evidence as to the cause of the imperfect success of the battle on the second day , by urging that Lee had not ordered the attack to be delivered at the earliest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him on this point is , however , very clear , although even without such evidence it would still be clear to all who closely study this great battle that the whole point and scheme of Lee 's battle manifestly depended on the attack being delivered at the earliest possible moment . If General Longstreet had not been too much absorbed by his own ideas of the way in which the campaign ought to have been fought , to pay attention to the literal and prompt execution of his chief 's orders , // he must have seen for himself that suddenness and earliness in the attack were of the essence of that scheme . Similarly , in the third day 's battle all the evidence goes to show that , if Pickett 's attack had been supported by the whole force of Longstreet 's corps and the division and a half of H. P. Hill 's corps , which were put at his disposal , that attack would have succeeded . The picture of General Longstreet not even able to make up his mind to order the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack upon the Redan in September , 1855 . Upon that occasion our final repulse was due to want of support . No effective arrangements had been made to reinforce the British troops engaged in the assault , who , left without support , were easily disposed of by the fresh troops of the enemy brought to bear on them . No operation in war is so bloody , nothing is so cruel to all concerned , as the weak decision which allows an insufficient force to engage in an attack from a disinclination to expose more than a small number of men to the risks it entails . How many serious disasters have been occasioned by the tender-heartedness of the commander who lacked the moral courage to launch heavy columns in support of men engaged in an attack like that attempted by General Pickett ! As to Lee 's decision to attack on the third day of Gettysburg , intending that attack to be adequately supported ( as , however it was not ) , it is very interesting to compare this battle with that of Grant at Chattanooga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained during the first two days ' fight at Chattanooga were so great as those which Lee had gained in the first two days ' fight at Gettysburg . On the first day at Chattanooga , the 23d November , 1863 , Thomas 's force seized . the picket lines of the eneniy in front of him by a sudden rush . On the 24th , Hooker , on the right , drove in a small force of the enemy , and secured the evacuation of Lookout Mountain , and Sherman forced his way to a position detached from the enemy 's right ; but up to the moment when the successful charge was made in the centre by Thomas , General Sherman had entirely failed to force his way on the left , and Geucral Hooker had not made good his advance on the right . No doubt the charge ol Thomas , as actually ordered , was not intended to be carried forward in the way it was . But a comparison between the circumstances of Thomas 's successful charge at Chattanooga with the // failure of Pickett at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailed in each case , and that it by no means follows that , because Pickett 's charge proved in fact disastrous , Lee was therefore wrong to order it , or that , if it had been properly supported , it would not have succeeded . Even if we had not the direct and specific evidence of General Imboden , we could not doubt that the words he has quoted must have represented the secret thoughts of Lee . " I never saw troops behave more magnificently than Pickett 's division of Virginians did to-day in that grand charge upon the enemy . And if they had been supported as they were to have been ,  --  but for some reason not yet fully explained to me , were not ,  --  we would have held the position , and the day would have been ours . After a moment 's pause he added in a loud voice , in a tone almost of agony , " Too bad ! Too bad ! Oh , too bad ! " ( Page 421 . ) The whole story , as told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1 A. *r. the morning after the last day 's battle , seems to leave no doubt as to what Lee 's view of the facts really was . Nothing is more characteristic of the man than that , when quietly reviewing the situation , he should realize how allimportant it was to the cause of the Confederacy that no personal differences should arise between him and Longstreet , and that he should consequently have taken all the blame upon himself . Most soldiers will think that General Longstreet has not served his own cause well by appealing so much to the generous silence of his chief . He has , at least as far as all future histories of the war are concerned , deprived himself of the benefit of that silence by the way in which he has laid himself out to make charges against the chief who refrained , under the most dire provocation , from one word of reproach against him . The sneer about the appointment of Virginians to command has been well answered by Colonel Allen ; the sneer about Stuart 's " wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which General Longstreet asserts was undertaken in disobedience of his own orders , is unfortunate , as Colonel Mosby ( page 251 ) shows from the original document that it was made by General Longstreet 's own order , after the question had been expressly referred to him by General Lee the errors he has fallen into as to the position of his own corps prior to Gettysburg are similarly confuted by the original documents . These , and not a few other matters of similar character , seem to deprive Gem // eral Longstreet 's statements of at least some of their value as evidence , and his criticism of all value as that of an unbiassed judge . There is in the record of General Longstreet 's battles a uniformity of incident as marked as that noticed in the case of some other generals . In the first day 's fight at Seven Pines , according to all the best evidence that is before us , General Longstreet 's division was so long in getting into position and preparing for attack that the whole scheme of General J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for his lieutenant , and is too generous a man , to reproach him for the miscarriage . At the second Bull Run , according to General Longstreet 's own report ( page 519 , Vol . II . ) , " As soon as the troops were arranged , General Lee expressed a wish to have me attack . The change of position on the part of the Federals , however , involved sufficient delay for a reconnoissance on our part . . . . The position was not inviting , and so I reported to General Lee . . . . General Lee was quite disappointed by my report against immediate attack along the turnpike . . . . General Lee urged me to go in , and , of course , I was anxious to meet his wishes . At the same time I wanted more than anything else to know that my troops hal a chance to accomplish what they might undertake . " And so on ad libitum-Lee always anxious for attack ; Longstreet deliberating and postponing action . In his one brilliant and successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Confederate left wing , and having orders ( page 652 , Vol . III. ) from Bragg to " begin at daybreak , " did not ( page 655 ) " advance until noon , " by which time the *action of the other wing had caused a gap in the Federal lines through which Longstreet , brilliantly taking advantage of the error , advanced and caused the Federal defeat . " Discovering , with the true instinct of a soldier , that he could do more by turning to the right , he disregarded the order to wheel to the left , and wheeled the other way . " Destiny may have shaped these results , but one is much mistaken if there is not evident in each of these actions the hand and mind of the same man who rough-hewed each of them according to the same temperamentthe hand of one man who was much better adapted to repair the errors of a second-rate commander than to carry out the purposes of such a chief as Lee . There is a greatness of soul which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying-out of the scheme of a leader who has the right to decide . Of any recognition of that fact on General Longstreet 's part in his relations with Lee , no trace is to be found in any one // of these actions . That Longstreet was a brilliant leader of a division or wing in action there can be no donbt , but he seems never to have been able-perhaps from some pecnliarity of temperament-to subordinate his own views heartily to the views and orders of his great chief . The impartial military critic must admit that at Seven Pines , the second Bull Run , and Gettysburg , the Confederacy paid dearly for that defect in his character . In one respect there is a rather remarkable similarity in the incidents of the Gettysburg and of the Chancellorsville campaign . In the latter campaign nearly the whole of the Federal cavalry had been detached from the army in order to throw itself between Lee 's position on the Rappahannock and his base at Richmond . The major portion of the Federal Army then crossed the Rappahannock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thus absent . During the Gettysburg campaign , Stuart , with a large portion of the Confederate cavalry , had been detached round the rear of Meade 's army , and the other portion of the cavalry , having been , by the course of the movements , thrown out of the line between the two armies , Lee was left with no cavalry in his front at the moment when the collision between the two armies unexpectedly occurred at Gettysburg . There is just this difference-that during the Gettysburg campaign the absence of the cavalry was contrary to Lee 's intention . He had calculated upon its being possible for Stuart to return to him before the collision should take place . The difficulty which a body of men , launched like those of Stuart upon the rear of an army , find themselves in , is well likened to the position of a man turned blindfold in a room full of enemies . It was that difficulty which prevented Stuart 's return till the eve of the battle . In the case of the Chancellorsville campaign , Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cavalry during the course of his whole campaign . In both cases alike the result seems to show that , when armies are manoeuvring against one another in the field , it is a risk too great to be worth running , even for the sake of breaking in upon the communications of an enemy , to deprive the army of its eyes , as one must do if the bulk of mounted troops are sent off on some entirely isolated operation . The case of Stuart 's ride aronnd McClellan , during the Peninsula campaign , is altogether different . There the armies were for the time stationary when opposite one another . Lee had no // intention of undertaking any movement till his cavalry had returned . Stuart brought back most valuable information , which assisted greatly in the general movements of the subsequent campaign . Similarly , the partisan work of small parties like that of Colonel Mosby may serve a most useful purpose , and can not be conducted with too much audacity . But Stoneman 's raid seems to have gained advantages for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the loss of the battle of Chancellorsville . The more one considers that battle , the more clear it becomes that it was the absence of the Federal cavalry which made possible Jackson 's turning movement . Under ordinary circumstances , the detachment of so large a force as that of Jackson 's to move at first completely away from the battle-field , and then round the enemy 's flank and rear , would be a very risky undertaking . It was possible and successful , first , because from the nature of the country nothing of the moveuient could be seen from the actual Federal position until it was too late , and , secondly , because the Confederate cavalry were able , in the absence of any corresponding force on the other side , to feel all the approaches to the Federal position and to ascertain exactly where their right wing lay . The small number of possible exits from the Federal position towards that of Lee made it possible for Lee to hold them as if they were defiles , whilst Jackson , with the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole story of the Federal action during these battles seems to carry the same moral as that which is pressed in my first article . The decisions from Washington and the criticisms from Washington , based upon the loose and rampant public opinion of the day , were in every instance wrong , and were disastrous to the cause of the Union . Well would it be if the survivors of the Administration by which those hasty judgments were formed would now realize what the effect was of their deciding upon the course of action to be taken without having before them any of the data for such decisions . If now they would only understand the danger they entailed upon their country by their interference in the conduct of war  --  the most difficult of all arts -- without any knowledge of its methods or of its principles , one might hope that the chastcued and wise public opinion so formed would be an incalculable future benefit to all self-governing nations .
