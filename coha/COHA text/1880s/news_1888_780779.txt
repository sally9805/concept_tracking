txt Shortly before 10 o'clock this morning Apostle George Q , Cannon , who has evaded the officers of the law for over two years , surrendered himself to United States Marshal Dyer in answer to the charge of unlawful cohabitation . Nothing that has occurred in this Territory for a number of years past created such a sensation as that piece of news when it had become thoroughly known throughout the city . Cannon was at one time Delegate to Congress from Utah , and has been the virtual head of the Mormon Church for years past . He was arrested several years ago in Nevada . as a fugitive from justiee on an indictment to which he pleaaed guilty to-day , and his sensational leap from the trait ' and his subsequenteforfeiture of a **26;59;TOOLONG bond , are matters of history . There were two indictments against Cannon . One was found March 20 , 1886 , and charged him with living with two wives , Martha Tulley and Emily Little . from July 2 , 1885 , to Dec. 31 of that year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cohabiting With five wives  --  Sarah Jane , Eliza T. , Martha T. , Emily H. , and Caroline J. , between the 21st of March , 1886 , and Sept. 15 , 1888 . The last indictment was found on the evidence of Bishop Clawson , Frank J. Cannon , the convict 's son . ana Charles H. Wilekon , who hal ; acted as Cannon 's body guard ever since he has been in hiding . Cannon came into court this morning and pleaded guilty to both indictments and asked that sentence be pronounced at once . Judge Sanford , in passing sentence , said : " Your plea of guilty has saved the Government the expense and labor of a trial , and your submission is au acknowledgment , a tacit admission that you submit yourself to the authority.of the law and admit the supremacy of the law , which every man must bow to and give obedience to . The offense to which you have pleaded guilty fe made by the statute of Congress a misdemeanor , and the punishment as fixed by that statute is either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months ; or both , within the discretion of the court . " The court then sentencea . Cannon to 75 days ' imprisonment and a fine-of $200 on the first indictment , and to 100 days ' imprisonment and $250 fine on the second indictment . Cannon was at once taken to the penitentiary . The indignation hero among the Gentiles is intense . They think , under the peculiarlyaggravated circumstances in Cannon 's ease , he should have received tho full penalty of the law : Cannon is the first Mormon who has been sentenced by Judge Sandford , who was recently appointed ChiefJustioe by President Cleveland . Cannon gives as his reason for evading the officers the fact that he was afraid that ex-Judge Zane would n't be lenient with him , and that he preferred to wait for a change of administration . It is generally understood that the Merman Church will soon abandon:pelygamy by an edict and then apply for a statement of the , Receiver .                  @ @ @
