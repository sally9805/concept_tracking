txt The gloom of the approaching conflict between Mr. GERHARD and Mr. SAN-Font ) overshadows the City . All nature , including carts and horse cars , and excepting only the elevated trains , seems hushed with expectancy ; and the listening nations of Europe , who have been warned by cable , . are waiting with their collective faces blanched and their entire hair in preparation for rising on end at the firing of the first shot . The quarrel is one which can only be settled by bloodshed . There is no reason to doubt that Mr. GERHARD informed Mr. SANFORD that the latter was a liar . This information was not conveyed as a matter of news but as a matter of aggravation . Neither does it appear to have had any relevancy to anything Mr. SANFORD had said . That gentleman had remarked that he might possibly call upon a lady , who for purposes of identification may be called Mrs. Smith . This was clearly a statement of fact . Given the existence of Mrs. Smith and the existence 1- of a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter might at some time call upon the former always exists . When Mr. GERHARD replied to this calm statement of an ' almost self-evident truth by calling Mr. SANFORD a liar he simply illustrated the irrelevancy of wrath , precisely as any angry man does when he intimates to his enemy that his existence illustrates a peculiar phase of the development theory . Mr. GERHARD 'S unmistakable intention was to aggravate Mr. SANFORD , and he completely succeeded . Mr. SANFORD answered Mr. GERHARD 'S expectations - by exhibiting aggravation in the shape of slapping Mr. GERHARD 'S cheek . This appears to have dissatisfied . Mr. GERHARD , which was very unreasonable , since he had deliberately tried to aggravate the slapper . It must be remembered , however , that Mr. GERHARD 'S cheek is one of his most important features , and he may have considered that no one had a right to take liberties with it . Why Mr. SANFORD did not box Mr. GERHARD 'S ears in preference to slapping his cheek is a question which will occur to every one . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not fail to note their lofty and majestic proportions , and could not have failed to hit them had he been so ' disposed . It is possible that , standing in the awful shadow of these towering ears , Mr. SANFORD 'S vision was not clear , and that he happened to hit Mr. GERHARD 'S cheek while aiming at , let us say , his chin . However this may be , the fact that Mr. GERHARD 'S face was slapped was undeniable , and as a consequence blood must flow . Were Messrs . GEBELARD and SANFORD , ordinary persons , of no particular importance , there would be no absolute necessity of a duel ; but , being as they are two of the most important personages on the continent , they-must fight . It is probable that in the last of our bloodthirsty duels neither Mr. BENNETT nor Mr. MAY really wanted to fight , but they occupied positions so exalted that the eyes of the world were upon them , and the pressure of opinion among the crowned heads of Europe drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. GERHARD doubtless knows that unless he fights Mr. SANFORD , neither the Queen of Great Britain , the Empress of Austria , nor the Empress of Russia will ever invite him to their houses again , and the British Association and the French Academy will never again consult him as an authority on nice questions of spelling . As for Mr. SANFORD , he is known all over the world as a representative American . Fathers of Central African families say to their sons , " Strive to grow up and imitate SANFORD ; " and the Princess of WALES , in educating her dren , compels them to study a little work written by the Archbishop of Canterbury , and entitled " The Example of Sanford . " Such men as Messrs . SANFORD and GERHARD can not be free agents . They must meet the expectations which the world has formed of them , and one of those expectations is that they will fight a duel . They will meet in Delaware or some other sequestered State and fire at one another with real pistols loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field of honor or on the way home , provided " local option " does not exist in the locality of the fight and interfere with their manly duties . Arrangements have already been made to telegraph the result of the duel to the four quarters of the earth , and Mr. GLADSTONE himself will announce it in the House of Commons . Should both the heroes survive , what tumultuous rejoicing would shake this solid earth , and should one of them fall through some mistake on the part of the seconds in loading the pistols , what mourning and lamentation would go up from the four continents and the islands of the sea . There is but one way in which a duel can be averted .. Should the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children* interfere and induce the Supreme Court to appoint guardians for Messrs . GERHARD and SANFORD all may yet be well . Such guardians would , of course , be able-bodied women , nurses by profession , and capable of wielding the slipper of correction with energy and effect . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late , and thus relieve the terrible suspense of the present critical and unprecedented moment .
