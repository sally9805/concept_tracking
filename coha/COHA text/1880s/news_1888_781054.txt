txt On the summit of Old Bald Mountain , some 13 or 14 years ago , a Frenchman named Gohnue and his son Jim , a lad of 15 , sunk a shaft , 75 feet deep . He was a queer old fellow and many strange tales are related of him . One of them is about the marvelous amount of riches which the old man extracted . from this wonderful shaft among the clouds . It is said that some of the rock he found was so rich in gold that he cached , it , taking this precaution in order that no one Might be able to know the richness of his treasure-hold , which could not be concealed if the specimens wore exhibited or kept in public places . He wonted away steadily and quietly for more than a year , and , it is believed , accumulated a nieo little fortune . Ire was not molested , the impression prevailing among the miners that he was laboring under a harmless delusion in wasting his time in this bleak and out-of-the-way place . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock.to give him sustenance . One day , while working at the bottom of the shaft , the rope broke while the bncket loaded with its rich freight was . being . hoisted by the boy , and , descending , crushed the life out of the eld man . Jim removed the body , and the miners buried it without having any knowledge of the actual circumstances . It seems the old man had kept concealed the hiding place of the treasure , and Jim , after the burial , searched , for it for months , but ' without success . He went away sorely disappointed , after filling in the shaft so that it had the appearance of an abandoned and worthless property , and he and the old man were soon forgotten . Jim returned recently to the vicinity and related the story to an old friend , and the two have been working ever since , both day and night , hoping to be rewarded by finding the cache . Last Saturday three ether miners were taken into the scheme , and this afternoon their labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered . The find has been placed in the hands of an expert , who will report in a few days . Should the gold turn out all right . it is thought that another gold excitement will be the outcome , as a number of other mines were recently unearthed near this point .
