ARTICLE VII. - DO WE NEED AN ETHICAL REVIVAL ? THE question submitted for discussion supposes a radical want or defect to exist in the religious life of our times ; a want which is not met , or but very partially met , by " revivals of religion " technically so called . What this defect is , is indicated by the term ethical , or moral , as distinguished from religious , as this word is popularly understood : and the various bearings of* the question are suggested by and comprehended in this deep and wide and far-reaching distinction . Perhaps we can best answer this question by considering the fact of such a defect , its causes , and its remedy . Let it not be inferred in naming this distinction , that religion in its true idea does not include morality , or that the ethical element can be separated from the religious without fatal injury to both ; that one can really love God without loving men who are made in the image of God ,  --  " for he that loveth not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God whom he hath not seen ? " - that one can truly reverence the divine attributes of justice , rightecusness , goodness and truth , and practice injustice , dishonesty , meanness or cruelty , or can be religious and devout in the sanctuary , and be selfish , corrupt , and grinding in the street or in the market . Such inconsistency is possible under heathen systems , and is even consistent with the heathen idea of religion , which has little or no connection with morality , since the heathen deities are as morally corrupt as their worshipers , and the worship of them is a sensual or merely formal , not a spiritual worship , the performance of some outward rite rendered not as an expression of love or reverence-for the love of God is an idea utterly foreign to heathenism  --  but a slavish task or penance , or expiatory offering . It is the distinctive excellence of Christianity that morality is a vital and or , anic part of religion , springing from it as branches from the root and can not be sundered from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of // love , which unites the soul to God , or the believer to Christ , secures the fulfillment of all duty , both the duties we owe to God and those we owe to one another . As the one principle of ife in the tree not only feeds the roots and sustains the inner and secret processes of growth through the vital chemistries of the soil , the air , and the light , but matures also the fruit , and gives strength and beauty to the form ; the supreme love and choice of God as revealed in Christ inspires not only feelings of devotion and acts of worship , but sanctifies the whole inward and outward life , moulding it after that law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus which has made us free from the law of sin and death , leading the Christian not only to believe in Christ and trust in him for salvation , but to follow and obey him in all things , to aspire after and pursue whatsoever things are true , honest , just , pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion in its idea , and in the experience and life of some believers ; but we need not say how seldom this idea is realized at the present day in the great mass of those who profess and call themselves Christians . I. It is a prevalent and growing conviction that the religion of our time is wanting in reality , and depth , *nd practical power over the life and character ; that while the numbers of those who " experience " and profess religion are multiplying as perhaps seldom before , the real power of godliness and the standard of Christian character , and the distinguishing traits that separate , or ought to separate , between the church and the world , are diminishing , so that it is often difficult to discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not . For some reason and in some way , there is a practical divorce between religion and morality . Piety is no longer the synonym of righteousness , godliness of goodness ; faith has almost ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and producer of good works , and is relegated into the domain of mere sentiment , or of dogmatic belief ; while works divorced from faith substitute a secular and bustling activity for that quiet , unostentatious , yet earnest and suecessfnl doing which our Saviour designates as letting the light shine , and bringing forth much fruit , and which is the working // not of mechanism but of l*fe . The defect here indicated , this practical divorce between religion and morality , is shown in various ways and forms of demonstration . It is seen in the startling revelations , so frequent of late , of a lack of honesty and integrity in those occupying places of trust and honor both in public and private life , and not seldom places of distinction in the church . That defections should occur even among those high in the Christian church is not indeed a strange thing , since one of Christ 's chosen apostles turned out a traitor , and the history of the church shows it has never been without apostates and unworthy members . But the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hardly exceptional , save in the exteat of the dishonesty and the consequent exposure and disgrace . They are signal examples and exponents of the demoralization and corruption of conscience going on beneath in the heart of the social , commercial , and political world . Again , the loose maxims arid looser practices that prevail in business and in politics ( almost without a suspicion that they are false and wrong ) , indicate a corruption and corrosion of the public conscience that does not stop at the imaginary line that separates the church and the world , but infects the mind of even good men with the idea that gain is godliness , and the chief end of existence ; that honesty is to be pursued so far , and only so far , as it is , or appears to be , the best policy ; that all is fair in politics , and right in business which the statute law does not prohibit , or is not " an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; " that the golden rule is too high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and capital , and the competitions of trade . In short the ethics of the wise man while working out his experimental philosophy of life , is the principle they follow : " Be not righteous overmuch : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? Neither be thou overmuch wicked : why shouldest thou die before thy time ? " ( like Tweed and Morrissey . ) But the most significant , perhaps , of all , as showing the defect in question , is the judgment of the world upon the character of many if not most of those who profess to be the followers of Christ . These read not the heart but the life , not the religious // experience but the practical fruits , or the character as manifested and tested in the every-day walks and relations of lie . And how often is this judgment to the effect that the character of " church people , " or professing Christians , so far as it can be seen of men , is no better than that of others ; that the moral virtues of many outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and higher toned than the so-called Christian virtues of those within . Now , making due allowance for prejudiced vision , the imperfections of even the best Christians , and the error of attributing to the whole of a class the characteNstics of a few ; is there not too much reason for the judgment here rendered ? Is it not true , what has often been affirmed , that the greatest obstacle to the triumph of Christianity arises not from the arguments or opposition of its foes , but the inconsistency of its professed friends ? IT . What now , let us inquire , is the cause or causes of this defect ; and what is the remedy ? Some will say , and do in fact tell us , that Christianity has spent its force , that it has had its day , like other religions of the past , and is about to pass away and give place to the religion of the future  --  to positivism , or free religion , or the religion of humanity , or whatever the new faith or philosophy may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , all the primary intuitions and beliefs of the human soul , eject the supernatural from the world and history , and substitute knowledge for faith , and science for what is called superstition . We need not spend words to refute this hypothesis . We who believe in the divine origin and indestructible truth and ultimate triumph of Christianity , believe that it is adapted to all ages and conditions of humanity , the most cultured as well as the most ignorant and degraded ; that it has within it forces and elements to correct every error , and su pply every defect , springing not only from human weakness and depravity , but from its own imperfect comprehension and application , to dissipate all darkness , b6th that of the mind into which it shines , and that of its own eclipse . 1 . Among the more real and positive causes , we may mention the prevalent Sceptic*srn and iVliaterialism of the age , which has found its way into every department of thought , and is // shaking or testing the strength of every system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence prevails  --  and it prevails much farther and over more minds than we imagine -- it necessarily dims the outlines and blunts the edge of Christian truth , and nullifies its power over the conscience and beart . When we find men reputed the foremost in the scientific world denying the reality of everything invisible to the senses or unprovable by material and scientific tests ; when all spiritual and immaterial existence , from God down to the lowest life-principle ; is pronounced a fable and figment of the mind , having no reality apart from matter and material forces ; when even the first truths and intuitions of reasons are questioned and denied because not demonstrable in terms of the understanding-it is not wonderful that a mist of doubt should begin to settle in some minds over those intuitions of conscience , those distinctions of Right and Wrong , as well as those supernatural and spiritual verities of religion in which they have been instructed . For all these are things of faith and not of sense or scientific demonstration . What wonder is it if the law of God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere sentiment ; if Duty should cease to be that " Stern daughter of the voice of God , " of which Wordsworth sung , and to whom all noblest minds have rendered homage , and exchange her celestial countenance for the coarse features of earthly expediency ; if immutable morality should degenerate into material profit and loss , and the calculation of consequences ? What wonder if the sanctions of the Gospel and the powers of the world to come should cease to be powers , and become mere figures of speech , good for rhetoric and to move the sensibilities , but not to rouse the conscience and regenerate the life . " " The most dangerous form of unbelief at the present day "  --  to quote the words of the London Sp6ctator --  " is what we call the scientific , which says , when it contents itself with negatives- ' We do not find God or any of the spiritual things of which you speak , in the world with wfiich we have to do . ' It is with this that the battle must be fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , our deepest gratitude is due . " 2 . We mention as another cause , the character and tone of // much of the preaching of the present day . We think we shall not speak amiss if we characterize it to a large extent as shallow and superficial , producing only transient and superficial results . Following the popular demand for novelty and sensation rather than for thought and instruction , it is addressed mainly to the imagination , or rather to the fancy and sensibilities , and not to the conscience and moral reason . It is not so much preaching of the Word or truth of God , as it is of human thought and human fancies . The connection of the discourse with the text out of which it professes to be drawn is of the slightest and most tenuous character , often less vital than that between an essay and its motto . " Doctrinal preaching " is decried as old fashioned and behind the times , and in its place is substituted what Carlyle would term rose-water , and Joseph Cook calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel , with law and penalty left out . Of course no divine or permanent results follow . The truth thus diluted and mixed with human inventions , pleases the ear and gratifies the taste , but does not find or stir the deep places of the soul : it does not influence the character or form and strengthen the principles . This modern reaction against the doctrinal preaching of the fathers can hardly be called an improvement if judged by its results . That , if dry and tedious to modern ears , at least exercised thought upon the grandest themes the human mind can contemplate : and without thought it is impossible to be religions to any purpose . Better to be exercised profoundly about the doctrines of election and the eternal decrees of God , than not to think of him at all , or to think of him as without any purposes and without any will concerning human affairs and human conduct . We will not speak of the sensational and the atrical preaching so much in vogue at the present day , where the very idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . The fact that such abuse and travesty of the pulpit can be tolerated and even sought after by Christian congregations , shows how far the ethical judgment of our times is perverted , and the minds of men corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ . We need not add , what is implied in what has been said , that much of the preaching of the present // day is secular , if not always in matter , at least in spirit and tone . Tn avoiding the sanctimonious , which formerly attached to the pulpit , it has lost its sanctity and the most sacred and solemn themes are often treated with a lightness and flippancy that in effect is equivalent to taking the name of God in vain . How seldom is the law of God , and the glories and " terrors of the Lord " presented in such a way as to produce conviction of sin , and lead the soul to cry out , " Woe is me , for I am undone : for mine eyes have seen the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel and cross of Christ so preached that its chief attraction is seen to he salvation from sin rather than from punishment , and leading one to choose rather to suffer with Christ if only he may be forgiven and cleansed . 3 . May we be permitted to mention as another cause of the defect we are considering , a tendency to antinomianisrn in our interpretation of the Gospel , and especially of the doctrine of justification by faith ? In our reaction from the Romish doctrine of justification by works , have we not emptied faith of its vitality , and destroyed the vital and organic connection between faith and salvation through a regenerate character as the fruit of faith and the essence of salvation ? Have we not decried " mere morality " so much , and the worthlessness of the moral virtues as a ground of salvation , that they are regarded as of little account in the matter of salvation and in the Christian life , compared with the all-essential , indispensable act of faithwhich , being regarded as an act rather than a principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure irrespective of character , and whatever may be the subsequent life ? Is not this the practical effect of much of our revival preaching and many of our popular revival hymns-such as " Jesus paid it all-all the debt I owe ; and nothing either great or small , remains for me to do . " " Hallelujah , t is done ! I believe on the Son ! I 'm saved by the blood of the crucified One ! " Do we not place an undue estimate on a mere technical " experience " called conversion-as if this were the essential thing instead of a regenerate character , and thus encourage a fatal security , as if salvation were already complete and assured apart from personal responsibility , and contrary to the word of Scripture : " Work out your own salvation with fear and trem // hung ; for it is God that worketh in you . " " Giving all diligence to make your calling and election sure . " Hence the murderer on his way to the scaffold and the profane and godless worldling on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith in Christ to be assured of immediate and complete salvation , without those fruits meet for repentance , which are the only true evidence of its reality , and in evident contradiction to the truth , that " whatever a man soweth that shall he also reap . " We would not limit the grace of Christ which saved the thief on the cross , and has , doubtless , saved many others in their last moments ; and which will save all at any time and anywhere who truly repent and turn to God . But is there not danger in making so much of a momentary act or " experience " and so little of those works by which alone character is evinced  --  a danger manifest in the sentiment often thought if not expressed- " No matter what a man 's life and character is if he only believes , " leading by reaction to the opposite sentiment , equally false and equally true , " No matter what a man believes if only his actions are right . " Paul 's great doctrine of justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jews , who trusted for salvation in their own legal righteousness , which was false and hollow , a mere form of obedience without the spirit , called therefore " dead works . " Against this the Apostle held up the righteousness which is of God , i. e. , the true divine righteousness in Christ , which was to be received by faith and wrought out within by the Spirit of Christ . Luther 's reiissertion of this doctrine was made against the system of penance taught and practiced in the ilomish church , which nullified the atonement of Christ and erected a doctrine of merit or meritorious works and sufferings as the condition of pardon and salvation . It was the doctrine of a free salvation freely received in place of a salvation earned or merited by painful works and austerities . But the faith which justifies is not a dead faith divorced from works , but a living and working faith which accepts and really receives the righteousness of Christ , not as imputed merely , but imparted and possessed as a living power working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works are not before but after forgiveness , and are not the cause but the effect and consequence of salvation . " When the salvation reigns within , And grace subdues the power of sin . " If the salvation is merely without , if the grace merely saves the soul without renewing the character , it is a spurious salvation and grace received in vain . This doctrine of Paul and Luther needs to be guarded from abuse in our day , as in that of the early church , by the complimentary doctrine of James , " What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he have faith and have not works ? can faith save him ? Thou believest there is one God , thou doest well : the devils also believe and tremble . But wilt thou know , 0 vain man , that faith without works is dead ? Was not Abraham , our father , justified by works when he had offered Isaac , his son , upon the altar ? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only . For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also . " This consideration of the causes of the defects we deplore will suggest an answer to our second inquiry- What is the remedy ? And th' remarks on this head will be very brief . 1 . It is not to he found in revivals of religion , at least of the type commonly experienced . The reason of this is manifest . Revivals are only the restoration or quickening of the religious life already existing the church but in a declining state . It does not commonly supply new elements , but only reanimates and strengthens those that remain and are ready to die . Like the breath and showers of spring , it quickens and develops the latent germs of growth , the seeds and principles already planted , each according to its organic type , but does not change the type or quality of the growth . The defect in question is deeper than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality of the religion or religious life itself . If this is emotional , merely a matter of feeling and not of principle , whose seat is in the mere surface currents of the soul , and not in the depths of the conscience and moral being , a revival of such religion will be only a transient glow of feeling , a spasm of religious excitement that soon subsides , leaving no perma // nent results in the character . Let us not be thought to depreciate the importance or necessity of revivals , or to undervalue the good they have accomplished and are destined to accomplish for the church and the progress of Christ 's kingdom . The evils attending them are chiefly those arising from their abuse , when conducted by unwise or unspiritual leaders , and from undue reliance upon them for all religious and spiritual fruit . But their true place and utility should be understood as auxiliaries , and not the main forces of Christianity or Christian progress . The character of revival preaching is necessarily awakening , and to a degree sensational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of moral and religious culture , or answer the end of the regular preaching of the gospel . Its mission is that of John the Baptist  --  a voice crying in the wilderness , " prepare ye the way of the Lord . " Its message is , Repent ye , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . It is the precurser of Christ , and points to him as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world . But it can not fill the place or do the work of Him of whom it is said , " He shall not strive nor cry , neither shall any hear his voice in the streets . A bruised reed he shall not break , and the smoking flax he shall not quench ; " and whose doctrine drops as the rain and his speech distils as the dew upon the tender herb . 2 . The preaching that shall help to remedy the evil or defect in question must be more ethical in its tone and teaching . By this it is not meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law of life as well as a promise of salvation ; and righteousness is the great end for which Christ came into the world  --  to establish righteousness in the earth and in the hearts of men . His kingdom is a kingdom of righteousness as well as of love and peace , and without righteousness these could not exist . Now the idea of righteousness is first given by the conscience . It has its norm or root-form planted deep in the moral nature of man . It is the law of God written on the heart , commanding us to do right , forbidding us to do wrong . Hence the sacredness of conscience as the divine oracle in the human breast . Its voice is the voice of God ; its authority is the authority of God . The approbation of conscience is the reflected smile of // God 's countenance , and its reproaches and stings of remorse is the inward witness and incipient experience of the wrath of God . Thus close and inseparable is the moral and the religious nature of man ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must address itself primarily to the conscience . All religious faith must rest on this deep and solid foundation planted by God in the human soul . To build on any other , on the understanding , or the affectional nature , or the instinctive desire of happiness , is to build upon the sand and not on the rock . To separate religion and morality , as many do , to speak or think disparagingly of the latter , as " mere morality , " or as of no worth in the sight of God , through fear of some pelagian error , is to sever the root from the branches , it is " to kill , " as Milton says , " the image of God in the eye , " to quench the inward light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world , lest it be confounded with or mistaken for the light without . " The light of the body is the eye ( and the light of the soul is conscience ) . If , therefore , thine eye be single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this inward eye ) ; but if thine eye be evil ( bleared by sin or false prin ciples of morality ) thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness To enlighten , to instruct , and educate the conscience , to clarify its vision , to deepen its tone and strengthen its authority by those moral truths and precepts which are adapted to it as light is to the eye , to increase this light of God within by the light of truth without , is the province and duty of the preacher . If he have any function and duty to perform it is this ; and all the more that such teaching is neglected and even prohibited in our public schools ! And for this he need not go outside the bible , for " all scripture , being given by inspiration of God , is profitable for doctrine , for reproog for correction , for instruction in righteousness , that the man of God may be perfect , thorortgldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this instruction is the doctrine of sin , without which conscience itself is an enigma , and without which clearly understood and deeply felt , the preaching of the gospel will he like the offer of medicine to one who is // conscious of no malady . We know of no doctrine which so intensely needs to be preached and unfolded at the present day as this ; srn as a power reigning without and within , in society , iii the world , and especially in the soul , corrupting and enslaving the whole being and from which man can not deliver himself . Sin , as essential evil , the only real evil , and involving in itself all evil and all punishment , and that , none other than eternal death . One good result which is coming from the thorough discussion now or recently in progi-ess respecting future punishment , is the deeper knowledge arid insight it will bring concerning the nature of sin , and the conviction which is beginning to be felt that sin is essentially and forever its own punishment ; that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can inflict upon the wicked are not so terrible or lasting as those penalties which sin itself inflicts upon its victims ; that those dire symbols of future suffering so terribly portrayed by the Saviour , are but shadows of this soul-destroying evil , projected from eternity upon the walls of time . Sin needs to be presented , moreover , in its ethical and moral nature not as a misfortune , but as guilt , self-created by the selfdetermining power of a tempted but free agent  --  a willful offence against the law and mind of God , and needing an atonement , a vicarious sacrifice to put away and destroy it . And here the moral or ethical side of the atonement needs to be brought more distinctly into view , not as being the only side , but a real and most important one . It is the feeling of many of the most thoughtful and spiritual teachers of the age that the face of the cross has been turned too exclusively toward God and the divine justice ; that since Christ is exalted to give repentance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw all men unto him , the most powerful attraction and the strongest motive to repentance is that view of the atonement where all the attributes of God are blended and concentrated in one intense focus and brought to bear not upon God from whom they proceed , and not to reconcile any conflict in the mind or government of God , but upon the heart of the sinner , to break the power of sin and reconcile the world unto God . As the works and miracles of Christ were wrought not for ostentation or for the pur // rose of proving his divinity , though they did this , but to heal and bless and save humanity , body and soid , so the whole redemptive work of Christ in his life and death-all the mighty forces of truth and grace , of love , and righteousness , and patience , and forgiveness , which stream from the cross , are not a mere show , or governmental expedient , having only abstract relations to law and justice , hut have a mighty moral power and influence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cross thus becomes the wisdom of God and the power of God unto salvation . Have we not , by accepting theories of the atonement wbieh hide the true glory of the cross , and greatly weaken its power , which even eclipse and darken the character of God-have we not made this central doctrine of Christianity unnecessarily an offense and a stone of stumbling , and what is worse , weakened the moral sense , by interpretations that confuse the first principles of right and justice ? Can we hope for an " ethical revival , " or a radical quickening and deepening of the Christian conscience , so long as our conception of God 's character and of his supreme act of love and righteousness is blurred by a confounding of all moral distinctions , as it is by supposing that divine justice can be satisfied by the punishment of the innocent in place of the guilty ? 3 . Finally , the true relation betweenfaith and works must be understood and their vital unity restored . Faith must be seen to be not a mere sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike deep into the moral and spiritual being-nor yet as a mere intellectual belief , however true and orthodox that belief may be , but a vital and practical power or principle , the deepest , most central , most controlling , and most ineradicable principle of the soul . Faith is not a feeling but a conviction , and not a conviction merely but a purpose , and not a purpose merely but a love ,  --  for love and faith though distinct in name are inseparable in reality . Its substance is truth received into the heart and embracing the will , and working through the whole intellectual and moral being , controlling every thought , volition , and affection , and bringing the whole life into subjection to the obedience of Christ . Hence its connection with doctrine , or the truth of // God , without which faith is mere feeling , destitute of root or practical power . Hence too , its connection with obedience , without which , according to our Saviour 's comparison , a hearing without doing , believing the truth without obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the sand . How many of these sand-built houses , faith as a mere sentiment , or intellectual conviction , without works to substantiate it , belief without practice , profession without character , have we in our churches , that can not withstand a storm or a flood , but fall when the trial comes . In these times that try men 's souls , we need a faith that is made of sterner stuff and tougher fibre , if our churches , or even our Christianity is to stand . As was said in the old days of anti-slavery agitation , when the clouds of rebellion and war were looming in the horizon , and which might be said with moi-e emphasis now- " What our statesmen and public men need is backbone , " so in these times of possibly greater peril , when ominous clouds are rising from all quarters of the heavens , and mutterings of deep thunder are heard announcing that the day of anti-Christ is come , and the battle of the great day of God Almighty is approaching , what we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religion needs is backbone , that we may stand in the evil day , and having done all to stand . And this means to withstand . For as Coleridge has truly said , " That which doth not withstand hath itself no standing place . " A faith which is merely passive and receptive , which is content to sing , and piay , and rejoice over sins forgiven and heaven secure , which accepts Christ merely as a substitute , and not as an example , and a leader and commander , which does not inspire the soul to fight for its crown , as He did , to deny self and take up the cross and follow Christ in obedience unto death , is no true or saving faith . The repentance that simply feels sorrow for sin without forsaking , and renouncing , and overcoming it , is no repentance unto life . A salvation which does not save from sin as well as from its penalties , and secure a regenerate and holy character , is no true salvation . The essence of salvation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of religion , its // experience and its blessedness , is not enjoyment here or hereafter , but a holy and Christ-like character . Hence , let us say in conclusion , we do need an " ethical revival , " a revival not of religion as that word is used in its demoralized sense , but of ? - ighteousmess - righteousness rooted and grounded in the conscience , and below this , in God , who is the ground and authority of conscience ; righteousness , which is ours , and yet not ours , being derived from Christ the righteous , living and reigning within , a righteousness born of faith , and nourished by truth , and working by love , and issuing in good works , i. e. , in all the fruits of a regenerate and holy character ; a righteousness which is more than an " experience of religion , " which needs no self-inspection or examining committee to ( letect ; which is seen and read of all men ; which shows itself in whatsoever things are true , honest , just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , let us think on these things , and do them .
