English , Thomas Dunn , 1819-1902 : " STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT . " from Strike while the iron is hot ( 1887 ) 1 When you toil in good faith a fair end to achieve , 2 Though the goal seem afar , neither falter nor grieve ; 3 Plod on to the mark , be it far off or near , 4 And wait for the opportune hour to appear . 5 Be watchful and wary , be patient and calm ; 6 Though the haft of the hammer lie loose in the palm , 7 Let the hand when the time comes with energy thrill , 8 And strike while the iron is hot  --  strike with a will .
