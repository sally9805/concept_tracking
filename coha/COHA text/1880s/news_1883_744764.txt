txt There has been much talk here and considerable excitement over a report that an unknown schooner sank off Beach Haven on Friday evening with all hands . It was said that she was pursued by a steamer ; that both vessels were heading for the shore under full sail and steam , and that when about five miles out the schooner suddenly sank . It was also said that the schooner carried a black flag . Up to this evening no clue has been obtained to the identity of the schooner , and the affair is wrapped in mystery . The little town of Beach Haven is an isolated fishing village on Long Beach , about 13 miles north of Atlantic City . There is no regular Signal Service station at that point , the telegraph office being in charge of Frank Taylor , a trustworthy operator who is employed by the guests of the Summer hotels . The eye-witnesses of this singular occurrence were Dr. Holden , a well-known physician of Newark , N. J. , who has been a visitor at Beach Haven for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coachman . Dr. Holden 's statement , which he corroborated this morning in person , and for which his family and coachman vouch , is as follows : " I had been gunning for marsh fowls during the afternoon of Friday . The storm having cleared overhead , although the waves were running mountain high , my wife and family drove out to meet me at a point some two miles north of Beach Haven . Just opposite the life-saving station , which is not manned this Summer , we saw a rakish-looking two-masted schooner , carrying a black flag , making straight toward us , and apparently pursued by a steamer . The schooner labored heavily and shook about a great deal in the heavy seas . My attention was attracted particularly by the black flag , which rose clear against the horizon as an enormous wave lifted the schooner until the entire hull . apparently filled with men , stood out in bold relief . I watched her sink in tee trough , and when I looked again she was nowhere to be seen . The steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came directly to the spot where we last saw the schooner , steamed carefully around it , and then came to a dead halt . She remained there apparently motionless for half an hour . I sighted at her down my gun-barrel , and am sure she did not move in that time . She then steamed to the north and out to sea . I could not see her launch any boats or make search for the crew of the schooner , though it is natural to suppose that she did so . " Dr. Holden is still in Beach Haven , a place , by the way , which has been for years past a resort for Jay uooke and his family and other Philadelphians , and is well known here and in Newark . Frank Taylor , the telegraph operator , said yesterday morning : " There is no doubt in , , the world of the correctness of Dr. Holden 's ' version of the mysterious affair . People here have been wild ever since the doctor 's return on Friday evening . When he returned Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly went down right before my eyes . ' The people here have been after me ever since for news , asking if the icrew were drowned and if nothing had come ashore . On Saturday evening two fishermen reported finding two barrels washed ashore on the beach off where the doctor saw the schooner ; sink , but I have not seen the barrels . " Dr. Holden 's coachman said : " I was terribly excited while we were watching the steamer chasing the- schooner , and when the schooner went down I. jumped off my box . Big Pete says he found a piece of a stern of a foreignbuilt boat on the beach on Saturday night , with part of a Spanish word on it , but he has told several different stories about it , I never felt so bad in my life as I did to see the schooner roll over and then go down in the flash of an eye and no sign of a soul saved of her crew . There is some mystery about the whole business  --  the steamer 's chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the black flag , too . The sea was terrible although the sun was shining . I guess the steamer reached the place where the schooner went down in about 10 minutes after she disappeared . " Mr. Taylor says he has no information of the name of either vessel . No black flag is known in marine codes save the piratical symbol of death .
