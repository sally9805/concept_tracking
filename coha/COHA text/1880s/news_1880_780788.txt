txt The eases of R. Heckscher &; Co. and Miller , Hoch &; Co. against Gilbert Sheafer and others , which were argued in court here yesterday , are expected to settle an important question of responsiblity which has arisen in recent mining operations . These suits were brought to restrain the defendants , Who are owners of the coal lands on which the plaintiffs ' collieries are situated . from collecting rents , on the ground that the plaintiffs have sustained great damage from the defendants ' failure to insure them the quiet enjoyment of their mining facilities . The mines are worked on what are known as coal leases , giving the right to mine coal within certain limits . The leases contain a clause binding the lessees so to work the mines as not to endanger surface properties . A portion of the surface over these workings was sold in lots to miners and others who wished to live near the works , and the lot deeds contained a clause reserving the right to mine coal under the property conveyed . Precautions were also taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from caving in of the surface was apprehended ; but as the mines extended , it was found that the Mammoth vein on which the plaintiffs ' collieries are situated had what miners call " a bad top , " the overlying rock breaking away so as to let down the surface where it was from 40 to 50 feet thick , something before unknown in minino. operations . Several pieces of surface property were injured in this way , and the owners procured injunctions restrainingthe coal firms from removing the coal under their lots . The companies retaliated on the landlords by withholding the monthly payments of rent , and applied for injunctions to restrain the landlords from making distress on their property for the amount due . The cases were joined , and were argued all day yesterday without being finished . Much interest is felt in the decision , as it will affect a great deal of property and a number of mining towns , especially in the Mahanoy district , Heckscher &; Co. ' s works being situated at Shenandoah , and Miller , Hoch &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all legal responsibility , are buying back the surface property wherever it is offered at a reasonable price , but some of the holders are demanding exorbitant prices with a view to speculation . Mining operations in the Mahanoy Valley are branching out from the Mammoth vein , which has been the one almost exclusively worked there , and are including smaller veins lying parallel with it . At the Stanton Colliery a tunnel 75 yards long has been driven from the Mammoth , which yesterday cut the Buck Mountain vein , penetrating 10 feet into the coal without cutting through it . At the Draper Colliery in the same neighborhood a tunnel of the same length has been recently driven from the Mammoth to the Primrose vein eight feet thick , and other colleries have similar works in contemplation . The Kohinoor Colliery has recently extended its workings by a second slope , so that it now has a shaft 400 feet deep , below that a slope 1,200 feet deep , and below that a second . 600 feet deep . The bottom of the second slope is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The coal in it is of the finest quality . It is reported that at the Pottsville shafts of the Reading Company the long-sought Mammoth vein has at last been cut in a bore hole extending from the long tunnel and about a quarter of a mile from the shaft . The report is believed to be true , but lacks official confirmation . If true , it will make this , when developed by far the largest and finest colliery in the State .
