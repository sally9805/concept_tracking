txt Gen. Sherman says that Senator Vance , of North Carolina , is not the man to whom Jeff Davis wrote saying that if a certain State withdrew from the Confederacy he would turn his batteries loose upon it , but the General still alleges that Davis wrote such a letter , and that it is in his possession . When asked when he would reply to Davis 's published communication denying the existence of such a letter he said that he . would answer it when he was ready , and that his reply would be sent through the War Department . About other matters the General was quite talkative . Re said of his proposed journey East this week , " I have got myself into a nice flx . A year ago I promised the President of the NewEngland Society of New-York Mr that if Gen. Grant would be present at the meeting this year I would attend also . I did n't think the General would be there , but , " holding up a dispatch find a letter , " look here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that'Gen . Grant will be on hand , and that I must stand by my agreement . Of course I shall have to be present also , and I shall leave in a few days for the East . The society meeting in Brooklyn is on Dec. 20 , and in New-York on the 22d . So it seems that I shall have to spend my Christmas and New Year 's away from my family after all . " And the General gazed thoughtfully at the fire , as though he saw a toothsome turkey roasting over the cheerful blaze . " Do you return home after the meeting ? " " No , I shall leave New-York immediately after New Year 's , and go to Washington to audit the accounts of the Smithsonian Institution , with which I am officially connected . "
