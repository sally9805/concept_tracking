THE LITERARY WORK OF THOMAS CARLYLE . THIRTY years are conventionally supposed to constitute the space of time which is loosely spoken of as a generation , and those whose memories can run to that length may , perhaps , be allowed to speak for the generation to which they belong , with , as it may be , less or more of authority , but , certainly , with sufficient knowledge . It is safe , therefore , for the present writer to say that at no time during the present generation in England has such a feeling been aroused in regard to the death of a man of letters as that which was felt in London when the announcement was made that Mr. Carlyle 's condition was hopeless , or , as our simpler forefathers would have had it , that " Thomas Carlyle , Esq. , lay a-dying at his house in Chelsea . " On the extreme verge of the period of memory to which I have alluded , the death of Wordsworth gives the first landmark of this peculiar kind . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very height of his fame . Thackeray , who had written on this latter recruit for " the majority " some of his most pathetic words , followed in i868 . Seven years afterward , his rival , as some thought , went to join him , and a bare month ago , George Eliot , whom a strong faction would even with these great names , preceded her neighbor , and , perhaps , in some sort , teacher , to the grave . These are the five greatest names borne on the literary schedule of England 's necrology during the last thirty years , but none of them has occupied anything like the position which was occupied by Mr. Carlyle . In some cases their fame had passed its zenith , and had begun to descend ; in others it was a matter rather of partisan assertion than of universal acceptance . In others , though they were acknowledged as consummate masters of one particular portion of the field , that portion was hardly thought by the general reader to be a very extensive one . But Mr. Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose , and though in prose he hardly cultivated more than two plots , the historical and that of the critical essay , has yet for many years been accepted by competent critics of all shades of opinion as the undoubted head of English letters . He had gained that position fifteen years ago by some forty years of laborious work , and , unlike some of his predecessors in the throne both in our own and in other countries , he had not endangered his supremacy by neglecting the adage , SQ/ye senescen/em. * In the rare instances in which , during the last stage of his career , he broke silence , no loss of power was observable , and if the king did not often meddle in the common jousts , he never took his spear in hand without acquitting himself in a manner becoming royalty . The hot debates which had once taken place as to his style , his principles , his moral influence , his philosophical value , had long died out . No one , save perhaps a very few very foolish people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an immoral defender of might instead of right , or a corrupter of the English language . Few people , on the other hand , upheld him as an inspired prophet , or an apostle of a new politico-ethical faith , or a harbinger of reformation in the language . He had passed the unquiet stage of violent acceptance and violent refusal , and had entered upon that placid possession of respect for his merits and tolerance for his short-comings which is usually reserved for those who have ceased to live . The three English editions of his collected works had , for some years , put a complete knowledge of what he had done while it , was day with him within the reach * Dismiss the aging horse from service , etc . Solve senescentern mature sanus equum , ne Peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat . HORACE , Epist. i , i , 8. // of almost all classes of readers . Moreover , though for the most part the respect due to the persdnal privacy of great men was fairly well observed ,  --  indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant personal anecdotes concerning his homely , vigorous wit and rugged amiability constantly spread through London society and gave a more intimate and personal complexion to the respect with which he was regarded . Many of these have never made their way into the professed collections of gossip , and even stern haters of ana may perhaps indulge a hope that they may some day be collected . How Mr. Carlyle would dispatch the character of some notable man or book with a couple or a dozen words of epigram ; how he would benevolently extinguish presumptuous youth and ruthlessly ignore troublesome age ; how persons of the most exalted station had to take their chance of his plain speaking ( " uttering comminatory words after the way of the Scotch " ) and make the best of it-these legends ( some of which are doubtless apocryphal , but most of which might be true , if they are not ) are duly recorded . The result of them , joined to the general respect for the intellectual greatness of the man and for his position as a consummate master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him which in different ways recalls something of that felt toward Scott by our fathers and something of that felt by our grandfathers toward Johnson , but which is differentiated from both these by the greater individuality and importance of Mr. Carlyle 's literary position and the unique character of the influence he exerted over the men of his time . All this is over now , and English literature is , for the moment , orphaned ; nor is it very clear ( since , in such matters , the lack of a natural succession is supplied by a process of adoption on the part of the children ) who is to be put into Mr. Carlyle 's place . A full biography of him would be no small task for any one , and nothing like a complete life is likely to appear for some years . He was born on the fourth of December , 1795 , at Ecclefechan , in Dumfriesshire , of good farmer folk , though at the time of his birth his father was pursuing the trade of a stone-mason-one of the numerous Socratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As usual with Scotch boys , he went early to the common school of the parishHoddam. - and had the rudiments duly impressed on him there . Thence he went to the higher or burgh school of Annan , a little town on the Solway , which " Red Gauntlet " has made classical . Here he met Edward Irving , his first friend , and one who had a peculiar influence on his destiny , as we shall shortly see . At fourteen he entered the University of Edinburgh , which , like most of the Scotch universities , was merely a high school as far as its students were concerned ,  --  indeed , it was but recently that in a protectionist spirit it had protested against the actual High School of Edinburgh being permitted to teach Greek ,  --  but which had a sufficiently distinguished staff of professors . He was not , as is sometimes said , seven years at the university , but only four , and his references direct and indirect to it are not friendly . The truth is , that at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch universities had nothing of the indescribable romantic charm of the older English institutions , nor were they very satisfactory places of mere learning . When he did leave Edinburgh , he at once decided that he had no vocation for the ministry , the usual destination of studious youth in his country , and he therefore fell back on the equally usual alternative of school-mastering , the rough and distasteful , but perhaps not unprofitable , vestibule through which so many men of letters have had to pass . A couple of years at his own old school at Annan , a couple more at Kirkcaldy , enabled him to " dree his weird " in this respect , and at the latter place he renewed his acquaintance with Irving . Then he went to Edinburgh and started fairly in literature . Brewster 's " Edinburgh Encyclopaedia " was his exercising ground , and the editor of that work helped him to his first solid piece of literary reward by suggesting that he should translate and preface Legendre 's " Geometry and Trigonometry . " After some time of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recommended him as a tutor , to the parents of Charles Buller , - one of the most widely , though most vaguely , known political names of the first part of the century ,  --  and a year or two in London not merely introduced him to very pleasant and very valuable society , but to literary work on the " London Magazine , " the short-lived but remarkable periodical which numbered on its staff during its few years of life , Lamb , De Quincey , Hazlitt , Carlyle , Allan Cunningham , Wainwright , and others . Here appeared part of the " Life of Schiller , " and for some years between 1824 and 1827 , Carlyle was much occupied // with translation , all the work of that kind reprinted in his collected editions being originally of this date and more besides . But Irving had unwittingly done his friend an even greater service than in introducing him to the Bullers . He had himself been asked to superintend the reading of a certain Miss Jane Welsh , daughter of Dr. Welsh , of Haddington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupil rejected the master , and he suggested that his friend Carlyle should take his place as tutor . The drama was repeated , but with happier result , and Thomas Carlyle gained the wife who for forty years was the " light of his life , " after whose death , in i866 , he was never the same man again , and who seemed to some of their friends to have in a different way intellectual powers nearly as remarkable as her husband 's . Besides these things , Miss Welsh was in a modest way an heiress , and her property of Craigenputtoch at once saved her husband from the necessity of hack-work , and gave him a singularly suitable place for the completion of his " Lehrjahre . " The site and appearance of this famous moor-land farm-house have been often enough described , and its adaptation to its purpose has been often enough commented on . But perhaps hasty readers are not aware of the immense amount of work that Mr. Carlyle did there . In rather less than five years , from 1828 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " especially the " Burns , "  --  a splendid example of the happy conjuncture of the right man and the right place ,  --  " Sartor Resartus , " and very much else which either never saw the light or was designedly suppressed or destroyed , were produced , while the plan at least of the " French Revolution " was formed . Above all , the period of apprenticeship to literature was completely got over . Mr. Carlyle was no precocity ; he did not to all appearance begin to write at all until he was five and twenty ; he confined himself to translation , criticism , biography , until he was fully five and thirty . Even had " Sartor Resartus " had a more speedy welcome from the booksellers it would not have appeared till its author had reached the ordinary half-way house of life , while the " French Revolution " was not completed till he was past forty . Yet no man ever wasted his time less , and when , in 1834 , he finally took up his abode in Cheyne Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly half a century ,  - -  no better-equipped man for the work that he had to do could have been found in the capital of England . Somewhat short of this particular point , when Mr. Carlyle had given up the hopeless pursuit of " hawking his poor little book about , " comes a very convenient opportunity of halting to survey the work which he had actually done ; for it was a little before this time that Francis Jeffrey , prince of blundering critics , wrote to Macvey Napier , his industrious and sorely tried successor in the " Edinburgh Review , " the following words , which I must ask to have printed in capitals as a perpetual warning to all censors of literature . The date is London , February 7 , i8*3* : " I FEAR CARLYLE WILL NOT DO ; THAT IS , IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THE LIBERTIES AND THE PAINS WITH HIM THAT I DID , BY STRIKING OUT FREELY AND WRITING IN OCCASIONALLY . THE MISFORTUNE IS THAT HE IS VERY OBSTINATE , AND , I AM AFRAID , CONCEITED ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE FINDS PEOPLE ENOUGH TO ABET AND APPLAUD HIM , AND TO INTERCEPT THE OTHERWISE INFALLIBLE REMEDY OF GENERAL AVOIDANCE AND NEGLECT . IT IS A GREAT PITY , FOR HE IS A MAN OF GENIUS AND INDUSTRY , AND WITH THE CAPACITY OF BEING AN ELEGANT AND IMPRESSIVE WRITER . " I do not hesitate to say that these are , in their own way , perhaps , the most instructive words to be found in all literature . Jeffrey was , indeed , frequently unfortunate in his judgments ; but in other cases there is generally something to be said in mitigation of the judgment which , in his turn , he has to undergo . There is here no drop serene of political prejudice , as in the case of the Lake poets . There is no provocation of youthful imbecility and inequality , as in the case of Byron . One man of letters , admitted ( and this is at once a saving and a damning clause for Jeffrey ) to be " a man of genius and industry , " comes before another man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is told that he must submit to letters of ( lenaturalization , if he is to be passed . Let it be remembered that Jeffrey was certainly no fool . A fool would not have admitted that Mr. Carlyle was a man of genius . A fool admitting this would not have dared to suggest that a man of genius and industry could be improved by the prdcess of striking out and writing in . Jeffrey was simply one of the numerous // persons of talent who are hopelessly under the control of accepted conventions . He had a series of test-standards to whichmore ma/orurn from the days of Boileauhe adjusted literary aspirants , and according to their unfitness for which he condemned them . He , the editor of the " Edinburgh Review , " doubtless regarded with scorn the admirable verses in which , ten years before , one of the most formidable assailants of that review had expressed the truth of the matter : " But this you may know , that , as long as they grow , Whatever change may be , You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greenwood tree . " Jeffrey 's idea of the complete vegetable was a tree duly subjected to the topiary art , and neither oak nor beech lends itself to that process . At this time Mr. Carlyle had already a considerable literary baggage , printed or unprinted . There was the mass of contributions at different periods to reviews , and the book-sellers ' hack-work  --  the " honest journey-work in default of better " - of which he has preserved a few essays , to be noticed later , and the translations from the German which fill five volumes of his collected works . There was " The Life of Schiller , " there was " Sartor Resartus , " -a stumbling-block to the readers of Fraser , **  --  and lastly there was , though only on the stocks as yet , the " French Revolution . " This had had , as most people know , to undergo a fiery trial which , had its author been a man of less genius and of less industry ,  --  let us thank the Shylock of Craigcrook for the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us take these in turn and see what is to be made of them . Translations , regarded merely as such , have but a dubious , and , at best , a mediocre literary interest . In the hands of writers such as Dryden and Shelley , who dare to be audaciously unfaithful , and to whom the gods grant that their infidelity shall be successful , they may acquire a certain independent value . But , for the most part , the interest of the translation is not in so far as it more or less imperfectly reproduces the original , but , on the one hand , in so far as it inspires a desire to read that original , and , on the other , in so far as it forms and contributes to the translator 's ability to produce independent literary work . The " Wilhelm Meister , " and those translations from German romance which Mr. Carlyle chose to reproduce , have , perhaps , less of the drawback of translations than most others , but they still suffer from it . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Goethe in German will ever , of pure choice , bestow his valuable or even his valueless time on " Quintus Fixlein , " or " Libussa , " or " Meister " itself , in their English dress . But these books acquire a most lively interest when we begin to estimate their influence on the matter and the form of the author of the " French Revolution " and of " Frederick the Great . " It is , perhaps , hardly a commonplace to say that nothing affects an author 's style so much as his practice in translation . Mere reading , if the reader be tolerably expert in the language he reads , alienates his style but little . He does not need to go through the process of translation ; his eyes and his brain are generously content to filter the foreign presentment into a familiar one for him without insisting on a literal and grammatical version . But when he comes , pen in hand , to undertake the process of conversion , with the sense of the double responsibility to writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-sellers ' hacks , the case becomes different . He must bathe himself in his original , and it is , at least , a chance if he succeeds in washing off the traces of his bath by any subsequent immersion in English undefiled , or whatever the native language may be in which he undertakes to initiate his proselyte . It is notorious that for many years , the complaints that Mr. Carlyle had Germanized English were loud . Yet , oddly enough , he maintained side by side with this Anglo-German dialect a practice of very orderly , and , according to the Jeffreyan standard , even elegant English eighteenth-century composition . Much of " The Life of Schiller , " which dates from the period of these translations , is visibly written in this latter style ; and Jeffrey and Brougham doubtless to their dying days regretted that the wholesome discipline of " avoidance and neglect " had not confirmed Mr. Carlyle in this tendency . The " Schiller , " indeed , as it is now published with a later preface and a still later appendix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . In the earlier work we have the language which the author might have continued to use if the topiary art had been successfully practiced on him . It is unequal , not inelegant , effective enough as mere book-sellers ' work , abso // lutely destitute , for the most part , of the peculiar charm and the peculiar stimulating power for which its author will be remembered among English men of letters . The translations and the " Schiller " thus give us the two currents , the Sa6ne and Rhone , of Mr. Carlyle 's future literary river . In all the rest of his work we see how their united force waters the vineyards , supplies the great cities , and serves as central artery to the mighty province of his literary domain . In these comparatively early works , not merely the style , but also the matter , is noteworthy . From the nature of it , it could contain little or nothing of its author 's own thought . It could only indicate that thought more or less indirectly and suggestively . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we had nothing of Mr. Carlyle 's but the " Sartor Resartus " and the " French Revolution , " we should lack a great deal of literary delight . We should not , perhaps , lack much literary instruction . The one still remains , on the whole , the most perfect presentment of his hurnoristic criticism ; the other is , unquestionably , the best presentment of his remarkable combination of minute historical research with the widest and most comprehensible historical view . It is probably not an exaggeration to say that no book of the nineteenth century has equaled " Sartor Resar*s " in the peculiar effect which it has had on the minds of young readers . The comparison of the chemical mixture which remains liquid as long as it be undisturbed , but shoots into crystallizations directly after the slightest shock is administered to it , is a hackneyed one ; but nothing so aptly expresses this effect . Like all Mr. Carlyle 's works , " Sartor Resartus " is remarkably barren in purely practical admonition . What he has to teach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a gospel " ; and it is the attitude of " Sartor Resartus " which hundreds and thousands of English-speaking and English-reading youths during the last half-century have felt constrained , much to their souls ' health , to adopt . To blench at no paradox , to accept no convention , to pierce below the surface at whatever cost apparently of safe and comfortable foot-hold , to get rid of belief in believing and assuniption of knowing ,  --  these are the lessons taught in this earliest book , as it may perhaps be allowably taken to be , of the.master 's , and no others will be learnt from the most attentive student of his later lucubrations . Yet the lesson , incomplete even with the " French Revolution , " as far as the universality of its application goes , would have been more incomplete ,  --  would , indeed , have been hopelessly and dangerously incomplete ,  --  without the succor of the book which had so strange a preliminary experience before it could get itself published to the world . After all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a trained critic like Jeffrey could go so far wrong , what might be expected of a layman ? To the average English ear of 1830 , " Sartor Resartus " had the double defect of talking in a language not understood of the people about things of which the people knew nothing . The " French Revolution " was , as a subject , at least free from the latter drawback . If the average Briton knew very little about its details , the fact of it and the importance of it were still fresh in his memory . He had not ceased " to plume himself because we beat the Corsican , " or to believe-in which , indeed , he was not far wrong-that it was the turning-point of the history of Europe . There was , therefore , at least , common ground between him and his author . His interest and dim general acquaintance with the subject supplied the term wanting in the case of " Sartor Resartus , " and while the United States , to their eternal honor , had welcomed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance in volume form in England , the " French Revolution " made its mark from the day of publication , forced itself onward against all opposition , and for nearly half a century has held , and is never likely to lose , the position of the locus classicus , in which all men of English birth and speech shall seek their knowledge of that tremendous fact . That it is worthy of the position which , in England at least , is generally assigned it , of the best of its author 's works , judged from all points of view , I have no doubt . It is not so marvelous a monument of insight as the " Cromwell . " Detached passages from the " Essays , " from the " Latter-day Pamphlets , " and from other pieces excel it in originality of humor , and quaint , fantastic perversion , and topsy-turvification . " The Life of Sterling " is even more admirable as a work of art . The " Frederick " is a more surprising evidence of untiring labor and of the comprehensiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which knows how to master them all . But if these separate good gifts are more eminently present in other works , the // 97 " French Revolution " exhibits them in the most harmonious combination . It is the most practically serviceable in the education of the citizen and the man of letters , and above all , it is the first sprightly running of its author 's mind in the direction of practical and historical application of an original , if partial and one-sided , view of human life and human affairs . M. Tame s memorable complaint of the extravagant titles of the chapters , of the way in which the events are enveloped in a cloudy haze of declamation , will always remain a most interesting probf of the incompatibility of certain eyes to adjust themselves to certain telescopes . To the French critic , the events of which he had , as he thought , a nicely codrdinated idea , were thrown into " pi " by Mr. Carlyle . To most Englishmen , even if they have taken the trouble to ascertain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most diverse , the mys. terious and almost incredible events of the French Revolution range themselves into a possible and intelligible whole in Mr. Carlyle 's account , and in that account almost only . Such a view does not exclude difference of political opinion ; it does not exclude the admission that in some cases the writer may have failed to take the true view . It simply amounts to an assertion that , in this famous book , for almost the first time since Tacitus , history had ceased to be a matter of words and names , of dates and figures . Between the " Annals " and the " French Revolution , " the dramatic truth of history had for the most part been lost sight of ; in the latter book it emerged into full recognition . That we have since suffered many things from the dramatic historian matters little ; the fact remains that the " French Revolution , " after nearly a century of very praiseworthy philosophy of history , made the dry bones of the science live and move , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most interesting of subjects to the purely literary critic , the style of Carlyle , would be here out of place ; yet , perhaps , a few words as from one who has considered that matter with such light as he has had may be given . The vague popular notion that this style consists in a mere Germanizing , and especially Richterizing , of English may be dismissed at once . For , in the first place , the first evil characteristic of a purely German style , as it appears to the impartial considerer of German literature in the original , from Wolfram von Eschenbach to Heine , is absent . That characteristic is clumsiness consequent upon length . The style of Carlyle is never clumsy , and it is rarely long . The truth is that , in the formative period of his studies , Mr. Carlyle had evidently three different models before his eyes . - There was the English style of the seventeenth century , before Dryden had codrdinated it into harmony ,  --  a style loose , unequal , not to be depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be appropriate . There was , secondly , the French style of the memoirs and casual writings of the eighteenth century ,  --  a style unequaled in detached felicities , but cast generally in a mold which requires to be strangely altered before it can give any good result in this speech of ours . There was , thirdly , the German determination to say what had to be said quite irrespective of any preestablished harmony between the conventional forms of speech and the meaning which had to be conveyed by that speech . Pepys , Voltaire , Richter , suggest themselves , turn by turn , as the antitypes of the singular hybrid language in which our author got his thoughts dressed and ready for the inspection of mankind . But the general result was wholly felicitous . Let us go for a negative definition of style to the writer who of all writers in our own day is most antipodean to Mr. Carlyle , save that both were humorists . The writer , says Th6ophile Gautier , to whom an idea presents itself which he can not clothe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape a negative condemnation may be thought to be a justification of the imperfect kind , yet there are few authors who are justified in this way so completely as the author of the " French Revolution " and " Sartor Resartus . " He can say what he pleases , even though the saying require an altogether Herculean task of rearranging the arrangements of his mothertongue . He is never obscure by reason of his style merely ; he never needs to have recourse to the clumsy elongations of the sentence in which inorganic talent takes refuge in all languages , and especially in German . Soon , too , after the time which we are now considering , a fresh and remarkable testimony to his varied capacities and excellencies was published . This was the collection of essays or miscellanies which he had contributed to various reviews or magazines during his period of probation . This collection ( unlike the " Sartor , " first reprinted in America ) has since been augmented by some remarkable works , some of which I may have occasion to comment upon later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d*fferen/ia of a new writer so fully as the two more independent works which have just been commented upon . But as " Sartor Resartus " and the " French Revolution " remain the best examples of Mr. Carlyle 's original faculty , so the " Essays , " which were republished in 1839 , remain the best example of his faculty of adaptation ,  --  the critical faculty , more especially ,  --  and are , perhaps , the best existing proof of his purely literary power . They contain also , beyond all doubt , the best examples of his limitations . The last test of the critic is , doubtless , the question , How does he bear himself toward those things or persons with whom he happens to disagree ? Carlyle can not wholly stand this test , and , in so far , he is an imperfect critic . Yet how many imperfect critics are there who achieve such a result as he has achieved ? The list of his critical essays is , perhaps , the most varied that any author of his standing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and Macvey Napier , show that even the completed and published results do not exhibit fully the range of his talent . He began by devoting himself to that German literature which was his first love and his last , and of which , like most men with their first loves , he was not , perhaps , an altogether wise judge . But the second volume , as ordinarily printed , of his " Essays , " shows at once the enlargement of circle which he was seldom afterward to lose . The essay on Burns is , in many ways , a test essay . Burns is , as a rule , to the Englishman a stumbling-block , and to the Scotchman foolishness ,  --  not in the sense of the original quotation , but because he deems himself bound to indulge in inconsiderate and indefensible laudation . The essay of which we are speaking did not say the last word about Burns , because Mr. Carlyle always had , and could not but have , a certain incapacity to take poetry merely on poetical grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or good on those grounds . One of his proposed essays on " French Poetry in 1841 " would probably have been - had it seen the light  --  a memorable study of the sorrowful chances which wait on those who undertake uncongenial tasks ; yet by sheer force of solid sense and human sympathy he has said better things about Burns than have ever been said before or since , and l ) etter than are ever likely to be said , until some one takes up the task to whom the dialect is no stumbling-block , who is not frightened by the poet 's moral obliquities , and who , at the same time , has no national , or pseudo-national , temptation to speak unadvisedly with his lips . In the same context comes the equally remarkable essay on Voltaire . It has made French critics very angry ; it has made English critics , who are by no means Voltaireans , confess that there is a good deal more to be said . But is there anywhere a more vivid account of the whole of that remarkable phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literature a better introduction to Voltaire , which the intelligent reader may , in the course of his reading , correct , but which will put him in case to undertake that reading with a chance of comprehension , and not a certainty of miscomprehension ? The third volume brings us to that admirable paper on the " Nibelungen Lied , " which it is not wonderful that the editor of the " Edinburgh Review " gently chid the author for not offering to him . I speak of this with all modesty , but with some tolerable knowledge of early German literature , and with a knowledge which perhaps also will pass muster of the earlier and more voluminous French or Franco-German literature of the chansons de ge's/es . But I do not know that to this day , after forty years ' ceaseless disinterment and careful examination of early medieval literature , any paper has appeared equal to this of the " N ibelungen Lied , " in the power of putting merely English readers in a position to appreciate the fertile fancies-now graceful now fierce , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following essay on " German Literature of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries " deals with far baser matter , but it has the same power of initiating the reader into the spirit of the time ; while , in so far as it deals with Reynard the Fox , it is one of the best comments ever made on one of the*nost delightful things in literature . It is a pity indeed that the critic 's knowledge of the real original , as far as we have it in the French of the thirteenth century , was imperfect , but that is only an unimportant detail . The essay of the fourth volume-I name only those which give salient illustrations of the author 's idiosyncrasy , where all are admirable-is the famous one on Boswell 's " Johnson , " where perhaps the force of fellow-feeling is better illustrated than anywhere else , and which , in contrast with Macaulay 's delightful but flashy paper , re // 99 mains a monument of solid insight . The fifth is almost wholly composed of masterpieces . The short note on Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four essays which compose the volume are masterpieces without any allowance for what is merely personal . They are , it may be said , digressions from the " French Revolution . " I may perhaps be allowed to speak of the essay on Diderot with some positiveness , inasmuch as , with the exception of Mr. Morley , I do not know another Englishman , besides myself , who has actually read the works of that strange man of letters from beginning to end . Here , as almost always with Mr. Carlyle , though one may quarrel with details , there is nothing to do but to acquiesce with a proviso as to general points of view in his total estimate . He has not done his singular subject full justice , but if any one will take the trouble to read his essay and then to compare it-I do not say with Mr. Morley 's book or with Rosenkrantz's-but with that recently put forth by a famous French critic , M. Scherer , he will see the difference at once . It is the difference between genius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biased comprehension of the facts and situations , and one who had endeavored to apply tentatively and shrinkingly certain preconceived ideas to a very complex and puzzling fact . I , for instance , disagree with not a few of Mr. Carlyle 's minors ; I decline to recognize in M. Scherer any major whatsoever . Of the " Cagliostro , " the " Diamond Necklace , " and the " Mirabeau , " it is impossible to speak here simply for want of space . They are patterns of the historical essay , the separate tractate giving a vivid glimpse of separate points which can not without digression be handled in a general history . Of more dubious truth , yet on no account to be passed over , is the essay on Sir Walter Scott . Here , if anywhere , Mr. Carlyle proved himself a hanging judge , and here perhaps the quality of mercy might have been most advantageously displayed . Scott 's noble and stainless character , his wonderful versatility of literary talent , the excellence of his work at its best , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness , might have bribed a less austere judge than Mr. Carlyle . But it did not bribe him . He thought he saw evidences of unworthy ambitions , of mistaken views of life , of hasty work , of deafness to the voices , obedience to which he himself thought to be the whole duty of man . He probably h.eld himself bound , as a Scotchman writing of a Scotchman , to show no mercy , and he showed none . And yet-which after all is not quite surprisingthe essay on Scott , like the essay on Burns , remains the best eulogy of its subject . The would-be curser has blessed , though not altogether ,  --  which indeed no true man writing of another , whatever his purposes or prepossessions may be , is likely to do . To return to the narrative of his life . The thirty years which passed from the time of his establishment in Cheyne Row to the death of Mrs. Carlyle , were occupied wholly with literary companionship and literary work . The latter has been noticed , or will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , were this the place for saying it . A certain detachment from London society was always noticeable about Mr. Carlyle , but especially at this early time he was in much of it , if not of it . His introduction to the Bullers had early given him access to most of the philosophical Radicals , and to the most advanced of the Whig party ; and , for a considerable time , he and John Stuart Mill  --  a strangely assorted pair-were the closest of friends . It was owing to Mill 's vicarious carelessness that the first volume of the " French Revolution " was lost , and it was during a chance call on Mill at the India Office that Mr. Carlyle was first introduced to Sterling . The life of the latter incidentally shows us a good deal of its author as well as of its hero , during the decade which closed in 1840 . Those were the days of the Sterling Club , and of much other pleasant companionship . Toward the close of the period , too , Mr. Carlyle , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and by the reprints-after America had set the example-of the " Sartor " and the " Essays , " took , probably at the advice of his friends , a step which at this distance of time seems a little curious  --  the step of lecturing . Only one of the four courses he delivered did he choose to preserve in his collected works , though all were well attended and highly popular . The mere epithets , " well attended " and " highly popular , " have such an odd sound in connection with any proceeding of Thomas Carlyle 's that it is scarzely surprising that he should not , after these experiments , have cared to continue the practice . It is , however , probable that the best-known and most popular course , that on " Heroes , " did a good deal to send hearers to his hooks , and thus to // do away with the ignorant and foolish prejudice against his style and his ideas which still existed to no small extent . By 1840 , however , he had thoroughly made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pilgrimages , in the body or in the spirit , such as those he had himself made to Goethe and to Coleridge ten years before . Of his attitude in relation to the former there is no need to speak , but it has often been suspected that the " Life of Sterling " does not tell the whole story of the relation to Coleridge , or , rather , that it tells *t in an indirect way , and that some such process of enchantment and of disenchantment befell the biographer as that which , by hypothesis chiefly , he asserts of his subject . But it is not difficult to see that the Coleridgean indifference to conduct must have been wholly horrible to Mr. Carlyle , and that the Coleridgean moonshine-not being his own variety of that fascinating kind of light-was scarce4y less horrible . By the time , however , at which we have now arrived , he was master , not pupil , and was rapidly becoming recognized as such by others than his own familiars . The years from 1839 to 1845 were chiefly occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a task upon which he bestowed , perhaps , more elaborate pains , as well as more genius , than any previous historian . Circumstances were more favorable than they had been in the case of the " French Revolution , " and he was able to add to the most careful collation of documentary evidence , actual visits to the places mentioned-visits resulting in a hardly matched vividness of description . He had also for some time begun to interest himself not a little in actual politics , though in a most curiously original way . " Past and Present " is at once a monument of the keen practical spirit of the man and of what may be called his literary flair , or scent . Ecclesiological medhevalism was at its veryheight , and in itself Mr. Carlyle hated it , or regarded it with a partly unutterable sense of sarcastic astonishment . Yet he managed , out of a book published to interest readers who read in this spirit , to make something quite different ,  --  to expound his own views , preach his own gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as those before expounded in the tract on " Chartism , " and those subsequently developed in " Latterday Pamphlets , " and elsewhere , were anything but palatable to his Radical friends , while the opposite party was hardly likelyat any rate , for a time  --  to be propitiated by the furious denunciations of game-preserving , of the " business of owning land , " of this and that and the other , which occurred here and there in the midst of demonstrations of the Tory theory of government . But all this time his reputation , and , so to speak , his popularity , public and private , grew steadily , and a rich harvest of stories from all sources will reward the biographer who sets himself patiently and humbly to Boswellize . His miscellaneous employments gave way early in the fifties to the project of writing a life of Frederick the Great , Which was undertaken on the same plan of careful documentary investigation and actual inspection of places as the " Cromwell . " There is no doubt that the labor involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing in years , it may well be that at times it was felt to be a burden . Fortunately or unfortunately , this is not the place for a critical examination in detail of Mr. Carlyle 's work , and only a very general summary can be attempted of what he did in this , the second and longest period of his career . The success of the " French Revolution " had placed him , not indeed , beyond the reach of carping criticism , but in the rank of an admitted master of English prose . In the same year as the collected essays , was published-as has been just remarked  --  the tractate on " Chartism , " which has sometimes been combined with them , and has sometimes made its appearance independently . It was its author 's first direct and independent attempt to meddle with English politics of the actual kind , and its merits and defects were very much what might have been anticipated by a clear-sighted critic . The " Condition-ofEngland " question was treated in altogether too a priori a fashi* for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who set before themselves the simple question , How is the Queen 's government to be carried on ? as the deciding test of all suggestions . Judged even from a less limited stand-point , it was , perhaps , wanting in practicality , inasmuch as the writer , after the wont of study-politicians , does not by any means grasp the whole of his subject ; yet it was in principle sound and healthy , as Mr. Carlyle 's work almost always has been , and it may be doubted whether , in forty years , it has grown wholly obsolete . The two works which were produced in the next year-184o-were , in more senses than one , remarkable . One- " Heroes and Hero // Worship " - was its author 's chief if not his only , bid for popularity , and has , perhaps , remained the most popular of his works . It is not the best ; indeed , in the judgment of the present writer , it is very far from the best . For the desire to meet the hearer half-way-it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue emphasizing of certain peculiarities of style , and in a reduction , to an unnatural scale , of the ordinary conditions of writing . Mr. Carlyle here attempted to put his philosophico-political creed in little , and , as it happens , it is not a creed which bears that process well ; so that the book remains an unsatisfactory book , full of noble passages , directed wholly to a noble end , but of a popular kind , compared with other work . Nothing of this sort can be said of " Past and Present , "  --  a unique book , which no one , perhaps , but its author could have written , neither the like of it will any other man write . Mr. Carlyle was , as has been said , nothing so little as a medi*valist ; yet in some respects the Middle Ages had a strong attraction for him , and in this particular instance he bent to the work with hardly surpassed success his marvelous talent for making the dry bones of history to live . The reconstruction-not to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present is , if possible , more marvelous still . " Past and Present " was a tour de force , and a wonderfully successful one , yet it was altogether eclipsed by the book which at some interval , occupied by continuous and unremitting labor , followed . Few books have had such a fortune as the " Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell . " It found its subject under the ban of both the great political parties in England ; it left him emancipated from any purely political ostracism of any kind . In saying this , I by no means intend to convey any expression of opinion that Mr. Carlyle has established Oliver Cromwell in the position in which he would seem to have wished to establish him , - that of a wholly disinterested and puresouled patriot . Whitehall and Drogheda must disappear from the map of the United Kingdom before any general agreement on this point is obtained ; and there must cease to be believers either in legitimacy and privilege on the one hand , or in the right of the nation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . But the point is that this book lifted Cromwell from the position of a pet aversion or a pet i ( lOl into that of an ordinary historic personage , whose actions may be judged favorably or unfavorably , but who can no longer be regarded as a mere monster or portent . Remarkable as had been the historical faculty for weaving details into clear narration which Mr. Carlyle had already shown , this book carried his reputation in that matter still higher , while his editions , as they may be called , of the " Letters and Speeches " revealed an entirely new talent in him . These documents , in so far as they had been known at all , had been a riddle for two hundred years . Mr. Carlyle treated them exactly as an editor of A*schylus treats the choruses of the " Supplices " or the " Choephor*e , " with the difference that his emendations and elucidations , instead of being merely felicitous guesses and display of scholarship , are certain and indisputable recoveries of fact . Intense sympathy , unremitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity with the circumstances of the original utterance and the original utterer , had enabled him to deal with them in the manner rather of science than of art . As with all work of the very Iirst class , the thing was done once for all . Estimates of Cromwell 's character will always differ , but we shall no more go back , nor will our sons go back , upon anything before this book as a basis for such estimates , than we shall go behind Bentley 's " Phalaris " or Darwin 's observations on the breeding of pigeons . There was again a considerable interval before Mr. Carlyle produced anything new , and his two next works , dating from the troubled period which closed the forties , were sufficiently remarkable . One of them is the most debatable and the most debated of all his works ; the other is that - which by common consent stands , as a work of art and as a personal monument , first of all . By the estimate which a man forms of " Latter-day Pamphlets " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiation into the Carlylean mysteries , and at the same time the degree with which he has preserved in the course of that initiation his faculty of sound judgment . ' To the uninitiated they are an abomination merely , and the reason is not far to seek , for in them as in no other work is to be found the caricature of the author 's peculiarities of style , the inurbane exaggeration of his violence of diction ,  - -  which in our own days a great disciple of his has unfortunately imitated ,  --  the willful consideration of all things through a pair of specially colored glasses , which earlier , and // even later when Philip was sober , he would himself have calledCarlyle , seeing all things in Carlyle . To the devotee , on the other hand , all this is admirable and quintessential . Between these two extremes , the impartial but appreciative critic may discover to his sorrow some evidence of spoiling , but still more , perhaps , of deep insight , of curious felicity of phrase , of rugged imperviousness to popular fallacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitherto , the appointed morning bitters for Englishmen of the nineteenth century , after they have gone through one of their periodical fits of worship of the unworthy . But it is medicine , not drink , except to a few exceptionally constituted palates . On the other hand , the " Life of Sterling " may be said to be nocturna versanda manu , versanda diurna . The comparative simplicity of the style , the abstinence from any wanton treading even upon obtrusive toes , the matchless episodic passages ,  - -  such as that portrait of Coleridge which , onesided as it doubtless is , is so absolutely faithful to the side to which it confines itself ; the affectionate and complete presentation of a typical nineteenth-century man ,  --  the abundance of personal and autobiographic detail , neither impertinently profuse nor affectedly limited , the pathos , the careful art , the unstudied naturalness of the book , could not fail and have not failed of their effect . With " In Memoriam " it builds the temple of nineteenth-century friendship for Englishmen , as no other age or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sartor " and the " French Revolution " are the most instructive of Carlyle 's works for the estimate of his literary and philosophical position , as the best essays represent his highest positive achievement in style , as the " Cromwell " is his most astonishing performance in point of research and creative criticism , so these two books are , the most intrinsically and independently interesting of all . Two passages there are at any rate in them which deserve never to be forgotten . The one is the author 's , the other is an extract from a letter of Sterling 's . " Sure enough , " says the fierce pessimist of the pamphlets , " if one in a thousand see at all in this sad matter what I see and have long seen in it , his life either suddenly or gradually will alter in several particulars , and his sorrow , apprehension , and amazement will probably grow upon him the longer he considers this affair , and his life , I think , will alter ever farther , and he-this one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens and me while he continues in this world or in any world . " " Toward me , " writes Sterling on his death-bed , " it is still more true than toward England that no one has been and done like you . " There are hundreds and thousands of men in England who have countersigned both these sayings since . Yet another interval or silence , and this time a very considerable one , followed these two notable books ; but , like the former intervals , it was occupied with sufficient preparation for the forthcoming work . No notice in any way corresponding to its bulk and deserts can here be attempted of the " Frederick . " I think that it has-in England-been hardly judged . It is of course fair to remember that the author , when the first volume appeared , had reached his grand climacteric ,  --  that a certain hardness of judgment , approaching to prejudice , had crept over him , and that it was sufficiently obvious that he was no longer , as he had once done , illustrating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , of malice prepense , illustrating them by a deliberately chosen paradox . Great as Frederick was in various ways , he seems  --  and I trust will always seem-detestable to most Englishmen . To me , personally , my own hearty detestation of the hero does not affect in the least my equally hearty enjoyment of the book ; but it is not so with most people , and I do not know that one can fairly expect that it should be so . Let it only be said that in no work is the so often mentioned mastery of detail more marvelously exhibited , while in none are the detached passages of vivid description more attractive . The early history of the house of Hohenzollern , the Voltaire episode , the history of the police-persecuted school-master whom Frederick relieved , could not have been better done by Mr. Carlyle himself in the vigor of his manhood ; that is to say , they could not have been so well done by any other living man . Once more , and for the last time , we must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election in 1865 as Rector of Edinburgh University was in some sort the climax of his worldly career . The distinction , in itself ; may seem but a small one , but it has to be remembered that it is allotted on a very peculiar principle . The Rector is elected by the students , and not merely literary but political and other considerations enter into the question . Mr. Carlyle had never laid himself out for flattery // of his university , nor even for flattery of his mother-country , and in this blind sort of way a seal was doubtless set on his position in literature . But Nemesis , the eldest and youngest of goddesses , waited upon him here . While he was absent at Edinburgh delivering his inaugural address  --  a very admirable one-his wife died suddenly , and " the light of his life went out . " He never , in any important degree , put pen to paper for the purposes of publication again . His house still continued to be a sort of Caaba of English literature , and his person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indocile to the system of personal worship , reverenced the principal and master figure and product of English letters . Only at rare intervals was his silence broken afterward . He had already taken a very decided line in the matter of the conflict between the Northern and Southern States of America ,  --  a question upon which it were , perhaps , better that no word should be spoken here . Three times during the last three lusters of his life did he break silence in similar fashion , and once or twice otherwise . The Jamaica business , in which his old friend John Stuart Mill took so strong a part against the English governor , found in Mr. Carlyle a still stronger defender of the unpopular side . I was at Oxford at the time , and I remember well how Mill was then the reigning star of philosophic speculation , and how his occultation followed at once , and , as it happened , though doubtless for other reasons , forever . To dethrone a logician because he had taken . a side , logical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but pure reason is not expected of boys of twenty . Some of us saved the logician while we damned the politician . All of us , I think I may say , save an insignificant minority , were on Mr. Carlyle 's side against Mr. Mill . Again , in 1870 , Mr. Carlyle made some profession of faith in the matter of the Franco-German war , and here he scarcely carried his audience with him , though I think that none of the dissentients bore him any grudge for the fact . Years passed , and 1875 brought some pleasant " last fruits from an old tree , " as one who had against expectation done Carlyle justice might have called them . The " Early Kings of Nor*vay , " and the essay on the portraits of John Knox showed , perhaps , a certain relaxation of the loins , a slight dimness of the lamp as far as literary style and brilliancy were concerned , but if it was old age it was the old age of Carlyle . Two years later , another political debate interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polemical utterances . " I do not remember that the warmest friends of the Russians found much gratification in their new ally who was so obviously reminiscent of Zorndorff and Kunersdorff : I am quite sure that the most decided of their opponents did not quarrel with Mr. Carlyle for his expression of opinion . Then he relapsed into what , after all , was , perhaps , his natural element-silence . A considerable physical collapse was reported years ago , yet the old faculty of humorous epigram remained untouched . One of the most striking stories of Mr. Carlyle which I have heard , and which , I think , has never yet made its way into print , was the following . Some years ago a new history of England , greeted with much shouting , had appeared , and judicious or injudicious friends , thinking to please Mr. Carlyle , asked his opinion of it . " Yes , " said he ,  --  and the racy dialect unfortunately not reproducible in print *iccentuated his words ,  --  " I have read it , that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here was a young man who had taken pains about his subject , and perhaps knew something about it . But I saw that there was a great deal about the British constitution , and a great deal about liberty , and as I do n't care a - for the British constitution , and as I do n't care a for liberty , I thought it would be waste of time to go further . " We-I speak for the great multitude of Mr. Carlyle 's English admirers , who maintain their freedom of judgment-knew what to make of this : it is not too much to hope that others will know what to make of it , too . Toward the end of January , in the midst of the severest weather which has been felt in England for a generation , it was whispered that Mr. Carlyle was seriously ill . Those who took an interest in him had heard that for some time past the powers of life were failing , and not a few , knowing how these visits of Arctic weather tell on the old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday , the 29th of January , that the first news came of a really alarming collapse , and on the following Saturday , February fifth , at half-past eight o'clock in the morning , , the greatest Englishman of our days had ceased to be . His last week of life was a season of feverish political excitement which a little diverted attention from Cheyne Row to a point lower down Thames bank . Yet few men who cared at all for // things worth caring for , failed during those seven days to turn first to their newspaper for news of the dying master , and fewer did not feel a shock when they learned that the end was at last come . So has a great light gone out in our midst . Some reference was made at the beginning of this paper to the personal and moral influence , independent of mere literary influence , which Mr. Carlyle has so long exercised . But no treatment of the subject would be complete without some further remarks on this . I have for my part no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " French Revolution , " of " Cromwell , " of the " Essays , " of the " Sterling , " in the purely literary estimate of any competent critic of English at any future time . But it is doubtful whether any one who has not been an Englishman in Victorian times will ever be able fully to understand the position which Mr. Carlyle occupied as a teacher of men during almost the whole period of the reign . The word teacher must be used because there is no other available , but it is an awkward and in some sense a delusive one . For , as has been already hinted , definiteness of gospel was no part of Mr. Carlyle 's work , and those who sought to find a definite gospel in him , as many of his earlier admirers did , and not a few later ones of the foolisher sort , took but little good by their endeavor . Either they tried to transfer their master 's formulas to their own facts ,  --  thereby doing the very thing he most protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his case symbolical , crotchet until it became ridiculous and absurd . Accordingly , the most gifted of those who about thirty years or more ago might have been definitely called Carlyleans have either fallen into comparative literary sterility and decadence , or , being saved from this by their natural force , have ended in a wild dogmatism on all things under the sun which is hardly saved by its eccentricity from being simply foolish . It was a great characteristic of Mr. Carlyle himself that he never spoke with insufficient knowledge . It is a characteristic of some of his imitators that they never speak with knowledge that is sufficient . But the real influence which he has exercised , the total amount of which is as enormous as its tendency is good , has been of a different kind from this . During the whole time of his literary fertility , and in hardly less degree since that period came to an end with the completion of the " Frederick , " the vast majority of English youths possessed of brains have been infallibly , and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carlyle's-it hardly mattered whichat the period when they were beginning to think for themselves . The influence was sometimes lasting , it was frequently powerful , it was almost always good . For a very short time during the process of vaccination , the patient may have been a little the worse for it , but the beneficial effects in a healthy subject were permanent . The reading of Carlyle by a person who has any capacities of original thought does not often , now that the outward peculiarities of his style have become familiar things in literature and are in many cases almost trite , result in a Carlylese mania such as was once too common . The humorous eccentricity and exaggeration is enjoyed , the happy turns of phrase are caught up and remembered , the vivid pictures of actual events enrich the gallery of memory . But the preeminent importance of Mr. Carlyle has been his contribution to what in a much-quoted phrase , less happily applied by its original inventor , has been called the criticism of life . No one has in relation to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom and circumstance , to dispel the clouds of convention , to quicken and waken the soul of the reader , and to plant it face to face with the fact of the mystery , the gravity , the momentous importance of life . Thousands of young men , who are now no longer young , must remember how - it may be in the secular stillness of Oxford rooms environed by everything that could suggest merely learned and dreamy ease , it may be in the roar and bustle surrounding London lodgings where everything told of business and the desire for gain-this singular mentor came to them and with stentorian voice -harpocratic-stentorian , as Sterling would have said-suggested that neither in dilettantism nor in money-getting was the business of man . As to what was his business , Harpocrates succeeded Stentor and no word was vouchsafed . Carlylism , if such a term may be used , is a kind of religion , but it is one of those religions which have no confession or accepted symbol , and in which every adept is a law and a general council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this dead man is to be , found the widest and at first sight the wildest diversity of practical belief on every subject of interest to mankind . High Tories , believers in the orthodox creeds , enthusiastic defenders of art for art 's sake , find themselves side by side with democrats , // free-thinkers , persons who can not judge a work of literature or of art except according to its agreement or disagreement with their ideas on morals , on politics , on religion . All that is required of any one who acknowledges himself to be of the faith is that he should at any rate be thorough ; that he should not be afraid to follow his conclusions out to their last results ; that he should , so long as it seems to him that two and two make four , obstinately refuse to say that two and two make five , and that he should acknowledge no final standard or test but the deliberate answer of his own soul on the questions presented to it . Perhaps it may be said that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ) , " mostly fools , " no very large proportion can ever be got or expected to answer these conditions . it is at any rate something that an influence should have been working thus for many years in the direction of the whole , the good , and the true . They have said  --  and it is curious how often , in reference to Mr. Carlyle , the famous quotation ( they have said what say they let them say ) recurs to the memorythat he had no heart , that the dim , common populations awoke no sympathy in him ; that as he himself failed to discover in all Voltaire one really great thought , so in all his own was to be found no real feeling for the weakness and the suffering of his fellow-creatures . To Mr. Carlyle , there was nothing specially venerable in the people merely because they were the majority ; nothing specially venerable in his Cromwells and Fredericks because they were the minority . The rare touches-rare because it was not his special mission to utter them-of sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work , are worth libraries of plaintive gush over such things . " Few boast that they have found the whole , " said Empedocles . But this man did seek to find the whole , and sometimes might have boasted that he had found it ; yet he could find time to spare for regret and pity over what was not the whole , or anything like it . Let any one who will turn to the passage which treats of the failure of Braddock ,  --  surely , as we have him from the two master portrait-painters of England during the last half-century , no hero nor anything save a most lamentable failure of a hero . Yet the /ac/zrymce rerum have never been dropped more effectively in such a case : the sense of the fact that VOL XXIL-9. many are called , but few chosen , has never been more nobly translated into words . There are few besides Mr. Carlyle who have ever , in our days , succeeded in giving both sides of the question as he has done ,  - -  few who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noblest , while recognizing what seemed to them to be the nobler of the Cromwells and the Harrisons . It was left to others to insult Strafford , to others to belie the truth of history about Charles the First . He had no need of that hypothesis  --  the hypothesis that the adherents of a falling or fallen cause must necessarily be fools or knaves . And in this largeness of vision , which he shared with few of his contemporaries , is the secret of his abiding strength . Much , however , of the value of this influence , and much of the strange attraction attaching to the man and the work that exercised it , are necessarily things which , with altered social and intellectual conditions , will pass away . A generation which has not felt the difficulties and the temptations in the stress of which this voice crying in the wilderness was such a help and rallying cry to the men of its own time , will naturally think much of it mere unmeaning glamour , just as the generation upon which , almost before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this , however , we need not greatly trouble ourselves . The direct influence of Mr. Carlyle has been unspeakably important " for us , " as Sainte-Beuve remarked on a curiously different matter to Mr. Matthew Arnold , and it is hard to think that it can ever become wholly unimportant . But even if in the changes of things , this should happen , there would still be the massive literary value of Mr. Carlyle 's work to save his name and fame , and to carry both securely . From this point of view , that work may seem to be exposed to two drawbacks . Its bulk is very great , and much of it is the expression of vehement , passionate , and almost inarticulate feeling . Such work is almost always faulty and unequal , and it would be absurd to deny that faultiness and inequality characterize some parts of the complete work of Carlyle . There were times , notably in the days of the " Latter-day Pamphlets , " when he seemed to have got into the most perilous of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the case of the " Frederick , " when it seemed that even his gigantic grasp of detail and his unremitting labor would not suffice to enable him to // coordinate the enormous mass of matter with which he was surrounding and overwhelming himself . But there was always one point about his work which was pretty sure to save it . In the remarkably dignified and characteristic letter in which he refers to Jeffrey 's " rewr-itings and omissions , " he says that his work was usually deliberate work , which made him all the more reluctant to see light editorial alterations of it . There is little doubt that it was at all times deliberate . No hasty writer could have recovered the " French Revolution . " No hasty writer could have succeeded in bringing order out of the chaos of details digested into the " Cromwell " and the " Frederick . " It must be remembered that great as Mr. Carlyle 's productiveness was , his span of life and the prolonged apprenticeship of silence which he served gave him room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with . Between the thirty years of his comparatively silent youth and the fifteen years of his comparatively silent old age , forty were left , and forty years of such a life as he lived-a life undisturbed by bread-winning drudgery of the non-literary kind , and cut into by but little indulgence in society-give room for a great deal of work . Much of that work is hitherto uncollected , and some of the uncollected part , notably his letters , which , if they can be got together , will yield in interest to hardly any similar body of correspondence , well deserves collection . But no doubt the work on which he chose himself to set his seal is sufficient for his passport to the literary land of matters unforgot . Hardly any writer at any time has seen during his own life-days so many new forms of speech , invented by himself pass into the general dictionary of phrase : none in our time at least has displayed such varied power of prose writing in the most opposite styles and on the most widely differing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious and careful information , fresh and original style , earnest purpose , and , pervading the whole , a vein of the soundest common sense safeguarding the most audacious paradox and toning down the most eccentric metaphor , so eminently present . This , at least , all sound criticism must allow , though for the present , and perhaps not for the present only , sane criticism is disposed to allow very much more . The admirable image in which the leader of the younger generation of English men of letters has described Mr. Carlyle will always recur to some memories : " Storm-god of the northern foam , Strong , wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea And thunders hack its thunder rhyme for rhyme , Answering as though to outroar the tides of time . "
