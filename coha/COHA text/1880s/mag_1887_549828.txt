IT is not the purpose of this Article to review Prof. Huxley 's scientific theories . What specially concerns us is the subject of " Science and Culture , " or Education for Men of Science ,  --  that which gives the title to this collection of papers , and forms the subject of the first paper . The title of the book indicates the importance the author attaches to this and the three other educational essays with which the volume opens . Here is a theme on which it seems desirable a good deal more should be said than has been said , and something differ . ent from most of what has been said . This is not the first time Prof. Huxley has discussed the subject . In his " Lay Sermons , Addresses , and Reviews , " there are three or four essays devoted to the theme of education , and it is to be hoped that his persevering efforts to direct attention to the claims of the Natural Sciences to a place in educational curricula , high and low , have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been need enough , even though we might think there were reason to // make allowance , in some of his statements about English Schools and Universities , for the earnestness of the reformer . The immediate occasion of the address on Science and Culture was the opening of Sir Josiah Mason 's Science College at Birmingham . Sir Josiah Mason had been a poor boy , had made his life battle and his fortune , and , wishing to do something for those who , like him , would have to run the gauntlet of the world 's blows , he founded a college " to provide them with the means of obtaining sound , extensive , and practical scientific knowledge . " From this college party politics , theology , and " mere literary instruction and education ' 7 are by express terms excluded . This last exclusion , Prof. Huxley supposes , has reference " to the ordinary classical course of our schools and universities , " in other words , to Latin and Greek studies . rphe institution , we are told , " professes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility is suggested that , in view of this profession and that exclusion , " the Levites of Culture , " by which designation is intended the advocates of classical studies , may set up a sound of trumpets . This furrnshes the speaker an occasion to express his convictions on the subject of science education ; the relation of science to culture and the education of men of science . Two propositions are laid down . " The first is , that neither the discipline nor the subject matter of classical education is of such direct value to the student of physical science as to justify the expenditure of valuable time upon either . " This proposition is further explained in course of the address . " . . . . given ample time for learning and destination for ordinary life or for a literary career , I do not think that a young Englishman in search of culture can do better than follow the course usually marked out for him , supplementing its deficiencies by his own efforts . But for those who mean to make science their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Prof. Huxley is therefore glad to see a provision which shuts out of this institution " the ordinary smattering of Latin and Greek . " The second proposition laid down is " that for the purpose of attaining real culture , an exclusively scientific education is at least as effectual as an exclusively literary education . " Mr. // Huxley accepts Matthew Arnold 's view that a criticism of life is the essence of culture , but dissents from the proposition , as too narrow , that literature contains the materials which suffice for the construction of such a criticism . " Perfect culture should supply a complete theory of life , based upon a clear knowledge alike of its possibilities and of its limitations . " " Nevertheless , " he says , " I am the last person to question the importance of genuine literary education , or to suppose that intellectual culture can be complete without it . An exclusively scientific training will bring about a mental twist as surely as an exclusively literary training. ** But the literary element in a scientific course may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three greatest literatures of the modern world . " " If an Englishman can not get literary culture out of his Bible , his Shakespeare , his Milton , neither , in my belief , will the profoundest study of Homer and Sophocles , Virgil and Horace , give it to them . " This abstract of Prof. Huxley 's views is not given for the purpose of criticism but in order to bring them into light . No one holds a more commanding position among men of science , and no one is more entitled to say what he thinks , of the kind of education needful to one who is about to devote his life to scientific pursuits . From his utterances in " Science and Culture , " it appears that he regards an institution , like the Josiah Mason Science College , founded " to promote the prosperity of the manufacturers and the industry of the country , " as a properly speaking Scientific College , adequate , at least , to the purposes of scientific culture . " The picked intelligences among all classes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need fail to obtain " here and in the primary and other schools " not merely the instruction but the culture most appropriate to the conditions of his life . " Education then for the scientific man must in its foundations be an education in the English branches , to which may be added the French and German languages , after which comes introduction to the principles of science and to its special applications . The classical languages are excluded-time spent upon them is misspent . Of Philosophy nothing is said ; prob*iblv it was not deemed worth mentioning . this is the view taken by Prof. Huxley of // education for students of physical science , " those who mean to make science their serious occupation . " Discard the classics , probably also philosophy , acquaint yourself with the English branches , get French and German , and then plunge into science , or some special department of it , in a school which may and probably will have a range similar to that of Sir Josiah Mason s College . And this , be it said , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because he does not think these studies worth the time to the man who makes science his aim . In these views Professor Huxley stands as the representative of a class , a large one , an influential one . There is no question but that among the parents of the more cultivated families scattered through this country , among practical men , commercial men , manufacturers , lawyers , and others , many of them men of classical education ; there is a wide-spread impression , that scientific schools , based on the ideas of Professor Huxley , can furnish and do furnish , not only practical fitness for the industries of life , but an all-sufficient culture ; and that , . especially if the aim be science as the serious occupation of life , a technical school like the Josiah Mason Science College is adequate to fit a man for that serious occupation . Not only so , but , for some reason or other , these views have widely prevailed in the opening of so-called scientific departments in connection with the larger universities and smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study in them will abundantly show . And it is just this state of things which makes the late utterances of such a man as Professor Huxley important , and makes it worth while to discuss the question of education for men of science . The subject is one of too great moment to be left to the random drift of a popular current . One has only to look at the number of technical schools which are being established in various parts of the country , and the number of colleges and universities which are establishing , in one form or another , courses of so-called scientific instruction , alongside the regular classical courses and at the great number of students who are giving the preference to these technical schools and scientific courses , to appreciate , in some degree , the importance which attaches to // the methods adopted in them , and to the ideas which they give their students , not only of the material world , but of ciiiture in general and of themselves . It makes some difference how men are taught to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , it makes a great difference to them and the world what they actually are . The young men who are now being educated in the various scientific schools are going to take an important part not only in the acting of the next fifty years , but also in their thinking . And when we consider what weight the thinking of men of science has with the masses , and that their thinking is not likely to have less weight but rather more in the future , the kind of preparation they are getting for their future thinking can not be too carefully scanned . Moreover courses of scientific study are laid out in a large number of technical schools , colleges and universities with reference to growth and future needs . Some of these institutions are now doing very little in the way of special instruction in the sciences , but , if future growth meets anticipations , they will crc long be teaching . If mistakes have been made in mapping out work in these departments , they are not past correction . Add to this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the future , more munificent foundations than they have received in the past , and it becomes exceedingly desirable that correct ideas of the aims of such departments should be so widely diffused , as to prevent the loading of gifts with conditions , which may go a long way towards thwarting the highest purposes of education in science . Now , in order to a correct view of the elements which must enter into the education of the man who is to make science his life study , it is necessary , first to consider what constitutes science ; and second the purposes a man may have in studying it . These questions present no serious difficulties . Science is simply the knowledge of the phenomenal world and the laws which govern it . It properly includes the phenomena not only of matter but of mind . Both sets of phenomena are objects of observation and may be made objects of experiment . Both may be presumed to have laws . But more commonly the term science is distinctively applied to the phenomena of // matter and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , and the laws , ever more and more inclusive as we ascend , by which phenomena are determined constitute the proper object of scientific seeking . Observation , experiment is subordinated to this end . When we turn to the second question , the purpose a man may have in view in studying science , we find that accordino ' to that purpose science divides itself into theoretical and practical or science proper and applied science . What is the distinction ? It is very clear . True , both may be combined in one person but both will rarely be present in equal ( degree . The mind will tend predominantly to the one or the other . Science proper , pure science is Arnowledge . Knowledge of phenomena and their laws , without reference to the use of the knowledge for the material service of life . The ruling idea is that of knowing not of using . The object of observation , classification , the determination of thouo-ht rela experiment , is tions among phenomena ; the enlargement of the intellectual view . Material sciQuce as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to know . It is therefore sharply contrasted with applied science . The purpose of the man who makes applied science , practical science his study is to use principles , laws , facts for the material ends of life . He knows in order that he may apply . Knowing is not the end . Thought relations are valuable only as they subserve material interests . Enlarge . ment of intellectual view is sought somewhat as the hawk seeks a wide vision , that he may secure his prey . This use of science is legitimate ; it may be noble ; but the distinction is positive , radical . According to this distinction we obtain two classes of students of science whose aims are wide apart ; students of applied science or technical students and students of pure science or scientists . The object of the technical student is to acquire some art , to become master of an industry . The arts or industries which such students may wish to acquire are exceedingly varied and as varied are the amounts of scientific knowledge needful to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make shoes by hand needs very little science beyond what is // at every man s elbow . Beyond this he acquires hand skill and does good work . A young woman who wants to make good butter might find it desirable to know quite a number of chemical facts not commonly understood , especially if she were going to experiment in new methods ; but , ordinarily , the art , though a very nice one , can be acquired out of school . A young man who has considerable farming interests at stake , finds it desirable to know something of a good many things ; of chemistry , of botany , of zoology , of meteorology . He goes to a technical school , a school of agriculture . There he seeks such knowledge of these branches as specially applies to his calling , in botany a limited knowledge of grasses , in zoology a knowledge of insects injurious to crops , and so on . He pursues these subjects , not as sciences , bat as contributors to a branch of economy . Science is not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various lines of manufacture , in sugar refining , and even in mining . While all these , and all other technical students must have a certain foundation of scientific knowledge , it differs in extent and in kind from that of the student of pure science . The actual practice with such students in the most discriminating schools is different . After a comparatively short course of preliminary instruction , the technological student , of sugar manufacturing for instance , can advantageously be set at the practical processes which shall acquaint him with the nature , chemical relations , sources of sugar , and the mechanical means of producing it . So with the metallurgist and the miner . No one will contend that the object had in view by the student of applied science will not necessarily exercise a powerful influence , not only upon the range of his studies , but upon the spirit of them . This distinction may be extended much further than would at first be thought . There are geologists who can hardly aspire to rank among men of science . Their aims are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers in those fields with which they are familiar , having a practical knowledge of rocks and more rarely of fossils , of the order of strata , and of useful minerals . They work up details for others to systematize into science , but they can hardly claim the stature of scientific men . So a man might be a very fair observer in // meteorology or even in astronomy and yet be of too mechanical and practical a tendency to become a scientist . I have enlarged upon this point more than I should have done were it not that in this quarter lies the very starting point of error . Science is something different from and more than an art . Science , as such , is pursued for the sake of what it reveals . A student of science has a perfectly distinct aim ; he follows science for its own sake . Not that he is not conscious of its utility , but he does not stop to inquire after its uses . lie is ready to spend his life on the solution of questions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thought of . While he rejoices , equally with others , if material benefits are conferred on mankind , as a result of his work , he often makes it a point of honor not to receive the material benefit himself . His discoveries become the property of the world . Even if he makes practical use of his knowledge scientific truth is ever uppermost among his aims . I will not say , for I do not know , what may be the feel . ings with younger students , but that generation with which I had the pleasure of beginning my studies in these departments , is still represented by noble souls to whom pure science offers charms which no utilitarian views have diminished , and who , I believe , have steadily refused to feather their nests with the results of their investigations . They stand open-handed , generous , devoted to an ideal , and they have done noble work . The spirit which then prevailed did not fail to express itself with reprobation of those who , while they professed to be devotees of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits of their discoveries . And the example was set them by an older generation of great names . When Weber and Gauss , in G6ttingen , stretched a wire from the studio of one to that of the other , and sent telegraphic signals through it , they dropped the work then and there . Why ? Not because they did not care for the benefits men might reap from telegraphy , but because the work of science was done . The rest was a matter of mechanical detail . That was not their sphere . They turned to further searchings in the fields of pure science . These illustrations may serve to make the distinction clear . // It would not be surprising if the practical drift of the day were to cry out against this denial of the name of science to what is really art ; but only when the distinction is drawn are we prepared to see what kind of training the man of science needs . First and foremost I would lay it down as fundamental that be shall himself understand the distinction we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind between science and technology . Only so can he form for himself a proper ideal towards which he may work . Having obtained such an ideal , it will not be difficult for him to see that if he is to realize it , he must begin by securing a broad basis of general culture . If to know is his aim , the unceasing requirement of his very being , he will esteem it a great misfortune not to have obtained at the outset broad glimpses at least of the knowable . He will deprecate , as a blow struck at his ideal of a scientific man , all views of education which shut him out from fields of culture , the beauty and worth of which he never can really know , unless he is permitted to tread them . The demand for a broad and generous culture , as a foundation for his future , will rise immediately out of his perception of the ideal man of science . If now from this genel-al demand we pass to special requirements , we observe that science , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts , and reasoning upon facts . Observing , reasoning , this is the work for which men are to be trained , i. e. , for a large , accurate use of the senses , for a close application of mind . Here at once arises again the demand for great breadth of training-train ing of the whole man , training of the senses and reasoning powers . A quick eye , a delicate touch , a sensitive taste , a quick perception , close attention , a command of names to mark objects , of memory to retain , vivid imagination , well-developed discrimination of like and unlike , an inductive power including classification and generalization-these are the belongings of the man of science , besides command of useful languages , instruments to unlock the doors of knowledge , ancient and modern . Here is the general statement . A glance at the powers is sufficient to show that they are necessary and may be cultivated . He would be a great genius who should possess them all in rich measure , // but genius even , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may acquire these powers under skillful training , and it is the definite purpose of scientific education to develop them . The training of the senses comes by systematic every-day use in the fields , the woods , the waters , the laboratory , the collection at the investigator 's table . Perception , attention , discrimination of likeness and difference , memory , come of constant , prolonged contact with phenomena . The logical faculty , classification , generalization , languages come partly of books , guiding to use . Books must everywhere supplement observation and experiment . This is not the place for a detailed enumeration of special studies for the student of science , but in view of the present tendencies of this particular branch of education , a few things need to be insisted on with emphasis . And in the first place , if we have been at all successful in this review of the subject , the reader will find some ground for agreement with the proposition that a broad culture , the broadest possible culture , is fundamental to education for scientific pursuits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in which the man of science is to engage . In view of the commanding influence accorded to men of science , in view of the part they are to play , inevitably , in the future of this country , especially in the future of its thought , it is not only fitting , it is demanded , that they shall prepare themselves for that future by courses of study at least as broad , as refining and as stimulating as those which belong to any other calling . I do not know of a single argument used to exclude the usual college curriculum , with its Latin , and especially its Greek , from the preparation of men of science , which is is not equally applicable to the law , to medicine , and in good degree to theology and many departments of literature . It is manifest that the master minds in natural science must take in as broad a range of studies , modern and ancient , as the master minds in any other department . If it is true that the sources of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin and Greek writings , so do the sources of knowledge in natural science lie there , so far as they lie in books at all . All of value that was thought and done in the fundamentals of science // from the time of Thales down to the time of IRoger Bacon , in the thirteenth century , was thought and done in Latin and Greek-pretty much all of it . The boasted science of Arabia was Greek science translated . The Arabic served mainly as a channel through which Greek science and philosophy were poured into medieval Europe , and how impure the channel was the men of Europe saw when , in the thirteenth century , they began to get hold of the original Greek writings of Aristotle . From those original writings coming in contact with the fresh minds of Europe , sprung more than we have been wont to believe  --  the first signs of modern science . And if it be said that those classical writings are accessible now , in reliable translations to all students of science , so are they to all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student can be satisfied with even the best translations . It is not enough that we get substantially , at second hand , the facts and ideas of a people to which we turn for intellectual enlargement ; what we want is the genius of the nation . That genius is in its speech , and the genius of the Greek was a genius inquiring , imaginative , scientific . It was precisely the genius which we have seen must be exemplified in the modern man of science . It will naturally appear , from the presentation of the subject in this way , that the best preparation for a young man , who is going to pursue pure science in earnest , will be found in the regular college curriculum . Probably on the whole this is the best source from which to draw the initial elements of culture . The main objections to this course are two . In the first place it is claimed that scientific students have not time . To which the reply is natural that they have just as much time as any other students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into active life any earlier , their professional studies require no longer time for one who is well prepared to take hold of them , than do other professional studies . A large part of our present so.called scientific course is taken up with studies which ought to have been made before enterin0 the school of science . A second objection is more serious . The whole life of the college student is spent with books , and the habit of depending on observation , so necessary to the student of nature , is // thereby seriously interfered with . This is true . College life develops a tendency to bookishness . But the tendency can be easily corrected by proper management . Let the college student upon entering the school of science be put instanter , for a sufficiently long period , into immediate contact with things . Take books away from him , excepting his two or three refer . ence books , set him at work on minerals , fossils , plants or in the laboratory , and in six months , a year , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides a basis of facts upon which he can begin to read intelligently . Further than these two objections I know of none , except that the methods of college instruction are too unpractical , resulting , in case of the classical languages , for the most part in a mere " smattering of Latin and Greek* " There was probably more ground for this charge formerly than now ; but that there is still great need of change in the methods of instruction is probably true . This objection , however , which is the one most commonly urged , is really an objection based not on the relative importance of classical studies , but on the method of acquiring them . The objection applies to all classical training for whatever end , and the way for colleges to meet it is by seeking new and more practical methods , rather than encouraging courses of study in which the classics are left out . That in advocating a broader culture for men of science this paper expresses the feeling of our best and purest scientific minds , we may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a certain degree , attaches to the science departments in our colleges and universities , while they are obliged to admit that the low standard of culture demanded as preparation for scientific studies , gives an air of justice to the reproach . They are also feeling the defect in a practical way . Only lately , an instructor was lamenting , in my presence , the inability of his classes to command the nomenclature of science , and the utter confusion of their minds over such siniplc terms as aphelion , perihelion , apogee , perigee , and synodic revolutions. * If students are seriously embarrassed over words which have almost become English , what must become of them when they enter on the vast terminology of other * Thi8 is a leading school of science . // branches of science . And how keenly the lack of preparatory classical education is occasionally felt by men who have made good advances in scientific studies , is well illustrated by an intimate friend who , after having studied in a scientific school , and spent a long term in German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges . He was so keenly sensible of the defects in his early education that , with Spartan heroism , he actually went in with the undergraduates , and recited in their classes to make up a loss which he could not afford to suffer . His subsequent success has been such as might have been expected of his courageous self-humiliation . When we pass from the preparatory course into the science school itself the main studies naturally determine themselves . But there are two branches at present very generally neglected , and of such importance to the cultivated man of science as to demand special mention here . The first of these is the general history of science . To know what has been done , and how it has been done , in the various departments of science is a thing of vast importance , and a general but complete outline of such knowledge ought to be furnished . Nothing can be more healthful to the student of science than this . In this way alone can he learn not only as to his own department , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been developed and illustrated along with processes of discovery . Nothing offers better preparation for the work of a man of right ideals than this knowledge of the past ; the century-long , slow processes by which facts have been gathered , ideas have been classified , principles established , laws ascertained . Nothing too can be safer for the morale of the student . The tremendous cost of knowledge is set before him in this way as in no other . And when a young man sees the mistakes of great minds , the fleeting character of theories , the boldness with which speculations have been advanced and the thoroughness with which each subsequent generation reviews the work and the theories of the past , how ruthlessly the favorite dogmas of one generation are overhauled and pulled down by the next , he must be gifted with a large share of conceit who does not learn modesty and caution , and also learn how valuable are facts and how uncertain are // speculations which go beyond the facts . He will understand that all the work of this generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can not expect wholly to escape the general destiny ; nay , that much of that which is now made the Shibboleth of scientific rank may not pass muster under the keener gaze and deeper knowledge of succeeding generations . But he will also learn that wbatever may become of theories , whatever may become of his own name and fame , all the solid material he works out of nature 's quarry will go into the reconstructed science of the future . The second largely neglected branch of study in these schools is Philosophy . It is no extravagant ideal of a man of science which asserts the imnortance to his training of a sound philosophy . The man who makes a life study of nature will be a philosopher of some school . It is not like a man of high ideals to stop short when he reaches the border line between science and that philosophy which inquires into the deeper nature and source of all that is . The history of the sensible world immediately around us leads up to the history of the cosmos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , without being drawn into speculations , which lie beyond the determinations of physical sequences . The vast mysteries which lie back of phenomena possess a mighty attractiveness to all who love knowledge for its own sake . Besides this , the question of the origin of things is indissolubly connected with questions concerning the progress of things ; those vast processes of mighty change , and the hopes , the destinies of men . We can not shake off these questions . It is utterly vain to tell men to " leave hoping and fearing alone . " Man is too largely a creature of hopes and fears . These questions as to whence and how things came to be and why they came to be as they are , and whither they all and we all tend constitute , to a large majority of minds , the very fascination of science , though they lie beyond science in the realm of philosophy . It is to be observed , that it is over such questions as these , this age is most profoundly agitated , notwithstanding its utilitarianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to be observed , that the influence which certain men , especially of the English school of science , have exerted dur // ing the last twenty-five years over the public mind7 has been due largely to that philosophy with which they have transfused their science . Of that philosophy there is here no occasion to speak farther than to insist that it has shaped the thinking and popular power of leading men of science of this day , as the philosophy which such men adopt will always do . And their dealing with sCtch questions attracts the gaze of men , because though science and philosophy are distinct , they are yet so intimate , that men do not always discriminate be . tween them . Hence the hearing , almost credulous , given to men of science when they touch these themes . Hence it becomes a matter of vast importance , that the philosophy held by every man of science should be sound . In order that it may be so he must be instructed in the elements of philosophy and in the history of philosophic speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent understanding of such history , in its main outlines , would guard the minds of young men , against that power , which the supposed novelty of bold speculations often has over them . They would discern how little there is of originality and of novelty in the ever recurring forms of sceptic philosophy , and would be prepared to measure the conditions and limitations of true science . It is time for educators to look to this matter as they love the future of our country . A false philosophy is the suicide of thought , and instead of being born of science , as some imagine , it is the suicide of science . It is to be wished the time were not far off , when no corps of scientific instructors should be looked upon as complete without its special representatives of the History of Science and of Philosophy . It remains , in closing this essay , to revert once moie to the importance of the distinction drawn between the school of science and the school of technology . To the confounding of this distinction must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard of education for men of science . The large demand of the industrial arts for men specially edu. cated to them has led a great many youths to resort to schools where science is taught , in order to obtain such needful information as science affords to fit them for their special callings . Naturally enough they have been received , with only such // preparation as was deemed necessary for their immediate purposes . Once in such institutions , they have straightway imagined and called themselves scientific students . The schools have been called scientific schools . The greater portion of these students have gone into the arts . But now and then one originally intending to study only some branch of technology has become enamored of a special branch of science , and has made it his life work , perhaps has become a teacher in it . So it has come about that we have schools of science and of technology all in one-students of science and technology mingling together habitually classed together in all minds , and what is worse , sharing equally the honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a certain relatively low standard of preparation . Hence the wide spread impression that to be a man of science does not require that thorough culture and trained scholarship which is necessary to a corresponding rank in other departments . Then the evil is exaggerated and intensified by the conferring of science degrees on those who are really only entitled to certificates of proficiency in some branch of technology . There seems to be no good reason why such degrees as Bachelor of Philosophy and Bachelor of Science should be conferred upon those whose studies have been mainly directed to the mastery of some industry , while they are eminently appropriate to those who pursue science for its own sake . The custom of conferring such degrees has however become wide spread and contributes largely to the unfortunate confusion of ideas which prevails . The degrees have the sound of a culture which is not realized . And still more do the higher degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy which are perhaps reserved for those who have made a real proficiency in some branch of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numerous catalogues for information as to the conditions of these degrees , we are led to the conclusion that with one or two exceptions they as well as the lower ones may be secured by candidates who possess only a mere elementary knowledge of Latin , in whom the knowledge of Greek is either absolutely wanting or is reduced to what the chemist would call a mere trace , while Philosophy has been nearly or quite ex // eluded from the course of study and the History of Science in its broad range has been ignored . These things have been brought about by peculiarities of the situation no doubt , among which have been conspicuous the demand for practical education , the decrying of classical cub ture , the necessity of concessions on the part of institutions of learning to popular demands , and possibly , in some instances , the jealousy of the older classical departments towards the new scientific rivals , and a fear of their supposed sceptical tendencies leading to want of sympathy and encouragement in their efforts to maintain a high standard . However this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of degrees is the key to the situation , and that when schools of science refuse degrees which are significant of broad culture to all except those who have made due efforts to obtain it , the desire and demand for such culture will arise among the candidates themselves . And it will conduce to the same end if the distinction between technology and science is maintained throughout . False names mislead . A school of technology should not be called a school of science . That name should be reserved for those schools which though they may have a department of technology , make it their leading aim to cultivate pure science and to furnish opportunities for education in pure science . iNor should students of technology bear the name of scientific students , or receive a title which fosters the impression that the institution which sends them forth looks upon them as fully equipped scientific men . It would be better to enter the different classes of students in catalogues under their appropriate designations , as being , not of unequal honor , but of different destination . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an intensely utilitarian age to preserve the proper ideals of science . But whatever it may cost , the lovers of science should be encouraged , by every means , in their efforts to maintain those ideals .
