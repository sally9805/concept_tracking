txt Sultan MULEY HASSAN has contrived to occupy , in one way or another , his full share of the world 's attention during the last six or eight months . He has been the theme of many astonishing stories  --  some possibly a little apocryphal , but others requiring no embroidering upon their striking facts . First , having defeated the tribes around Tedla and . suppressed the rebellion in the mountains of the north , he was said to have cut off a hundred heads of prisoners and sent them to be publicly exhibited , after the manner of some of his ancestors . His next alleged appearance was in the role of a moralist , uniting the zeal of a Neal Dow and a King James I. by issuing stringent edicts against ardent spirits and tobacco . This last , move , hardly expected from the Mohammedan ruler , the Sultan is said . to have made particularly sensational by having some of his hapless subjects publicly whipped for indulging in smoking . The next exciting report was that he had . discovered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of $475,000 , - 000 , which he had confiscated for the imperial coffers . Presently came news that the monarch was dead , the victim of poison in a harem intrigue , and . that his son , a lad of 16 , had taken the oath of office on his father 's corpse and . appointed a favorite uncle as his Grand Vizier . Six days later it was announced that AIULEY HASSAN was better and taking horseback exercise . Then it was narrated that a revolt in his Majesty 's harem had been punished by distributing forty of its turbulent inmates to the officers of his guard , while the grimly- , humorous ruler was further said to have introduced the bicycle as a species of punishment into the same institution  --  perhaps upon the principle of breaking a butterfly on the wheel . These were not the only peculiar performances attributed to this eccentric monarch . He gravely sent an Ambassador - to Rome to congratulate the Pope on his jubilee . He promptly disarmed the complaints of France by paying an indemnity of $20,000 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent two of his Ministers to Berlin to study its military methods , and . had Germany , France , Italy , Spain , and England balanced against each other , suspecting each other of a disposition to encroach on his domains . His latest sensational performance has been with our own country ; and it is not wholly . impossible that he may have been glad to make this diversion of public attention , after having noted . the premature eagerness with which the various Mediterranean countries and also England and Germany had assembled their war ships at Tangier in expectation of his demise . There is not much reason , however , thus far , to look for any other than a peaceful solution of the difficulty arising between Consul W. R. LEWIS and . the Sultan 's Government ' ? It seems probable that the Moorish officials committed an outrage in seizing the American protOgt3 at Rabat , throwing him into prison , and declaring his property forfeited . It was wise that the Enterprise should have been sent to Tangier to inquire into the affair and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have undoubtedly been abuses in past years of our so-called protection system in Morocco , andprejudice has thereby been excited against it . Talk of bombarding Tangier seems preposterous as things now are , since there is no reason to suppose that the present trouble can not be arranged through the friendly offices of the representatives of other Governments . Morocco , - with its atrocious and despotic customs , its lack of progress and developments , is one of the most extraordinary relics of barbarism left in close proximity to the civilized nations of Europe , and it is probably only a question of a short time when intervention of some sort will make a great change in that empire . But , meanwhile , we have only a very limited concern with it . Very few American residents are to be found . there . Our commerce with Morocco is absolutely insignificant , and it is only strange how much trouble , chiefly through the errors of Consul LEWIS 'S predecessor , we have managed . for the past year or two to get up with a country of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
