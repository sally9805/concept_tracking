txt Ex-Senators Roscoe Conkling and Thomas C. Platt were little annoyed by visitors yesterday in the Fifth-Avenue Hotel apartments . Both of these gentlemen went about their private business much after the manner of other men and attracted no especial attention . These who spoke of having conversed with the senior ex - Senator said that his visit to NewYork on this occasion had no political significance  --  that he came here to look after the private interests of himself and certain clients . Those who claimed to be in the confidence of ex-Senator Platt said that some of the numerous enterprises in which he is engaged sorely needed his personal attention . It was not urged in behalf of either of the ex-Senators that they were in a cheerful frame of mind . A week ago , when Vice-President Arthur , ex-Senators Conkling and Platt , Police Commissioner French , and Mr. Arthur B. Johnson were in this City together , they were full of hope and confidence . On that occasion they were enthusiastically of the opinion that victory for the Stalwarts was assured . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13 half-breeds who are ready to go over to him referring to Mr. Conkling whenever their votes will elect him , and we have only to secure six more votes to make our success assured . I believe that we will get these votes during the coming week , and if we do you will see a stampede for Conkling which will astonish you . " From this and other utterances made at that time by those who had the entr  --  e of " headquarters , " the impression was created that the Stalwarts were then engaged in the preparation of a bombshell to be thrown into the camp of the half-breeds . It was also a common remark among the Stalwarts , " Wait a few days , and you will ho astonished . " Other followers of Mr. Conkling 's fortunes sought to bolster up their courage by saying : " There is something yet to come . Conkling is no chicken ; he has something in reserve for the halfbreeds . " So that when Assemblyman Bradley made his serious allegation against Senator Sessions the half-breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the smoke died away there were none dead upon the field and only one haltbreed wounded . His comrades were strongly of the opinion last night , however , that he would recover and be stronger than before . The reporter was informed on good authority that Mr. Conkling had expressed much surprise at the manner in which the newspapers of the State have treated the Bradley explosion , and was also astonished that Mr. Depew is still a candidate leading all the others . The senior ex-Senator , while in a thoughtful mood , was asked his opinion of the situation , whether this Legislature would elect Senators at all , and his reply is said to have been that he did not believe his successor would be elected by this Legislature . He expressed the conviction , it was also said , that an adjournment of the Legislature was in order , and that the question of his claim to be returned to the United States Senate should go before the people in the election of members of the Legislature this Fall . If ex-Senator Platt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Con kiing , and thinks that Assemblyman Bradley 's charge against Senator Sessions is a big card in the hands of the Stalwarts , and should be played for all it is worth . These friends say that ever since the trouble over holding a caucus was begun ex-Senators Conkling and Platt , Vice-President Arthur , Silas B. Dutcher , and others at " head-quarters , " ( as Assemblyman Bradley designated Gen. Arthur 's room , when asked where he went with the $2,000 which he says Senator Sessions gave him , ) were on the scent for some such outbreak as that made by the Assemblyman from Cattaraugus . Mr. Platt has resolved , so his friends say , to continue the fight on this line if it takes until the appearance of the December snow-storm , and makes the astonishing statement that the Stalwarts have the names of a dozen other members of the Legislature who are to be attacked in the same way that Senator Sessions was set upon . And further , that Mr. Platt is confident that the result will be to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen made no secret of the fact that they intend to return to Albany tomorrow . Senator Birdsall , who was at the FifthAvenue Hotel last night , said that the halfbreeds were determined to get at the bottom facts of the Bradley matter , and intimated that they were now in possession of information that would clearly show that the attack upon Senator Sessions was the outgrowth of a conspiracy upon the part of the Stalwarts . He was satisfied that Mr. Depew would gain votes day by day , and that before the end of this week he might have sufficient votes to elect him .. He anticipated little delay in the election of a Senator to succeed Mr. Conkling after Mr. Platt was disposed of . It was referred to as a remarkable change of opinion upon the part of Mr. I'latt that a week ago , when told that ex-President Grant would go to Albany to engage in the Senatorial contest in favor of Messrs . Conkling and Platt , that he ( Mr. Platt ) thought it was a good idea upon the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-President would not go to Albany , Mr. Platt thought it was also a good idea upon the part of the exPresident , as that gentleman 's appearance in Albany might injure rather than enhance the prospects of Messrs . Colliding and Platt .
