txt COPYRIGHT AND " OTHERS . " We quite agree with Mr. PUTNAM , the Secretary of the American Publishers ' Copyright League , that the petition against the bill for international copyright now pending in the House which has been put in circulation by a firm of lawyers in this city needs explanation . The only.explanation given by the lawyers who are circu- ' lating it is that they are acting in the interest of " newsdealer% booksellers , and others . " As they do not furnish the name of a single one of their clients , and as Mr. PUTNAM shows that it is to the interest of booksellers that the bill should be enacted , the inference is that the lawyers are acting exclusively for " others , " and that the interest of " others " is such as they do not care publicly to avow . The fact is that the bill for international copyright as it stands represents the wishes and interests of everybody who has a legitimate interest in the production and distribution of books in this country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on this account it has come nearer to enactment than any bill for the same purpose has come before , and nearer , there is every reason to believe , than it would have come had it not been so modified and injured . It is a pity that a great nation should not be able to do an act of justice to a certain class of workmen , American and foreign , by securing them the right to dispose of their work for what it would bring without consulting all manner of extraneous persons and " interests . " Nevertheless , the authors are satisfied that the bill is considerably better than nothing . The publishers are also satisfied that their business will be more secure and more profitable under the proposed arrangement than under the existing derangement , and . this , of course , means that the profits of the authors , which depend u-pon the profits of the publishers , will be increased . Even the printers and eleetrotypers and pressmen have been consulted and have assented to the bill . Who , then , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be borne in mind that publishers are also booksellers , and are the largest booksellers . Some ' of them deal exclusively in their own publications , but a larger number keep for sale works published by other persons . As to these works the interest of a publisher is precisely the same as that of any other bookseller , and his judgment is that of an expert in the book trade . The truth is that the chaos that has prevailed in the book trade since the market has been flooded with cheap and illegible reprints of foreign copyright books has so injured , the business of bookselling A 's almost to have extinguished it . Whereas twenty years ago every town of a few thousand inhabitants had one dr more booksellers , it is only in large cities that bookstores any longer exist . This means that the practice of buying good books in a legible and permanent form has diminished . There is no practice that more distinctly and powerfully makes for intellectual culture , that is to say , for civilization , for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place can not possibly be taken by the issue of books in a form that plainly indicates that they are to be read once and then thrown away like a newspaper . When publishers have the security they now lack , that in bringing out a book in decent form they will not be undersold the next week by a - reissue in an indecent form , they will go to the additional expense required for a book intended to be kept . The result will bo the extension of the excellent practice Of collecting books and the revival of the trade of bookselling , which is , now almost extinct . Mt Lowstruck the keynote of the whole discussion in saying that a book that was honestly come by was more desirable than a cheap book , but it is not only the satisfaction of not having stolen goods in his - possession that the American book buyer would feel under an international copyright , , but also the satisfaction of knowing that in a material sense he had , as Mr. PUTNAM expresses it . " better value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that copyright would introduce into this country the absurdly costly- editions of current fiction that are issued in England . The conditions of the American book market are fixed . They are , of course , better understood by American publishers than by anybody else . They require that a book should be issued in the cheapest form that is consistent with legibility and . durability . Nobody ought to wish , and no real lover of books does wish that a book should be cheaper than that , and the talk about " making knowledge dear , " whether it is uttered in Congress or elsewhere , ' is insincere when it is not ignorant . Mr. PUTNAM suggests that the arguments of the " booksellers , newsdealers , and others " lead to the same conclusion of the undesirableness of the present bill that has been reached by the London Chamber of Commerce , which last week sent a deputation to Sir MICHAEL HICKS BEACH to explain that its passage would injure the British book trade . Whether " others " are British manufacturers who wish to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be gone if they were compelled to buy the goods of the foreign author before reselling them , Mr. PUTNAM makes it clear that there is nothing in their remonstrance that should affect the mind of any member of Congress .
