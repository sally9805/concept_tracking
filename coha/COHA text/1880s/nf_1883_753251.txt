PART I. The Drift CHAPTER I. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DRIFT . READER ,  --  Let us reason together :  --  What do we dwell on ? The earth . What part of the earth ? The latest formations , of course . We live upon the top of a mighty series of stratified rocks , laid down in the water of ancient seas and lakes , during incalculable ages , said , by geologists , to be from ten to twenty miles in thickness . Think of that ! Rock piled over rock , from the primeval granite upward , to a height four times greater than our highest mountains , and every rock stratified like the leaves of a book ; and every leaf containing the records of an intensely interesting history , illustrated with engravings , in the shape of fossils , of all forms of life , from the primordial cell up to the bones of man and his implements . But it is not with the pages of this sublime volume p. 2 we have to deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally wonderful formation . Upon the top of the last of this series of stratified rocks we find THE DRIFT . What is it ? Go out with me where yonder men are digging a well . Let us observe the material they are casting out . First they penetrate through a few inches or a foot or two of surface soil ; then they enter a vast deposit of sand , gravel , and clay . It may be fifty , one hundred , five hundred , eight hundred feet , before they reach the stratified rocks on which this drift rests . It covers whole continents . It is our earth . It makes the basis of our soils ; our railroads cut their way through it ; our carriages drive over it ; our cities are built upon it ; our crops are derived from it ; the water we drink percolates through it ; on it we live , love , marry , raise children , think , dream , and die ; and in the bosom of it we will be buried . Where did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you in this work ,  --  if you will have the patience to follow me . So far as possible , as I shall in all cases speak by the voices of others I shall summon my witnesses that you may cross-examine them . I shall try , to the best of my ability , to buttress every opinion with adequate proofs . If I do not convince , I hope at least to interest you . And to begin : let us understand what the Drift is , before we proceed to discuss its origin . In the first place , it is mainly unstratified ; its lower formation is altogether so . There may be clearly defined strata here and there in it , but they are such as a tempest might make , working in a dust-heap : picking up a patch here and laying it upon another there . But there p. 3 are no continuous layers reaching over any large extent of country . Sometimes the material has been subsequently worked over by rivers , and been distributed over limited areas in strata , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower , older , and first-laid-down portion of the Drift , called in Scotland " the till , " and in other countries " the hard-pan , " there is a total absence of stratification . James Geikie says : " In describing the till , I remarked that the irregular manner in which the stones were scattered through that deposit imparted to it a confused and tumultuous appearance . The clay does not arrange itself in layers or beds , but is distinctly unstratified. " 1 " The material consisted of earth , gravel , and stones , and also in some places broken trunks or branches of trees . Part of it was deposited in a pell-mell or unstratified condition during the progress of the period , and part either stratified or unstratified in the opening part of the next period when the ice melted. " 2 " The unstratified drift may be described as a heterogeneous mass of clay , with sand and gravel in varying proportions , inclosing the transported fragments of rock , of all dimensions , partially rounded or worn into wedge-shaped forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material looking as if it had been scraped together . " 3 The " till " of Scotland is " spread in broad but somewhat ragged sheets " through the Lowlands , " continuous across wide tracts , " while in the Highland and upland districts it is confined principally to the valleys. 4 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 21. 2 . Dana 's " Text-Book , " p. 220. 3 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. vi , p. 111. 4 . " Great Ice Age , " Geikie , p. 6. p. 4 " The lowest member is invariably a tough , stony clay , called ' till ' or ' hard-pan . ' Throughout wide districts stony clay alone occurs . " 1 " It is hard to say whether the till consists more of stones or of clay . " 2 This " till , " this first deposit , will be found to be the strangest and most interesting . In the second place , although the Drift is found on the earth , it is unfossiliferous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-existent or contemporaneous life . This , when we consider it , is an extraordinary fact : Where on the face of this life-marked earth could such a mass of material be gathered up , and not contain any evidences of life ? It is as if one were to say that he had collected the detritus of a great city , and that it showed no marks of man 's life or works . " I would reiterate , " says Geikie , 3 " that nearly all the Scotch shell-bearing beds belong to the very close of the glacial period ; only in one or two places have shells ever been obtained , with certainty , from a bed in the true till of Scotland . They occur here and there in bowlder-clay , and underneath bowlder-clay , in maritime districts ; but this clay , as I have shown , is more recent than the till  --  fact , rests upon its eroded surface . " " The lower bed of the drift is entirely destitute of organic remains . " 4 Sir Charles Lyell tells us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever may be the cause , the fact is certain that over large areas in Scotland , Ireland , and Wales , I might add throughout the northern hemisphere , on both sides of the Atlantic , the stratified drift of the glacial period is very commonly devoid of fossils . " 5 1 . " Great Ice Age , " Geikie , p. 7. 2 . Ibid. , p. 9. 3 . Ibid. , p. 342. 4 . Rev. O. Fisher , quoted in " The World before the Deluge , " p. 461. 5 . " Antiquity of Man , " third edition , p. 268. p. 5 In the next place , this " till " differs from the rest of the Drift in its exceeding hardness : " This till is so tough that engineers would much rather excavate the most obdurate rocks than attempt to remove it from their path . Hard rocks are more or less easily assailable with gunpowder , and the numerous joints and fissures by which they are traversed enable the workmen to wedge them out often in considerable lumps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blast , and to pick it to pieces is a very slow and laborious process . Should streaks of sand penetrate it , water will readily soak through , and large masses will then run or collapse , as soon as an opening is made into it . " ### TILL OVERLAID WITH BOWLDER-CLAY , RIVER STINCHAR. r , Rock ; t , Till ; g , Bowlder-Clay ; x , Fine Gravel , etc . The accompanying cut shows the manner in which it is distributed , and its relations to the other deposits of the Drift . In this " till " or " hard-pan " are found some strange and characteristic stones . They are bowlders , not water-worn , not rounded , as by the action of waves , and yet not angular  --  for every point and projection has been ground off . They are not very large , and they differ in this and other respects from the bowlders found in the other portions of the Drift . These stones in the " till " are always striated  --  that is , cut by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to their longest diameter . The cut on the following page represents one of them . p. 6 Above this clay is a deposit resembling it , and yet differing from it , called the " bowlder-clay . " This is not so tough or hard . The bowlders in it are larger and more angular-sometimes they are of immense size ; one at ### SCRATCHED STONE ( BLACK SHALE ) , FROM THE TILL . Bradford , Massachusetts , is estimated to weigh 4,500,000 pounds . Many on Cape Cod are twenty feet in diameter . One at Whitingham , Vermont , is forty-three feet long by thirty feet high , or 40,000 cubic feet in bulk . In some p. 7 cases no rocks of the same material are found within two hundred miles. 1 These two formations  --  the " till " and the " bowlder-clay "  --  sometimes pass into each other by insensible degrees . At other times the distinction is marked . Some of the stones in the bowlder-clay are furrowed or striated , but a large part of them are not ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rare exception . Above this bowlder-clay we find sometimes beds of loose gravel , sand , and stones , mixed with the remains of man and other animals . These have all the appearance of being later in their deposition , and of having been worked over by the action of water and ice . This , then , is , briefly stated , the condition of the Drift . It is plain that it was the result of violent action of some kind . And this action must have taken place upon an unparalleled and continental scale . One writer describes it as , " A remarkable and stupendous period  --  a period so startling that it might justly be accepted with hesitation , were not the conception unavoidable before a series of facts as extraordinary as itself . " 2 Remember , then , in the discussions which follow , that if the theories advanced are gigantic , the facts they seek to explain are not less so . We are not dealing with little things . The phenomena are continental , world-wide , globe-embracing. 1 . Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ice Age , " " Popular Science Monthly , " January , 1878 . CHAPTER II . THE ORIGIN OF THE DRIFT NOT KNOWN . WHILE several different origins have been assigned for the phenomena known as " the Drift , " and while one or two of these have been widely accepted and taught in our schools as established truths , yet it is not too much to say that no one of them meets all the requirements of the case , or is assented to by the profoundest thinkers of our day . Says one authority : " The origin of the unstratified drift is a question which has been much controverted. " 1 Louis Figuier says , 2 after considering one of the proposed theories : " No such hypothesis is sufficient to explain either the cataclysms or the glacial phenomena ; and we need not hesitate to confess our ignorance of this strange , this mysterious episode in the history of our globe . . . . Nevertheless , we repeat , no explanation presents itself which can be considered conclusive ; and in science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . " Geikie says : " Many geologists can not yet be persuaded that till has ever formed and accumulated under ice . " 3 A recent scientific writer , after summing up all the facts and all the arguments , makes this confession : 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. vi , p. 112. 2 . " The World before the Deluge , " pp. 435 , 463. 3 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 370. p. 9 From the foregoing facts , it seems to me that we are justified in concluding : " 1 . That however simple and plausible the Lyellian hypothesis may be , or however ingenious the extension or application of it suggested by Dana , it is not sustained by any proof , and the testimony of the rocks seems to be decidedly against it . " 2 . Though much may yet be learned from a more extended and careful study of the glacial phenomena of all parts of both hemispheres , the facts already gathered seem to be incompatible with any theory yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telluric phenomena , and so far strengthens the arguments of those who look to extraneous and cosmical causes for the origin of these phenomena . " 1 The reader will therefore understand that , in advancing into this argument , he is not invading a realm where Science has already set up her walls and bounds and landmarks ; but rather he is entering a forum in which a great debate still goes on , amid the clamor of many tongues . There are four theories by which it has been attempted to explain the Drift . These are : I. The action of great waves and floods of water . II . The action of icebergs . III . The action of glaciers . IV . The action of a continental ice-sheet . We will consider these several theories in their order . 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " July , 1876 , p. 290. p. 10 CHAPTER III . THE ACTION OF WAVES . WHEN men began , for the first time , to study the drift deposits , they believed that they found in them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called the Diluvium , and the period of time in which it was laid down was entitled the Diluvial age . It was supposed that  --  " Somehow and somewhere in the far north a series of gigantic waves was mysteriously propagated . These waves were supposed to have precipitated themselves upon the land , and then swept madly over mountain and valley alike , carrying along with them a mighty burden of rocks and stones and rubbish . Such deluges were called ' waves of translation . ' " 1 There were many difficulties about this theory : In the first place , there was no cause assigned for these waves , which must have been great enough to have swept over the tops of high mountains , for the evidences of the Drift age are found three thousand feet above the Baltic , four thousand feet high in the Grampians of Scotland , and six thousand feet high in New England . In the next place , if this deposit had been swept up from or by the sea , it would contain marks of its origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remains of seals and whales , would have been taken up by these great deluges , and carried over the land , and have remained 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 26. p. 11 mingled in the d ? bris which they deposited . This is not the case . The unstratified Drift is unfossiliferous , and where the stratified Drift contains fossils they are the remains of land animals , except in a few low-lying districts near the sea . I quote : " Over the interior of the continent it contains no marine fossils or relics . " 1 Geikie says : " Not a single trace of any marine organism has yet been detected in true till . " 2 Moreover , if the sea-waves made these great deposits , they must have picked up the material composing them either from the shores of the sea or the beds of streams . And when we consider the vastness of the drift-deposits , extending , as they do , over continents , with a depth of hundreds of feet , it would puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe that could produce such inconceivable quantities of gravel , sand , and clay . The production of gravel is limited to a small marge of the ocean , not usually more than a mile wide , where the waves and the rocks meet . If we suppose the whole shore of the oceans around the northern half of America to be piled up with gravel five hundred feet thick , it would go but a little way to form the immense deposits which stretch from the Arctic Sea to Patagonia . The stones of the " till " are strangely marked , striated , and scratched , with lines parallel to the longest diameter . No such stones are found in river-beds or on sea-shores . Geikie says : " We look in vain for striated stones in the gravel which the surf drives backward and forward on a beach , 1 . Dana 's " Text-Book , " p. 220. 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 15. p. 12 and we may search the detritus that beaches and rivers push along their beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the till . " 1 But we need not discuss any further this theory . It is now almost universally abandoned . We know of no way in which such waves could be formed ; if they were formed , they could not find the material to carry over the land ; if they did find it , it would not have the markings which are found in the Drift , and it would possess marine fossils not found in the Drift ; and the waves would not and could not scratch and groove the rock-surfaces underneath the Drift , as we know they are scratched and grooved . Let us then dismiss this hypothesis , and proceed to the consideration of the next . 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 69. p. 13 CHAPTER IV . WAS IT CAUSED BY ICEBERGS ? WE come now to a much more reasonable hypothesis , and one not without numerous advocates even to this day , to wit : that the drift-deposits were caused by icebergs floating down in deep water over the sunken land , loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shed as they melted in the warmer seas of the south . This hypothesis explains the carriage of enormous blocks weighing hundreds of tons from their original site to where they are now found ; but it is open to many unanswerable objections . In the first place , if the Drift had been deposited under water deep enough to float icebergs , it would present throughout unquestionable evidences of stratification , for the reason that the larger masses of stone would fall more rapidly than the smaller , and would be found at the bottom of the deposit . If , for instance , you were to go to the top of a shot-tower , filled with water , and let loose at the same moment a quantity of cannon-balls , musket-balls , pistol-balls , duck-shot , reed-bird shot , and fine sand , all mixed together , the cannon-balls would reach the bottom first , and the other missiles in the order of their size ; and the deposit at the bottom would be found to be regularly stratified , with the sand and the finest shot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Drift , especially in the " till " ; clay , sand , gravel , stones , p. 14 and bowlders are all found mixed together in the utmost confusion , " higgledy-piggledy , pell-mell . " Says Geikie : " Neither can till owe its origin to icebergs . If it had been distributed over the sea-bottom , it would assuredly have shown some kind of arrangement . When an iceberg drops its rubbish , it stands to reason that the heavier blocks will reach the bottom first , then the smaller stones , and lastly the finer ingredients . There is no such assortment visible , however , in the normal ' till , ' but large and small stones are scattered pretty equally through the clay , which , moreover , is quite unstratified. " 1 This fact alone disposes of the iceberg theory as an explanation of the Drift . Again : whenever deposits are dropped in the sea , they fall uniformly and cover the surface below with a regular sheet , conforming to the inequalities of the ground , no thicker in one place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . The deposit is thicker in the valleys and thinner on the hills , sometimes absent altogether on the higher elevations . " The true bowlder-clay is spread out over the region under consideration as a somewhat widely extended and uniform sheet , yet it may be said to fill up all small valleys and depressions , and to be thin or absent on ridges or rising grounds . " 2 That is to say , it fell as a snow-storm falls , driven by high winds ; or as a semi-fluid mass might be supposed to fall , draining down from the elevations and filling up the hollows . Again : the same difficulty presents itself which we found in the case of " the waves of transplantation . " Where did the material of the Drift come from ? On what sea-shore , in what river-beds , was this incalculable mass of clay , gravel , and stones found ? 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 72. 2 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. vi , p. 112. p. 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Arctic coasts , the question comes , Would the icebergs have carried it over the face of the continents ? Mr. Croll has shown very clearly1 that the icebergs nowadays usually sail down into the oceans without a scrap of d ? bris of any kind upon them . Again : how could the icebergs have made the continuous scratchings or stri ? , found under the Drift nearly all over the continents of Europe and America ? Why , say the advocates of this theory , the icebergs press upon the bottom of the sea , and with the stones adhering to their base they make those stri ? . But two things are necessary to this : First , that there should be a force great enough to drive the berg over the bottom of the sea when it has once grounded . We know of no such force . On the contrary , we do know that wherever a berg grounds it stays until it rocks itself to pieces or melts away . But , suppose there was such a propelling force , then it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would cease to make the strive , and would resume them only when it nearly stranded again . That is to say , when the water was deep enough for the berg to float clear of the bottom of the sea , there could be no stri ? ; when the water was too shallow , the berg would not float at all , and there would be no stri ? . The berg would mark the rocks only where it neither floated clear nor stranded . Hence we would find stri ? only at a certain elevation , while the rocks below or above that level would be free from them . But this is not the case with the drift-markings . They pass over mountains and down into the deepest valleys ; they are 1 . " Climate and Time , " p. 282. p. 16 universal within very large areas ; they cover the face of continents and disappear under the waves of the sea . It is simply impossible that the Drift was caused by icebergs . I repeat , when they floated clear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the water was too shallow to permit them to float at all , and so move onward , of course they could not mark them . The striations would occur only when the water was ; just deep enough to float the berg , and not deep enough to raise the berg clear of the rocks ; and but a small part of the bottom of the sea could fulfill these conditions . Moreover , when the waters were six thousand feet deep in New England , and four thousand feet deep in Scotland , and over the tops of the Rocky Mountains , where was the rest of the world , and the life it contained ? p. 17 CHAPTER V. WAS IT CAUSED BY GLACIERS ? WHAT is a glacier ? It is a river of ice , crowded by the weight of mountain-ice down into some valley , along which it descends by a slow , almost imperceptible motion , due to a power of the ice , under the force of gravity , to rearrange its molecules . It is fed by the mountains and melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comparatively few in number ; they are confined to valleys having some general slope downward . The whole Alpine mass does not move down upon the plain . The movement downward is limited to these glacier-rivers . The glacier complies with some of the conditions of the problem . We can suppose it capable of taking in its giant paw a mass of rock , and using it as a graver to carve deep grooves in the rock below it ; and we can see in it a great agency for breaking up rocks and carrying the detritus down upon the plains . But here the resemblance ends . That high authority upon this subject , James Geikie , says : " But we can not fail to remark that , although scratched and polished stones occur not infrequently in the frontal moraines of Alpine glaciers , yet at the same time these moraines do not at all resemble till . The moraine consists for the most part of a confused heap of rough angular stones and blocks , and loose sand and d ? bris ; scratched p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close search will often fail to show them . Clearly , then , the till is not of the nature of a terminal moraine . Each stone in the ' till ' gives evidence of having been subjected to a grinding process . . . . " We look in vain , however , among the glaciers of the Alps for such a deposit . The scratched stones we may occasionally find , but where is the clay ? . . . It is clear that the conditions for the gathering of a stony clay like the I till ' do not obtain ( as far as we know ) among the Alpine glaciers . There is too much water circulating below the ice there to allow any considerable thickness of such a deposit to accumulate . " 1 But it is questionable whether the glaciers do press with a steady force upon the rocks beneath so as to score them . As a rule , the base of the glacier is full of water ; rivers flow from under them . The opposite picture , from Professor Winchell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not represent a mass of ice , bugging the rocks , holding in its grasp great gravers of stone with which to cut the face of the rocks into deep grooves , and to deposit an even coating of rounded stones and clay over the face of the earth . On the contrary , here are only angular masses of rock , and a stream which would certainly wash away any clay which might be formed . Let Mr. Dawkins state the case : " The hypothesis upon which the southern extension is founded  --  that the bowlder-clays have been formed by ice melting on the land  --  is open to this objection , that no similar clays have been proved to have been so formed , either in the Arctic regions , where the ice-sheet has retreated , or in the districts forsaken by the glaciers in the Alps or Pyrenees , or in any other mountain-chain . . . . The English bowlder-clays , as a whole , differ from 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " pp. 70-72. p. 19 the moraine profonde in their softness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bowlder-clay at all comparable to the great clay mantle covering the lower grounds of Britain , north of the Thames , are conspicuous by their absence from the glaciated regions of Central Europe and the Pyrenees , which were not depressed beneath the sea . " ### A RIVER ISSUING FROM A SWISS GLACIER . Moreover , the Drift , especially the " till , " lies in great continental sheets of clay and gravel , of comparatively uniform thickness . The glaciers could not form such sheets ; they deposit their material in long ridges called " terminal moraines . " Agassiz , the great advocate of the ice-origin of the Drift , says : " All these moraines are the land-marks , so to speak , by which we trace the height and extent , as well as the 1 . Dawkin 's " Early Man in Britain , " pp. 116 , 117. p. 20 progress and retreat , of glaciers in former times . Suppose , for instance , that a glacier were to disappear entirely . For ages it has been a gigantic ice-raft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled onward , and bearing them along with it ; while the hard particles of rocks set in its lower surface have been polishing and fashioning the whole surface over which it extended . As it now melts it drops its various burdens to the ground ; bowlders are the milestones marking the different stages of its journey ; the terminal and lateral moraines are the frame-work which it erected around itself as it moved forward , and which define its boundaries centuries after it has vanished . " 1 ### TERMINAL MORAINE . And Professor Agassiz gives us , on page 307 of the same work , the above representation of a " terminal moraine . " The reader can see at once that these semicircular 1 . " Geological Sketches , " p. 308. p. 21 ridges bear no resemblance whatever to the great drift-deposits of the world , spread out in vast and nearly uniform sheets , without stratification , over hills and plains alike . And here is another perplexity : It might naturally be supposed that the smoothed , scratched , and smashed appearance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stones under the ice of the glaciers ; but , strange to say , we find that  --  " The scratched and polished rock-surfaces are by no means confined to till-covered districts . They are met with everywhere and at all levels throughout the country , from the sea-coast up to near the tops of some of our higher mountains . The lower hill-ranges , such as the Sidlaws , the Ochils , the Pentlands , the Kilbarchan and Paisley Hills , and others , exhibit polished and smoothed rock-surfaces on their very crest . Similar markings streak and score the rocks up to a great height in the deep valleys of the Highlands . " 1 We can realize , in our imagination , the glacier of the mountain-valley crushing and marking the bed in which it moves , or even the plain on which it discharges itself ; but it is impossible to conceive of a glacier upon the bare top of a mountain , without walls to restrain it or direct its flow , or higher ice accumulations to feed it . Again : " If glaciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Alpine ranges , then we would expect to find the same results on the plains of Northern Italy that present themselves on the low grounds of Switzerland . But this is not the case . On the plains of Italy there are no traces of the stony clay found in Switzerland and all over Europe . Neither are any of the stones of the drift of Italy scratched or striated. " 2 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 73. 2 . Ibid. , pp. 491 , 492. p. 22 But , strange to say , while , as Geikie admits , no true " till " or Drift is now being formed by or under the glaciers of Switzerland , nevertheless " till " is found in that country disassociated from the glaciers . Geikie says : " In the low grounds of Switzerland we get a dark , tough clay , packed with scratched and well-rubbed stones , and containing here and there some admixture of sand and irregular beds and patches of earthy gravel . This clay is quite unstratified , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being turned up on end and bent over , exactly as in this country the rocks are sometimes broken and disturbed below till . The whole deposit has experienced much denudation , but even yet it covers considerable areas , and attains a thickness varying from a few feet up to not less than thirty feet in thickness . " 1 Here , then , are the objections to this theory of the glacier-origin of the Drift : I. The glaciers do not produce striated stones . II . The glaciers do not produce drift-clay . III . The glaciers could not have formed continental sheets of " till . " IV . The glaciers could not have existed upon , and consequently could not have striated , the mountain-tops . V. The glaciers could not have reached to the great plains of the continents far remote from valleys , where we still find the Drift and drift-markings . VI . The glaciers are limited in number and confined in their operations , and were utterly inadequate to have produced the thousands of square miles of drift-d ? bris which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice Age , " p. 373. p. 23 CHAPTER VI . WAS IT CAUSED BY CONTINENTAL ICE-SHEETS ? WE , come now to the theory which is at present most generally accepted : It being apparent that glaciers were not adequate to produce the results which we find , the glacialists have fallen back upon an extraordinary hypothesis  --  to wit , that the whole north and south regions of the globe , extending from the poles to 35 ? or 40 ? of north and south latitude , were , in the Drift age , covered with enormous , continuous sheets of ice , from one mile thick at its southern margin , to three or five miles thick at the poles . As they find drift-scratches upon the tops of mountains in Europe three to four thousand feet high , and in New England upon elevations six thousand feet high , it follows , according to this hypothesis , that the ice-sheet must have been considerably higher than these mountains , for the ice must have been thick enough to cover their tops , and high enough and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratch the rocks . And as the stri ? in Northern Europe were found to disregard the conformation of the continent and the islands of the sea , it became necessary to suppose that this polar ice-sheet filled up the bays and seas , so that one could have passed dry-shod , in that period , from France to the north pole , over a steadily ascending plane of ice . No attempt has been made to explain where all this p. 24 ice came from ; or what force lifted the moisture into the air which , afterward descending , constituted these world-cloaks of frozen water . It is , perhaps , easy to suppose that such world-cloaks might have existed ; we can imagine the water of the seas falling on the continents , and freezing as it fell , until , in the course of ages , it constituted such gigantic ice-sheets ; but something more than this is needed . This does not account for these hundreds of feet of clay , bowlders , and gravel . But it is supposed that these were torn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-sheet moving southward . But what would make it move southward ? We know that some of our mountains are covered to-day with immense sheets of ice , hundreds and thousands of feet in thickness . Do these descend upon the flat country ? No ; they lie there and melt , and are renewed , kept in equipoise by the contending forces of heat and cold . Why should the ice-sheet move southward ? Because , say the " glacialists , " the lands of the northern parts of Europe and America were then elevated fifteen hundred feet higher than at present , and this gave the ice a sufficient descent . But what became of that elevation afterward ? Why , it went down again . It had accommodatingly performed its function , and then the land resumed its old place ! But did the land rise up in this extraordinary fashion ? Croll says : " The greater elevation of the land ( in the Ice period ) is simply assumed as an hypothesis to account for the cold . The facts of geology , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country was covered with ice , the land stood in relation to the sea at a lower level than at present , and that the continental periods or times , when the land stood in relation to the p. 25 sea at a higher level than now , were the warm inter-glacial periods , when the country was free of snow and ice , And a mild and equable condition of climate prevailed . This is the conclusion toward which we are being led by the more recent revelations of surface-geology , and also by certain facts connected with the geographical distribution of plants and animals during the Glacial epoch . " 1 H. B. Norton says : " When we come to study the cause of these phenomena , we find many perplexing and contradictory theories in the field . A favorite one is that of vertical elevation . But it seems impossible to admit that the circle inclosed within the parallel of 40 ?  --  some seven thousand miles in diameter  --  could have been elevated to such a height as to produce this remarkable result . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of land and water on the surface of the globe and with the phenomena of terrestrial contraction and gravitation. " 2 We have seen that the surface-rocks underneath the Drift are scored and grooved by some external force . Now we find that these markings do not all run in the same direction ; on the contrary , they cross each other in an extraordinary manner . The cut on the following page illustrates this . If the direction of the motion of the ice-sheets , which caused these markings , was ,  --  as the glacialists allege ,  --  always from the elevated region in the north to the lower ground in the south , then the markings must always have been in the same direction : given a fixed cause , we must have always a fixed result . We shall see , as we go on in this argument , that the deposition of the " till " was instantaneous ; and , as these markings were made before or at the same time the " till " was laid down , how could the land 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Popular Science Monthly , " October , 1879 , p. 833. p. 26 possibly have bobbed up and down , now here , now there , so that the elevation from which the ice-sheet descended ### SKETCH OF GLACIER-FURROWS AND SCRATCHES AT STONY POINT , LAKE ERIE , MICHIGAN . aa , deep water-line ; bb border of the bank of earthy materials ; cc , deep parallel grooves four and a half feet apart and twenty-five feet long , bearing north 60 ? east ; d , a set of grooves and scratches bearing north 60 ? west ; e , a natural bridge . Winchell 's " Sketches of Creation , " p. 213. was one moment in the northeast , and the next moment had whirled away into the northwest ? As the poet says : " . . . Will these trees , That have outlived the eagle , page thy steps And skip , when thou point'st out ? " p. 27 But if the point of elevation was whisked away from east to west , how could an ice-sheet a mile thick instantaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in the interval between the time when the external force , whatever it was , struck the rocks , and the time when a sufficient body of " till " had been laid down to shield the rocks and prevent further wear and tear . Neither is it possible to suppose an ice-sheet , a mile in thickness , moving in two diametrically opposite directions at the same time . Again : the ice-sheet theory requires an elevation in the north and a descent southwardly ; and it is this descent southwardly which is supposed to have given the momentum and movement by which the weight of the superincumbent mass of ice tore up , plowed up , ground up , and smashed up the face of the surface-rocks , and thus formed the Drift and made the stri ? . But , unfortunately , when we come to apply this theory to the facts , we find that it is the north sides of the hills and mountains that are striated , while the south sides have gone scot-free ! Surely , if weight and motion made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , must have been more distinct upon a declivity than upon an ascent . The school-boy toils patiently and slowly up the hill with his sled , but when he descends he comes down with railroad-speed , scattering the snow before him in all directions . But here we have a school-boy that tears and scatters things going up-hill , and sneaks down-hill snail-fashion . " Professor Hitchcock remarks , that Mount Monadnock , New Hampshire , 3,250 feet high , is scarified from top to bottom on its northern side and western side , but not on , the southern . " 1 This state of things is universal in North America . 1 . Dana 's " Manual of Geology , " p. 537. p. 28 But let us look at another point : If the vast deposits of sand , gravel , clay , and bowlders , which are found in Europe and America , were placed there by a great continental ice-sheet , reaching down from the north pole to latitude 35 ? or 40 ? ; if it was the ice that tore and scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striated them , and left them in great sheets and heaps all over the land  --  then it follows , as a matter of course , that in all the regions equally near the pole , and equally cold in climate , the ice must have formed a similar sheet , and in like manner have torn up the rocks and ground them into gravel and clay . This conclusion is irresistible . If the cold of the north caused the ice , and the ice caused the Drift , then in all the cold north-lands there must have been ice , and consequently there ought to have been Drift . If we can find , therefore , any extensive cold region of the earth where the Drift is not , then we can not escape the conclusion that the cold and the ice did not make the Drift . Let us see : One of the coldest regions of the earth is Siberia . It is a vast tract reaching to the Arctic Circle ; it is the north part of the Continent of Asia ; it is intersected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find the Drift ; here , if anywhere , was the ice-field , " the sea of ice . " It is more elevated and more mountainous than the interior of North America where the drift-deposits are extensive ; it is nearer the pole than New York and Illinois , covered as these are with hundreds of feet of d ? bris , and yet there is no Drift in Siberia ! I quote from a high authority , and a firm believer in the theory that glaciers or ice-sheets caused the drift ; James Geikie says : " It is remarkable that nowhere in the great plains of Siberia do any traces of glacial action appear to have p. 29 been observed . If cones and mounds of gravel and great erratics like those that sprinkle so wide an area in Northern America and Northern Europe had occurred , they would hardly have failed to arrest the attention of explorers . Middendorff does , indeed , mention the occurrence of trains of large erratics which he observed along the banks of some of the rivers , but these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general character of the ' tundras ' is that of wide , flat plains , covered for the most part with a grassy and mossy vegetation , but here and there bare and sandy . Frequently nothing intervenes to break the monotony of the landscape . . . . It would appear , then , that ill Northern Asia representatives of the glacial deposits which are met with in similar latitudes in Europe and America do not occur . The northern drift of Russia and Germany ; the ? sar of Sweden ; the kames , eskers , and erratics of Britain ; and the iceberg-drift of Northern America have , apparently , no equivalent in Siberia . Consequently we find the great river-deposits , with their mammalian remains , which tell of a milder climate than now obtains in those high latitudes , still lying undisturbed at the surface . " 1 Think of the significance of all this . There is no Drift in Siberia ; no " till , " no " bowlder-clay , " no stratified masses of gravel , sand , and stones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Asia , up to the Arctic Circle ! How pregnant is this admission . It demolishes at one blow the whole theory that the Drift came of the ice . For surely if we could expect to find ice , during the so-called Glacial age , anywhere on the face of our planet , it would be in Siberia . But , if there was an ice-sheet there , it did not grind up the rocks ; it did not striate them ; it did not roll the fragments into bowlders and pebbles ; it rested so quietly on the face of the land that , as Geikie tells us , the pre-glacial deposits throughout Siberia , with their mammalian remains , are still found " lying undisturbed 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 460 , published in 1873. p. 30 on the surface " ; and he even thinks that the great mammals , the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros , " may have survived in Northern Asia down to a comparatively recent date , " 1 ages after they were crushed out of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to account for this extraordinary state of things by supposing that the climate of Siberia was , during the Glacial age , too dry to furnish snow to make the ice-sheet . But when it is remembered that there was moisture enough , we are told , in Northern Europe and America at that time to form a layer of ice from one to three miles in thickness , it would certainly seem that enough ought to have blown across the eastern line of European Russia to give Siberia a fair share of ice and Drift . The explanation is more extraordinary than the thing it explains . One third of the water of all the oceans must have been carried up , and was circulating around in the air , to descend upon the earth in rain and snow , and yet none of it fell on Northern Asia ! And as the line of the continents separating Europe and Asia had not yet been established , it can not be supposed that the Drift ref used to enter Asia out of respect to the geographical lines . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably , all Asia ; it does not extend even over all Europe . Louis Figuier says that the traces of glacial action " are observed in all the north of Europe , in Russia , Iceland , Norway , Prussia , the British Islands , part of Germany in the north , and even in some parts of the south of Spain . " 2 M. Edouard Collomb finds only a " a shred " of the glacial evidences in France , and thinks they were absent from part of Russia ! 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 461. 2 . " The World before the Deluge , " p. 451. p. 31 And , even in North America , the Drift is not found everywhere . There is a remarkable region , embracing a large area in Wisconsin , Iowa , and Minnesota , which Professor J. D. Whitney1 calls " the driftless region , " in which no drift , no clays , no gravel , no rock strive or furrows are found . The rock-surfaces have not been ground down and polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geikie , " seeing that the regions to the north , west , east , and south are all more or less deeply covered with drift-deposits. " 2 And , in this region , as in Siberia , the remains of the large , extinct mammalia are found imbedded in the surface-wash , or in cracks or crevices of the limestone . If the Drift of North America was due to the ice-sheet , why is there no drift-deposit in " the driftless region " of the Northwestern States of America ? Surely this region must have been as cold as Illinois , Ohio , etc . It is now the coldest part of the Union . Why should the ice have left this oasis , and refused to form on it ? Or why , if it did form on it , did it refuse to tear up the rock-surfaces and form Drift ? Again , no traces of northern drift are found in California , which is surrounded by high mountains , in some of which fragments of glaciers are found even to this day. 3 According to Foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the opinion of some , it does not reach much beyond the western boundary of Iowa . Nor can it be supposed that the driftless regions of Siberia , Northwestern America , and the Pacific coast are due to the absence of ice upon them during the Glacial 1 . " Report of the Geological Survey of Wisconsin , " vol. i , p. 114. 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 465. 3 . Whitney , " Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences . " p. 32 age , for in Siberia the remains of the great mammalia , the mammoth , the woolly rhinoceros , the bison , and the horse , are found to this day imbedded in great masses of ice , which , as we shall see , are supposed to have been formed around them at the very coming of the Drift age . But there is another difficulty : Let us suppose that on all the continents an ice-belt came down from the north and south poles to 35 ? or 40 ? of latitude , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greenland , frowning over the remnant of the world , and giving out continually fogs , snow-storms , and tempests ; what , under such circumstances , must have been the climatic conditions of the narrow belt of land which these ice-sheets did not cover ? Louis Figuier says : " Such masses of ice could only have covered the earth when the temperature of the air was lowered at least some degrees below zero . But organic life is incompatible with such a temperature ; and to this cause must we attribute the disappearance of certain species of animals and plants  --  in particular the rhinoceros and the elephant  --  which , before this sudden and extraordinary cooling of the globe , appeared to have limited themselves , in immense herds , to Northern Europe , and chiefly to Siberia , where their remains have been found in such prodigious quantities . " 1 But if the now temperate region of Europe and America was subject to a degree of cold great enough to destroy these huge animals , then there could not have been a tropical climate anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 40 ? , north and south , was several degrees below zero , the equator must have been at least below the frost-point . And , if so , how can we account for the survival , 1 . " The World before the Deluge , " p. 462. p. 33 to our own time , of innumerable tropical plants that can not stand for one instant the breath of frost , and whose fossilized remains are found in the rocks prior to the Drift ? As they lived through the Glacial age , it could not have been a period of great and intense cold . And this conclusion is in accordance with the results of the latest researches of the scientists :  --  " In his valuable studies upon the diluvial flora , Count Gaston de Saporta concludes that the climate in this period was marked rather by extreme moisture than extreme cold . " Again : where did the clay , which is deposited in such gigantic masses , hundreds of feet thick , over the continents , come from ? We have seen ( p. 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no such clay has been proved to have been formed , either in the Arctic regions , whence the ice-sheet has retreated , or in the districts forsaken by the glaciers . " If the Arctic ice-sheet does not create such a clay now , why did it create it centuries ago on the plains of England or Illinois ? The other day I traveled from Minnesota to Cape May , on the shore of the Atlantic , a distance of about fifteen hundred miles . At scarcely any point was I out of sight of the red clay and gravel of the Drift : it loomed up amid the beach-sands of New Jersey ; it was laid bare by railroad-cuts in the plains of New York and Pennsylvania ; it covered the highest tops of the Alleghanies at Altoona ; the farmers of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , and Wisconsin were raising crops upon it ; it was everywhere . If one had laid down a handful of the Wisconsin Drift alongside of a handful of the New Jersey deposit , he could scarcely have perceived any difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geological formation , almost identical in character , fifteen hundred miles long from east to west , and reaching through the whole length of North and South America , from the Arctic Circle to Patagonia . Did ice grind this out of the granite ? Where did it get the granite ? The granite reaches the surface only in limited areas ; as a rule , it is buried many miles in depth under the sedimentary rocks . How did the ice pick out its materials so as to grind nothing but granite ? This deposit overlies limestone and sandstone . The ice-sheet rested upon them . Why were they not ground up with the granite ? Did the ice intelligently pick out a particular kind of rock , and that the hardest of them all ? But here is another marvel  --  this clay is red . The red is due to the grinding up of mica and hornblende . Granite is composed of quartz , feldspar , and mica . In syenitic granite the materials are quartz , feldspar , and hornblende . Mica and hornblende contain considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mica and hornblende are ground up , the result is blue or red clays , as the oxidation of the iron turns the clay red ; while the clay made of feldspar is light yellow or white . Now , then , not only did the ice-sheet select for grinding the granite rocks , and refuse to touch the others , but it put the granite itself through some mysterious process by which it separated the feldspar from the mica and hornblende , and manufactured a white or yellow clay out of the one , which it deposited in great sheets by itself , as west of the Mississippi ; while it ground up the mica and hornblende and made blue or red clays , which it laid down elsewhere , as the red clays are spread over that great stretch of fifteen hundred miles to which I have referred . p. 35 Can any one suppose that ice could so discriminate ? And if it by any means effected this separation of the particles of granite , indissolubly knit together , how could it perpetuate that separation while moving over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave it on the face of the earth free from commixture with the surface rocks ? Again : the ice-sheets which now exist in the remote north do not move with a constant and regular motion southward , grinding up the rocks as they go . A recent writer , describing the appearance of things in Greenland , says : " The coasts are deeply indented with numerous bays and fiords or firths , which , when traced inland , are almost invariably found to terminate against glaciers . Thick ice frequently appears , too , crowning the exposed sea-cliffs , from the edges of which it droops in thick , tongue-like , and stalactitic projections , until its own weight forces it to break away and topple down the precipices into the sea . " 1 This does not represent an ice-sheet moving down continuously from the high grounds and tearing up the rocks . It rather breaks off like great icicles from the caves of a house . Again : the ice-sheets to-day do not striate or groove the rocks over which they move . Mr. Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Fire and Frost , " and " A Short American Tramp "  --  went , in 1864 , to the coasts of Labrador , the Strait of Belle Isle , and the Gulf of St. Lawrence , for the express purpose of witnessing the effects of icebergs , and testing the theory he had formed . On the coast of Labrador he reports that at Hanly Harbor , where 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " April , 1874 , p. 646. p. 36 the whole strait is blocked up with ice each winter , and the great mass swung bodily up and down , " grating along the bottom at all depths , " he " found the rocks ground smooth , but not striated. " 1 At Cape Charles and Battle Harbor , he reports , " the rocks at the water-line are not striated. " 2 At St. Francis Harbor , " the water-line is much rubbed smooth , but not striated. " 3 At Sea Islands , he says , " No stri ? are to be seen at the land-wash in these sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again : if these drift-deposits , these vast accumulations of sand , clay , gravel , and bowlders , were caused by a great continental ice-sheet scraping and tearing the rocks on which it rested , and constantly moving toward the sun , then not only would we find , as I have suggested in the case of glaciers , the accumulated masses of rubbish piled up in great windrows or ridges along the lines where the face of the ice-sheet melted , but we would naturally expect that the farther north we went the less we would find of these materials ; in other words , that the ice , advancing southwardly , would sweep the north clear of d ? bris to pile it up in the more southern regions . But this is far from being the case . On the contrary , the great masses of the Drift extend as far north as the land itself . In the remote , barren grounds of North America , we are told by various travelers who have visited those regions , " sand-hills and erratics appear to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Bach tells us6 that he saw great chains of sand-hills , stretching 1 . " A Short American Tramp , " pp. 68 , 107. 2 . Ibid. , p. 68. 3 . Ibid. , p. 72. 4 . Ibid. , p. 76. 5 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 391. 6 . " Narrative of Arctic Land Expedition to the Mouth of the Great Fish River , " pp. 140 , 346. p. 37 away from each side of the valley of the Great Fish River , in north latitude 66 ? , of great height , and crowned with gigantic bowlders . Why did not the advancing ice-sheet drive these deposits southward over the plains of the United States ? Can we conceive of a force that was powerful enough to grind up the solid rocks , and yet was not able to remove its own d ? bris ? But there is still another reason which ought to satisfy us , once for all , that the drift-deposits were not due to the pressure of a great continental ice-sheet . It is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it is found was once covered with a body of ice thick and heavy enough by its pressure and weight to grind up the surface-rocks into clay , sand , gravel , and bowlders , then the tropical regions of the world must have been covered with such a great ice-sheet , upon the very equator ; for Agassiz found in Brazil a vast sheet of " ferruginous clay with pebbles , " which covers the whole country , " a sheet of drift , " says Agassiz , " consisting of the same homogeneous , unstratified paste , and containing loose materials of all sorts and sizes , " deep red in color , and distributed , as in the north , in uneven hills , while sometimes it is reduced to a thin deposit . It is recent in time , although overlying rocks ancient geologically . Agassiz had no doubt whatever that it was of glacial origin . Professor Hartt , who accompanied Professor Agassiz in his South American travels , and published a valuable work called " The Geology of Brazil , " describes drift-deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the equator itself . The whole valley of the Amazon is covered with stratified and unstratified and unfossiliferous p. 38 Drift , 1 and also with a peculiar drift-clay ( argile plastique bigarr ? e ) , plastic and streaked . Professor Hartt gives a cut from which I copy the following representation of drift-clay and pebbles overlying a gneiss hillock of the Serra do Mar , Brazil : ### DRIFT-DEPOSITS IN THE TROPICS . a , drift-clay ; f f , angular fragments of quartz ; c. sheet of pebbles ; d d , gneiss in situ ; g g , quartz and granite veins traversing the gneiss . But here is the dilemma to which the glacialists are reduced : If an ice-sheet a mile in thickness , or even one hundred feet in thickness , was necessary to produce the Drift , and if it covered the equatorial regions of Brazil , then there is no reason why the same climatic conditions should not have produced the same results in Africa and Asia ; and the result would be that the entire globe , from pole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or centuries , wrapped in a continuous easing , mantle , or shroud of ice , under which all vegetable and animal life must have utterly perished . 1 . " Geology of Brazil , " p. 488. p. 39 And we are not without evidences that the drift-deposits are found in Africa . We know that they extend in Europe to the Mediterranean . The " Journal of the Geographical Society " ( British ) has a paper by George Man , F. G. S. , on the geology of Morocco , in which he says : " Glacial moraines may be seen on this range nearly eight thousand feet above the sea , forming gigantic ridges and mounds of porphyritic blocks , in some places damming up the ravines , and at the foot of Atlas are enormous mounds of bowlders . " These mounds oftentimes rise two thousand feet above the level of the plain , and , according to Mr. Man , were produced by glaciers . We shall see , hereafter , that the sands bordering Egypt belong to the Drift age . The diamond-bearing gravels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equator . It is even a question whether that great desolate land , the Desert of Sahara , covering a third of the Continent of Africa , is not the direct result of this signal catastrophe . Henry W. Haynes tells us that drift-deposits are found in the Desert of Sahara , and that  --  " In the bottoms of the dry ravines , or wadys , which pierce the hills that bound the valley of the Nile , I have found numerous specimens of flint axes of the type of St. Acheul , which have been adjudged to be true pal ? olithic implements by some of the most eminent cultivators of prehistoric science . " 1 The sand and gravel of Sahara are underlaid by a deposit of clay . Bayard Taylor describes in the center of Africa 1 . " The Pal ? olithic Implements of the Valley of the Delaware , " Cambridge , 1881. p. 40 great plains of coarse gravel , dotted with gray granite bowlders. 1 In the United States Professor Winchell shows that the drift-deposits extend to the Gulf of Mexico . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbles one hundred feet in thickness. 2 If there are no drift-deposits except where the great ice-sheet ground them out of the rocks , then a shroud of death once wrapped the entire globe , and all life ceased . But we know that all life ,  --  vegetable , animal , and human ,  --  is derived from pre-glacial sources ; therefore animal , vegetable , and human life did not perish in the Drift age ; therefore an ice-sheet did not wrap the world in its death-pall ; therefore the drift-deposits of the tropics were not due to an ice-sheet ; therefore the drift-deposits of the rest of the world were not due to ice-sheets : therefore we must look elsewhere for their origin . There is no escaping these conclusions . Agassiz himself says , describing the Glacial age : " All the springs were dried up ; the rivers ceased to flow . To the movements of a numerous and animated creation succeeded the silence of death . " If the verdure was covered with ice a mile in thickness , all animals that lived on vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnivores which lived on these must have ceased to exist ; and man himself , without animal or vegetable food , must have disappeared for ever . A writer , describing Greenland wrapped in such an ice-sheet , says 1 . " Travels in Africa , " p. 188. 2 . " Sketches of Creation , " pp. 222 , 223. p. 41 " The whole interior seems to be buried beneath a great depth of snow and ice , which loads up the valleys and wraps over the hills . The scene opening to view in the interior is desolate in the extreme  --  nothing but one dead , dreary expanse of white , so far as the eye can reach  --  no living creature frequents this wilderness  --  neither bird , beast , nor insect . The silence , deep as death , is broken only when the roaring storm arises to sweep before it the pitiless , blinding snow . " 1 And yet the glacialists would have us believe that Brazil and Africa , and the whole globe , were once wrapped in such a shroud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidences that the deposits of the Drift are not due to continental ice-sheets : I. The present ice-sheets of the remote north create no such deposits and make no such markings . II . A vast continental elevation of land-surfaces at the north was necessary for the ice to slide down , and this did not exist . III . The ice-sheet , if it made the Drift markings , must have scored the rocks going up-hill , while it did not score them going down-hill . IV . If the cold formed the ice and the ice formed the Drift , why is there no Drift in the coldest regions of the earth , where there must have been ice ? V. Continental ice-belts , reaching to 40 ? of latitude , would have exterminated all tropical vegetation . It was not exterminated , therefore such ice-sheets could not have existed . VI . The Drift is found in the equatorial regions of the world . If it was produced by an ice-sheet in those regions , all pre-glacial forms of life must have perished ; but they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Popular Science Monthly , " April , 1874 , p. 646. p. 42 have covered these regions , and could not have produced the drift-deposits there found . In brief , the Drift is not found where ice must have been , and is found where ice could not have been ; the conclusion , therefore , is irresistible that the Drift is not due to ice . p. 43 CHAPTER VII . THE DRIFT A GIGANTIC CATASTROPHE . IN the first place , the Drift fell upon a fair and lovely world , a world far better adapted to give happiness to its inhabitants than this storm-tossed planet on which we now live , with its endless battle between heat and cold , between sun and ice . The pre-glacial world was a garden , a paradise ; not excessively warm at the equator , and yet with so mild and equable a climate that the plants we now call tropical flourished within the present Arctic Circle . If some future daring navigator reaches the north pole and finds solid land there , he will probably discover in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bananas of the pre-glacial age . That the reader may not think this an extravagant statement , let me cite a few authorities . A recent writer says : " This was , indeed , for America , the golden age of animals and plants , and in all respects but one  --  the absence of man  --  the country was more interesting and picturesque than now . We must imagine , therefore , that the hills and valleys about the present site of New York were covered with noble trees , and a dense undergrowth of species , for the most part different from those now living there ; and that these were the homes and feeding-grounds of many kinds of quadrupeds and birds , which have long since become extinct . The broad plain which sloped gently seaward from the highlands must have been p. 44 covered with a sub-tropical forest of-giant trees and tangled vines teeming with animal life . This state of things doubtless continued through many thousands of years , but ultimately a change came over the fair face of Nature more complete and terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " At the close of the Tertiary age , which ends the long series of geological epochs previous to the Quaternary , the landscape of Europe had , in the main , assumed its modern appearance . The middle era of this age  --  the Miocene  --  was characterized by tropical plants , a varied and imposing fauna , and a genial climate , so extended as to nourish forests of beeches , maples , walnuts , poplars , and magnolias in Greenland and Spitzbergen , while an exotic vegetation hid the exuberant valleys of England . " 2 Dr. Dawson says : " This delightful climate was not confined to the present temperate or tropical regions . It extended to the very shores of the Arctic Sea . In North Greenland , at Atane-Kerdluk , in latitude 70 ? north , at an elevation of more than a thousand feet above the sea , were found the remains of beeches , oaks , pines , poplars , maples , walnuts , magnolias , limes , and vines .

Some reasons have been adduced for the belief that in the Miocene and Eocene there were intervals of cold climate ; but the evidence of this may be merely local and exceptional , and does not interfere with the broad characteristics of the age .

The roots were in place , in a frozen mass of earth , the stump standing upright where it was probably overtaken by the great winter. 2 Trees have been found , in situ , on Prince Patrick 's Island , in latitude 76 ? 12 ' north , four feet in circumference . They were so old that the wood had lost its combustible quality , and refused to burn . Mr. Geikie thinks that it is possible these trees were pre-glacial , and belonged to the Miocene age . They may have been the remnants of the great forests which clothed that far northern region when the so-called glacial age came on and brought the Drift . We shall see hereafter that man , possibly civilized man , dwelt in this fair and glorious world  --  this world that knew no frost , no cold , no ice , no snow ; that he had dwelt in it for thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fell upon it ; and that he has preserved the memory of this catastrophe to the present day , in a multitude of myths and legends scattered all over the face of the habitable earth . But was it sudden ? Was it a catastrophe ? Again I call the witnesses to the stand , for I ask you , good reader , to accept nothing that is not proved . In the first place , was it sudden ? 1 . " Earth and Man , " p. 264. 2 . " The Last of the Arctic Voyages , " vol. i , p. 380. p. 46 One writer says : " The glacial action , in the opinion of the land-glacialists , was limited to a definite period , and operated simultaneously over a vast area . " 1 And again : " The drift was accumulated where it is by some violent action . " 2 Louis Figuier says : " The two cataclysms of which we have spoken surprised Europe at the moment of the development of an important creation . The whole scope of animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that part of our hemisphere over which these gigantic convulsions spread , followed by the brief but sudden submersion of entire continents . Organic life had scarcely recovered from the violent shock , when a second , and perhaps severer blow assailed it . The northern and central parts of Europe , the vast countries which extend from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean and the Danube , were visited by a period of sudden and severe cold ; the temperature of the polar regions seized them . The plains of Europe , but now ornamented by the luxurious vegetation developed by the heat of a burning climate , the boundless pastures on which herds of great elephants , the active horse , the robust hippopotamus , and great carnivorous animals grazed and roamed , became covered with a mantle of ice and snow . " 3 M. Ch . Martins says : " The most violent convulsions of the solid and liquid elements appear to have been themselves only the effects due to a cause much more powerful than the mere expansion of the pyrosphere ; and it is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and bolder hypothesis than has Yet been hazarded . Some philosophers have belief 1 . American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. vi , p. 114. 2 . Ibid. , vol. vi , p. 111. 3 . " The World before the Deluge , " p. 435. p. 47 in an astronomical revolution which may have overtaken our globe in the first age of its formation , and have modified its position in relation to the sun . They admit that the poles have not always been as they are now , and that some terrible shock displaced them , changing at the same time the inclination of the axis of the rotation of the earth . " 1 Louis Figuier says : " We can not doubt , after such testimony , of the existence , in the frozen north , of the almost entire remains of the mammoth . The animals seem to have perished suddenly ; enveloped in ice at the moment of their death , their bodies have been preserved from decomposition by the continual action of the cold . " 2 Cuvier says , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized , and which have been preserved , with their hair , flesh , and skin , down to our own times : " If they had not been frozen as soon as killed , putrefaction would have decomposed them ; and , on the other hand , this eternal frost could not have previously prevailed in the place where they died , for they could not have lived in such a temperature . It was , therefore , at the same instant when these animals perished that the country they inhabited was rendered glacial . These events must have been sudden , instantaneous , and without any gradation . " 3 There is abundant evidence that the Drift fell upon a land covered with forests , and that the trunks of the trees were swept into the mass of clay and gravel , where they are preserved to this day . Mr. Whittlesey gives an account of a log found forty feet below the surface , in a bed of blue clay , resting 1 . " The World before the Deluge , " p. 463. 2 . Ibid. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ les R ? volutions du Globe . " p. 48 upon the " hard-pan " or " till , " in a well dug at Columbia , Ohio. 1 At Bloomington , Illinois , pieces of wood were found one hundred and twenty-three feet below the surface , in sinking a shaft. 2 And it is a very remarkable fact that none of these Illinois clays contain any fossils. 3 The inference , therefore , is irresistible that the clay , thus unfossiliferous , fell upon and inclosed the trees while they were yet growing . These facts alone would dispose of the theory that the Drift was deposited upon lands already covered with water . It is evident , on the contrary , that it was dry land , inhabited land , land embowered in forests . On top of the Norwich crag , in England , are found the remains of an ancient forest , " showing stumps of trees standing erect with their roots penetrating an ancient soil . " 4 In this soil occur the remains of many extinct species of animals , together with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippopotamus , three species of elephant , the mammoths , rhinoceros , bear , horse , Irish elk , etc . In Ireland remains of trees have been found in sand-beds below the till. 5 Dr. Dawson found a hardened peaty bed under the bowlder-clay , in Canada , which " contained many small roots and branches , apparently of coniferous trees allied to the spruces. " 6 Mr. C. Whittlesey refers to decayed 1 . " Smithsonian Contributions , " vol. xv . 2 . " Geology of Illinois , " vol. iv , p. 179. 3 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 387. 4 . Ibid. , p. 340 .

" 3 We have seen that the Drift itself has all the appearance of having been the product of some sudden catastrophe : " Stones and bowlders alike are scattered higgledy-piggledy , pell-mell , through the clay , so as to give it a highly confused and tumultuous appearance . " Another writer says : " In the mass of the ' till ' itself fossils sometimes , but very rarely , occur . Tusks of the mammoth , reindeer-antlers , and fragments of wood have from time to time been discovered . They almost invariably afford marks of having been subjected to the same action as the stones and bowlders by which they are surrounded . " 4 Another says : " Logs and fragments of wood are often got at great depths in the buried gorges . " 5 1 . " Smithsonian Contributions , " vol. xv . 2 .

Two elephant-tasks were got at a depth of seventeen and a half feet from the surface . . . . The mammalian remains , obtained from this quarry , occurred in a peaty layer between two thin beds of sand and gravel which lay beneath a mass of ' till , ' and rested directly on the sandstone rock . " 1 And again : " Remains of the mammoth have been met with at Chapelhall , near Airdrie , where they occurred in a bed of laminated sand , underlying ' till . ' Reindeer-antlers have also been discovered in other localities , as in the valley of the Endrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antler was found associated with marine shells , near the bottom of a bed of blue clay , and close to the underlying rock  --  the blue clay being covered with twelve feet of tough , stony clay . " 2 Professor Winchell says " Buried tree-trunks are often exhumed from the glacial drift at a depth of from twenty to sixty feet from the surface . Dr. Locke has published an account of a mass of buried drift-wood at Salem , Ohio , forty-three feet below the surface , imbedded in ancient mud . The museum of the University of Michigan contains several fragments of well-preserved tree-trunks exhumed from wells in the vicinity of Ann Arbor . Such occurrences are by no means uncommon . The encroachments of the waves upon the shores of the Great Lakes reveal whole forests of the buried trunks of the white cedar . " 3 These citations place it beyond question that the Drift came suddenly upon the world , slaughtering the animals , 1 . The Great Ice Age , " p. 149. 2 . Ibid. , p. 150. 3 . Winchell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking up the forests , and overwhelming the trunks and branches of the trees in its masses of d ? bris . Let us turn to the next question : Was it an extraordinary event , a world-shaking cataclysm ? The answer to this question is plain : The Drift marks probably the most awful convulsion and catastrophe that has ever fallen upon the globe . The deposit of these continental masses of clay , sand , and gravel was but one of the features of the apalling event . In addition to this the earth at the same time was cleft with great cracks or fissures , which reached down through many miles of the planet 's crust to the central fires and released the boiling rocks imprisoned in its bosom , and these poured to the surface , as igneous , intrusive , or trap-rocks . Where the great breaks were not deep enough to reach the central fires , they left mighty fissures in the surface , which , in the Scandinavian regions , are known as fiords , and which constitute a striking feature of the scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hewn , as it were , in the rock  --  with high walls penetrating from the sea far into the interior of the land . They are found in Great Britain , Maine , Nova Scotia , Labrador , Greenland , and on the Western coast of North America . David Dale Owen tells us that the outburst of trap-rock at the Dalles of the St. Croix came up through open fissures , breaking the continuity of strata , without tilting them into inclined planes . " 1 It would appear as if the earth , in the first place , cracked into deep clefts , and the igneous matter within took advantage of these breaks to rise to the surface . It caught masses of the sandstone in its midst and hardened around them . These great clefts seem to be , as Owen says , " lines 1 . " Geological Survey of Wisconsin , Iowa , and Minnesota , " p. 142. p. 52 radiating southwestwardly from Lake Superior , as if that was the seat of the disturbance which caused them . " 1 Moreover , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Drift came , we do not find them merely smoothed and ground down , as we might suppose a great , heavy mass of ice moving slowly over them would leave them . There was something more than this . There was something , ( whatever it was , ) that fell upon them with awful force and literally smashed them , pounding , beating , pulverizing them , and turning one layer of mighty rock over upon another , and scattering them in the wildest confusion . We can not conceive of anything terrestrial that , let loose upon the bare rocks to-day , would or could produce such results . Geikie says : " When the ' till ' is removed from the underlying rocks , these almost invariably show either a well-smoothed , polished , and striated surface , or else a highly confused , broken , and smashed appearance . " 2 Gratacap says : " ' Crushed ledges ' designate those plicated , overthrown , or curved exposures where parallel rocks , as talcose schist , usually vertical , are bent and fractured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above . The strata are oftentimes tumbled over upon a cliff-side like a row of books , and rest upon heaps of fragments broken away by the strain upon the bottom layers , or crushed off from their exposed layers . " 3 The Rev. O. Fisher , F. G. S. , says he " Finds the covering beds to consist of two members  --  a lower one , entirely destitute of organic remains , and 1 . " Geological Survey of Wisconsin , Iowa , and Minnesota , " p. 147. 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 73. 3 . " Popular Science Monthly , " January , 1878 , p. 326. p. 53 generally unstratified , which has often been forcibly INDENTED into the bed beneath it , sometimes exhibiting slickensides at the junction . There is evidence of this lower member having been pushed or dragged over the surface , from higher to lower levels , in a plastic condition ; on which account he has named it ' The Trail ' . " 1 Now , all these details are incompatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imagined that would smash rocks , that would beat them like a maul , that would indent them ? And when we pass from the underlying rocks to the " till " itself , we find the evidences of tremendous force exerted in the wildest and most tumultuous manner . When the clay and stones were being deposited on those crushed and pounded rocks , they seem to have picked up the detritus of the earth in great masses , and whirled it wildly in among their own material , and deposited it in what are called " the intercalated beds . " It would seem as if cyclonic winds had been at work among the mass . While the " till " itself is devoid of fossils , " the intercalated beds " often contain them . Whatever was in or on the soil was seized upon , carried up into the air , then cast down , and mingled among the " till . " James Geikie says , speaking of these intercalated beds : " They are twisted , bent , crumpled , and confused often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gravel , which were probably deposited in a nearly horizontal plane , are puckered into folds and sharply curved into vertical positions . I have seen whole beds of sand and clay which had all the appearance of having been pushed forward bodily for some distance the bedding assuming the most fantastic appearance . . . . The intercalated beds are everywhere cut through by the overlying ' till , ' and 1 . " Journal of the Geological Society and Geological Magazine . " p. 54 large portions have been carried away . . . . They form but a small fraction of the drift-deposits. " 1 In the accompanying cut we have one of these sand ( s ) and clay ( c ) patches , embosomed in the " till , " t1 and t2. ### STRATIFIED BEDS IN TILL , LEITHEN WATER , PEEBLESSHIRE , SCOTLAND . And again , the same writer says : " The intercalated beds are remarkable for having yielded an imperfect skull of the great extinct ox ( Bos primigenius ) , and remains of the Irish elk or deer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 2 Several of our foremost scientists see in the phenomena of the Drift the evidences of a cataclysm of some sort . Sir John Lubbock3 gives the following representation of a section of the Drift at Joinville , France , containing ### SECTION AT JOINVILLE. 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 149. 2 . Ibid. , p. 149. 3 . " Prehistoric Times , " p. 370. p. 55 an immense sandstone block , eight feet six inches in length , with a width of two feet eight inches , and a thickness of three feet four inches . Discussing the subject , Mr. Lubbock says : " We must feel that a body of water , with power to move such masses as these , must have been very different from any floods now occurring in those valleys , and might well deserve the name of a cataclysm . . . . But a flood which could bring down so great a mass would certainly have swept away the comparatively light and movable gravel below . We can not , therefore , account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would deposit the sandstone blocks would remove the underlying gravel , and a flood which would deposit the gravel would not remove the blocks . The Deus ex machin ? has not only been called in most unnecessarily , but when examined turns out to be but an idol , after all . " Sir John thinks that floating ice might have dropped these blocks ; but then , on the other hand , M. C. d'Orbigny observes that all the fossils found in these beds belong to fresh-water or land animals . The sea has had nothing to do with them . And D'Orbigny thinks the Drift came from cataclysms . M. Boucher de Perthes , the first and most exhaustive investigator of these deposits , has always been of opinion that the drift-gravels of France were deposited by violent cataclysms. 1 This view seems to be confirmed by the fact that the gravel-beds in which these remains of man and extinct animals are found lie at an elevation of from eighty to two hundred feet above the present water-levels of the valleys . Sir John Lubbock says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which the upper-level gravels stand above the 1 . " M ? m . Soc. d'Em. l'Abbeville , " 1861 , p. 475. p. 56 present water-line . We can not wonder that these beds have generally been attributed to violent cataclysms. " 1 In America , in Britain , and in Europe , the glacial deposits made clean work of nearly all animal life . The great mammalia , too large to find shelter in caverns , were some of them utterly swept away , while others never afterward returned to those regions . In like manner pal ? olithic man , man of the rude and unpolished flint implements , the contemporary of the great mammalia , the mammoth , the hippopotamus , and the rhinoceros , was also stamped out , and the cave-deposits of Europe show that there was a long interval before be reappeared in those regions . The same forces , whatever they were , which " smashed " and " pounded " and " contorted " the surface of the earth , crushed man and his gigantic associates out of existence. 2 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the large mammalia were caught and entombed in ice , and preserved even to our own day , there was no " smashing " and " crushing " of the earth , and many escaped the snow-sheets , and their posterity survived in that region for long ages after the Glacial period , and are supposed only to have disappeared in quite recent times . In fact , within the last two or three years a Russian exile declared that he had seen a group of living mammoths in a wild valley in a remote portion of that wilderness . These , then , good reader , to recapitulate , are points that seem to be established : I. The Drift marked a world-convulsing catastrophe . It was a gigantic and terrible event . It was something quite out of the ordinary course of Nature 's operations . II . It was sudden and overwhelming . 1 . " Prehistoric Times , " p. 372. 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 466. p. 57 III . It fell upon land areas , much like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a glorious land , basking in perpetual summer , in the midst of a golden age . Let us go a step further . p. 58 CHAPTER VIII . GREAT HEAT A PREREQUISITE . Now , it will be observed that the principal theories assigned for the Drift go upon the hypothesis that it was produced by extraordinary masses of ice  --  ice as icebergs , ice as glaciers , or ice in continental sheets . The scientists admit that immediately preceding this Glacial age the climate was mild and equable , and these great formations of ice did not exist . But none of them pretend to say how the ice came or what caused it . Even Agassiz , the great apostle of the ice-origin of Drift , is forced to confess : " We have , as yet , no clew to the source of this great and sudden change of climate . Various suggestions have been made  --  among others , that formerly the inclination of the earth 's axis was greater , or that a submersion of the continents under water might have produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are satisfactory , and science has yet to find any cause which accounts for all the phenomena connected with it . " 1 Some have imagined that a change in the position of the earth 's axis of rotation , due to the elevation of extensive mountain-tracts between the poles and the equator , might have caused a degree of cold sufficient to produce the phenomena of the Drift ; but Geikie says  --  " It has been demonstrated that the protuberance of the earth at the equator so vastly exceeds that of any 1 . " Geological Sketches , " p. 210. p. 59 possible elevation of mountain-masses between the equator and the poles , that any slight changes which may have resulted from such geological causes could have had only an infinitesimal effect upon the . general climate of the globe . " 1 Let us reason together :  --  The ice , say the glacialists , caused the Drift . What caused the ice ? Great rains and snows , they say , falling on the face of the land . Granted . What is rain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds derived ? From the waters of the earth , principally from the oceans . How is the water in the clouds transferred to the clouds from the seas ? By evaporation . What is necessary to evaporation ? Heat . Here , then , is the sequence : If there is no heat , there is no evaporation ; no evaporation , no clouds ; no clouds , no rain ; no rain , no ice ; no ice , no Drift . But , as the Glacial age meant ice on a stupendous scale , then it must have been preceded by heat on a stupendous scale . Professor Tyndall asserts that the ancient glaciers indicate the action of heat as much as cold . He says : " Cold will not produce glaciers . You may have the bitterest northeast winds here in London throughout the winter without a single flake of snow . Cold must have the fitting object to operate upon , and this object  --  the aqueous vapor of the air  --  is the direct product of heat . Let us put this glacier question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the temperature of its production in the tropics , is about 1,000 ? Fahr. , for the latent heat augments as the temperature of evaporation descends . A pound of water thus vaporized at the equator has absorbed one thousand times the quantity of heat which 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 98. p. 60 would raise a pound of the liquid one degree in temperature . . . . It is perfectly manifest that by weakening the sun 's action , either through a defect of emission or by the steeping of the entire solar system in space of a low temperature , we should be cutting off the glaciers at their source . " 1 Mr. Croll says : " Heat , to produce evaporation , is just as essential to the accumulation of snow and ice as cold to produce condensation. " 2 Sir John Lubbock says : " Paradoxical as it may appear , the primary cause of the Glacial epoch may be , after all , an elevation of the temperature in the tropics , causing a greater amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of the raw material of snow in the temperate regions during the winter months . " 3 So necessary did it appear that heat must have come from some source to vaporize all this vast quantity of water , that one gentleman , Professor Frankland , 4 suggested that the ocean must have been rendered hot by the internal fires of the earth , and thus the water was sent up in clouds to fall in ice and snow ; but Sir John Lubbock disposes of this theory by showing that the fauna of the seas during the Glacial period possessed an Arctic character . We can not conceive of Greenland shells and fish and animals thriving in an ocean nearly at the boiling-point . A writer in " The Popular Science Monthly " 5 says : " These evidences of vast accumulations of ice and snow on the borders of the Atlantic have led some theorists 1 . " Heat considered as a Mode of Motion , " p. 192. 2 . " Climate and Time , " p. 74. 3 . " Prehistoric Times , " p. 401. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 328. 5 . July , 1876 , p. 288. p. 61 to suppose that the Ice period was attended , if not in part caused , by a far more abundant evaporation from the surface of the Atlantic than takes place at present ; and it has even been conjectured that submarine volcanoes in the tropics might have loaded the atmosphere with an unusual amount of moisture . This speculation seems to me , however , both improbable and superfluous ; improbable , because no traces of any such cataclysm have been discovered , and it is more than doubtful whether the generation of steam in the tropics , however large the quantity , would produce glaciation of the polar regions . The ascent of steam and heated air loaded with vapor to the altitude of refrigeration would , as it seems to me , result in the rapid radiation of the heat into space , and the local precipitation of unusual quantities of rain ; and the effect of such a catastrophe would be slowly propagated and feebly felt in the Arctic and Antarctic regions . When we consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glacialists , covered the continents during the Drift age , it becomes evident that a vast proportion of the waters of the ocean must have been evaporated and carried into the air , and thence cast down as snow and rain . Mr. Thomas Belt , in a recent number of the " Quarterly Journal of Science , " argues that the formation of ice-sheets at the poles must have lowered the level of the oceans of the world two thousand-feet ! The mathematician can figure it out for himself : Take the area of the continents down to , say , latitude 40 ? , on both sides of the equator ; suppose this area to be covered by an ice-sheet averaging , say , two miles in thickness ; reduce this mass of ice to cubic feet of water , and estimate what proportion of the ocean would be required to be vaporized to create it . Calculated upon any basis , and it follows that the level of the ocean must have been greatly lowered . What a vast , inconceivable accession of heat to our p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean-water out of its bed and into the clouds ! The ice , then , was not the cause of the cataclysm ; it was simply one of the secondary consequences . We must look , then , behind the ice-age for some cause that would prodigiously increase the heat of our atmosphere , and , when we have found that , we shall have discovered the cause of the drift-deposits as well as of the ice . The solution of the whole stupendous problem is , therefore , heat , not cold . p. 63 PART II . The Comet . CHAPTER I. A COMET CAUSED THE DRIFT . Now , good reader , we have reasoned together up to this point . To be sure , I have done most of the talking , while you have indulged in what the Rev. Sydney Smith called , speaking of Lord Macaulay , " brilliant flashes of silence . " But I trust we agree thus far that neither water nor ice caused the Drift . Water and ice were doubtless associated with it , but neither produced it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solved ? First , we are to find something that instantaneously increased to a vast extent the heat of our planet , vaporized the seas , and furnished material for deluges of rain , and great storms of snow , and accumulations of ice north and south of the equator and in the high mountains . Secondly , we are to find something that , coming from above , smashed , pounded , and crushed " as with a maul , " and rooted up as with a plow , the gigantic rocks of the surface , and scattered them for hundreds of miles from their original location . p. 64 Thirdly , we are to find something which brought to the planet vast , incalculable masses of clay and gravel , which did not contain any of the earth 's fossils ; which , like the witches of Macbeth , Look not like th ' inhabitants of earth , And yet are on it ; " which are marked after a fashion which can not be found anywhere else on earth ; produced in a laboratory which has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to find something that would produce cyclonic convulsions upon a scale for which the ordinary operations of nature furnish us no parallel . Fifthly , we are to find some external force so mighty that it would crack the crust of the globe like an eggshell , lining its surface with great rents and seams , through which the molten interior boiled up to the light . Would a comet meet all these prerequisites ? I think it would . Let us proceed in regular order . p. 65 CHAPTER II . WHAT IS A COMET ? IN the first place , are comets composed of solid , liquid , or gaseous substances ? Are they something , or the next thing to nothing ? It has been supposed by some that they are made of the most attenuated gases , so imponderable that if the earth were to pass through one of them we would be unconscious of the contact . Others have imagined them to be mere smoke-wreaths , faint mists , so rarefied that the substance of one a hundred million miles long could , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Solomon 's brass bottles . But the results of recent researches contradict these views : Padre Secchi , of Rome , observed , in Donati 's comet , of 1858 , from the 15th to the 22d of October , that the nucleus threw out intermittingly from itself appendages having the form of brilliant , coma-shaped masses of incandescent substance twisted violently backward . He accounts for these very remarkable changes of configuration by the influence first of the sun 's heat upon the comet 's substance as it approached toward perihelion , and afterward by the production in the luminous emanations thus generated of enormous tides and perturbation derangements . Some of the most conspicuous of these luminous developments occurred on October 11th , when the comet was at its nearest approach to the earth , and on p. 66 October 17th , when it was nearest to the planet Venus . He has no doubt that the close neighborhood of the earth and Venus at those times was the effective cause of the sudden changes of aspect , and that those changes of aspect may be accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderable material . " Mr. Lockyer used the spectroscope to analyze the light of Coggia 's comet , and he established beyond question that  --  " Some of the rays of the comet were sent either from solid particles , or from vapor in a state of very high condensation , and also that beyond doubt other portions of the comet 's light issue from the vapor shining by its own inherent light . The light coming from the more dense constituents , and therefore giving a continuous colored spectrum , was , however , deficient in blue rays , and was most probably emitted by material substance at the low red and yellow stages of incandescence . " Padre Secchi , at Rome , believed he saw in the comet " carbon , or an oxide of carbon , as the source of the bright luminous bands , " and the Abb ? Moigno asks whether this comet may not be , after all , " un gigantesque diamant volatilis ? . " " Whatever may be the answer hereafter given to that question , the verdict of the spectroscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of a commingling of thin vapor and of denser particles , either compressed into the condition of solidification , or into some physical state approaching to that condition , and is therefore entirely in accordance with the notion formed on other grounds that the nucleus of the comet is a cluster of solid nodules or granules , and that the luminous coma and tail are jets and jackets of vapor , associated with the more dense ingredients , and swaying and streaming about them as heat and gravity , acting antagonistic ways , determine . " 1 1 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 210. p. 67 If the comet shines by reflected light , it is pretty good evidence that there must be some material substance there to reflect the light . " A considerable portion of the light of the comet is , nevertheless , borrowed from the sun , for it has one property belonging to it that only reflected light can manifest . It is capable of being polarized by prisms of double-refracting spar . Polarization of this character is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reflected from an imperfectly transparent medium . " 1 There is considerable difference of opinion as to whether the bead of the comet is solid matter or inflammable gas . " There is nearly always a point of superior brilliancy perceptible in the comet 's head , which is termed its nucleus , and it is necessarily a matter of pressing interest to determine what this bright nucleus is ; whether it is really a kernel of hard , solid substance , or merely a whiff of somewhat more condensed vapor . Newton , from the first , maintained that the comet is made partly of solid substance , and partly of an investment of thin , elastic vapors . If this is the case , it is manifest that the central nodule of dense substance should be capable of intercepting light when it passes in front of a more distant luminary , such as a fixed star . Comets , on this account , have been watched very narrowly whenever they have been making such a passage . On August 18 , 1774 , the astronomer Messier believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the nucleus of a comet which had concealed it the instant before . Another observer , Wartmann , in the year 1828 , noticed that the light of an eighth-magnitude star was temporarily quenched as the nucleus of Encke 's comet passed over it . " 2 Others , again , have held that stars have been seen through the comet 's nucleus . 1 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 207. 2 . Ibid. , p. 206. p. 68 Am ? d ? e Guillemin says : " Comets have been observed whose heads , instead of being nebulous , have presented the appearance of stars , with which , indeed , they have been confounded . " 1 When Sir William Herschel discovered the planet Urania , he thought it was a comet . Mr. Richard A. Proctor says : " The spectroscopic observations made by Mr. Huggins on the light of three comets show that a certain portion , at least , of the light of these objects is inherent . . . . The nucleus gave in each case three bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of glowing vapor. " 2 In one case , the comet-head seemed , as in the case of the , comet examined by Padre Secchi , to consist of pure carbon . In the great work of Dr. H. Schellen , of Cologne , annotated by Professor Huggins , we read : " That the nucleus of a comet can not be in itself a dark and solid body , such as the planets are , is proved by its great transparency ; but this does not preclude the possibility of its consisting of innumerable solid particles separated from one another , which , when illuminated by the sun , give , by the reflection of the solar light , the impression of a homogeneous mass . It has , therefore , been concluded that comets are either composed of a substance which , like gas in a state of extreme rarefaction , is perfectly transparent , or of small solid particles individually separated by intervening spaces through which the light of a star can pass without obstruction , and which , held together by mutual attraction , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through space like a cloud of dust . In any case the connection lately noticed by Schiaparelli , between comets and meteoric 1 . " The Heavens , " p. 239. 2 . Note to Guillemin 's " Heavens , " p. 261. p. 69 showers , seems to necessitate the supposition that in many comets a similar aggregation of particles seems to exist . " 1 I can not better sum up the latest results of research than by giving Dr. Schellen 's words in the work just cited : " By collating these various phenomena , the conviction can scarcely be resisted that the nuclei of comets not only emit their own light , which is that of a glowing gas , but also , together with the coma and the tail , reflect the light of the sun . There seems nothing , therefore , to contradict the theory that the mass of a comet may be composed of minute solid bodies , kept apart one from another in the same way as the infinitesimal particles forming a cloud of dust or smoke are held loosely together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most easily fusible constituents of these small bodies become wholly or partially vaporized , and in a condition of white heat overtake the remaining solid particles , and surround the nucleus in a self-luminous cloud of glowing vapor. " 2 Here , then , we have the comet : First , a more or less solid nucleus , on fire , blazing , glowing . Second , vast masses of gas heated to a white heat and enveloping the nucleus , and constituting the luminous head , which was in one case fifty times as large as the moon . Third , solid materials , constituting the tail ( possibly the nucleus also ) , which are ponderable , which reflect the sun 's light , and are carried along under the influence of the nucleus of the comet . Fourth , possibly in the rear of all these , attenuated volumes of gas , prolonging the tail for great distances . What are these solid materials ? 1 . " Spectrum Analysis , " 1872. 2 . Ibid. , p. 402. p. 70 Stones , and sand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the proof of this ? Simply this : that it is now conceded that meteoric showers are shreds and patches of cosmetic matter , dropped from the tail ; and meteoric showers are stones . " Schiaparelli considers meteors to be dispersed portions of the comet 's original substance ; that is , of the substance with which the comet entered the solar domain . Thus comets would come to be regarded as consisting of a multitude of relatively minute masses . " 1 Now , what is the genesis of a comet ? How did it come to be ? How was it born ? In the first place , there are many things which would connect them with our planets . They belong to the solar system ; they revolve around the sun . Says Am ? d ? e Guillemin : " Comets form a part of our solar system . Like the . planets , they revolve about the sun , traversing with very variable velocities extremely elongated orbits . " 2 We shall see reason to believe that they contain the same kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbits seem to be reminiscences of former planetary conditions : " All the comets , having a period not exceeding seven years , travel in the same direction around the sun as the planets . Among comets with periods less than eighty years long , five sixths travel in the same direction as the planets . " 3 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. v , p. 141. 2 . " The Heavens , " p. 239. 3 . American Cyclopedia , " vol. v , p. 141. p. 71 It is agreed that this globe of ours was at first a gaseous mass ; as it cooled it condensed like cooling steam into a liquid mass ; it became in time a molten globe of red-hot matter . As it cooled still further , a crust or shell formed around it , like the shell formed on an egg , and on this crust we dwell . While the crust is still plastic it shrinks as the mass within grows smaller by further cooling , and the wrinkles so formed in the crust are the depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as ages go on and the process of cooling progresses , the crust reaches a density when it supports itself , like a couple of great arches ; it no longer wrinkles ; it no longer follows downward the receding molten mass within ; mountains cease to be formed ; and at length we have a red-hot ball revolving in a shell or crust , with a space between the two , like the space between the dried and shrunken kernel of the nut and the nut itself . Volcanoes are always found on sea-shores or on islands . Why ? Through breaks in the earth the sea-water finds its way occasionally down upon the breast of the molten mass ; it is at once converted into gas , steam ; and as it expands it blows itself out through the escape-pipe of the volcano ; precisely as the gas formed by the gunpowder coming in contact with the fire of the percussion-cap , drives the ball out before it through the same passage by which it had entered . Hence , some one has said , " No water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so enters is small because of the smallness of the cavity between the shell of the earth and the molten globe within , this process is carried on upon a comparatively small scale , and is a safe one for the earth . But suppose the process of cooling to go on uninterruptedly until a vast space exists between the p. 72 crust and the core of the earth , and that some day a convulsion of the surface creates a great chasm in the crust , and the ocean rushes in and fills up part of the cavity ; a tremendous quantity of steam is formed , too great to escape by the aperture through which it entered , an explosion takes place , and the crust of the earth is blown into a million fragments . The great molten ball within remains intact , though sorely torn ; in its center is still the force we call gravity ; the fragments of the crust can not fly off into space ; they are constrained to follow the master-power lodged in the ball , which now becomes the nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomiting flames , and wearing itself away . The catastrophe has disarranged its course , but it still revolves in a prolonged orbit around the sun , carrying its broken d ? bris in a long trail behind it . This d ? bris arranges itself in a regular order : the largest fragments are on or nearest the head ; the smaller are farther away , diminishing in regular gradation , until the farthest extremity , the tail , consists of sand , dust , and gases . There is a continual movement of the particles of the tail , operated upon by the attraction and repulsion of the sun . The fragments collide and crash against each other ; by a natural law each stone places itself so that its longest diameter coincides with the direction of the motion of the comet ; hence , as they scrape against each other they mark each other with lines or stri ? , lengthwise of their longest diameter . The fine dust ground out by these perpetual collisions does not go off into space , or pack around the stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it falls to the rear and takes its place , like the small men of a regiment , in the farther part of the tail . Now , all this agrees with what science tells us of the constitution of clay . p. 73 " It is a finely levigated silico-aluminous earth  --  formed by the disintegration of feldspathic or granite rocks . " 1 The particles ground out of feldspar are finer than those derived from mica and hornblende , and we can readily understand how the great forces of gravity , acting upon the dust of the comet 's tail , might separate one from the other ; or how magnetic waves passing through the comet might arrange all the particles containing iron by themselves , and thus produce that marvelous separation of the constituents of the granite which we have found to exist in the Drift clays . If the destroyed world possessed no sedimentary rocks , then the entire material of the comet would consist of granitic stones and dust such as constitutes clays . The stones are reduced to a small size by the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not of the largest ; indeed , bowlders above four feet in diameter are comparatively seldom met with in the till . " 2 And this theory is corroborated by the fact that the eminent German geologist , Dr. Hahn , has recently discovered an entire series of organic remains in meteoric stones , of the class called chrondites , and which he identifies as belonging to classes of sponges , corals , and crinoids . Dr. Weinland , another distinguished German , corroborates these discoveries ; and he has also found fragments in these stones very much like the youngest marine chalk in the Gulf of Mexico ; and he thinks he sees , under the microscope , traces of vegetable growth . Francis Birgham says : 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " article " Clay . " 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 10. p. 74 " This entire ex-terrestrial fauna hitherto discovered , which already comprises about fifty different species , and which originates from different meteoric falls , even from some during the last century , conveys the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body with a unique creation , which in by-gone ages seems to have been overtaken by a grand catastrophe , during which it was broken up into fragments . " 1 When we remember that meteors are now generally believed to be the droppings of comets , we come very near to proof of the supposition that comets are the d ? bris of exploded planets ; for only on planets can we suppose that life existed , for there was required , for the growth of these sponges , corals , and crinoids , rocks , earth , water , seas or lakes , atmosphere , sunshine , and a range of temperature between the degree of cold where life is frozen up and the degree of heat in which it is burned up : hence , these meteors must be fragments of bodies possessing earth-like conditions . We know that the heavenly bodies are formed of the same materials as our globe . Dana says : " Meteoric stones exemplify the same chemical and crystallographic laws as the rocks of the earth , and have afforded no new element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed , therefore , that the granite crust of the exploded globe from which some comet was created was the source of the finely triturated material which we know as clay . But the clays are of different colors  --  white , yellow , red , and blue . 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " November , 1881 , p. 86. 2 . " Manual of Geology , " p. 3. p. 75 " The aluminous minerals contained in granite rocks are feldspar , mica , and hornblende . . . . Mica and hornblende generally contain considerable oxide of iron , while feldspar usually yields only a trace or none . Therefore clays which are derived from feldspar are light-colored or white , while those partially made up of decomposed mica or hornblende are dark , either bluish or red . " 1 The tail of the comet seems to be perpetually in motion . It is , says one writer , " continually changing and fluctuating as vaporous masses of cloud-like structure might be conceived to do , and in some instances there has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great comet of 1858 , Donati 's comet , which many now living will well remember , and which was of such size that when its head was near our horizon the extremity of the tail reached nearly to the zenith , illustrated this continual movement of the material of the tail ; that appendage shrank and enlarged millions of miles in length . Mr. Lockyer believed that he saw in Coggia 's comet the evidences of a whirling motion  --  " In which the regions of greatest brightness were caused by the different coils cutting , or appearing to cut , each other , and so in these parts leading to compression or condensation , and frequent collision of the luminous particles . " Olbers saw in a comet 's tail  --  " A sudden flash and pulsation of light which vibrated for several seconds through it , and the tail appeared during the continuance of the pulsations of light to be lengthened by several degrees and then again contracted . " 1 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " article " Clay . " 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 208 , 3 , " Cosmos , " vol. i , p. 143. p. 76 Now , in this perpetual motion , this conflict , these great thrills of movement , we are to find the source of the clays which cover a large part of our globe to a depth of hundreds of feet . Where are those exposures of granite on the face of the earth from which ice or water could have ground them ? Granite , I repeat , comes to the surface only in limited areas . And it must be remembered that clay is the product exclusively of granite ground to powder . The clays are composed exclusively of the products of disintegrated granite . They contain but a trace of lime or magnesia or organic matters , and these can be supposed to have been infiltrated into them after their arrival on the face of the earth. 1 Other kinds of rock , ground up , form sand . Moreover , we have seen that neither glaciers nor ice-sheets now produce such clays . We shall see , as we proceed , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , represent it as party-colored ; it is " speckled " in one legend ; spotted like a tiger in another ; sometimes it is a white boar in the heavens ; sometimes a blue snake ; sometimes it is red with the blood of the millions that are to perish . Doubtless these separate formations , ground out of the granite , from the mica , hornblende , or feldspar , respectively , may , as I have said , under great laws , acted upon by magnetism or electricity , have arranged themselves in separate lines or sheets , in the tail of the comet , and hence we find that the clays of one region are of one color , while those of another are of a different hue . Again , we shall see that the legends represent the monster as " winding , " undulating , writhing , twisting , fold over fold , precisely as the telescopes show us the comets do to-day . 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. iv , p. 650. p. 77 The very fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet , and that it is capable of expanding and contracting on an immense scale , is conclusive proof that it is composed of small , adjustable particles . The writer from whom I have already quoted , speaking of the extraordinary comet of 1843 , says : " As the comet moves past the great luminary , it sweeps round its tail as a sword may be conceived to be held out at arm's-length , and then waved round the head , from one side to the opposite . But a sword with a blade one hundred and fifty millions of miles long must be a somewhat awkward weapon to brandish round after this fashion . Its point would have to sweep through a curve stretching out more than six hundred millions of miles ; and , even with an allowance of two hours for the accomplishment of the movement , the flash of the weapon would be of such terrific velocity that it is not an easy task to conceive how any blade of connected material substance could bear the strain of the stroke . Even with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , the case would be one that it would be difficult for molecular cohesion to deal with . But that difficulty is almost infinitely increased when it is a substance of much lower cohesive tenacity than either iron or steel that has to be subjected to the strain . " There would be , at least , some mitigation of this difficulty if it were lawful to assume that the substance which is subjected to this strain was not amenable to the laws of ponderable existence ; if there were room for the notion that comets and their tails , which have to be brandished in such a stupendous fashion , were sky-spectres , immaterial phantoms , unreal visions of that negative shadow-kind which has been alluded to . This , however , unfortunately , is not a permissible alternative in the circumstances of the case . The great underlying and indispensable fact that the comet comes rushing up toward the sun out of space , and then shoots round that great center of attraction by the force of its own acquired and ever-increasing impetuosity ; the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elliptical , or , to speak more exactly , of conic-section , movement , permits of no doubt as to the condition of materiality . The comet is obviously drawn by the influence of the sun 's mass , and is subservient to that all-pervading law of sympathetic gravitation that is the sustaining bond of the material universe . It is ponderable substance beyond all question , and held by that chain of physical connection which it was the glory of Newton to discover . If the comet were not a material and ponderable substance it would not gravitate round the sun , and it would not move with increasing velocity as it neared the mighty mass until it had gathered the energy for its own escape in the enhanced and quickened momentum . In the first instance , the ready obedience to the attraction , and then the overshooting of the spot from which it is exerted , combine to establish the comet 's right to stand ranked at least among the ponderable bodies of space . " 1 And it is to the comet we must look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravel which go to constitute the Drift . " They have been usually attributed to the action of waves ; but the mechanical work of the ocean is mostly confined to its shores and soundings , where alone material exists in quantity within reach of the waves and currents. 2 . . . The eroding action is greatest for a short distance above the height of half-tide , and , except in violent storms , it is almost null below low-tide. " 3 But if any one will examine a sea-beach he will see , not a vast mass of pebbles perpetually rolling and grinding each other , but an expanse of sand . And this is to be expected ; for as soon as a part of the pebbles is , by the attrition of the waves , reduced to sand , the sand packs around the stones and arrests their further waste . To form such a mass of gravel as is found in the Drift we 1 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 202. 2 . Dana 's " Text Book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 must conceive of some way whereby , as soon as the sand is formed , it is removed from the stones while the work of attrition goes on . This process we can conceive of in a comet , if the finer detritus is constantly carried back and arranged in the order of the size of its particles . To illustrate my meaning : let one place any hard substance , consisting of large fragments , in a mortar , and proceed to reduce it with a pestle to a fine powder . The work proceeds rapidly at first , until a portion of the material is triturated ; you then find that the pulverized part has packed around and protected the larger fragments , and the work is brought to a stand-still . You have to remove the finer material if you would crush the pieces that remain . The sea does not separate the sand from the gravel ; it places all together at elevations where the waves can not reach them : " Waves or shallow soundings have some transporting power ; and , as they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They thus beat back , little by little , any detritus in the waters , preventing that loss to continents or islands which would take place if it were carried out to sea . " 1 The pebbles and gravel are soon driven by the waves up the shore , and beyond the reach of further wear ; 2 and " the rivers carry only silt to the ocean . " 3 The brooks and rivers produce much more gravel than the sea-shore : " The detritus brought down by rivers is vastly greater in quantity than the stones , sand , or clay produced by the wear of the coasts . " 4 1 . Dana 's " Text Book , " p. 288. 2 . Ibid. , p. 291. 3 . Ibid. , p. 302. 4 . Ibid. , p. 290. p. 80 But it would be absurd to suppose that the beds of rivers could have furnished the immeasurable volumes of gravel found over a great part of the world in the drift-deposits . And the drift-gravel is different from the gravel of the sea or rivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is something very peculiar about the shape of the stones . They are neither round and oval , like the pebbles in river-gravel , or the shingle of the sea-shore , nor are they sharply angular like newly-fallen d ? bris at the base of a cliff , although they more closely resemble the latter than the former . They are , indeed , angular in shape , but the sharp corners and edges have invariably been smoothed away . . . . Their shape , as will be seen , is by no means their most striking peculiarity . Each is smoothed , polished , and covered with stri ? or scratches , some of which are delicate as the lines traced by an etching-needle , others deep and harsh as the scores made by the plow upon a rock . And , what is worthy of note , most of the scratches , coarse and fine together , seem to run parallel to the longer diameter of the stones , which , however , are scratched in many other directions as well . " 1 Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a mass of ponderable , separated matter , such as stones , gravel , clay-dust , and gas . II . The nucleus gives out great heat and masses of burning gas . III . Luminous gases surround the nucleus . IV . The drift-clays are the result of the grinding up of granitic rocks . V. No such deposits , of anything like equal magnitude , could have been formed on the earth . 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 13. p. 81 VI . No such clays are now being formed under glaciers or Arctic ice-sheets . VII . These clays were ground out of the substance of the comet by the endless changes of position of the material of which it is composed as it flew through space , during its incalculable journeys in the long reaches of time . VIII . The earth-supplies of gravel are inadequate to account for the gravel of the drift-deposits . IX . Neither sea-beach nor rivers produce stones like those found in the Drift . I pass now to the next question . p. 82 CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the evidence I am about to present will satisfy you , not only that a comet might have struck the earth in the remote past , but , that the marvel is that the earth escapes collision for a single century , I had almost said for a single year . How many comets do you suppose there are within the limits of the solar system ( and remember that the solar system occupies but an insignificant portion of universal space ) ? Half a dozen-fifty-a hundred-you will answer . Let us put the astronomers on the witness-stand : Kepler affirmed that " COMETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE HEAVENS WITH AS MUCH PROFUSION AS FISHES IN THE OCEAN . " Think of that ! " Three or four telescopic comets are now entered upon astronomical records every year . Lalande had a list of seven hundred comets that had been observed in his time . " Arago estimated that the comets belonging to the solar system , within the orbit of Neptune , numbered seventeen million five hundred thousand ! Lambert regards five hundred millions as a very moderate estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p. 251. p. 83 And this does not include the monstrous fiery wanderers who may come to visit us , bringing their relations ### ORBITS OF THE PERIODIC COMETS. along , from outside the solar system  --  a sort of celestial immigrants whom no anti-Chinese legislation can keep away . Says Guillemin : " Leaving mere re-appearances out of the question , new comets are constantly found to arrive from the depths of space , describing around the sun orbits which testify to the attractive power of that radiant body ; and , for the p. 84 most part , going away for centuries , to return again from afar after their immense revolutions . " 1 But do these comets come anywhere near the orbit of the earth ? Look at the map on the preceding page , from Am ? d ? e Guillemin 's great work , " The Heavens , " page 244 , and you can answer the question for yourself . Here you see the orbit of the earth overwhelmed in a complication of comet-orbits . The earth , here , is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild beasts . And this diagram represents the orbits of only six comets out of those seventeen millions or five hundred millions ! It is a celestial game of ten-pins , with the solar system for a bowling-alley , and the earth waiting for a ten-strike . In 1832 the earth and Biela 's comet , as I will show more particularly hereafter , were both making for the same spot , moving with celestial rapidity , but the comet reached the point of junction one month before the earth did ; and , as the comet was not polite enough to wait for us to come up , this generation missed a revelation . " In the year 1779 Lexell 's comet approached so near to the earth that it would have increased the length of the sidereal year by three hours if its mass had been equal to the earth's. " 2 And this same comet did strike our fellow-planet , Jupiter . 1 . " The Heavens , " p. 251. 2 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 205. p. 85 In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of Jupiter 's satellites , and became entangled temporarily among them . But not one of the satellites altered its movements to the extent of a hair 's breadth , or of a tenth of an instant . " 1 But it must be remembered that we had no glasses then , and have none now , that could tell us what were the effects of this visitation upon the surface of Jupiter or its moons . The comet might have covered Jupiter one hundred feet  --  yes , one hundred miles  --  thick with gravel and clay , and formed clouds of its seas five miles in thickness , without our knowing anything about it . Even our best telescopes can only perceive on the moon 's surface  --  which is , comparatively speaking , but a few miles distant from us  --  objects of very great size , while Jupiter is sixteen hundred times farther away from us than the moon . But it is known that Lexell 's comet was very much demoralized by Jupiter . It first came within the influence of that planet in 1767 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Jupiter until 1779 , when it became entangled with Jupiter 's moons , and then it lost its orbit again , and was whisked off into infinite space , never more , perhaps , to be seen by human eyes . Is it not reasonable to suppose that an event which thus demoralized the comet may have caused it to cast down a considerable part of its material on the face of Jupiter ? Encke 's comet revolves around the sun in the short period of twelve hundred and five days , and , strange to say  --  " The period of its revolution is constantly diminishing ; so that , if this progressive diminution always follows the same rate , the time when the comet , continually 1 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 205. p. 86 describing a spiral , will be plunged into the incandescent mass of the sun can be calculated . " 1 The comet of 1874 , first seen by Coggia , at Marseilles , and called by his name , came between the earth and the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun . It traveled through this fierce blaze at the rate of three hundred and sixty-six miles per second ! Three hundred and sixty-six miles per second ! When a railroad-train moves at the rate of a mile per minute , we regard it as extraordinary speed ; but three hundred and sixty-six miles per second ! The mind fails to grasp it . When this comet was seen by Sir John Herschel , after it had made its grand sweep around the sun , it was not more than six times the breadth of the sun 's face away from the sun . And it had come careering through infinite space with awful velocity to this close approximation to our great luminary . And remember that these comets are no animalcul ? . They are monsters that would reach from the sun to the earth . And when we say that they come so close to the sun as in the above instances , it means peril to the earth by direct contact ; to say nothing of the results to our planet by the increased combustion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them fall upon the sun . We have seen , in the last chapter , that the great comet of 1843 possessed a tail one hundred and fifty million miles long ; that is , it would reach from the sun to the earth , and have over fifty million miles of tail to spare ; and it swept this gigantic appendage around in two hours , describing the are of a circle six hundred million miles long ! 1 . Guillemin , " The Heavens , " p. 247. p. 87 The mind fails to grasp these figures . Solar space is hardly large enough for such gyrations . And it must be remembered that this enormous creature actually grazed the surface of the sun . And it is supposed that this monster of 1843 , which was first seen in 1668 , returned , and was seen in the southern hemisphere in 1880  --  that is to say , it came back in thirty-seven years instead of one hundred and seventy-five years . Whereupon Mr. Proctor remarked : " If already the comet experiences such resistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun that its period undergoes a marked diminution , the effect must of necessity be increased at each return , and after only a few , possibly one or two , circuits , the comet will be absorbed by the sun . " On October 10 , 1880 , Lewis Swift , of Rochester , New York , discovered a comet which has proved to be of peculiar interest . From its first discovery it has presented no brilliancy of appearance , for , during its period of visibility , a telescope of considerable power was necessary to observe it . Since this comet , when in close proximity to the earth , was very faint indeed , its dimensions must be quite moderate . The illustration on page 88 gives the orbit of the earth and the orbit of this comet , and shows how closely they approached each other ; when at its nearest , the comet was only distant from the earth 0.13 of the distance of the earth from the sun . It comes back in eleven years , or in 1891 . On the 22d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly into view . It was unexpected , and advanced with tremendous rapidity . The illustration on page 89 will show how its flight intersected the orbit of the earth . At its nearest point , June 19th , it was distant p. 88 from the earth only 0.28 of the distance of the sun from the earth . Now , it is to be remembered that great attention has been paid during the past few years to searching for comets , and some of the results are here given . As many as five were discovered during the year 1881 . But not ### ORBIT OF EARTH AND COMET a few of the greatest of these strange orbs require thousands of years to complete their orbits . The period of the comet of July , 1844 , has been estimated at not less than one hundred thousand years ! Some of those that have flashed into sight recently have been comparatively small , and their contact with p. 89 ### THE EARTH 'S ORBIT the earth might produce but trifling results . Others , again , are constructed on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but children compared with the monsters that wander through space on orbits p. 90 that penetrate the remotest regions of the solar system , and even beyond it . When we consider the millions of comets around us , and when we remember how near some of these have come to us during the last few years , who will undertake to say that during the last thirty thousand , fifty thousand , or one hundred thousand years , one of these erratic luminaries , with blazing front and train of d ? bris , may not have come in collision with the earth ? p. 91 CHAPTER IV . THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE EARTH . IN this chapter I shall try to show what effect the contact of a comet must have had upon the earth and its inhabitants . I shall ask the reader to follow the argument closely first , that he may see whether any part of the theory is inconsistent with the well-established principles of natural philosophy ; and , secondly , that he may bear the several steps in his memory , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mighty catastrophe has been preserved in the legends of mankind , and precisely in the order in which reason tells us they must have occurred . In the first place , it is , of course , impossible at this time to say precisely how the contact took place ; whether the head of the comet fell into or approached close to the sun , like the comet of 1843 , and then swung its mighty tail , hundreds of millions of miles in length , moving at a rate almost equal to the velocity of light , around through a great are , and swept past the earth ;  --  the earth , as it were , going through the midst of the tail , which would extend for a vast distance beyond and around it . In this movement , the side of the earth , facing the advance of the tail , would receive and intercept the mass of material  --  stones , gravel , and the finely-ground-up-dust which , compacted by water , is now clay  --  which came in contact with it , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoralized , perhaps , in its orbit , like Lexell 's comet when it became entangled with Jupiter 's moons , but shorn of a comparatively small portion of its substance . The following engraving will illustrate my meaning . I can not give , even approximately , the proportions of the ### THE COMET SWEEPING PAST THE EARTH . objects represented , and thus show the immensity of the sun as compared with our insignificant little orb . In a picture showing the true proportions of the sun and earth , the sun would have to be so large that it would take up the entire page , while the earth would be but as a p. 93 ### THE SIDE OF THE EARTH STRUCK BY THE COMET left THE SIDE NOT STRUCK BY THE COMET right p. 94 pin-head . And I have not drawn the comet on a scale large enough as compared with the earth . If the reader will examine the map on page 93 , he will see that the distribution of the Drift accords with this theory . If we suppose the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comet , we will see why the Drift is supposed to be confined to Europe , Africa , and parts of America ; while the right-hand figure will show the half of the world that escaped . " The breadth of the tail of the great comet of 1811 , at its widest part , was nearly fourteen million miles , the length one hundred and sixteen million miles , and that of the second comet of the same year , one hundred and forty million miles . " 1 On page 95 is a representation of this monster . Imagine such a creature as that , with a head fifty times as large as the moon , and a tail one hundred and sixteen million miles long , rushing past this poor little earth of ours , with its diameter of only seven thousand nine hundred and twenty-five miles ! The earth , seven thousand nine hundred and twenty-five miles wide , would simply make a bullet-hole a pin-hole  --  closed up at once by the constant movements which take place in the tail of the comet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth facing the comet might be covered with hundreds of feet of d ? bris . Or , on the other hand , the comet may , as described in some of the legends , have struck the earth , head on , amid-ships , and the shock may have changed the angle of inclination of the earth 's axis , and thus have modified 1 . Schellen , " Spectrum Analysis , " p. 392. p. 95 permanently the climate of our globe ; and to this cause we might look also for the great cracks and breaks in the earth 's surface , which constitute the fiords of the sea-coast and the trap-extrusions of the continents ; and here , too , ### THE GREAT COMET OF 1811. might be the cause of those mighty excavations , hundreds of feet deep , in which are now the Great Lakes of America , and from which , as we have seen , great cracks radiate out in all directions , like the fractures in a pane of glass where a stone has struck it . The cavities in which rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is difficult to comprehend how an ice-sheet could dig out and root out a hole , as in the case of Lake Superior , nine hundred feet deep ! p. 96 And , if it did this , why were not similar holes excavated wherever there were ice-sheets  --  to wit , all over the northern and southern portions of the globe ? Why should a general cause produce only local results ? Sir Charles Lyell shows1 that glaciers do not cut out holes like the depressions in which the Great Lakes lie ; he also shows that these lakes are not due to a sinking down of the crust of the earth , because the strata are continuous and unbroken beneath them . He also calls attention to the fact that there is a continuous belt of such lakes , reaching from the northwestern part of the United States , through the Hudson Bay Territory , Canada , and Maine , to Finland , and that this belt does not reach below 50 ? north latitude in Europe and 40 ? in America . Do these lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the stri ? indicate , came from the north . The mass of Donati 's comet was estimated by MM . Faye and Roche at about the seven-hundredth part of the bulk of the earth . M. Faye says : " That is the weight of a sea of forty thousand square miles one hundred and nine yards deep ; and it must be owned that a like mass , animated with considerable velocity , might well produce , by its shock with the earth , very perceptible results . " 2 We have but to suppose , ( a not unreasonable supposition , ) that the comet which struck the earth was much larger than Donati 's comet , and we have the means of accounting for results as prodigious as those referred to . We have seen that it is difficult to suppose that ice produced the drift-deposits , because they are not found where ice certainly was , and they are found where ice certainly was not . But , if the reader will turn to the 1 . " Elements of Geology , " pp. 168,171 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p. 260. p. 97 illustration which constitutes the frontispiece of this volume , and the foregoing engraving on page 93 , he will see that the Drift is deposited on the earth , as it might have been if it had suddenly fallen from the heavens ; that is , it is on one side of the globe  --  to wit , the side that faced the comet as it came on . I think this map is substantially accurate . There is , however , an absence of authorities as to the details of the drift-distribution . But , if my theory is correct , the Drift probably fell at once . If it had been twenty-four hours in falling , the diurnal revolution would , in turn , have presented all sides of the earth to it , and the Drift would be found everywhere . And this is in accordance with what we know of the rapid movements of comets . They travel , as I have shown , at the rate of three hundred and sixty-six miles per second ; this is equal to twenty-one thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and ninety-six thousand miles per hour ! And this accords with what we know of the deposition of the Drift . It came with terrific force . It smashed the rocks ; it tore them up ; it rolled them over on one another ; it drove its material into the underlying rocks ; " it indented it into them , " says one authority , already quoted . It was accompanied by inconceivable winds  --  the hurricanes and cyclones spoken of in many of the legends . Hence we find the loose material of the original surface gathered up and carried into the drift-material proper ; hence the Drift is whirled about in the wildest confusion . Hence it fell on the earth like a great snow-storm driven by the wind . It drifted into all hollows ; it was not so thick on , or it was entirely absent from , the tops of hills ; it formed tails , precisely as snow does , on the leeward side of all obstructions . Glacier-ice is slow and plastic , p. 98 and folds around such impediments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following representation of a well-known feature of the Drift , called ### CRAG AND TAIL .  --  c , crag ; t , till . " crag and tail , " taken from Geikie 's work , 1 with the drifts formed by snow on the leeward side of fences or houses . The material runs in streaks , just as if blown by violent winds : " When cut through by rivers , or denuded by the action of the sea , ridges of bowlders are often seen to be inclosed within it . Although destitute of stratification , horizontal lines are found , indicating differences in texture and color . " 2 Geikie , describing the bowlder-clay , says : " It seems to have come from regions whence it is bard to see how they could have been borne by glaciers . As a rule it is quite unstratified , but traces of bedding are not uncommon . " " Sometimes it contains worn fossils , and fragments of shells , broken , crushed , and striated ; sometimes it contains bands of stones arranged in lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gusts and great whirls of the same material as the " till , " lifted up by the cyclones and mingled with blocks , rocks , bones , sands , fossils , earth , peat , and other matters , picked up with terrible 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 18. 2 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. vi , p. 112. p. 99 force from the face of the earth and poured down pell-mell on top of the first deposit of true " till . " In England ninety-four per cent of these stones found in this bowlder-clay are " stranger " stones ; that is to say , they do not belong to the drainage area in which they are found , but must have been carried there from great distances . But how about the markings , the stri ? , on the face of the surface-rocks below the Drift ? The answer is plain . D ? bris , moving at the rate of a million miles an hour , would produce just such markings . Dana says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks sometimes wear them smooth , or cover them with scratches and furrows , as observed by W. P. Blake on granite rocks at the Pass of San Bernardino , in California . Even quartz was polished and garnets were left projecting upon pedicels of feldspar . Limestone was so much worn as to look as if the surface had been removed by solution . Similar effects have been observed by Winchell in the Grand Traverse region , Michigan . Glass in the windows of houses on Cape Cod sometimes has holes worn through it by the same means . The hint from nature has led to the use of sand , driven by a blast , with or without steam , for cutting and engraving glass , and even for cutting and carving granite and other hard rocks . " 1 Gratacap describes the rock underneath the " till " as polished and oftentimes lustrous . " 2 But , it may be said , if it be true that d ? bris , driven by a terrible force , could have scratched and dented the rocks , could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But the fact is , the stri ? on the face of the rocks covered by the Drift are not continuous ; 1 . Dana 's " Text-Book , " p. 275. 2 . " Popular Science Monthly , " January , 1878 , p. 320. p. 100 they do not indicate a steady and constant pressure , such as would result where a mountainous mass of ice had caught a rock and held it , as it were , in its mighty hand , and , thus holding it steadily , had scored the rocks with it as it moved forward . " The groove is of irregular depth , its floor rising and falling , as though hitches had occurred when it was first planed , the great chisel meeting resistance , or being thrown up at points along its path . " 1 What other results would follow at once from contact with the comet ? We have seen that , to produce the phenomena of the Glacial age , it was absolutely necessary that it must have been preceded by a period of heat , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of the ocean . And we have seen that no mere ice-hypothesis gives us any clew to the cause of this . Would the comet furnish us with such heat ? Let me call another witness to the stand : In the great work of Am ? d ? e Guillemin , already cited , we read : " On the other hand , it seems proved that the light of the comets is , in part , at least , borrowed from the sun . But may they not also possess a light of their own ? And , on this last hypothesis , is this brightness owing to a kind of phosphorescence , or to the state of incandescence of the nucleus ? Truly , if the nuclei of comets be incandescent , the smallness of their mass would eliminate from the danger of their contact with the earth only one element of destruction : the temperature of the terrestrial atmosphere would be raised to an elevation inimical to the existence of organized beings ; and we should only escape the danger of a mechanical shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Ice Age , " in " Popular Science Monthly , " January , 1818 , p. 321. p. 101 one of being calcined in a many days passage through an immense furnace . " 1 Here we have a good deal more heat than is necessary to account for that vaporization of the seas of the globe which seems to have taken place during the Drift Age . But similar effects might be produced , in another way , even though the heat of the comet itself was inconsiderable . Suppose the comet , or a large part of it , to have fallen into the sun . The arrested motion would be converted into heat . The material would feed the combustion of the sun . Some have theorized that the sun is maintained by the fall of cosmetic matter into it . What would be the result ? Mr. Proctor notes that in 1866 a star , in the constellation Northern Cross , suddenly shone with eight hundred times its former luster , afterward rapidly diminishing in luster . In 1876 a new star in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be only perceptible by means of a telescope ; the luster of this star must have increased from five hundred to many thousand times . Mr. Proctor claims that should our sun similarly increase in luster even one hundred-fold , the glowing heat would destroy all vegetable and animal life on earth . There is no difficulty in seeing our way to heat enough , if we concede that a comet really struck the earth or fell into the sun . The trouble is in the other direction  --  we would have too much heat . We shall see , hereafter , that there is evidence in our rocks that in two different ages of the world , millions of years before the Drift period , the whole surface of the 1 . " The Heavens , " p. 260. p. 102 earth was actually fused and melted , probably by cosmetic contact . This earth of ours is really a great powder-magazine there is enough inflammable and explosive material about it to blow it into shreds at any moment . Sir Charles Lyell quotes , approvingly , the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , so full of combustible elements , stands a moment unexploded . " It needs but an infinitesimal increase in the quantity of oxygen in the air to produce a combustion which would melt all things . In pure oxygen , steel burns like a candle-wick . Nay , it is not necessary to increase the amount of oxygen in the air to produce terrible results . It has been shown1 that , of our forty-five miles of atmosphere , one fifth , or a stratum of nine miles in thickness , is oxygen . A shock , or an electrical or other convulsion , which would even partially disarrange or decompose this combination , and send an increased quantity of oxygen , the heavier gas , to the earth , would wrap everything in flames . Or the same effects might follow from any great change in the constitution of the water of the world . Water is composed of eight parts of oxygen and one part of hydrogen . " The intensest heat by far ever yet produced by the blow-pipe is by the combustion of these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that the combination which produced the intensest heat was that in which the two gases were in the precise proportions found in water. 2 We may suppose that this vast heat , whether it came from the comet , or the increased action of the sun , preceded the fall of the d ? bris of the comet by a few minutes or a few hours . We have seen the surface-rocks 1 . " Science and Genesis , " p. 125. 2 . Ibid. , p. 127. p. 103 described as lustrous . The heat may not have been great enough to melt them  --  it may merely have softened them ; but when the mixture of clay , gravel , striated rocks , and earth-sweepings fell and rested on them , they were at once hardened and almost baked ; and thus we can account for the fact that the " till , " which lies next to the rocks , is so hard and tough , compared with the rest of the Drift , that it is impossible to blast it , and exceedingly difficult even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by workmen and contractors than any of the true rocks . Professor Hartt shows that there is evidence that some cause , prior to but closely connected with the Drift , did decompose the surface-rocks underneath the Drift to great depths , changing their chemical composition and appearance . Professor Hartt says : " In Brazil , and in the United States in the vicinity of New York city , the surface-rocks , under the Drift , are decomposed from a depth of a few inches to that of a hundred feet . The feldspar has been converted into slate , and the mica has parted with its iron . " 1 Professor Hartt tries to account for this metamorphosis by supposing it to have been produced by warm rains ! But why should there be warm rains at this particular period ? And why , if warm rains occurred in all ages , were not all the earlier rocks similarly changed while they were at the surface ? Heusser and Clarez suppose this decomposition of the rocks to be due to nitric acid . But where did the nitric acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presence on the earth , just before the Drift struck it , of that conflagration which we shall find described in so many legends . 1 . " The Geology of Brazil , " p. 25. p. 104 And certainly the presence of ice could not decompose rocks a hundred feet deep , and change their chemical constitution . Nothing but heat could do it . But we have seen that the comet is self-luminous  --  that is , it is in process of combustion ; it emits great gushes and spouts of luminous gases ; its nucleus is enveloped in a cloak of gases . What effect would these gases have upon our atmosphere ? First , they would be destructive to animal life . But it does not follow that they would cover the whole earth . If they did , all life must have ceased . They may have fallen in places here and there , in great sheets or patches , and have caused , until they burned themselves out , the conflagrations which the traditions tell us accompanied the great disaster . Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our atmosphere they may have helped to produce the marked difference between the pre-glacial and our present climate . What did these gases consist of ? Here that great discovery , the spectroscope , comes to our aid . By it we are able to tell the elements that are being consumed in remote stars ; by it we have learned that comets are in part self-luminous , and in part shine by the reflected light of the sun ; by it we are even able to identify the very gases that are in a state of combustion in comets . In Schellen 's great work1 I find a cut ( see next page ) comparing the spectra of carbon with the light emitted by two comets observed in 1868  --  Winnecke 's comet and Brorsen 's comet . Here we see that the self-luminous parts of these comets 1 . " Spectrum Analysis , " p. 396. p. 105 burned with substantially the same spectrum as that emitted by burning carbon . The inference is irresistible that these comets were wrapped in great masses of carbon in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ### SOLAR SPECTRUM Padre Secchi , the great Roman astronomer , examined Dr. Winnecke 's comet on the 21st of June , 1868 , and concluded that the light from the self-luminous part was produced by carbureted hydrogen . We shall see that the legends of the different races speak of the poison that accompanied the comet , and by which great multitudes were slain ; the very waters that p. 106 first flowed through the Drift , we are told , were poisonous . We have but to remember that carbureted hydrogen is the deadly fire-damp of the miners to realize what effect great gusts of it must have had on animal life . We are told1 that it burns with a yellow flame when subjected to great heat , and some of the legends , we will see hereafter , speak of the " yellow hair " of the comet that struck the earth . And we are further told that , " when it , carbureted hydrogen , is mixed in due proportion with oxygen or atmospheric air , a compound is produced which explodes with the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carbureted hydrogen , olefiant gas , is deadly to life , burns with a white light , and when mixed with three or four volumes of oxygen , or ten or twelve of air , it explodes with terrific violence . We shall see , hereafter , that many of the legends tell us that , as the comet approached the earth , that is , as it entered our atmosphere and combined with it , it gave forth world-appalling noises , thunders beyond all earthly thunders , roarings , howlings , and hissings , that shook the globe . If a comet did come , surrounded by volumes of carbureted hydrogen , or carbon combined with hydrogen , the moment it reached far enough into our atmosphere to supply it with the requisite amount of oxygen or atmospheric air , precisely such dreadful explosions would occur , accompanied by noises similar to those described in the legends . Let us go a step further : Let us try to conceive the effects of the fall of the material of the comet upon the earth . We have seen terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyclop ? dia , " vol. iii , p. 776. p. 107 but fancy a storm of stones and gravel and clay-dust !  --  not a mere shower either , but falling in black masses , darkening the heavens , vast enough to cover the world in many places hundreds of feet in thickness ; leveling valleys , tearing away and grinding down hills , changing the whole aspect of the habitable globe . Without and above it roars the earthquaking voice of the terrible explosions ; through the drifts of d ? bris glimpses are caught of the glaring and burning monster ; while through all and over all is an unearthly heat , under which rivers , ponds , lakes , springs , disappear as if by magic . Now , reader , try to grasp the meaning of all this description . Do not merely read the words . To read aright , upon any subject , you must read below the words , above the words , and take in all the relations that surround the words . So read this record . Look out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Imagine an instantaneous descent of granite-sand and gravel sufficient to smash and crush these trees to the ground , to bury their trunks , and to cover the earth one hundred to five hundred feet higher than the elevation to which their tops now reach ! And this not alone here in your garden , or over your farm , or over your township , or over your county , or over your State ; but over the whole continent in which you dwell  --  in short , over the greater part of the habitable world ! Are there any words that can draw , even faintly , such a picture  --  its terror , its immensity , its horrors , its destructiveness , its surpassal of all earthly experience and imagination ? And this human ant-hill , the world , how insignificant would it be in the grasp of such a catastrophe ! Its laws , its temples , its libraries , its religions , its armies , its mighty nations , would be but as the veriest p. 108 stubble  --  dried grass , leaves , rubbish-crushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , lo ! through the darkness , the wretches not beaten down and whelmed in the d ? bris , but scurrying to mountain-caves for refuge , have a new terror : the cry passes from lip to lip , " The world is on fire ! " The head of the comet sheds down fire . Its gases have fallen in great volumes on the earth ; they ignite ; amid the whirling and rushing of the d ? bris , caught in cyclones , rises the glare of a Titanic conflagration . The winds beat the rocks against the rocks ; they pick up sand-heaps , peat-beds , and bowlders , and whirl them madly in the air . The heat increases . The rivers , the lakes , the ocean itself , evaporate . And poor humanity ! Burned , bruised , wild , crazed , stumbling , blown about like feathers in the hurricanes , smitten by mighty rocks , they perish by the million ; a few only reach the shelter of the caverns ; and thence , glaring backward , look out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fled to these hiding-places : the terrified denizens of the forest , the domestic animals of the fields , with the instinct which in great tempests has driven them into the houses of men , follow the refugees into the caverns . We shall see all this depicted in the legends . The first effect of the great heat is the vaporization of the waters of the earth ; but this is arrested long before it has completed its work . Still the heat is intense  --  how long it lasts , who shall tell ? An Arabian legend indicates years . The stones having ceased to fall , the few who have escaped  --  and they are few indeed , for many are shut up for ever by the clay-dust and gravel in their hiding-places , p. 109 and on many others the convulsions of the earth have shaken down the rocky roofs of the caves  --  the few survivors come out , or dig their way out , to look upon a changed and blasted world . No cloud is in the sky , no rivers or lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caverns are left ; the sun , a ball of fire , glares in the bronze heavens . It is to this period that the Norse legend of Mimer 's well , where Odin gave an eye for a drink of water , refers . But gradually the heat begins to dissipate . This is a signal for tremendous electrical action . Condensation commences . Never has the air held such incalculable masses of moisture ; never has heaven 's artillery so rattled and roared since earth began ! Condensation means clouds . We will find hereafter a whole body of legends about " the stealing of the clouds " and their restoration . The veil thickens . The sun 's rays are shut out . It grows colder ; more condensation follows . The heavens darken . Louder and louder bellows the thunder . We shall see the lightnings represented , in myth after myth , as the arrows of the rescuing demi-god who saves the world . The heat has carried up perhaps one fourth of all the water of the world into the air . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm darkens the heavens . In this case it is black night . A pall of dense cloud , many miles in thickness , enfolds the earth . No sun , no moon , no stars , can be seen . " Darkness is on the face of the deep . " Day has ceased to be . Men stumble against each other . All this we shall find depicted in the legends . The overloaded atmosphere begins to discharge itself . The great work of restoring the waters of the ocean to the ocean begins . It grows colder  --  colder  --  colder . The pouring rain turns into snow , and settles on all the uplands and north countries ; snow falls on p. 110 snow ; gigantic snow-beds are formed , which gradually solidify into ice . While no mile-thick ice-sheet descends to the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Mexico , glaciers intrude into all the valleys , and the flora and fauna of the temperate regions become arctic ; that is to say , only those varieties of plants and animals survive in those regions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call arctic . In the midst of this darkness and cold and snow , the remnants of poor humanity wander over the face of the desolated world ; stumbling , awe-struck , but filled with an insatiable hunger which drives them on ; living upon the bark of the few trees that have escaped , or on the bodies of the animals that have perished , and even upon one another . All this we shall find plainly depicted in the legends of mankind , as we proceed . Steadily , steadily , steadily  --  for days , weeks , months , years  --  the rains and snows fall ; and , as the clouds are drained , they become thinner and thinner , and the light increases . It has now grown so light that the wanderers can mark the difference between night and day . " And the evening and the morning were the first day . " Day by day it grows lighter and warmer ; the piled-up snows begin to melt . It is an age of tremendous floods . All the low-lying parts of the continents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rivers are floods ; the Drift d ? bris is cut into by the waters , re-arranged , piled up in what is called the stratified , secondary , or Champlain drift . Enormous river-valleys are cut out of the gravel and clay . The seeds and roots of trees and grasses , uncovered by the rushing torrents , and catching the increasing p. 111 warmth , begin to put forth green leaves . The sad and parti-colored earth , covered with white , red , or blue clays and gravels , once more , wears a fringe of green . The light increases . The warmth lifts up part of the water already cast down , and the outflow of the steaming ice-fields , and pours it down again in prodigious floods . It is an age of storms . The people who have escaped gather together . They know the sun is coming back . They know this desolation is to pass away . They build great fires and make human sacrifices to bring back the sun . They point and guess where he will appear ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all this is told in the legends . At last the great , the godlike , the resplendent luminary breaks through the clouds and looks again upon the wrecked earth . Oh , what joy , beyond all words , comes upon those who see him ! They fall upon their faces . They worship him whom the dread events have taught to recognize as the great god of life and light . They burn or cast down their animal gods of the pre-glacial time , and then begins that world-wide worship of the sun which has continued down to our own times . And all this , too , we shall find told in the legends . And from that day to this we live under the influence of the effects produced by the comet . The mild , eternal summer of the Tertiary age is gone . The battle between the sun and the ice-sheets continues . Every north wind brings us the breath of the snow ; every south wind is part of the sun 's contribution to undo the comet 's work . A continual amelioration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if no new catastrophe falls on the earth , our remote posterity will yet see the last snow-bank p. 112 of Greenland melted , and the climate of the Eocene reestablished in Spitzbergen . " It has been suggested that the warmth of the Tertiary climate was simply the effect of the residual heat of a globe cooling from incandescence , but many facts disprove this . For example , the fossil plants found in our Lower Cretaceous rocks in Central North America indicate a temperate climate in latitude 35 ? to 40 ? in the Cretaceous age . The coal-flora , too , and the beds of coal , indicate a moist , equable , and warm but not hot climate in the Carboniferous age , millions of years before the Tertiary , and three thousand miles farther south than localities where magnolias , tulip-trees , and deciduous cypresses , grew in the latter age . Some learned and cautious geologists even assert that there have been several Ice periods , one as far back as the Devonian . " 1 The ice-fields and wild climate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and North America , represent the residuum of the refrigeration caused by the evaporation due to the comet 's heat , and the long absence of the sun during the age of darkness . Every visitation of a comet would , therefore , necessarily eventuate in a glacial age , which in time would entirely pass away . And our storms are bred of the conflict between the heat and cold of the different latitudes . Hence , it may be , that the Tertiary climate represented the true climate of the earth , undisturbed by comet catastrophes ; a climate equable , mild , warm , stormless . Think what a world this would be without tempests , cyclones , ice , snow , or cold ! Let us turn now to the evidences that man dwelt on the earth during the Drift , and that he has preserved recollections of the comet to this day in his myths and legends . 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " July , 1876 , p. 283. p. 113 PART III The Legends CHAPTER I. THE NATURE OF MYTHS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeats the minds of all former generations ; the construction of the intellectual nature varies no more , from age to age , than the form of the body or the color of the skin ; the generations feel the same emotions , and think the same thoughts , and use the same expressions . And this is to be expected , for the brain is as much a part of the inheritable , material organization as the color of the eyes or the shape of the nose . The minds of men move automatically : no man thinks because he intends to think ; he thinks , as he hungers and thirsts , under a great primal necessity ; his thoughts come out from the inner depths of his being as the flower is developed by forces rising through the roots of the plant . The female bird says to herself , " The time is propitious , and now , of my own free will , and under the operation of my individual judgment , I will lay a nestful of eggs and batch a brood of children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physical necessity , which has constrained all its ancestors from the beginning of time , p. 114 and which will constrain all its posterity to the end of time ; that its will is nothing more than an expression of age , development , sunlight , food , and " the skyey influences . " If it were otherwise it would be in the power of a generation to arrest the life of a race . All great thoughts are inspirations of God . They are part of the mechanism by which he advances the race ; they are new varieties created out of old genera . There come bursts of creative force in history , when great thoughts are born , and then again Brahma , as the Hindoos say , goes to sleep for ages .

" It came as the Arabian tree distilled its " medicinal gum " ; it was the mere expression of an internal force , as much beyond his control as the production of the gum was beyond the control of the tree . But in primitive races mind repeats mind for thousands of years . If a tale is told at a million hearth-fires , the probabilities are small , indeed , that any innovation at one hearth-fire , however ingenious , will work its way into and modify the narration at all the rest . There is no printing-press to make the thoughts of one man the thoughts of thousands . While the innovator is modifying p. 115 the tale , to his own satisfaction , to his immediate circle of hearers , the narrative is being repeated in its unchanged form at all the rest . The doctrine of chances is against innovation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale is told to the new generation  --  to the little ones sitting around with open eyes and gaping mouths  --  they naturally ask , " Where did all this occur ? " The narrator must satisfy this curiosity , and so he replies , " On yonder mountain-top , " or " In yonder cave . " The story has come down without its geography , and a new geography is given it . Again , an ancient word or name may have a signification in the language in which the story is told different from that which it possessed in the original dialect , and , in the effort to make the old fact and the new language harmonize , the story-teller is forced , gradually , to modify the narrative ; and , as this lingual difficulty occurs at every fireside , at every telling , an ingenious explanation comes at last to be generally accepted , and the ancient myth remains dressed in a new suit of linguistic clothes . But , as a rule , simple races repeat ; they do not invent . One hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the utmost contempt was felt for all legends . Whatever had been written down was regarded as certainly true ; whatever had not been written down was necessarily false . We are reminded of that intellectual old brute , Dr. Samuel Johnson , trampling poor Macpherson under foot , like an enraged elephant , for daring to say that he had collected from the mountaineers of wild Scotland the poems of Ossian , and that they had been transmitted , from mouth to mouth , through ages . But the great epic of the son of Fingal will survive , part of the widening p. 116 heritage of humanity , while Johnson is remembered only as a coarse-souled , ill-mannered incident in the development of the great English people . But as time rolled on it was seen that the greater part of history was simply recorded legends , while all the rest represented the passions of factions , the hates of sects , or the servility and venality of historians . Men perceived that the common belief of antiquity , as expressed in universal tradition , was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few prejudiced individuals . And then grave and able men ,  --  philosophers , scientists ,  --  were seen with note-books and pencils , going out into Hindoo villages , into German cottages , into Highland huts , into Indian tepees , in short , into all lands , taking down with the utmost care , accuracy , and respect , the fairy-stories , myths , and legends of the people ;  --  as repeated by old peasant-women , " the knitters in the sun , " or by " gray-haired warriors , famous ? d for fights . " And , when they came to put these narratives in due form , and , as it were , in parallel columns , it became apparent that they threw great floods of light upon the history of the world , and especially upon the question of the unity of the race . They proved that all the nations were repeating the same stories , in some cases in almost identical words , just as their ancestors had heard them , in some most ancient land , in " the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German , Gaul , Gael , Greek , Roman , Hindoo , Persian , Egyptian , Arabian , and the red-people of America , dwelt together under the same roof-tree and used the same language . But , above all , these legends prove the absolute fidelity of the memory of the races . We are told that the bridge-piles driven by the Romans , two thousand years ago , in the rivers of Europe , p. 117 from which the surrounding waters have excluded the decaying atmosphere , have remained altogether unchanged in their condition . If this has been the case for two thousand years , why would they not remain unchanged for ten thousand , for a hundred thousand years ? If the ice in which that Siberian mammoth was incased had preserved it intact for a hundred years , or a thousand years , why might it not have preserved it for ten thousand , for a hundred thousand years ? Place a universal legend in the minds of a race , let them repeat it from generation to generation , and time ceases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great foe to its perpetuation  --  civilization . Civilization brings with it a contempt for everything which it can not understand ; skepticism becomes the synonym for intelligence ; men no longer repeat ; they doubt ; they dissect ; they sneer ; they reject ; they invent . If the myth survives this treatment , the poets take it up and make it their stock in trade : they decorate it in a masquerade of frippery and finery , feathers and furbelows , like a clown dressed for a fancy ball ; and the poor barbarian legend survives at last , if it survives at all , like the Conflagration in Ovid or King Arthur in Tennyson  --  a hippopotamus smothered in flowers , jewels , and laces . Hence we find the legends of the primitive American Indians adhering quite closely to the events of the past , while the myths that survive at all among the civilized nations of Europe are found in garbled forms , and . only among the peasantry of remote districts . In the future more and more attention will be given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reliable , and as reaching farther back in time than many things which we call history . Thoughtful men will p. 118 analyze them , despising nothing ; like a chemist who resolves some compound object into its original elements  --  the very combination constituting a history of the object . H. H. Bancroft describes myths as  --  " A mass of fragmentary truth and fiction , not open to rationalistic criticism ; a partition wall of allegories , built of dead facts cemented with wild fancies ; it looms ever between the immeasurable and the measurable past . " But he adds : " Never was there a time in the history of philosophy when the character , customs , and beliefs of aboriginal man , and everything appertaining to him , were held in such high esteem by scholars as at present . " " It is now a recognized principle of philosophy that no religious belief , however crude , nor any historical tradition , however absurd , can be held by the majority of a people for any considerable time as true , without having had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An universal myth points to two conclusions : First , that it is based on some fact . Secondly , that it dates back , in all probability , to the time when the ancestors of the races possessing it had not yet separated . A myth should be analyzed carefully ; the fungi that have attached themselves to it should be brushed off ; the core of fact should be separated from the decorations and errors of tradition . But above all , it must be remembered that we can not depend upon either the geography or the chronology of a myth . As I have shown , there is a universal tendency to give the old story a new habitat , and hence we have Ararats and Olympuses all over the world . In the same 1 . " The Native Races of America , " vol. iii , p. 14. p. 119 way the myth is always brought down and attached to more recent events : " All over Europe-in Germany , France , Spain , Switzerland , England , Scotland , Ireland  --  the exploits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Nibelungen Lied , have been ascribed , in the folk-lore and ballads of the people , to Barbarossa , Charlemagne , Boabdil , Charles V , William Tell , Arthur , Robin Hood , Wallace , and St. Patrick . " 1 In the next place , we must remember how impossible it is for the mind to invent an entirely new fact . What dramatist or novelist has ever yet made a plot which did not consist of events that had already transpired somewhere on earth ? He might intensify events , concentrate and combine them , or amplify them ; but that is all . Men in all ages have suffered from jealousy ,  --  like Othello ; have committed murders ,  --  like Macbeth ; have yielded to the sway of morbid minds ,  --  like Hamlet ; have stolen , lied , and debauched ,  --  like Falstaff ;  --  there are Oliver Twists , Bill Sykeses , and Nancies ; Micawbers , Pickwicks , and Pecksniffs in every great city . There is nothing in the mind of man that has not preexisted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw or heard of an elephant , drawing a picture of such a two-tailed creature ? It was thought at one time that man had made the flying-dragon out of his own imagination ; but we now know that the image of the pterodactyl had simply descended from generation to generation . Sindbad 's great bird , the roc , was considered a flight of the Oriental fancy , until science revealed the bones of the dinornis . All the winged beasts breathing fire are simply a recollection of the comet . In fact , even with the patterns of nature before it , the 1 . Bancroft , " Native Races , " note , vol. iii , p. 17. p. 120 human mind has not greatly exaggerated them : it has never drawn a bird larger than the dinornis or a beast greater than the mammoth . It is utterly impossible that the races of the whole world , of all the continents and islands , could have preserved traditions from the most remote ages , of a comet having struck the earth , of the great heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the return of the sun , and yet these things have had no basis of fact . It was not possible for the primitive mind to have imagined these things if they had never occurred . p. 121 CHAPTER II . DID MAN EXIST BEFORE THE DRIFT ? FIRST , let us ask ourselves this question , Did man exist before the Drift ? If he did , he must have survived it ; and he could hardly have passed through it without some remembrance of such a terrible event surviving in the traditions of the race . If he did not exist before the Drift , of course , no myths descriptive of it could have come down to us . This preliminary question must , then , be settled by testimony . Let us call our witnesses " The pal ? olithic hunter of the mid and late Pleistocene river-deposits in Europe belongs , as we have already shown , to a fauna which arrived in Britain before the lowering of the temperature produced glaciers and icebergs in our country ; he may , therefore , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely over the earth before the Drift ; therefore , he had lived long on the earth . His remains have been found in Scotland , England , Ireland , France , Spain , Italy , Greece ; in Africa , in Palestine , in India , and in the United States. 2 " Man was living in the valley of the lower Thames before the Arctic mammalia had taken full possession of 1 . Dawkins 's " Early Man in Britain , " p. 169. 2 . Ibid. , pp. 165 , 166. p. 122 the valley of the Thames , and before the big-nosed rhinoceros had become extinct . " 1 Mr. Tidderman2 writes that , among a number of bones obtained during the exploration of the Victoria Cave , near Settle , Yorkshire , there is one which Mr. Busk has identified as human . Mr. Busk says : " The bone is , I have no doubt , human ; a portion of an unusually clumsy fibula , and in that respect not unlike the same bone in the Mentone skeleton . " The deposit from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stiff glacial clay , containing ice-scratched bowlders .

" 3 The evidences are numerous , as I have shown , that when these deposits came upon the earth the face of the land was above the sea , and occupied by plants and animals . ### SECTION AT ST . ACHEUL . The accompanying cut , taken from Sir John Lubbock 's " Prehistoric Times , " page 364 , represents the strata at St. Acheul , near Amiens , France . 1 . Dawkins 's " Early Man in Britain , " p. 137. 2 . " Nature , " November 6 , 1873. 3 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 475. p. 123 The upper stratum ( a ) represents a brick earth , four to five feet in thickness , and containing a few angular flints . The next ( b ) is a thin layer of angular gravel , one to two feet in thickness . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to six feet in thickness . The lowest deposit ( d ) immediately overlies the chalk ; it is a bed of partially rounded gravel , and , in this , human implements of flint have been found . The spot was used in the early Christian period as a cemetery ; f represents one of the graves , made fifteen hundred years ago ; e represents one of the ancient coffins , of which only the nails and clamps are left , every particle of the wood having perished . And , says Sir John Lubbock : " It is especially at the lower part " of these lowest deposits " that the flint implements occur . " The bones of the mammoth , the wild bull , the deer , the horse , the rhinoceros , and the reindeer are found near the bottom of these strata mixed with the flint implements of men . " All the fossils belong to animals which live on land ; . . . we find no marine remains . " 2 Remember that the Drift is unfossiliferous and unstratified ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in its lower part , or caught between it and the rocks below it , and you can form a vivid picture of the sudden and terrible catastrophe . The trees were imbedded with man and the animals ; the bones of men , smaller and more friable , probably perished , ground up in the tempest , while only their flint implements and the great bones of the larger animals , hard as stones , remain to tell the dreadful story . And yet some human bones 1 . " Prehistoric Times , " p. 366. 2 . Ibid. , pp. 366 , 367. p. 124 have been found ; a lower jaw-bone was discovered in a pit at Moulinguignon , and a skull and other bones were found in the valley of the Seine by M. Bertrand. 1 And these discoveries have not been limited to river-gravels . In the Shrub Hill gravel-bed in England , " in the lowest part of it , numerous flint implements of the pal ? olithic type have been discovered . " 2 We have , besides these sub-drift remains , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  men who may have looked upon the very comet that smote the world . They represent two widely different races . One is " the Engis skull , " so called from the cave of Engis , near Li ? ge , where it was found by Dr. Schmerling . " It is a fair average human skull , which might , " says Huxley , " have belonged to a philosopher , or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage . " 3 It represents a ### THE ENGIS SKULL . civilized , if not a cultivated , race of men . It may represent a victim , a prisoner , held for a cannibalistic feast or a trader from a more civilized region . 1 . " Prehistoric Times , " p. 360. 2 . Ibid. , p. 351. 3 . " Man 's Place in Nature , " p. 156. p. 125 In another cave , in the Neanderthal , near Hochdale , between D ? sseldorf and Elberfeld , a skull was found which is the most ape-like of all known human crania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barbarian brute of the rudest possible type . Here is a representation of it . ### THE NEANDERTHAL SKULL . I beg the reader to remember these skulls when he comes to read , a little further on , the legend told by an American Indian tribe of California , describing the marriage between the daughter of the gods and a son of the grizzly bears , from which union , we are told , came the Indian tribes . These skulls represent creatures as far apart , I was about to say , as gods and bears . The " Engis skull , " with its full frontal brain-pan , its fine lines , and its splendidly arched dome , tells us of ages of cultivation and development in some favored center of the race ; while the horrible and beast-like proportions of " the Neanderthal skull " speak , with no less certainty , of undeveloped , brutal , savage man , only a little above the gorilla in capacity ;  --  a prowler , a robber , a murderer , a cave-dweller , a cannibal , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on in the legends of the races on both sides of the Atlantic , that they all looked to some central land , east of America and west of Europe , some island of the ocean , where dwelt a godlike race , and where alone , it would seem , the human race was preserved to repeople the earth , while these brutal representatives of the race , the Neanderthal people , were crushed out . And this is not mere theorizing . It is conceded , as the result of most extensive scientific research : 1 . That the great southern mammalia perished in Europe when the Drift came upon the earth . 2 . It is conceded that these two skulls are associated with the bones of these locally extinct animals , mingled together in the same deposits . 3 . The conclusion is , therefore , logically irresistible , that these skulls belonged to men who lived during or before the Drift Age . Many authorities support this proposition that man  --  pal ? olithic man , man of the mammoth and the mastodon  --  existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having occupied the English caves for untold ages , pal ? olithic man disappeared for ever , and with him vanished many animals now either locally or wholly extinct . " 1 Above the remains of man in these caves comes a deposit of stalagmite , twelve feet in thickness , indicating a vast period of time during which it was being formed , and during this time man was absent. 2 Above this stalagmite comes another deposit of cave-earth : " The deposits immediately overlying the stalagmite and cave-earth contain an almost totally different assemblage 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 411. 2 . Ibid. , p. 411. p. 127 of animal remains , along with relics of the neolithic , bronze , iron , and historic periods . " There is no passage , but , on the contrary , a sharp and abrupt break between these later deposits and the underlying pal ? olithic accumulations. " 1 Here we have the proof that man inhabited these caves for ages before the Drift ; that he perished with the great mammals and disappeared ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no men and few animals dwelt in Europe . But some fragment of the human race had escaped elsewhere , in some other region ; there it multiplied and replenished the earth , and gradually extended and spread again over Europe , and reappeared in the cave-deposits above the stalagmite . And , in like manner , the animals gradually came in from the regions on which the Drift had not fallen . But the revelations of the last few years prove , not only that man lived during the Drift age , and that he dwelt on the earth when the Drift fell , but that he can be traced backward for ages before the Drift ; and that he was contemporary with species of great animals that had run their course , and ceased to exist centuries , perhaps thousands of years , before the Drift . I quote a high authority : " Most of the human relics of any sort have been found in the more recent layers of the Drift . They have been discovered , however , not only in the older Drift , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , in the Upper Pliocene at St. Prest , near Chartres , were found stone implements and cuttings on bone , in connection with relics of a long-extinct elephant ( Elephas meridionalis ) that is wholly lacking in the Drift . During the past two years the evidences of human existence in the Tertiary period , i. e. , previous to the age of mammoths 1 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 411. p. 128 of the Diluvial period , have multiplied , and by their multiplication give cumulative confirmation to each other . Even in the lower strata of the Miocene ( the middle Tertiary ) important discoveries of stone knives and bone-cuttings have been made , as at Thenay , department of Marne-et-Loire , and Billy , department of Allier , France . Professor J. D. Whitney , the eminent State geologist of California , reports similar discoveries there also . So , then , we may believe that before the last great upheaval of the Alps and Pyrenees , and while the yet luxuriant vegetation of the then ( i. e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , man inhabited this region . " 1 We turn to the American Continent and we find additional proofs of man 's pre-glacial existence . The " American Naturalist , " 1873 , says : " The discoveries that are constantly being made in this country are proving that man existed on this continent as far back in geological time as on the European Continent ; and it even seems that America , really the Old World , geologically , will soon prove to be the birthplace of the earliest race of man . One of the late and important discoveries is that by Mr. E. L. Berthoud , which is given in full , with a map , in the ' Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences for 1872 , ' p. 46 . Mr. Berthoud there reports the discovery of ancient fire-places , rude stone monuments , and implements of stone in great number and variety , in several places along Crow Creek , in Colorado , and also on several other rivers in the vicinity . These fire-places indicate several ancient sites of an unknown race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the shells and other fossils found with the remains make it quite certain that the deposit in which the ancient sites are found is as old as the Pliocene , and perhaps as the Miocene . As the fossil shells found with the relies of man are of estuary forms , and as the sites of the ancient towns are on extended 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " April , 1875 , p. 682. p. 129 points of land , and at the base of the ridges or bluffs , Mr. Berthoud thinks the evidence is strongly in favor of the locations having been near some ancient fresh-water lake , whose vestiges the present topography of the region favors . " I quote the following from the " Scientific American " ( 1880 ) : " The finding of numerous relies of a buried race on an ancient horizon , from twenty to thirty feet below the present level of country in Missouri and Kansas , has been noted . The St. Louis ' Republican ' gives particulars of another find of an unmistakable character made last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. R. W. Booth , who was engaged in iron-mining about three miles from Dry Branch , a station on the St. Louis and Santa F ? Railroad . At a depth of eighteen feet below the surface the miners uncovered a human skull , with portions of the ribs , vertebral column , and collar-bone . With them were found two flint arrow-heads of the most primitive type , imperfect in shape and barbed . A few pieces of charcoal were also found at the same time and place . Dr. Booth was fully aware of the importance of the discovery , and tried to preserve everything found , but upon touching the skull it crumbled to dust , and some of the other bones broke into small pieces and partly crumbled away ; but enough was preserved to fully establish the fact that they are human bones . " Some fifteen or twenty days subsequent to the first finding , at a depth of twenty-four feet below the surface , other bones were found  --  a thigh-bone and a portion of the vertebra , and several pieces of charred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In both cases the bones rested on a fibrous stratum , suspected at the time to be a fragment of coarse matting . This lay upon a floor of soft but solid iron-ore , which retained the imprint of the fibers . . . . " The indications are that the filled cavity had originally been a sort of cave , and that the supposed matting was more probably a layer of twigs , rushes , or weeds , which the inhabitants of the cave had used as a bed , as the fiber p. 130 marks cross each other irregularly . The ore-bed in which the remains were found , and part of which seems to have formed after the period of human occupation of the cave , lies in the second ( or saccharoidal ) sandstone of the Lower Silurian . " Note the facts : The remains of this man are found separated  --  part are eighteen feet below the surface , part twenty-four feet  --  that is , they are six feet apart . How can we account for this condition of things , except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shallow rock-shelter , and had there been caught by the world-tempest , and torn to pieces and deposited in fragments with the d ? bris that filled his rude home ? In California we encounter a still more surprising state of things . The celebrated Calaveras skull was found in a shaft one hundred and fifty feet deep , under five beds of lava and volcanic tufa , and four beds of auriferous gravel . The accompanying cut represents a plummet found in digging a well in the San Joaquin Valley , California , thirty feet below the surface . ### PLUMMET FROM SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY , CAL . Dr. Foster says : " In examining this beautiful relic , one is led almost instinctively to believe that it was used as a plummet , for the purpose of determining the perpendicular to the horizon for building purposes ? ; . . . when we consider its symmetry of form , the contrast of colors brought out by the process of grinding and polishing , and the delicate drilling of the hole through a material ( syenite ) so liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhibition of the lapidary 's skill superior to anything yet furnished by the Stone age of either continent . " 1 1 . " The Prehistoric Races of the United States , " p. 55. p. 131 In Louisiana , layers of pottery , six inches thick , with remnants of matting and baskets , were found twelve feet below the surface , and underneath what Dr. Foster believes to be strata of the Drift. 1 I might fill pages with similar testimony ; but I think I have given enough to satisfy the reader that man did exist before the Drift . I shall discuss the subject still further when I come to consider , in a subsequent chapter , the question whether pre-glacial man was or was not civilized . 1 . " The Prehistoric Races of the United States , " p. 56. p. 132 CHAPTER III . LEGENDS OF THE COMING OF THE COMET . WE turn now to the legends of mankind . I shall try to divide them , so as to represent , in their order , the several stages of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , for the same legend may detail several different parts of the same common story ; and hence there may be more or less repetition ; they will more or less overlap each other . And , first , I shall present one or two legends that most clearly represent the first coming of the monster , the dragon , the serpent , the wolf , the dog , the Evil One , the Comet . The second Hindoo " Avatar " gives the following description of the rapid advance of some dreadful object out of space , and its tremendous fall upon the earth : " By the power of God there issued from the essence of Brahma a being shaped like a boar , white and exceeding small ; this being , in the space of an hour , grew to the size of an elephant of the largest size , and remained in the air . " That is to say , it was an atmospheric , not a terrestrial creature . " Brahma was astonished on beholding this figure , and discovered , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the power of the Omnipotent which had assumed a body and become visible . He now felt that God is all in all , and all is from him , and all in him ; p. 133 and said to Mareechee and his sons ( the attendant genii ) : ' A wonderful animal has emanated from my essence ; at first of the smallest size , it has in one hour increased to this enormous bulk , and , without doubt , it is a portion of the almighty power . ' " Brahma , an earthly king , was at first frightened by the terrible spectacle in the air , and then claimed that he had produced it himself ! " They were engaged in this conversation when that vara , or ' boar-form , ' suddenly uttered a sound like the loudest thunder , and the echo reverberated and shook all the quarters of the universe . " This is the same terrible noise which , as I have already shown , would necessarily result from the carbureted hydrogen of the comet exploding in our atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful awe of heaven , a certain wonderful divine confidence secretly animated the hearts of Brahma , Mareechee , and the other genii , who immediately began praises and thanksgiving . That vara ( boar-form ) figure , hearing the power of the Vedas and Mantras from their mouths , again made a loud noise , and became a dreadful spectacle . Shaking the full flowing mane which hung down his neck on both sides , and erecting the humid hairs of his body , he proudly displayed his two most exceedingly white tusks ; then , rolling about his wine-colored ( red ) eyes , and erecting his tail , he descended from the region of the air , and plunged headforemost into the water . The whole body of water was convulsed by the motion , and began to rise in waves , while the guardian spirit of the sea , being terrified , began to tremble for his domain and cry for mercy. 1 flow fully does this legend accord with the descriptions of comets given by astronomers , the " horrid hair , " the mane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice 's " Ancient History of Hindustan , " vol. i , p. 304. p. 134 Lockyer 's account of Coggia 's comet , as seen through Newell 's large refracting telescope at Ferndene , Gateshead , and which he described as having a head like " a fan-shaped projection of light , with ear-like appendages , at each side , which sympathetically complemented each other at every change either of form or luminosity . " We turn to the legends of another race : The Zendavesta of the ancient Persians1 describes a period of " great innocence and happiness on earth . " This represents , doubtless , the delightful climate of the Tertiary period , already referred to , when endless summer extended to the poles . " There was a ' man-bull , ' who resided on an elevated region , which the deity had assigned him . " This was probably a line of kings or a nation , whose symbol was the bull , as we see in Bel or Baal , with the bull 's horns , dwelling in some elevated mountainous region . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . After having dared to visit heaven " ( that is , he appeared first in the high heavens ) , " he descended upon the earth and assumed the form of a serpent . " That is to say , a serpent-like comet struck the earth . " The man-bull was poisoned by his venom , and died in consequence of it . Meanwhile , Ahriman threw the whole universe into confusion ( chaos ) , for that enemy of good mingled himself with everything , appeared everywhere , and sought to do mischief above and below . " We shall find all through these legends allusions to the poisonous and deadly gases brought to the earth by the comet : we have already seen that the gases which are proved to be associated with comets are fatal to life . 1 . Faber 's " Hor ? Mosaic ? , " vol. i , p. 72. p. 135 And this , be it remembered , is not guess-work , but the revelation of the spectroscope . The traditions of the ancient Britons1 tell us of an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Supreme to send a pestilential wind upon the earth . A pure poison descended , every blast was death . At this time the patriarch , distinguished for his integrity , was shut up , together with his select company , in the inclosure with the strong door . ( The cave ? ) Here the just ones were safe from injury . Presently a tempest of fire arose . It split the earth asunder to the great deep . The lake Llion burst its bounds , and the waves of the sea lifted themselves on high around the borders of Britain , the rain poured down from heaven , and the waters covered the earth . " Here we have the whole story told briefly , but with the regular sequence of events : 1 . The poisonous gases . 2 . The people seek shelter in the caves . 3 . The earth takes fire . 4 . The earth is cleft open ; the fiords are made , and the trap-rocks burst forth . 5 . The rain pours down . 6 . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends , as recorded by one of their most ancient writers , Hesiod , we find the coming of the comet clearly depicted . We shall see here , and in many other legends , reference to the fact that there was more than one monster in the sky . This is in accordance with what we now know to be true of comets . They often appear in pairs or even triplets . Within the past few years we have seen Biela 's comet divide and form two separate comets , pursuing 1 . " Mythology of the British Druids , " p. 226. p. 136 their course side by side . When the great comet of 1811 appeared , another of almost equal magnitude followed it . Seneca informs us that Ephoras , a Greek writer of the fourth century before Christ , had recorded the singular fact of a comet 's separation into two parts . " This statement was deemed incredible by the Roman philosopher . More recent observations of similar phenomena leave no room to question the historian 's veracity . " 1 The Chinese annals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two smaller ones  --  at the same time , in the year 896 of our era . " They traveled together for three days . The little ones disappeared first and then the large one . " And again : " On June 27th , A. D. 416 , two comets appeared in the constellation Hercules , and pursued nearly the same path . " 2 If mere proximity to the earth served to split Biela 's comet into two fragments , why might not a comet , which came near enough to strike the earth , be broken into several separate forms ? So that there is nothing improbable in Hesiod 's description of two or three a ? rial monsters appearing at or about the same time , or of one being the apparent offspring of the other , since a large comet may , like Biela 's , have broken in two before the eyes of the people . Hesiod tells us that the Earth united with Night to do a terrible deed , by which the Heavens were much wronged . The Earth prepared a large sickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her son Cronus , and stationed him in ambush , and when Heaven came , Cronus , his son , grasped at him , and with his " huge sickle , long and jagged-toothed , " cruelly wounded him . 1 . Kirkwood , " Comets and Meteors , " p. 60. 2 . Ibid. , p. 51. p. 137 Was this jagged , white , sickle-shaped object a comet ? " And Night bare also hateful Destiny , and black Fate , and Death , and Nemesis . " And Hesiod tells us that " she , " probably Night  --  " Brought forth another monster , irresistible , nowise like to mortal man or immortal gods , in a hollow cavern ; the divine , stubborn-hearted Echidna ( half-nymph , with dark eyes and fair cheeks ; and half , on the other hand , a serpent , huge and terrible and vast ) , speckled , and flesh-devouring , ' neath caves of sacred Earth . . . .

Her Pegasus slew and brave Bellerophon . " The astronomical works show what weird , and fantastic , and goblin-like shapes the comets assume under the telescope . Look at the representation on page 137 , from Guillemin 's work , 1 of the appearance of the comet of 1862 , giving the changes which took place in twenty-four hours . If we will imagine one of these monsters close to the earth , we can readily suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ( as the Hindoo legend calls it , ) saw it taking the shapes of serpents , dragons , birds , and wolves . And Hesiod proceeds to tell us something more about this fiery , serpent-like monster : " But when Jove had driven the Titans out from Heaven , huge Earth bare her youngest-born son , Typh&oelig;us ( Typhaon , Typh&oelig;us , Typhon ) , by the embrace of Tartarus ( Hell ) , through golden Aphrodite ( Venus ) , whose hands , indeed , are apt for deeds on the score of strength , and untiring the feet of the strong god ; and from his shoulders there were a hundred heads of a serpent , a fierce dragon playing with dusky tongues " ( tongues of fire and smoke ? ) , " and from the eyes in his wondrous heads are sparkled beneath the brows ; whilst from all his heads fire was gleaming , as he looked keenly . In all his terrible heads , too , were voices sending forth every kind of voice ineffable . For one while , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods to understand , and at another time , again , the voice of a loud-bellowing bull , untamable in force and proud in utterance ; at another time , again , that of a lion possessing a daring spirit ; at another time , again , they would sound like to whelps , wondrous to hear ; and at another , he would hiss , and the lofty mountains resounded. 1 . " The Heavens , " p. 256. p. 139 " And , in sooth , then would there have been done a deed past remedy , and he , even he , would have reigned over mortals and immortals , unless , I wot , the sire of gods and men had quickly observed him . Harshly then he thundered , and heavily and terribly the earth re-echoed around ; and the broad heaven above , and the sea and streams of ocean , and the abysses of earth . But beneath his immortal feet vast Olympus trembled , as the king uprose and earth groaned beneath . And the heat from both caught the dark-colored sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the monster , the heat arising from the thunder-storms , winds , and burning lightning . And all earth , and heaven , and sea , were boiling ; and huge billows roared around the shores about and around , beneath the violence of the gods ; and unallayed quaking arose . Pluto trembled , monarch over the dead beneath ; and the Titans under Tartarus , standing about Cronus , trembled also , on account of the unceasing tumult and dreadful contention . But Jove , when in truth he had raised high his wrath , and had taken his arms , his thunder and lightning , and smoking bolt , leaped up and smote him from Olympus , and scorched all around the wondrous heads of the terrible monster . " But when at length he had quelled it , after having smitten it with blows , the monster fell down , lamed , and huge Earth groaned . But the flame from the lightning-blasted monster flashed forth in the mountain hollows , hidden and rugged , when he was stricken , and much was the vast earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pewter , heated by the art of youths , and by the well-bored melting-pit , or iron , which is the hardest of metals , subdued in the dells of the mountain by blazing fire , melts in the sacred earth , beneath the hands of Vulcan .

" 1 Here we have a very faithful and accurate narrative of the coming of the comet : 1 . " Theogony. " p. 140 Born of Night a monster appears , a serpent , huge , terrible , speckled , flesh-devouring . With her is another comet , Typhaon ; they beget the Chim ? ra , that breathes resistless fire , fierce , huge , swift . And Typhaon , associated with both these , is the most dreadful monster of all , born of Hell and sensual sin , a serpent , a fierce dragon , many-headed , with dusky tongues and fire gleaming ; sending forth dreadful and appalling noises , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the earth , the sea boils ; there is unceasing tumult and contention , and in the midst the monster , wounded and broken up , falls upon the earth ; the earth groans under his weight , and there he blazes and burns for a time in the mountain fastnesses and desert places , melting the earth with boundless vapor and glaring fire . We will find legend after legend about this Typhon he runs through the mythologies of different nations . And as to his size and his terrible power , they all agree . He was no earth-creature . He moved in the air ; he reached the skies : " According to Pindar the head of Typhon reached to the stars , his eyes darted fire , his hands extended from the East to the West , terrible serpents were twined about the middle of his body , and one hundred snakes took the place of fingers on his hands . Between him and the gods there was a dreadful war . Jupiter finally killed him with a flash of lightning , and buried him under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his great throes and writhings , we are told , still shake the earth , and threaten mankind : And with pale lips men say , ' To-morrow , perchance to-day , Encelidas may arise ! " ' p. 141 CHAPTER IV . RAGNAROK THERE is in the legends of the Scandinavians a marvelous record of the coming of the Comet . It has been repeated generation after generation , translated into all languages , commented on , criticised , but never understood . It has been regarded as a wild , unmeaning rhapsody of words , or as a premonition of some future earth catastrophe . But look at it ! The very name is significant . According to Professor Anderson 's etymology of the word , it means " the darkness of the gods " ; from regin , gods , and r ? kr , darkness ; but it may , more properly , be derived from the Icelandic , Danish , and Swedish regn , a rain , and r ? k , smoke , or dust ; and it may mean the rain of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is described in some Indian legends as ashes . First , there is , as in the tradition of the Druids , page 135 , ante , the story of an age of crime . The Vala looks upon the world , and , as the " Elder Edda " tells us  --  There saw she wade In the heavy streams , Men  --  foul murderers And perjurers , And them who others ' wives Seduce to sin . Brothers slay brothers Sisters ' children Shed each other 's blood . p. 142 Hard is the world ! Sensual sin grows huge . There are sword-ages , axe-ages ; Shields are cleft in twain ; Storm-ages , murder ages ; Till the world falls dead , And men no longer spare Or pity one another . " 1 The world has ripened for destruction ; and " Ragnarok , " the darkness of the gods , or the rain of dust and ashes , comes to complete the work . The whole story is told with the utmost detail , and we shall see that it agrees , in almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are three winters , " or years , " during which great wars rage over the world . " Mankind has reached a climax of wickedness . Doubtless it is , as now , highly civilized in some regions , while still barbarian in others . " Then happens that which will seem a great miracle : that the wolf devours the sun , and this will seem a great loss . " That is , the Comet strikes the sun , or approaches so close to it that it seems to do so . " The other wolf devours the moon , and this , too , will cause great mischief . " We have seen that the comets often come in couples or triplets . " The stars shall be hurled from heaven . " This refers to the blazing d ? bris of the Comet falling to the earth . " Then it shall come to pass that the earth will shake so violently that trees will be torn up by the roots , the 1 . Anderson , " Norse Mythology , " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds and fetters will be broken and snapped . " Chaos has come again . How closely does all this agree with Hesiod 's description of the shaking earth and the universal conflict of nature ? " The Fenris-wolf gets loose . " This , we shall see , is the name of one of the comets . " The sea rushes over the earth , for the Midgard-serpent writhes in giant rage , and seeks to gain the land . " The Midgard-serpent is the name of another comet ; it strives to reach the earth ; its proximity disturbs the oceans . And then follows an inexplicable piece of mythology : " The ship that is called Naglfar also becomes loose . It is made of the nails of dead men ; wherefore it is worth warning that , when a man dies with unpared nails , he supplies a large amount of materials for the building of this ship , which both gods and men wish may be finished as late as possible . But in this flood Naglfar gets afloat . The giant Hrym is its steersman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper jaw reaches to heaven and the lower jaw is on the earth . " That is to say , the comet extends from the earth to the sun . " He would open it still wider had he room . " That is to say , the space between the sun and earth is not great enough ; the tail of the comet reaches even beyond the earth . " Fire flashes from his eyes and nostrils . " A recent writer says : " When bright comets happen to come very near to the sun , and are subjected to close observation under the p. 144 advantages which the fine telescopes of the present day afford , a series of remarkable changes is found to take place in their luminous configuration . First , jets of bright light start out from the nucleus , and move through the fainter haze of the coma toward the sun ; and then these jets are turned backward round the edge of the coma , and stream from it , behind the comet , until they are fashioned into a tail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and the sea ; he is very terrible , and places himself side by side with the wolf . " The two comets move together , like Biela 's two fragments ; and they give out poison  --  the carbureted-hydrogen gas revealed by the spectroscope . " In the midst of this clash and din the heavens are rent in twain , and the sons of Muspelheim come riding through the opening . " Muspelheim , according to Professor Anderson , 2 means the day of judgment . " Muspel signifies an abode of fire , peopled by fiends . So that this passage means , that the heavens are split open , or appear to be , by the great shining comet , or comets , striking the earth ; it is a world of fire ; it is the Day of Judgment . " Surt rides first , and before him and after him flames burning fire . " Surt is a demon associated with the comet ; 3 he is the same as the destructive god of the Egyptian mythology , Set , who destroys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet . " He has a very good sword that shines brighter than the sun . As they ride over Bifrost it breaks to pieces , as has before been stated . " 1 . " Edinburgh Review , " October , 1874 , p. 207. 2 . " Norse Mythology , " p. 454. 3 . Ibid. , p. 458. p. 145 Bifrost , we shall have reason to see hereafter , was a prolongation of land westward from Europe , which connected the British Islands with the island-home of the gods , or the godlike race of men . There are geological proofs that such a land once existed . A writer , Thomas Butler Gunn , in a recent number of an English publication , 1 says : " Tennyson 's ' Voyage of Maeldune ' is a magnificent allegorical expansion of this idea ; and the laureate has also finely commemorated the old belief in the country of Lyonnesse , extending beyond the bounds of Cornwall : ' A land of old upheaven from the abyss By fire , to sink into the abyss again ; Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in a coast Of ever-shifting sands , and far away The phantom circle of a moaning sea . ' " Cornishmen of the last generation used to tell stories of strange household relics picked up at the very low tides , nay , even of the quaint habitations seen fathoms deep in the water . " There are those who believe that these Scandinavian Eddas came , in the first instance , from Druidical Briton sources . The Edda may be interpreted to mean that the Comet strikes the planet west of Europe , and crushes down some land in that quarter , called " the bridge of Bifrost . " Then follows a mighty battle between the gods and the Comet . It can have , of course , but one termination ; but it will recur again and again in the legends of different nations . It was necessary that the gods , the protectors of mankind , should struggle to defend them against these strange and terrible enemies . But their very helplessness 1 . " All the Year Round . " p. 146 and their deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The Edda continues : " The sons of Muspel direct their course to the plain which is called Vigrid . Thither repair also the Fenris-wolf and the Midgard-serpent . " Both the comets have fallen on the earth . " To this place have also come Loke " ( the evil genius of the Norse mythology ) " and Hrym , and with him all the Frost giants . In Loke 's company are all the friends of Hel " ( the goddess of death ) . " The sons of Muspel have then their efficient bands alone by themselves . The plain Vigrid is one hundred miles ( rasts ) on each side . " That is to say , all these evil forces , the comets , the fire , the devil , and death , have taken possession of the great plain , the heart of the civilized land . The scene is located in this spot , because probably it was from this spot the legends were afterward dispersed to all the world . It is necessary for the defenders of mankind to rouse themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accordingly , we learn  --  " While these things are happening , Heimdal " ( he was the guardian of the Bifrost-bridge ) " stands up , blows with all his might in the Gjallar-horn and awakens all the gods , who thereupon hold counsel . Odin rides to Mimer 's well to ask advice of Mimer for himself and his folk . " Then quivers the ash Ygdrasil , and all things in heaven and earth tremble . " The ash Ygdrasil is the tree-of-life ; the tree of the ancient tree-worship ; the tree which stands on the top of the pyramid in the island-birth place of the Aztec race ; the tree referred to in the Hindoo legends . " The asas " ( the godlike men ) " and the einherjes " ( the heroes ) " arm themselves and speed forth to the battlefield . Odin rides first ; with his golden helmet , resplendent p. 147 byrnie , and his spear Gungner , he advances against the Fenris-wolf " ( the first comet ) . " Thor stands by his side , but can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full in his struggle with the Midgard-serpent " ( the second comet ) . " Frey encounters Surt , and heavy blows are exchanged ere Frey falls . The cause of his death is that he has not that good sword which he gave to Skirner . Even the dog Garm , " ( another comet ) , " that was bound before the Gnipa-cave , gets loose . He is the greatest plague . He contends with Tyr , and they kill each other . Thor gets great renown by slaying the Midgard-serpent , but retreats only nine paces when he falls to the earth dead , poisoned by the venom that the serpent blows upon him . " He has breathed the carbureted-hydrogen gas ! " The wolf swallows Odin , and thus causes his death ; but Vidar immediately turns and rushes at the wolf , placing one foot on his nether jaw . " On this foot he has the shoe , for which materials have been gathering through all ages , namely , the strips of leather which men cut off from the toes and heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the asas must cast these strips away . " This last paragraph , like that concerning the ship Naglfar , is probably the interpolation of some later age . The narrative continues : " With one hand Vidar seizes the upper jaw of the wolf , and thus rends asunder his mouth . Thus the wolf perishes . Loke fights with Heimdal , and they kill each other . Thereupon Surt flings fire over the earth , and burns up all the world . " This narrative is from the Younger Edda . The Elder Edda is to the same purpose , but there are more allusions to the effect of the catastrophe on the earth The eagle screams , And with pale beak tears corpses . . . . Mountains dash together , p. 148 Heroes go the way to Hel , And heaven is rent in twain . . . . All men abandon their homesteads When the warder of Midgard In wrath slays the serpent . The sun grows dark , The earth sinks into the sea , The bright stars From heaven vanish ; Fire rages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven itself " And what follow then ? Ice and cold and winter . For although these things come first in the narrative of the Edda , yet we are told that " before these " things , to wit , the cold winters , there occurred the wickedness of the world , and the wolves and the serpent made their appearance . So that the events transpired in the order in which I have given them . " First there is a winter called the Fimbul winter , " " The mighty , the great , the iron winter , " 1 " ' When snow drives from . all quarters , the frosts are so severe , the winds so keen , there is no joy in the sun . There are three such winters in succession , without any intervening summer . " Here we have the Glacial period which followed the Drift . Three years of incessant wind , and snow , and intense cold . The Elder Edda says , speaking of the Fenris-wolf : " It feeds on the bodies Of men , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . " 1 . " Norse Mythology , " p. 444. p. 149 This probably refers to the iron-stained red clay cast down by the Comet over a large part of the earth ; the " seats of the gods " means the home of the god-like race , which was doubtless covered , like Europe and America , with red clay ; the waters which ran from it must have been the color of blood . " The Sunshine blackens In the summers thereafter , And the weather grows bad . " In the Younger Edda ( p. 57 ) we are given a still more precise description of the Ice age : " Replied Har , explaining , that as soon as the streams , that are called Elivogs " ( the rivers from under ice ) , " had came so far that the venomous yeast " ( the clay ? ) " which flowed with them hardened , as does dross that runs from the fire , then it turned " ( as ) " into ice . And when this ice stopped and flowed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose from the venom " ( the clay ) , " and froze into rime " ( ice ) , " and one layer of ice was laid upon another clear into the Ginungagap . " Ginungagap , we are told , 1 was the name applied in the eleventh century by the Northmen to the ocean between Greenland and Vinland , or America . It doubtless meant originally the whole of the Atlantic Ocean . The clay , when it first fell , was probably full of chemical elements , which rendered it , and the waters which filtered through it , unfit for human use ; clay waters are , to this day , the worst in the world . " Then said Jafnhar : ' All that part of Ginungagap that turns to the north ' ( the north Atlantic ) ' was filled with thick and heavy ice and rime , and everywhere within were drizzling rains and gusts . But the south part of Ginungagap was lighted up by the glowing sparks that flew out of Muspelheim. ' " 1 . " Norse Mythology , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north represent the age of ice and snow . Muspelheim was the torrid country of the south , over which the clouds could not yet form in consequence of the heat  --  Africa . But it can not last forever . The clouds disappear ; the floods find their way back to the ocean ; nature begins to decorate once more the scarred and crushed face of the world . But where is the human race ? The " Younger Edda " tells us : " During the conflagration caused by Surt 's fire , a woman by the name of Lif and a man named Lifthraser lie concealed in Hodmimer 's hold , or forest . The dew of the dawn serves them for food , and so great a race shall spring from them , that their descendants shall soon spread over the whole earth . " 1 The " Elder Edda " says : " Lif and Lifthraser Will lie hid In Hodmimer's-holt ; The morning dew They have for food . From them are the races descended . " Holt is a grove , or forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see that nearly all the legends refer to the caves in which mankind escaped from destruction . This statement , " From them are the races descended , " shows that this is not prophecy , but history ; it refers to the past , not to the future ; it describes not a Day of Judgment to come , but one that has already fallen on the human family . Two others , of the godlike race , also escaped in some 1 . " Norse Mythology " p. 429. p. 151 way not indicated ; Vidar and Vale are their names . They , too , had probably taken refuge in some cavern . " Neither the sea nor Surt 's fire had harmed them , and they dwell on the plains of Ida , where Asgard was before . Thither come also the sons of Thor , Mode , and Magne , and they have Mjolner . Then come Balder and Hoder from Hel . Mode and Magne are children of Thor ; they belong to the godlike race . They , too , have escaped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he has returned from the abode of death , to which the comet consigned him . Hoder is the Night . All this means that the fragments and remnants of humanity reassemble on the plain of Ida  --  the plain of Vigrid  --  where the battle was fought . They possess the works of the old civilization , represented by Thor 's hammer ; and the day and night once more return after the long midnight blackness . And the Vala looks again upon a renewed and rejuvenated world : " She sees arise The second time . From the sea , the earth , Completely green . The cascades fall , The eagle soars , From lofty mounts Pursues its prey . " It is once more the glorious , the sun-lighted world the world of flashing seas , dancing streams , and green leaves ; with the eagle , high above it all , " Batting the sunny ceiling of the globe With his dark wings ; " while " The wild cataracts leap in glory . " p. 152 What history , what poetry , what beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden away in these Sagas  --  the despised heritage of all the blue-eyed , light-haired races of the world ! Rome and Greece can not parallel this marvelous story : The gods convene On Ida 's plains , And talk of the powerful Midgard-serpent ; They call to mind The Fenris-wolf And the ancient runes Of the mighty Odin . " What else can mankind think of , or dream of , or talk of for the next thousand years but this awful , this unparalleled calamity through which the race has passed ? A long-subsequent but most ancient and cultivated people , whose memory has , for us , almost faded from the earth , will thereafter embalm the great drama in legends , myths , prayers , poems , and sagas ; fragments of which are found to-day dispersed through all literatures in all lands ; some of them , as we shall see , having found their way even into the very Bible revered alike of Jew and Christian : The Edda continues , " Then again The wonderful Golden tablets Are found in the grass In time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's race Possessed them . " And what a find was that ! This poor remnant of humanity discovers " the golden tablets " of the former p. 153 civilization . Doubtless , the inscribed tablets , by which the art of writing survived to the race ; for what would tablets be without inscriptions ? For they talk of " the ancient runes of mighty Odin , " that is , of the runic letters , the alphabetical writing . And we shall see hereafter that this view is confirmed from other sources . There follows a happy age : " The fields unsown Yield their growth ; All ills cease . Balder comes . Hoder and Balder , Those heavenly gods , Dwell together in Odin 's halls . " The great catastrophe is past . Man is saved , The world is once more fair . The sun shines again in heaven . Night and day follow each other in endless revolution around the happy globe . Ragnarok is past . p. 154 CHAPTER V. THE CONFLAGRATION OF PHA ? TON Now let us turn to the mythology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ovid , one of the greatest of the poets of ancient Rome. 1 Here we have the burning of the world involved in the myth of Pha ? ton , son of Ph&oelig;bus  --  Apollo  --  the Sun  --  who drives the chariot of his father ; he can not control the horses of the Sun , they run away with him ; they come so near the earth as to set it on fire , and Pha ? ton is at last killed by Jove , as he killed Typhon in the Greek legends , to save heaven and earth from complete and common ruin . This is the story of the conflagration as treated by a civilized mind , explained by a myth , and decorated with the flowers and foliage of poetry . We shall see many things in the narrative of Ovid which strikingly confirm our theory . Pha ? ton , to prove that he is really the son of Ph&oelig;bus , the Sun , demands of his parent the right to drive his chariot for one day . The sun-god reluctantly consents , not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his inconsiderate ambition . Pha ? ton persists . The old man says : " Even the ruler of vast Olympus , who hurls the ruthless bolts with his terrific right hand , can not guide 1 . " The Metamorphoses , " book xi , fable 1. p. 155 this chariot ; and yet , what have we greater than Jupiter ? The first part of the road is steep , and such as the horses , though fresh in the morning , can hardly climb . In the middle of the heaven it is high aloft , whence it is often a source of fear , even to myself , to look down upon the sea and the earth , and my breast trembles with fearful apprehensions . The last stage is a steep descent , and requires a sure command of the horses . . . . Besides , the heavens are carried round with a constant rotation , and carrying with them the lofty stars , and whirl them with rapid revolution . Against this I have to contend ; and that force which overcomes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried in a contrary direction to the rapid world . " Here we seem to have a glimpse of some higher and older learning , mixed with the astronomical errors of the day : Ovid supposes the rapid world to move , revolve , one way , while the sun appears to move another . But Pha ? ton insists on undertaking the dread task . The doors of Aurora are opened , " her halls filled with roses " ; the stars disappear ; the Hours yoke the horses , " filled with the juice of ambrosia , " the father anoints the face of his son with a hallowed drug that he may the better endure the great heat ; the reins are handed him , and the fatal race begins . Ph&oelig;bus has advised him not to drive too high , or " thou wilt set on fire the signs of the heavens "  --  the constellations ;  --  nor too low , or he will consume the earth . " In the mean time the swift Pyroeis , and Eo ? s and ? thon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fill the air with neighings , sending forth flames , and beat the barriers with their feet . . . . They take the road . . . they cleave the resisting clouds , and , raised aloft by their wings , they pass by the east winds that had arisen from the same parts . But the weight " ( of Pha ? ton ) " was light , and such as the horses of the sun could not feel ; and the yoke was deficient of its wonted weight . . . . Soon as p. 156 the steeds had perceived this they rush on and leave the beaten track , and run not in the order in which they did before . He himself becomes alarmed , and knows not which way to turn the reins intrusted to him ; nor does he know where the way is , nor , if he did know , could he control them . Then , for the first time , did the cold Triones grow warm with sunbeams , and attempt , in vain , to be dipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serpent , which is situate next to the icy pole , being before torpid with cold , and formidable to no one , grew warm , and regained new rage for the heat . And they say that thou , Bo ? tes , scoured off in a mighty bustle , although thou wert but slow , and thy cart hindered thee . But when from the height of the skies the unhappy Pha ? ton looked down upon the earth lying far , very far beneath , he grew pale , and his knees shook with a sudden terror ; and , in a light so great , darkness overspread his eyes . And now he could wish that he had never touched the horses of his father ; and now he is sorry that he knew his descent , and prevailed in his request ; now desiring to be called the son of Merops . " " What can he do ? . . . He is stupefied ; he neither lets go the reins , nor is able to control them . In his fright , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavens , and the forms of huge wild beasts . There is a spot where the Scorpion bends his arms into two curves , and , with his tail and claws bending on either side , he extends his limbs through the space of two signs of the zodiac . As soon as the youth beheld him , wet with the sweat of black venom , and threatening wounds with the barbed point of his tail , bereft of sense he let go the reins in a chill of horror . " Compare the course which Ovid tells us Pha ? ton pursued through the constellations , past the Great Serpent and Bo ? tes , and close to the venomous Scorpion , with the orbit of Donati 's comet in 1858 , as given in Schellen 's great work. 1 1 . " Spectrum Analysis , " p. 391. p. 157 ### COURSE OF DONATI 'S COMET The path described by Ovid shows that the comet came from the north part of the heavens ; and this agrees with what we know of the Drift ; the markings indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range at large ; " they go through p. 158 the air of an unknown region ; . . . they rush on the stars fixed in the sky " ; they approach the earth . " The moon , too , wonders that her brother 's horses run lower than her own , and the scorched clouds send forth smoke , As each region is most elevated it is caught by the flames , and cleft , it makes vast chasms , its moisture being carried away . The grass grows pale ; the trees , with their foliage , are burned up , and the dry , standing corn affords fuel for its own destruction . But I am complaining of trifling ills . Great cities perish , together with their fortifications , and the flames turn whole nations into ashes ; woods , together with mountains , are on fire . Athos burns , and the Cilician Taurus , and Tmolus , and &OElig;ta , and Ida , now dry but once most famed for its springs , and Helicon , the resort of the virgin Muses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tna burns intensely with redoubled flames , and Parnassus , with its two summits , and Eryx , and Cynthus , and Orthrys , and Rhodope , at length to be despoiled of its snows , and Mimas , and Dindyma , and Mycale , and Cith ? ron , created for the sacred rites . Nor does its cold avail even Scythia ; Caucasus is on fire , and Ossa with Pindus , and Olympus , greater than them both , and the lofty Alps , and the cloud-bearing Apennines . " Then , indeed , Pha ? ton beholds the world see on fire on all sides , and he can not endure heat so great , and he inhales with his mouth scorching air , as though from a deep furnace , and perceives his own chariot to be on fire . And neither is he able now to bear the ashes and the emitted embers ; and on every side he is involved in a heated smoke . Covered with a pitchy darkness , he knows not whither he is going , nor where he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeds . They believe that it was then that the nations of the ? thiopians contracted their black hue , the blood being attracted . into the surface of the body . Then was Libya " ( Sahara ? ) " made dry by the heat , the moisture being carried off ; then with disheveled hair the Nymphs lamented the springs and the lakes . B&oelig;otia bewails Dirce , Argos Amymone , and Ephyre the waters of Pirene . Nor do rivers that p. 159 have banks distant remain secure . Tanais smokes in the midst of its waters , and the aged Peneus and Teuthrantian Ca ? cus and rapid Ismenus . . . . The Babylonian Euphrates , too , was on fire , Orontes was in flames , and the swift Thermodon and Ganges and Phasis and Ister . Alpheus boils ; the banks of Spercheus burn ; and the gold which Tagus carries with its stream melts in the flames . The river-birds , too , which made famous the M ? onian banks with song , grew hot in the middle of Ca ? ster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the earth and concealed his head , which still lies hid ; his seven last mouths are empty , seven channels without any streams . The same fate dries up the Ismarian rivers , Hebeus together with Strymon , and the Hesperian streams , the Rhine , the Rhone , and the Po , and the Tiber , to which was promised the sovereignty of the world . " In other words , according to these Roman traditions here poetized , the heat dried up the rivers of Europe , Asia , and Africa ; in short , of all the known world . Ovid continues : " All the ground bursts asunder , and through the chinks the light penetrates into Tartarus , and startles the infernal king with his spouse . " We have seen that during the Drift age the great clefts in the earth , the fiords of the north of Europe and America , occurred , and we shall see hereafter that , according to a Central American legend , the red rocks boiled up through the earth at this time . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and that which lately was sea is a surface of parched sand , and the mountains which the deep sea has covered , start up and increase the number of the scattered Cyclades " ( a cluster of islands in the ? gean Sea , surrounding Delos as though with a circle , whence their name ) ; " the fishes sink to the bottom , and the crooked dolphins do not care to raise themselves on the surface into the air as usual . The bodies of sea-calves float lifeless on their backs on p. 160 the top of the water . The story , too , is that even Nereus himself and Doris and their daughters lay hid in the heated caverns . " All this could scarcely have been imagined , and yet it agrees precisely with what we can not but believe to have been the facts . Here we have an explanation of how that vast body of vapor which afterward constituted great snow-banks and ice-sheets and river-torrents rose into the air . Science tells us that to make a world-wrapping ice-sheet two miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been evaporated ; 1 to make one a mile thick would take one half the waters of the globe ; and here we find this Roman poet , who is repeating the legends of his race , and who knew nothing about a Drift age or an Ice age , telling us that the water boiled in the streams ; that the bottom of the Mediterranean lay exposed , a bed of dry sand ; that the fish floated dead on the surface , or fled away to the great depths of the ocean ; and that even the sea-gods " hid in the heated caverns . " Ovid continues : " Three times had Neptune ventured with stern countenance to thrust his arms out of the water ; three times he was unable to endure the scorching heat of the air . " This is no doubt a reminiscence of those human beings who sought safety in the water , retreating downward into the deep as the heat reduced its level , occasionally lifting up their heads to breathe the torrid and tainted air . " However , the genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the waters of the main " ( the ocean ) ; " the springs dried up on every side which had hidden themselves in the bowels of their cavernous parent , burnt up , lifted up her all-productive face as far as her neck , and 1 . " Science and Genesis , " p. 125. p. 161 placed her hand to her forehead , and , shaking all things with a vast trembling , she sank down a little and retired below the spot where she is wont to be . " Here we are reminded of the bridge Bifrost , spoken of in the last chapter , which , as I have shown , was probably a prolongation of land reaching from Atlantis to Europe , and which the Norse legends tell us sank down under the feet of the forces of Muspelheim , in the day of Ragnarok : " And thus she spoke with a parched voice : ' O sovereign of the gods , if thou approvest of this , if I have deserved it , why do thy lightnings linger ? Let me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish by thy flames ; and alleviate my misfortune by being the author of it . With difficulty , indeed , do I open my mouth for these very words . Behold my scorched hair , and such a quantity of ashes over my eyes ' ( the Drift-deposits ) , ' so much , too , over my features . And dost thou give this as my recompense ? This as the reward of my fertility and my duty , in that I endure wounds from the crooked plow and harrows , and am harassed all the year through , in that I supply green leaves for the cattle , and corn , a wholesome food , for mankind , and frankincense for yourselves . " ' But still , suppose I am deserving of destruction , why have the waves deserved this ? Why has thy brother ' ( Neptune ) ' deserved it ? Why do the seas delivered to him by lot decrease , and why do they recede still farther from the sky ? But if regard neither for thy brother nor myself influences thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , see how each pole is smoking ; if the fire shall injure them , thy palace will fall in ruins . See ! Atlas himself is struggling , and hardly can he bear the glowing heavens on his shoulders . " ' If the sea , if the earth , if the palace of heaven , perish , we are then jumbled into the old chaos again . Save it from the flames , if aught still survives , and provide for the preservation of the universe . ' p. 162 " Thus spoke the Earth ; nor , indeed , could she any longer endure the vapor , nor say more , and she withdrew her face within herself , and the caverns neighboring to the shades below . " But the omnipotent father , having called the gods above to witness , and him , too , who had given the chariot to Pha ? ton , that unless he gives assistance all things will perish in direful ruin , mounts aloft to the highest eminence , from which he is wont to spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves his thunders , and burls the brandished lightnings . But then he had neither clouds that he could draw over the earth , nor showers that he could pour down from the sky . " That is to say , so long as the great meteor shone in the air , and for some time after , the heat was too intense to permit the formation of either clouds or rain ; these could only come with coolness and condensation . He thundered aloud , and darted the poised lightning from his right ear , against the charioteer , and at the same moment deprived him both of life and his seat , and by his ruthless fires restrained the flames . The horses are affrighted , and , making a bound in the opposite direction , they shake the yoke from their necks , and disengage themselves from the torn harness . In one place lie the reins , in another the axle-tree wrenched from the pole , in another part are the spokes of the broken wheels , and the fragments of the chariot torn in pieces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flames consuming his yellow hair , is hurled headlong , and is borne in a long track through the air , as sometimes a star is seen to fall from the serene sky , although it really has not fallen . Him the great Eridanus receives in a part of the world far distant from his country , and bathes his foaming face . The Hesperian Naiads commit his body , smoking from the three-forked flames , to the tomb , and inscribe these verses on the stone : ' Here is Pha ? ton buried , the driver of his father 's chariot , which , if he did not manage , still he miscarried in a great attempt . ' " But his wretched father " ( the Sun ) " had hidden his p. 163 face overcast with bitter sorrow , and , if only we can believe it , they say that one day passed without the sun . The flames " ( of the fires on the earth ) " afforded light , and there was some advantage in that disaster . " As there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , that one day of darkness was probably of long duration ; it may have endured for years . Then follows Ovid 's description of the mourning of Clymene and the daughters of the Sun and the Naiads for the dead Pha ? ton . Cycnus , king of Liguria , grieves for Pha ? ton until he is transformed into a swan ; reminding one of the Central American legend , ( which I shall give hereafter , ) which states that in that day all men were turned into goslings or geese , a reminiscence , perhaps , of those who saved themselves from the fire by taking refuge in the waters of the seas : " Cycnus becomes a new bird ; but he trusts himself not to the heavens or the air , as being mindful of the fire unjustly sent from thence . He frequents the pools and the wide lakes , and , abhorring fire , he chooses the streams , the very contrary of flames . " Meanwhile , the father of Pha ? ton " ( the Sun ) , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is wont to be when he suffers an eclipse of his disk , abhors both the light , himself , and the day ; and gives his mind up to grief , and adds resentment to his sorrow . " In other words , the poet is now describing the age of darkness , which , as we have seen , must have followed the conflagration , when the condensing vapor wrapped the world in a vast cloak of cloud . The Sun refuses to go again on his daily journey ; just as we shall see hereafter , in the American legends , he refuses to stir until threatened or coaxed into action . p. 164 " All the deities , " says Ovid , " stand around the Sun as he says such things , and they entreat him , with suppliant voice , not to determine to bring darkness over the world . " At length they induce the enraged and bereaved father to resume his task . " But the omnipotent father " ( Jupiter ) " surveys the vast walls of heaven , and carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , may fall into ruin . After he has seen them to be secure and in their own strength , he examines the earth , and the works of man ; yet a care for his own Arcadia is more particularly his object . He restores , too , the springs and the rivers , that had not yet dared to flow , he gives grass to the earth , green leaves to the trees ; and orders the injured forests again to be green . " The work of renovation has begun ; the condensing moisture renews the springs and rivers , the green mantle of verdure once more covers the earth , and from the waste places the beaten and burned trees put forth new sprouts . The legend ends , like Ragnarok , in a beautiful picture of a regenerated world . Divest this poem of the myth of Pha ? ton , and we have a very faithful tradition of the conflagration of the world caused by the comet . The cause of the trouble is a something which takes place high in the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it traverses particular constellations ; it is disastrous ; it has yellow hair ; it is associated with great heat ; it sets the world on fire it dries up the seas ; its remains are scattered over the earth ; it covers the earth with ashes ; the sun ceases to appear ; there is a time when he is , as it were , in eclipse , darkened ; after a while he returns ; verdure comes again upon the earth , the springs and rivers reappear , the world is renewed . During this catastrophe man has hidden himself , swanlike , p. 165 in the waters ; or the intelligent children of the earth betake themselves to deep caverns for protection from the conflagration . How completely does all this accord , in chronological order and in its details , with the Scandinavian legend ; and with what reason teaches us must have been the consequences to the earth if a comet had fallen upon it ! And the most ancient of the ancient world , the nation that stood farthest back in historical time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton really represented the contact of the earth with a comet . When Solon , the Greek lawgiver , visited Egypt , six hundred years before the Christian era , he talked with the priests of Sais about the Deluge of Deucalion . I quote the following from Plato ( " Dialogues , " xi , 517 , Tim ? us ) : " Thereupon , one of the priests , who was of very great age , said , ' O Solon , Solon , you Hellenes are but children , and there is never an old man who is an Hellene . ' Solon , hearing this , said , ' What do you mean ? ' ' I mean to say , ' he replied , ' that in mind you are all young ; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition , nor any science which is hoary with age . And I will tell you the reason of this : there have been , and there will be again , many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once upon a time Pha ? thon , the son of Helios , having yoked the steeds in his father 's chariot , because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father , burnt up all that was upon the earth , and was himself destroyed by a thunder-bolt . Now , this has the form of a myth , but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving around the earth and in the heavens , and a great conflagration of things upon the earth recurring at long intervals of time : when this happens , those who live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the sea-shore. " ' p. 166 CHAPTER VI . OTHER LEGENDS OF THE CONFLAGRATION . THE first of these , and the most remarkable of all , is the legend of one of the Central American nations , preserved not by tradition alone , but committed to writing at some time in the remote past . In the " Codex Chimalpopoca , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking of the destruction which took place by fire , says : " The third sun " ( or era ) " is called Quia-Tonatiuh , sun of rain , because there fell a rain of fire ; all which existed burned ; and there fell a rain of gravel . " " They also narrate that while the sandstone , which we now see scattered about , and the tetzontli ( amygdaloide poreuse  --  trap or basaltic rocks ) , ' boiled with great tumult , there also rose the rocks of vermilion color . ' " That is to say , the basaltic and red trap-rocks burst through the great cracks made , at that time , in the surface of the disturbed earth . " Now , this was in the year Ce Tecpatl , One Flint , it was the day Nahui-Quiahuitl , Fourth Rain . Now , in this day , in which men were lost and destroyed in a rain of fire , they were transformed into goslings ; the sun itself was on fire , and everything , together with the houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans of Antiquity , " p. 499. p. 167 Here we have the whole story told in little : " Fire fell from heaven , " the comet ; " the sun itself was on fire " ; the comet reached to , or appeared to reach to , the sun ; or its head had fallen into the sun ; or the terrible object may have been mistaken for the sun on fire . " There was a rain of gravel "  --  the Drift fell from the comet . There is also some allusion to the sandstones scattered about ; and we have another reference to the great breaks in the earth 's crust , caused either by the shock of contact with the comet , or the electrical disturbances of the time ; and we are told that the trap-rocks , and rocks of vermilion color , boiled up to the surface with great tumult . Mankind was destroyed , except such as fled into the seas and lakes , and there plunged into the water , and lived like " goslings . " Can any one suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , how comes it that their invention agreed so exactly with the traditions of all the rest of mankind ; and with the revelations of science as to the relations between the trap rocks and the gravel , as to time at least ? We turn now to the legends of a different race , in a different stage of cultivation  --  the barbarian Indians of California and Nevada . It is a curious and wonderful story : " The natives in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe ascribe its origin to a great natural convulsion . There was a time , they say , when their tribe possessed the whole earth , and were strong numerous , and rich ; but a day came in which a people rose up stronger than they , and defeated and enslaved them . Afterward the Great Spirit sent an immense wave across the continent from the sea , and this wave ingulfed both the oppressors and the oppressed , all but a very small remnant . Then the task-masters made the remaining people raise up a great temple , so that p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a refuge in case of another flood , and on the top of this temple the masters worshiped a column of perpetual fire . " It would be natural to suppose that this was the great deluge to which all the legends of mankind refer , and which I have supposed , elsewhere , to refer to the destruction of " Atlantis " ; but it must be remembered that both east and west of the Atlantic the traditions of mankind refer to several deluges  --  to a series of catastrophes  --  occurring at times far apart . It may be that the legend of the Tower of Babel refers to an event far anterior in time even to the deluge of Noah or Deucalion ; or it may be , as often happens , that the chronology of this legend has been inverted . The Tahoe legend continues : " Half a moon had not elapsed , however , before the earth was again troubled , this time with strong convulsions and thunderings , upon which the masters took refuge in their great tower , closing the people out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting into canoes , paddled for life from the awful sight behind them ; for the land was tossing like a troubled sea , and casting up fire , smoke , and ashes . The flames went up to the very heavens , and melted many stars , SO THAT THEY RAINED DOWN IN MOLTEN METAL UPON THE EARTH , forming the ore " gold ? " that white men seek . The Sierra was mounded up from the bosom of the earth ; while the place where the great fort stood sank , leaving only the dome on the top exposed above the waters of Lake Tahoe . The inmates of the temple-tower clung to this dome to save themselves from drowning ; but the Great Spirit walked upon the waters in his wrath , and took the oppressors one by one , like pebbles , and threw them far into the recesses of a great cavern on the east side of the lake , called to this day the Spirit Lodge , where the waters shut them in . There must they remain till the last great volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , is to again set them free . In the depths of cavern-prison they may still be heard , wailing and their cave , moaning , when the snows melt and the waters swell in the lake . " 1 Here we have the usual mingling of fact and myth . The legend describes accurately , no doubt , the awful appearance of the tossing earth and the falling fire and d ? bris ; the people flying to rivers and taking shelter in the caves ) and some of them closed up in the caves for ever . The legend , as is usual , accommodates itself to the geography and topography of the country in which the narrators live . In the Aztec creation-myths , as preserved by the Fray Andres de Olmos , and taken down by him from the lips of those who narrated the Aztec traditions to him , we have an account of the destruction of mankind by the sun , which reads as follows : The sun had risen indeed , and with the glory of the cruel fire about him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he moved not . There he lay on the horizon ; and when the deities sent Tlotli , their messenger , to him , with orders that he should go on upon his way , his ominous answer was that he would never leave that place till he had destroyed and put an end to them all . Then a great fear fell upon some , while others were moved only to anger ; and among the others was one Citli , who immediately strung his bow and advanced against the glittering enemy . By quickly lowering his head the sun avoided the first arrow shot at him ; but the second and third had attained his body in quick succession , when , filled with fury , he seized the last and launched it back upon his assailant . And the brave Citli laid shaft to string never more , for the arrow of the sun pierced his forehead . Then all was dismay in the assembly of the gods , and despair filled their hearts , for they saw that 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not prevail against the shining one ; and they agreed to die , and to cut themselves open through the breast . . Xololt was appointed minister , and he killed his companions one by one , and last of all he slew himself also . . . . Immediately after the death of the gods , the sun began his motion in the heavens ; and a man called Tecuzistecatl , or Tezcociztecatl , who , when Nanahuatzin leaped into the fire , had retired into a cave , now emerged from his concealment as the moon . Others say that instead of going into a cave , this Tecuzistecatl had leaped into the fire after Nanahuatzin , but that the heat of the fire being somewhat abated he had come out less brilliant than the sun . Still another variation is that the sun and moon came out equally bright , but this not seeming good to the gods , one of them took a rabbit by the heels and slung it into the face of the moon , dimming its luster with a blotch whose mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the same Titanic battle between the gods , the godlike men of old  --  " the old ones "  --  and the Comet , which appears in the Norse legends , when Odin , Thor , Prey , Tyr , and Heimdal boldly march out to encounter the Comet and fall dead , like Citli , before the weapons or the poisonous breath of the monster . In the same way we see in Hesiod the great Jove , rising high on Olympus and smiting Typhaon with his lightnings . And we shall see this idea of a conflict between the gods and the great demon occurring all through the legends . And it may be that the three arrows of this American story represent the three comets spoken of in Hesiod , and the Fenris-wolf , Midgard-serpent , and Surt or Garm of the Goths : the first arrow did not strike the sun ; the second and the third " attained its body , " and then the enraged sun launched the last arrow back at Citli , at the earth ; and thereupon despair filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 62. p. 171 The Avesta , the sacred book of the ancient Persians , written in the Zend dialect , tells the same story . I have already given one version of it : Ahura Mazda is the good god , the kind creator of life and growth ; he sent the sun , the fertilizing rain . He created for the ancestors of the Persians a beautiful land , a paradise , a warm and fertile country . But Ahriman , the genius of evil , created Azhidahaka , " the biting snake of winter . " " He had triple jaws , three heads , six eyes , the strength of a thousand beings . " He brings ruin and winter on the fair land . Then comes a mighty hero , Thraetaona , who kills the snake and rescues the land. 1 In the Persian legends we have Feridun , the hero of the Shah-Nameh . There is a serpent-king called Zohak , who has committed dreadful crimes , assisted by a demon called Iblis . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder , which was granted . Then from the shoulder sprang two dreadful serpents . Iblis told him that these must be fed every day with the brains of two children . So the human race was gradually being exterminated . Then Feridun , beautiful and strong , rose up and killed the serpent-king Zohak , and delivered his country . Zohak is the same as Azhidahaka in the Avesta  --  " the biting snake of winter . " 2 He is Python ; he is Typhaon ; he is the Fenris-wolf ; he is the Midgard-serpent . The Persian fire-worship is based on the primeval recognition of the value of light and fire , growing out of this Age of Darkness and winter . In the legends of the Hindoos we read of the fight between Rama , the sun-god ( Ra was the Egyptian god of the sun ) , and Ravana , a giant who , accompanied by the 1 . Poor , " Sanskrit Literature , " p. 144. 2 . Ibid. , p. 158. p. 172 Rakshasas , or demons , made terrible times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that period . He carries away the wife of Rama , Sita ; her name signifies " a furrow , " and seems to refer to agriculture , and an agricultural race inhabiting the furrowed earth . He bears her struggling through the air . Rama and his allies pursue him . The monkey-god , Hanuman , helps Rama ; a bridge of stone , sixty miles long , is built across the deep ocean to the Island of Lanka , where the great battle is fought : " The stones which crop out through Southern India are said to have been dropped by the monkey builders ! " The army crosses on the bridge , as the forces of Muspelheim , in the Norse legends , marched over the bridge " Bifrost . " The battle is a terrible one . Ravana has ten heads , and as fast as Rama cuts off one another grows in its place . Finally , Rama , like Apollo , fires the terrible arrow of Brahma , the creator , and the monster falls dead . " Gods and demons are watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in showers on the victorious hero . " The body of Ravana is consumed by fire . Sita , the furrowed earth , goes through the ordeal of fire , and comes out of it purified and redeemed from all taint of the monster Ravana ; and Rama , the sun , and Sita , the earth , are separated for fourteen years ; Sita is hid in the dark jungle , and then they are married again , and live happily together ever after . Here we have the battle in the air between the sun and the demon : the earth is taken possession of by the demon ; the demon is finally consumed by fire , and perishes ; the earth goes through an ordeal of fire , a conflagration ; and for fourteen years the earth and sun do not see each other ; the earth is hid in a dark jungle ; but p. 173 eventually the sun returns , and the loving couple are again married , and live happily for ever after . The Phoibos Apollo of the Greek legends was , Byron tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god of life and poetry and light , The sun in human limbs arrayed , and brow All radiant from his triumph in the fight . The shaft had just been shot , the arrow bright With an immortal 's vengeance ; in his eye And nostril beautiful disdain , and might , And majesty flash their full lightnings by , Developing in that one glance the deity . " This fight , so magnificently described , was the sun-god 's battle with Python , the destroyer , the serpent , the dragon , the Comet . What was Python doing ? He was " stealing the springs and fountains . " That is to say , the great heat was drying up the water-courses of the earth . " The arrow bright with an immortal 's vengeance , " was the shaft with which Apollo broke the fiend to pieces and tumbled him down to the earth , and saved the springs and the clouds and the perishing ocean . When we turn to America , the legends tell us of the same great battle between good and evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare Nana , is , in the Algonquin legends , the White One , the light , the sun . " His foe was the glittering prince of serpents " - the Comet. 1 Among the Iroquois , according to the Jesuit missionary , Father Brebeuf , who resided among the Hurons in 1626 , there was a legend of two brothers , Ioskeba and Tawiscara , which mean , in the Oneida dialect , the White One , the light , the sun , and the Dark One , the night . 1 . Brinton 's " Myths , " p. 182. p. 174 They were twins , born of a virgin mother , who died in giving them life . Their grandmother was the moon ( the water deity ) , called At-aeusic , a word which signifies " she bathes herself , " derived from the word for water . " The brothers quarreled , and finally came to blows , the former using the horns of a stag , the latter the wild rose . He of the weaker weapon was very naturally discomfited and sorely wounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step , and as it fell turned into flint-stones . The victor returned to his grandmother in the far east , and established his lodge on the borders of the great ocean , whence the sun comes . In time he became the father of mankind , and special guardian of the Iroquois . The earth was at first arid and sterile , but he destroyed the gigantic frog which had swallowed all the waters , and guided the torrents into smooth streams and lakes . The woods he stocked with game ; and , having learned from the great tortoise who supports the world how to make fire , taught his children , the Indians , this indispensable art . . . . Sometimes they spoke of him as the sun , but this is only figuratively. " 1 Here we have the light and darkness , the sun and the night , battling with each other ; the sun fights with a younger brother , another luminary , the comet ; the comet is broken up ; it flies for life , the red blood ( the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth wherever the blood ( the clay ) falls . The victorious sun re-establishes himself in the east . And then the myth of the sun merges into the legends concerning a great people , who were the fathers of mankind who dwelt " in the east , " on the borders of the great eastern ocean , the Atlantic . " The earth was at first arid and sterile , " covered with d ? bris and stones ; but the returning sun , the White One , destroys the gigantic frog , emblem of cold and water , the great snows and ice-deposits ; this 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 184. p. 175 frog had " swallowed all the waters , " that is to say , the falling rains had been congealed in these great snow-banks and glaciers ; the sun melts them , and kills the frog ; the waters pour forth in deluging floods ; Manibozho " guides the torrents into smooth streams and lakes " ; the woods return , and become once more full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun and the sun-land in the east . From this sun-land , represented as " a tortoise , " always the emblem of an island , the Iroquois derive the knowledge of " how to make fire . " This coming of the monster , his attack upon and conquest of the sun , his apparent swallowing of that orb , are all found represented on both sides of the Atlantic , on the walls of temples and in great earth-mounds , in the image of a gigantic serpent holding a globe in its mouth . This long-trailing object in the skies was probably the origin of that primeval serpent-worship found all over the world . And hence the association of the serpent in so many religions with the evil-one . In itself , the serpent should no more represent moral wrong than the lizard , the crocodile , or the frog ; but the hereditary abhorrence with which he is regarded by mankind extends to no other created thing . He is the image of the great destroyer , the wronger , the enemy . Let us turn to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tupi Indians of Brazil : " Monau , without beginning or end , author of all that is , seeing the ingratitude of men , and their contempt for him who had made them thus joyous , withdrew from them , and sent upon them tata , the divine fire , which burned all that was on the surface of the earth . He 1 . " Une F ? te Br ? silienne c ? l ? br ? ? Rouen en 1550 , " par M. Ferdinand Denis , p. 82. p. 176 swept about the fire in such a way that in places he raised mountains , and in others dug valleys . Of all men one alone , Irin Mag ? , was saved , whom Monau carried into the heaven . He , seeing all things destroyed , spoke thus to Monau : ' Wilt thou also destroy the heavens and their garniture ? Alas ! henceforth where will be our home ? Why should I live , since there is none other of my kind ? Then Monau was so filled with pity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quenched the fire , and flowed on all sides , forming the ocean , which we call the parana , the great waters . " 1 The prayer of Irin Mag ? , when he calls on God to save the garniture of the heavens , reminds one vividly of the prayer of the Earth in Ovid . It might be inferred that heaven meant in the Tupi legend the heavenly land , not the skies ; this is rendered the more probable because we find Irin asking where should he dwell if heaven is destroyed . This could scarcely allude to a spiritual heaven . And here I would note a singular coincidence : The fire that fell from heaven was the divine tata . In Egypt the Dame of deity was " ta-ta , " or " pta-pta , " which signified father . This became in the Hebrew " ya-ya , " from which we derive the root of Jah , Jehovah . And this word is found in many languages in Europe and America , and even in our own , as , " da-da , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was fire from the supreme father . Who can doubt the oneness of the human race , when millions of threads of tradition and language thus cross each other through it in all directions , like the web of a mighty fabric ? We cross from one continent to another , from the torrid part of South America to the frozen regions of North America , and the same legend meets us. 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 227. p. 177 The Tacullies of British Columbia believe that the earth was formed by a musk-rat , who , diving into the universal sea , brought up the land in his mouth and spit it out , until he had formed " quite an island , and , by degrees , the whole earth " : " In some unexplained way , this earth became afterward peopled in every part , and it remained , until a fierce fire , of several days ' duration , swept over it , destroying all life , with two exceptions ; one man and one woman hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , and from these two has the world since been repeopled. " 1 Brief as is this narrative , it preserves the natural sequence of events : First , the world is made ; then it becomes peopled in every part ; then a fierce fire sweeps over it for several days , consuming all life , except two persons , who save themselves by hiding in a deep cave ; and from these the world is repeopled . How wonderfully does all this resemble the Scandinavian story ! It has oftentimes been urged , by the skeptical , when legends of Noah 's flood were found among rude races , that they had been derived from Christian missionaries . But these myths can not be accounted for in this way ; for the missionaries did not teach that the world was once destroyed by fire , and that a remnant of mankind escaped by taking refuge in a cave ; although , as we shall see , such a legend really appears in several places hidden in the leaves of the Bible itself . We leave the remote north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ute Indians of California and Utah . This is their legend : " The Ute philosopher declares the sun to be a living personage , and explains his passage across the heavens along an appointed way by giving an account of a fierce 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 98 p. 178 personal conflict between Ta-vi , the sun-god , and Ta-wats , one of the supreme gods of his mythology . " In that , long ago , the time to which all mythology refers , the sun roamed the earth at will . When he came too near with his fierce heat the people were scorched , and when he hid away in his cave for a long time , too idle to come forth , the night was long and the earth cold . Once upon a time Ta-wats , the hare-god , was sitting with his family by the camp-fire in the solemn woods , anxiously waiting for the return of Ta-vi , the wayward sun-god . Wearied with long watching , the hare-god fell asleep , and the sun-god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta-wats . Foreseeing the vengeance which would be thus provoked , he fled back to his cave beneath the earth . Ta-wats awoke in great anger , and speedily determined to go and fight the sun-god . After a long journey of many adventures the hare-god came to the brink of the earth , and there watched long and patiently , till at last the sun-god coming out he shot an arrow at his face , but the fierce heat consumed the arrow ere it had finished its intended course ; then another arrow was sped , but that also was consumed ; and another , and still another , till only one remained in his quiver , but this was the magical arrow that had never failed its mark . Ta-wats , holding it in his hand , lifted the barb to his eye and baptized it in a divine tear ; then the arrow was sped and struck the sun-god full in the face , and the sun was shivered into a thousand fragments , which fell to the earth , causing a general conflagration . Then Ta-wats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as he fled the burning earth consumed his feet , consumed his legs , consumed his body , consumed his bands and his arms  --  all were consumed but the head alone , which bowled across valleys and over mountains , fleeing destruction from the burning earth , until at last , swollen with heat , the eyes of the god burst and the tears gushed forth in a flood which spread over the earth and extinguished the fire . The sun-god was now conquered , and he appeared before a council of the gods to await sentence . In that long council were established the days and the nights , the seasons and the years , with the length p. 179 thereof , and the sun was condemned to travel across the firmament by the same trail day after day till the end of time . " 1 Here we have the succession of arrows , or comets , found in the legend of the Aztecs , and here as before it is the last arrow that destroys the sun . And here , again , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , the long absence of the sun , the great rains and the cold . Let us shift the scene again . In Peru  --  that ancient land of mysterious civilization , that brother of Egypt and Babylon , looking out through the twilight of time upon the silent waters of the Pacific , waiting in its isolation for the world once more to come to it-in this strange land we find the following legend : " Ere sun and moon was made , Viracocha , the White One , rose from the bosom of Lake Titicaca , and presided over the erection of those wondrous cities whose ruins still dot its islands and western shores , and whose history is totally lost in the night of time . " 2 He constructed the sun and moon and created the inhabitants of the earth . These latter attacked him with murderous intent ( the comet assailed the sun ? ) ; but " scorning such unequal contest he manifested his power by hurling the lightning on the hill-sides and consuming the forests , " whereupon the creatures he had created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At-achuchu . He civilized the Peruvians , taught them arts and agriculture and religion ; they called him " The teacher of all things . " He came from the east and disappeared in the Western Ocean . Four civilizers followed him who emerged from the cave 1 . " Popular Science Monthly , " October , 1879 , p , 799. 2 . Brinton 's ; " Myths of the New World , " p. 192. p. 180 Pacarin Tampu , the House of Birth. 1 These four brothers were also called Viracochas , white men . Here we have the White One coming from the east , hurling his lightning upon the earth and causing a conflagration ; and afterward civilized men emerged from a cave . They were white men ; and it is to these cave-born men that Peru owed its first civilization . Here is another and a more amplified version of the Peruvian legend : The Peruvians believed in a god called At-achuchu , already referred to , the creator of heaven and earth , and the maker of all things . From him came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up with events that seem to refer to the Age of Fire . He descended to the earth , and " there seduced the sister of certain Guachemines , rayless ones , or Darklings " ; that is to say , certain Powers of Darkness , " who then possessed it . For this crime they destroyed him . " That is to say , the Powers of Darkness destroyed the light . But not for ever . " Their sister proved pregnant , and died in her labor , giving birth to two eggs , " the sun and moon . " From these emerged the two brothers , Apocatequil and Piguerao . " Then followed the same great battle , to which we have so many references in the legends , and which always ends , as in the case of Cain and Abel , in one brother slaughtering the other . In this case , Apocatequil " was the more powerful . By touching the corpse of his mother ( the sun ? ) he brought her to life , he drove off and slew the Guachemines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 193. p. 181 At-achuchu , released the race of Indians from the soil by turning it up with a golden spade . " That is to say , he dug them out from the cave in which they were buried . " For this reason they adored him as their maker . He it was , they thought , who produced the thunder and the lightning by hurling stones with his sling ; and the thunder-bolts that fall , said they , are his children . Few villages were willing to be without one or more of these . They were in appearance small , round , smooth stones , but had the admirable properties of securing fertility to the fields , protecting from lightning , " etc. 1 I shift the scene again ; or , rather , group together the legends of three different localities . I quote : " The Takahlis " ( the Tacullies already referred to ) " of the North Pacific coast , the Yurucares of the Bolivian Cordilleras , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the world to a general conflagration , which swept over the earth , consuming everything living except a few who took refuge in a deep cave . " 2 The Botocudos of Brazil believed that the world was once destroyed by the moon falling upon it . Let us shift the scene again northward : There was once , according to the Ojibway legends , a boy ; the sun burned and spoiled his bird-skin coat ; and he swore that he would have vengeance . He persuaded his sister to make him a noose of her own hair . He fixed it just where the sun would strike the land as it rose above the earth 's disk ; and , sure enough , he caught the sun , and held it fast , so that it did not rise . " The animals who ruled the earth were immediately put into great commotion . They had no light . They called a council to debate upon the matter , and to appoint 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 165. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and cut the cord , for this was a very hazardous enterprise , as the rays of the sun would burn up whoever came so near . At last the dormouse undertook it , for at this time the dormouse was the largest animal in the world " ( the mastodon ? ) ; " when it stood up it looked like a mountain . When it got to the place where the sun was snared , its back began to smoke and burn with the intensity of the heat , and the top of its carcass was reduced to enormous heaps of ashes . It succeeded , however , in cutting the cord with its teeth and freeing the sun , but it was reduced to very small size , and has remained so ever since . " This seems to be a reminiscence of the destruction of the great mammalia. 1 The " enormous heaps of ashes " may represent the vast deposits of clay-dust . Among the Wyandots a story was told , in the seventeenth century , of a boy whose father was killed and eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare . He was small , but of prodigious strength . He climbed a tree , like Jack of the Bean-Stalk , until he reached heaven . " He set his snares for game , but when he got up at night to look at them he found everything on fire . His sister told him he had caught the sun unawares , and when the boy , Chakabech , went to see , so it was . But he dared not go near enough to let him out . But by chance he found a little mouse , and blew upon her until she grew so big " ( again the mastodon ) " that she could set the sun free , and he went on his way . But while he was held in the snare , day failed down here on earth . " It was the age of darkness2 The Dog-Rib Indians , far in the northwest of America , near the Esquimaux , have a similar story : Chakabech becomes Chapewee . He too climbs a tree , but it is in pursuit 1 . Tylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Le Jeune ( 1637 ) , in " R ? lations des Jesuits dans la Nouvelle France , " vol. i , p. 54. p. 183 of a squirrel , until he reaches heaven . He set a snare made of his sister 's hair and caught the sun . " The sky was instantly darkened . Chapewee 's family said to him , ' You must have done something wrong when you were aloft , for we no longer enjoy the light of day . ' ' I have , ' replied he , ' but it was unintentionally . ' Chapewee sent a number of animals to cut the snare , but the intense heat reduced them all to ashes . " At last the ground-mole working in the earth cut the snare but lost its sight , " and its nose and teeth have ever since been brown as if burnt . " 1 The natives of Siberia represented the mastodon as a great mole burrowing in the earth and casting up ridges of earth  --  the sight of the sun killed him . These sun-catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth had not yet separated . Hence we find the same story , in almost the same words , in Polynesia and America . Maui is the Polynesian god of the ancient days . He concluded , as did Ta-wats , that the days were too short . He wanted the sun to slow-up , but it would not . So he proceeded to catch it in a noose like the Ojibway boy and the Wyandot youth . The manufacture of the noose , we are told , led to the discovery of the art of rope-making . He took his brothers with him ; he armed himself , like Samson , with a jaw-bone , but instead of the jaw-bone of an ass , he , with much better taste , selected the jawbone of his mistress . She may have been a lady of fine conversational powers . They traveled far , like Ta-wats , even to the very edge of the place where the sun rises . There he set his noose . The sun came and put his head and fore-paws into it ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin 's Second Expedition , " p. 291. p. 184 tight and Maui gave him a great whipping with the jawbone ; he screamed and roared ; they held him there for a long time , ( the Age of Darkness , ) and at last they let him go ; and weak from his wounds , ( obscured by clouds , ) he crawls slowly along his path . Here the jaw of the wolf Fenris , which reached from earth to heaven , in the Scandinavian legends , becomes a veritable jaw-bone which beats and ruins the sun . It is a curious fact that the sun in this Polynesian legend is Ra , precisely the same as the name of the god of the sun in Egypt , while in Hindostan the sun-god is Ra-ma . In another Polynesian legend we read of a character who was satisfied with nothing , " even pudding would not content him , " and this unconscionable fellow worried his family out of all heart with his new ways and ideas . He represents a progressive , inventive race . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too short ; so , like Maui , he determined to catch the sun in nets and ropes ; but the sun went on . At last he succeeded ; he caught him . The good man then had time to finish his house , but the sun cried and cried " until the island of Savai was nearly drowned . " 1 And these myths of the sun being tied by a cord are , strange to say , found even in Europe . The legends tell us : " In North Germany the townsmen of B ? sum sit up in their church-tower and hold the sun by a cable all day long ; taking care of it at night , and letting it up again in the morning . In ' Reynard the Fox , ' the day is bound with a rope , and its bonds only allow it to come slowly on . The Peruvian Inca said the sun is like a tied beast , who goes ever round and round , in the same track . " 2 That is to say , they recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . 1 . Tyler 's " Early Mankind , " p. 347. 2 . Ibid. , p. 352. p. 185 Verily the bands that knit the races of the earth together are wonderful indeed , and they radiate , as I shall try to show , from one spot of the earth 's surface , alike to Polynesia , Europe , and America . Let us change the scene again to the neighborhood of the Aztecs : We are told of two youths , the ancestors of the Miztec chiefs , who separated , each going his own way to conquer lands for himself : " The braver of the two , coming to the vicinity of Tilantongo , armed with buckler and bow , was much vexed and oppressed by the ardent rays of the sun , which he took to be the lord of that district , striving to prevent his entrance therein . Then the young man strung his bow , and advanced his buckler before him , and drew shafts from his quiver . He shot these against the great light even till the going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that land , seeing that he had grievously wounded the sun and forced him to hide behind the mountains . Upon this story is founded the lordship of all the caciques of Mizteca , and upon their descent from this mighty archer , their ancestor . Even to this day , the chiefs of the Miztecs blazon as their arms a plumed chief with bow and arrows and shield , and the sun in front of him setting behind gray clouds . " 1 Are these two young men , one of whom attacks and injures the sun , the two wolves of the Gothic legends , the two comets , who devoured the sun and moon ? And did the Miztec barbarians , in their vanity , claim descent from these monstrous creatures of the sky ? Why not , when the historical heroes of antiquity traced their pedigree back to the gods ; and the rulers of Peru , Egypt , and China pretended to be the lineal offspring of the sun ? And there are not wanting those , even in Europe , who 1 . Bancroft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73. p. 186 yet believe that the blood-royal differs in some of its constituents from the blood of the common people " What , will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground ? " In the Aztec legends there were four ages , or suns , as they were termed . The first terminated , according to Gama , in a destruction of the people of the world by hunger ; the second ended in a destruction by winds ; in the third , the human race was swept away by fire , and the fourth destruction was by water . And in the Hindoo legends we find the same series of great cycles , or ages : one of the Shastas teaches that the human race has been destroyed four times  --  first by water , secondly by winds , thirdly the earth swallowed them , and lastly fire consumed them. 1 I come now to a most extraordinary record : In the prayer of the Aztecs to the great god Tezcatlipoca , " the supreme , invisible god , " a prayer offered up in time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the people by stones and fire . It would almost seem as if this great prayer , noble and sublime in its language , was first poured out in the very midst of the Age of Fire , wrung from the human heart by the most appalling calamity that ever overtook the race ; and that it was transmitted from age to age , as the hymns of the Vedas and the prayers of the Hebrews have been preserved , for thousands of years , down to our own times , when it was carefully transcribed by a missionary priest . It is as follows : " O mighty Lord , under whose wing we find defense and shelter , thou art invisible and impalpable , even as night and the air . How can I , that am so mean and worthless , dare to appear before thy majesty ? Stuttering 1 .

Peradventure , wilt thou permit that the temples , and the places of prayer , and the altars , built for thy service , be razed and destroyed , and no memory of them left ?

" 1 Now it may be doubted by some whether this most extraordinary supplication could have come down from the Glacial Age ; but it must be remembered that it may have been many times repeated in the deep cavern before the terror fled from the souls of the desolate fragment of the race ; and , once established as a religious prayer , associated with such dreadful events , who would dare to change a word of it ? 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 200. p. 191 Who would dare , among ourselves , to alter a syllable of the " Lord 's Prayer " ? Even though Christianity should endure for ten thousand years upon the face of the earth ; even though the art of writing were lost , and civilization itself had perished , it would pass unchanged from mouth to mouth and from generation to generation , crystallized into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious instinct . There can be no doubt of the authenticity of this and the other ancient prayers to Tezcatlipoca , which I shall quote hereafter . I repeat what H. H. Bancroft says , in a foot-note , in his great work : " Father Bernardino de Sahagun , a Spanish Franciscan , was one of the first preachers sent to Mexico , where he was much employed in the instruction of the native youth , working for the most part in the province of Tezcuco . While there , in the city of Tepeopulco , in the latter part of the sixteenth century , he began the work , best known to us as the ' Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva Espa ? a , ' from which the above prayers have been taken . It would be hard to imagine a work of such a character constructed after a better fashion of working than his . Gathering the principal natives of the town in which he carried on his labors , he induced them to appoint him a number of persons , the most learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . These learned Mexicans being collected , Father Sahagun was accustomed to get them to paint down in their native fashion the various legends , details of history and mythology , and so on , that he wanted ; at the foot of the said . pictures these learned Mexicans wrote out the explanations of the same in the Mexican tongue ; and this explanation the Father Sahagun translated into Spanish . That translation purports to be what we now read as the ' Historia General . ' " 1 1 . " The Native Races of the Pacific States , " vol. iii , p. 231. p. 192 Sahagun was a good and holy man , who was doubtless inspired of God , in the face of much opposition and many doubts , to perpetuate , for the benefit of the race , these wonderful testimonials of man 's existence , condition , opinions , and feelings in the last great cataclysm which shook the whole world and nearly destroyed it . Religions may perish ; the name of the Deity may change with race and time and tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eloquent appeals from the hearts of millions of men , repeated through thousands of generations , as these Aztec prayers have been . Whether addressed to Tezcatlipoca , Zeus , Jove , Jehovah , or God , they pass alike direct from the heart of the creature to the heart of the Creator ; they are of the threads that tie together matter and spirit . In conclusion , let me recapitulate 1 . The original surface-rocks , underneath the Drift , are , we have seen , decomposed and changed , for varying depths of from one to one hundred feet , by fire ; they are metamorphosed , and their metallic constituents vaporized out of them by heat . 2 . Only tremendous heat could have lifted the water of the seas into clouds , and formed the age of snow and floods evidenced by the secondary Drift . 3 . The traditions of the following races tell us that the earth was once swept by a great conflagration : a . The ancient Britons , as narrated in the mythology of the Druids . b . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Scandinavians , as appears in the Elder Edda and Younger Edda. d . The ancient Romans , as narrated by Ovid. e . The ancient Toltecs of Central America , as told in their sacred books . p. 193 f . The ancient Aztecs of Mexico , as transcribed by Fray de Olmos. g . The ancient Persians , as recorded in the Zend-Avesta. h . The ancient Hindoos , as told in their sacred books . i . The Tahoe Indians of California , as appears by their living traditions . Also by the legends of  --  j . The Tupi Indians of Brazil . k . The Tacullies of British America . 1 . The Ute Indians of California and Utah . m . The Peruvians. n . The Yurucares of the Bolivian Cordilleras. o . The Mbocobi of Paraguay . p . The Botocudos of Brazil . q . The Ojibway Indians of the United States . r . The Wyandot Indians of the United States . s . Lastly , the Dog-rib Indians of British Columbia . We must concede that these legends of a world-embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are a colossal falsehood  --  an invention of man . If the latter , then that invention and falsehood must have been concocted at a time when the ancestors of the Greeks , Romans , Hindoos , Persians , Goths , Toltecs , Aztecs , Peruvians , and the Indians of Brazil , the United States , the west coast of South America , and the northwestern extremity of North America , and the Polynesians , ( who have kindred traditions , ) all dwelt together , as one people , alike in language and alike in color of their hair , eyes , and skin . At that time , therefore , all the widely separated regions , now inhabited by these races , must have been without human inhabitants ; the race must have been a mere handful , and dwelling in one spot . p. 194 What vast lapses of time must have been required before mankind slowly overflowed to these remote regions of the earth , and changed into these various races speaking such diverse tongues ! And if we take the ground that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood , then we must conclude that this handful of men , before they dispersed , in the very infancy of the world , shared in the propagation of a prodigious lie , and religiously perpetuated it for tens of thousands of years . And then the question arises , How did they hit upon a lie that accords so completely with the revelations of science ? They possessed no great public works , in that infant age , which would penetrate through hundreds of feet of d ? bris , and lay bare the decomposed rocks beneath ; therefore they did not make a theory to suit an observed fact . And how did mankind come to be reduced to a handful ? If men grew , in the first instance , out of bestial forms , mindless and speechless , they would have propagated and covered the world as did the bear and the wolf . But after they had passed this stage , and had so far developed as to be human in speech and brain , some cause reduced them again to a handful . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , some blazing beast or serpent , which appeared in the heavens , which filled the world with conflagrations , and which destroyed the human race , except a remnant , who saved themselves in caverns or in the water ; and from this seed , this handful , mankind again replenished the earth , and spread gradually to all the continents and the islands of the sea . p. 195 CHAPTER VII . LEGENDS OF THE CAVE-LIFE . I HAVE shown that man could only have escaped the fire , the poisonous gases , and the falling stones and clay-dust , by taking refuge in the water or in the deep caves of the earth . And hence everywhere in the ancient legends we find the races claiming that they came up out of the earth . Man was earth-born . The Toltecs and Aztecs traced back their origin to " the seven caves . " We have seen the ancestors of the Peruvians emerging from the primeval cave , Pacarin-Tampu ; and the Aztec Nanahuatzin taking refuge in a cave ; and the ancestors of the Yurucares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biding themselves from the conflagration in a cave ; and we have seen the tyrannical and cruel race of the Tahoe legend buried in a cave . And , passing to a far-distant region , we find the Bungogees and Pankhoos , Hill tribes , of the most ancient races of Chittagong , in British India , relating that " their ancestors came out of a cave in the earth , under the guidance of a chief named Tlandrokpah. " 1 We read in the Toltec legends that a dreadful hurricane visited the earth in the early age , and carried away trees , mounds , horses , etc. , and the people escaped by seeking safety in caves and places where the great hurricane 1 . Captain Lewin , " The Hill Tribes of Chittagong " p. 95 , 1869. p. 196 could not reach them . After a few days they came forth " to see what had become of the earth , when they found it all populated with monkeys . All this time they were in darkness , without the light of the sun Or the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A North American tribe , a branch of the Tinneh of British America , have a legend that " the earth existed first in a chaotic state , with only one human inhabitant , a woman , who dwelt in a cave and lived on berries . " She met one day a mysterious animal , like a dog , who transformed himself into a handsome young man , and they became the parents of a giant race . " 2 There seems to be an allusion to the cave-life in Ovid , where , detailing the events that followed soon after the creation , he says : " Then for the first time did the parched air glow with sultry heat , and the ice , bound up by the winds , was pendent . Then for the first time did men enter houses ; those houses were caverns , and thick shrubs , and twigs fastened together with bark . " 3 But it is in the legends of the Navajo Indians of North America that we find the most complete account of the cave-life . It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pueblos , say that at one time all the nations , Navajos , Pueblos , Coyoteros , and white people , lived together tinder ground , in the heart of a mountain , near the river San Juan . Their food was meat , which they had in abundance , for all kinds of game were closed up with them in their cave ; but their light was dim , and only endured for a few hours each day . There were , happily , two dumb men among the Navajos , flute-players , 1 . " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 239. 2 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 105. 3 . " The Metamorphoses , " Fable IV. p. 197 who enlivened the darkness with music . One of these , striking by chance on the roof of the limbo with his flute , brought out a hollow sound , upon which the elders of the tribe determined to bore in the direction whence the sound came . The flute was then set up against the roof , and the Raccoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he could not . Then the Moth-worm mounted into the breach , and bored and bored till he found himself suddenly on the outside of the mountain , and surrounded by water . " We shall see hereafter that , in the early ages , mankind , all over the world , was divided into totemic septs or families , bearing animal names . It was out of this fact that the fables of animals possessing human speech arose . When we are told that the Fox talked to the Crow or the Wolf , it simply means that a man of the Fox totem talked to a man of the Crow or Wolf totem . And , consequently , when we read , in the foregoing legend , that the Raccoon went up to dig a way out of the cave and could not , it signifies that a man of the Raccoon totem made the attempt and failed , while a man of the Moth-worm totem succeeded . We shall see hereafter that these totemic distinctions probably represented original race or ethnic differences . The Navajo legend continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moth-worm , ) heaped up a little mound , and set himself down on it to observe and ponder the situation . A critical situation enough !  --  for from the four corners of the universe four great white Swans bore down upon him , every one with two arrows , one under each wing . The Swan from the north reached him first , and , having pierced him with two arrows , drew them out and examined their points , exclaiming , as the result , ' He is of my race . ' So , also , in succession , did all the others . Then they went away ; and toward the directions in which they departed , to the north , south , east , and west , were found four great arroyos , p. 198 by which all the water flowed off , leaving only MUD . The Worm now returned to the cave , and the Raccoon went up into the mud , sinking in it mid-leg deep , as the marks on his fur show to this day . And the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mud was dried away . " Then the men and the animals began to come up from their cave , and their coming up required several days . First came the Navajos , and no sooner had they reached the surface than they commenced gaming at patole , their favorite game . Then came the Pueblos and other Indians , who crop their hair and build houses . Lastly came the white people , who started off at once for the rising sun , and were lost sight of for many winters . " When these nations lived under ground they all spake one tongue ; but , with the light of day and the level of earth , came many languages . The earth was at this time very small , and the light was quite as scanty as it had been down below , for there was as yet no heaven , no sun , nor moon , nor stars . So another council of the ancients was held , and a committee of their number appointed to manufacture these luminaries. " 1 Here we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the races of men had differentiated , a remnant of mankind was driven , by some great event , into a cave ; all kinds of animals had sought shelter in. the same place ; something  --  the Drift  --  had closed up the mouth of the cavern ; the men subsisted on the animals . At last they dug their way out , to find the world covered with mud and water . Great winds cut the mud into deep valleys , by which the waters ran off . The mud was everywhere ; gradually it dried up . But outside the cave it was nearly as dark as it was within it ; the clouds covered the world ; neither sun , moon , nor stars could be seen ; the earth was very small , that is , but little of it was above the waste of waters . 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 81. p. 199 And here we have the people longing for the return of the sun . The legend proceeds to give an account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had charge of the construction of the sun , through his clumsiness , came near setting fire to the world . " The old men , however , either more lenient than Zeus , or lacking his thunder , contented themselves with forcing the offender back by puffing the smoke of their pipes into his face . " Here we have the event , which properly should have preceded the cave-story , brought in subsequent to it . The sun nearly burns up the earth , and the earth is saved amid the smoke of incense from the pipes of the old men  --  the gods . And we are told that the increasing size of the earth has four times rendered it necessary that the sun should be put farther back from the earth . The clearer the atmosphere , the farther away the sun has appeared . " At night , also , the other dumb man issues from this cave , bearing the moon under his arm , and lighting up such part of the world as he can . Next , the old men set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stars in beautiful patterns of bears , birds , and such things . " That is to say , a civilized race ' began to divide up the heavens into constellations , to which they gave the names of the Great and Little Bear , the Wolf , the Serpent , the Dragon , the Eagle , the Swan , the Crane , the Peacock , the Toucan , the Crow , etc. ; some of which names they retain among ourselves to this day . " But , just as they had made a beginning , a prairie-wolf rushed in , and , crying out , ' Why all this trouble and embroidery ? ' scattered the pile of stars over all the floor of heaven , just as they still lie . " This iconoclastic and un ? sthetical prairie-wolf represents a barbarian 's incapacity to see in the arrangement p. 200 of the stars any such constellations , or , in fact , anything but an unmeaning jumble of cinders . And then we learn how the tribes of men separated : " The old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared two earthen tinages , or water-jars , and having decorated one with bright colors , filled it with trifles ; while the other was left plain on the outside , but filled within with flocks and herds and riches of all kinds . These jars being covered , and presented to the Navajos and Pueblos , the former chose the gaudy but paltry jar ; while the Pueblos received the plain and rich vessel  --  each nation showing , in its choice , traits which characterize it to this day . " In the legends of the Lenni-Lenape ,  --  the Delaware Indians ,  --  mankind was once buried in the earth with a wolf ; and they owed their release to the wolf , who scratched away the soil and dug out a means of escape for the men and for himself . The Root-Diggers of California were released in the same way by a coyote . " 1 " The Tonkaways , a wild people of Texas , still celebrate this early entombment of the race in a most curious fashion . They have a grand annual dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is buried in the earth ; the others , clothed in wolf-skins , walk over him , snuff around him , howl in lupine style , and finally dig him up with their nails . " 2 Compare this American custom with the religious ceremony of an ancient Italian tribe : " Three thousand years ago the Hirpani , or Wolves , an ancient Sabine tribe of Italy , were wont to collect on Mount Soracte , and there go through certain rites , in memory of an oracle which predicted their extinction when they ceased to gain their living as wolves do , by violence and plunder . Therefore they dressed in wolf-skins , 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 247. 2 . Ibid. p. 201 ran with barks and howls over burning coals , and gnawed wolfishly whatever they could seize . " 1 All the tribes of the Creeks , Seminoles , Choctaws , Chickasaws , and Natchez , who , according to tradition , were in remote times banded into one common confederacy , unanimously located their earliest ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black River , in the Natchez country , whence they pretended to have emerged . This hill is an elevation of earth about half a mile square and fifteen or twenty feet high . From its northeast corner a wall of equal height extends for nearly half a mile to the high land . This was the Nunne Chaha , properly Nanih waiya , sloping hill , famous in Choctaw story , and which Captain Gregg found they had not yet forgotten in their Western home . " The legend was , that in its center was a cave , the house of the Master of Breath . Here he made the first men from the clay around him , and , as at that time the waters covered the earth , he raised the wall to dry them on . When the soft mud had hardened into elastic flesh and firm bone , he banished the waters to their channels and beds , and gave the dry land to his creatures . " 2 Here , again , we have the beginnings of the present race of men in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and we have the water subsiding into its channels and beds , and the dry land appearing , whereupon the men emerged from the cave . A parallel to this Southern legend occurs among the Six Nations of the North . They with one consent looked to a mountain near the falls of the Oswego River , in the State of New York , as the locality where their forefathers saw the light of day ; and their name , Oneida , signifies the people of the stone . 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 217. 2 . Ibid. , p. 242. p. 202 The cave of Pacarin-Tampu , already alluded to , the Lodgings of the Dawn , or the Place of Birth of the Peruvians , was five leagues distant from Cuzco , surrounded by a sacred grove , and inclosed with temples of great antiquity . " From its hallowed recesses the mythical civilizers , of Peru , tile first of men , emerged , and in it , during the time of the flood , the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 We read in the legends of Oraibi , hereafter quoted more fully , that the people climbed up a ladder from a lower world to this  --  that is , they ascended from the cave in which they had taken refuge . This was in an age of cold and darkness ; there was yet no sun or moon . The natives in the neighborhood of Mount Shasta , in Northern California , have a strange legend which refers to the age of Caves and Ice . They say the Great Spirit made Mount Shasta first : " Boring a hole in the sky , " ( the heavens cleft in twain of the Edda ? ) " using a large stone as an auger , " ( the fall of stones and pebbles ? ) " he pushed down snow and ice until they reached the desired height ; then he stepped from cloud to cloud down to the great icy pile , and from it to the earth , where he planted the first trees by merely putting his finger into the soil here and there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced water ; the water ran down the sides of the mountains , refreshed the trees , and made rivers . The Creator gathered the leaves that fell from the trees , blew upon them , and they became birds , " etc. 2 This is a representation of the end of the Glacial Age . But the legends of these Indians of Mount Shasta go still further . After narrating , as above , the fall of a 1 . Balboa , " Histoire du P ? rou , " p. 4. 2 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 90. p. 203 stone from heaven , and the formation of immense masses of ice , which subsequently melted and formed rivers , and after the Creator had made trees , birds , . and animals , especially the grizzly bear , then we have a legend which reminds us of the cave-life which accompanied the great catastrophe : " Indeed , this animal " ( the grizzly bear ) " was then so large , strong , and cunning , that the Creator somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wigwam for himself , where he might reside while on earth in the most perfect security and comfort . So the smoke was soon to be seen curling up from the mountain where the Great Spirit and his family lived , and still live , though their hearth-fire is alive no longer , now that the white-man is in the land . " Here the superior race seeks shelter in a cave on Mount Shasta , and their camp-fire is associated with the smoke which once went forth out of the volcano ; while an inferior race , a Neanderthal race , dwell in the plains at the foot of the mountain . " This was thousands of snows ago , and there came after this a late and severe spring-time , in which a memorable storm blew up from the sea , shaking the huge lodge " ( Mount Shasta ) " to its base . " ( Another recollection of the Ice Age . ) " The Great Spirit commanded his daughter , little more than an infant , to go up and bid the wind to be still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fatherly way , not to put her head out into the blast , but only to thrust out her little red arm and make a sign , before she delivered her message . " 1 Here we seem to have a reminiscence of the cave-dwellers , looking out at the terrible tempest from their places of shelter . 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 91. p. 204 The child of the Great Spirit exposes herself too much , is caught by the wind and blown down the mountain-side , where she is found , shivering on the snow , by a family of grizzly bears . These grizzly bears evidently possessed some humane as well as human traits : " They walked then on their hind-legs like men , and talked , and carried clubs , using the fore-limbs as men use their arms . " They represent in their bear-skins the rude , fur-clad race that were developed during the intense cold of the Glacial Age . The child of the Great Spirit , the superior race , intermarries with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of men , to wit , the Indians . " But the Great Spirit punished the grizzly bears by depriving them of the power of speech , and of standing erect  --  in short , by making true bears of them . But no Indian will , to this day , kill a grizzly bear , recognizing as he does the tie of blood . " Again , we are told : " The inhabitants of central Europe and the Teutonic races who came late to England place their mythical heroes under ground in caves , in vaults beneath enchanted castles , or in mounds which rise up and open , and show their buried inhabitants alive and busy about the avocations of earthly men . . . . In Morayshire the buried race are supposed to be under the sandhills , as they are in some parts of Brittany . " 1 Associated with these legends we find many that refer to the time of great cold , and snow , and ice . I give one or two specimens : In the story of the Iroquois , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the White One , the Light One , the Sun , after he had destroyed the monster who covered the earth with 1 . " Frost and Fire , " vol. ii , p. 190. p. 205 blood and stones , then destroyed the gigantic frog . The frog , a cold-blooded , moist reptile , was always the emblem of water and cold ; it represented the great ice-fields that squatted , frog-like , on the face of the earth . It had " swallowed all the waters , " says the Iroquois legend ; that is , " the waters were congealed in it ; and when it was killed great and destructive torrents broke forth and devastated the land , and Manibozho , the White One , the beneficent Sun , guided these waters into smooth streams and lakes . " The Aztecs adored the goddess of water under the figure of a great green frog carved from a single emerald. 1 In the Omaha we have the fable of " How the Rabbit killed the Winter , " told in the Indian manner . The Rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he , probably , as we shall see , a recollection of a great race , whose totem was the Hare . I condense the Indian story : " The Rabbit in the past time moving came where the Winter was . The Winter said : ' You have not been here lately ; sit down . ' The Rabbit said he came because his grandmother had altogether beaten the life out of him " ( the fallen d ? bris ? ) . " The Winter went hunting . It was very cold : there was a snow-storm . The Rabbit seared up a deer . ' Shoot him , ' said the Rabbit . ' No ; I do not hunt such things as that , ' said the Winter . They came upon some men . That was the Winter 's game . He killed the men and boiled them for supper , " ( cave-cannibalism ) . " The Rabbit refused to eat the human flesh . The Winter went hunting again . The Rabbit found out from the Winter 's wife that the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of a Rocky Mountain sheep . The Rabbit procured one . It was dark . He threw it suddenly at the Winter , saying , ' Uncle , that round thing by you is the head of a Rocky Mountain 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 185. p. 206 sheep . ' The Winter became altogether dead . Only the woman remained . Therefore from that time it has not been very cold . " Of course , any attempt to interpret such a crude myth must be guess-work . It shows , however , that the Indians believed that there was a time when the winter was much more severe than it is now ; it was very cold and dark . Associated with it is the destruction of men and cannibalism . At last the Rabbit brings a round object , ( the Sun ? ) , the head of a Rocky Mountain sheep , and the Winter looks on it , and perishes . Even tropical Peru has its legend of the Age of Ice . Garcilaso de la Vega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient indigenous poem of his nation , which seems to allude to a great event , the breaking to fragments of some large object , associated with ice and snow . Dr. Brinton translates it from the Quichua , as follows " Beauteous princess , Lo , thy brother Breaks thy vessel Now in fragments . From the blow come Thunder , lightning , Strokes of lightning And thou , princess , Tak'st the water , With it raineth , And the hail , or Snow dispenseth . Viracocha , World-constructor , World-enlivener , To this office Thee appointed , Thee created . " 1 1 . " Myths of the New World , " p. 167. p. 207 But it may be asked , How in such a period of terror and calamity  --  as we must conceive the comet to have caused-would men think of finding refuge in caves ? The answer is plain : either they or their ancestors had lived in caves . Caves were the first shelters of uncivilized men . It was not necessary to fly to the caves through the rain of falling d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great world-storm broke , and others naturally sought their usual dwelling-places . " The cavern , " says Brinton , " dimly lingered in the memories of nations . " Man is born of the earth ; he is made of the clay like Adam , created  --  " Of good red clay , Haply from Mount Aornus , beyond sweep Of the black eagle 's wing . " The cave-temples of India-the oldest temples , probably , on earth  --  are a reminiscence of this cave-life . We shall see hereafter that Lot and his daughters " dwelt in a cave " ; and we shall find Job bidden away in the " narrow-mouthed bottomless " pit or cave . 1 . " Myths of the New World , " p. 244. p. 208 CHAPTER VIII . LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF DARKNESS . ALL the cosmogonies begin with an Age of Darkness ; a damp , cold , rainy , dismal time . Hesiod tells us , speaking of the beginning of things " In truth , then , foremost sprung Chaos . . . . But from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night again sprang forth ? ther and Day , whom she bare after having conceived by union with Erebus . " Aristophanes , in his " Aves , " says : 1 " Chaos and Night and black Erebus and wide Tartarus first existed . " 2 Orpheus says : " From the beginning the gloomy night enveloped and obscured all things that were under the ether " ( the clouds ) . " The earth was invisible on account of the darkness , but the light broke through the ether " ( the clouds ) , " and illuminated the earth . " By this power were produced the sun , moon , and stars. 3 It is from Sanchoniathon that we derive most of the little we know of that ancient and mysterious people , the Ph&oelig;nicians . He lived before the Trojan war ; and of his writings but fragments survive  --  quotations in the writings of others . 1 . " The Theogony. " 2 . Faber 's " Origin of Pagan Idolatry , " vol. i , p. 255. 3 . Cory 's " Fragments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The beginning of all things was a condensed , windy air , or a breeze of thick air , and a chaos turbid and black as Erebus . " Out of this chaos was generated M ? t , which some call Ilus , " ( mud , ) " but others the putrefaction of a watery mixture . And from this sprang all the seed of the creation , and the generation of the universe . . . . And , when the air began to send forth light , winds were produced and clouds , and very great defluxions and torrents of the heavenly waters . " Was this " thick air " the air thick with comet-dust , which afterward became the mud ? Is this the meaning of the " turbid chaos " ? We turn to the Babylonian legends . Berosus wrote from records preserved in the temple of Belus at Babylon . He says : " There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an abyss of waters , wherein resided most hideous beings , which were produced of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comets ? From the " Laws of Menu , " of the Hindoos , we learn that the universe existed at first in darkness . We copy the following text from the Vedas : " The Supreme Being alone existed ; afterward there was universal darkness ; next the watery ocean was produced by the diffusion of virtue . " We turn to the legends of the Chinese , and we find the same story : Their annals begin with " Pwan-ku , or the Reign of Chaos . " 1 1 . " The Ancient Dynasties of Berosus and China , " Rev. T. P. Crawford , D. D. , p. 4. p. 210 And we are told by the Chinese historians that  --  " P'an-ku came forth in the midst of the great chaotic void , and we know not his origin ; that he knew the rationale of heaven and earth , and comprehended the changes of the Darkness and the Light . " 1 He " existed before the shining of the Light . " 2 He was " the Prince of Chaos . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , then earth , then after they existed , and the atmosphere had changed its character , man came forth . " 3 That is to say , P'an-ku lived through the Age of Darkness , during a chaotic period , and while the atmosphere was pestilential with the gases of the comet . Where did he live ? The Chinese annals tell us : " In the age after the chaos , when heaven and earth had just separated . " That is , when the great mass of cloud had just lifted from the earth : " Records had not yet been established or inscriptions invented . At first even the rulers dwelt in caves and desert places , eating raw flesh and drinking blood . At this fortunate juncture Pan-ku-sze came forth , and from that time heaven and earth began to be heaven and earth , men and things to be men and things , and so the chaotic state passed away . " 1 This is the rejuvenation of the world told of in so many legends . And these annals tell us further of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's primeval history . " At Wu  --  the Sixth Stem  --  the Darkness and the Light unite with injurious effects  --  all things become solid , " ( frozen ? ) , " and the Darkness destroys the growth of all things . 1 . Compendium of Wong-shi-Shing 1526-1590 , " Crawford , p. 3. 2 . Ibid. 3 . Ibid. , p. 2. 4 . Ibid. , p. 3. p. 211 " At Kung  --  the Seventh Stem  --  the Darkness nips all things . " But the Darkness is passing away : " At Jin  --  the Ninth Stem  --  the Light begins to nourish all things in the recesses below . " Lastly , at Tsze , all things begin to germinate . " 1 The same story is told in the " Twelve Branches . " " 1 . K'wun-tun stands for the period of chaos , the cold midnight darkness . It is said that with it all things began to germinate in the hidden recesses of the under-world . " In the 2d  --  Ch'i-fun-yoh  --  " light and heat become active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nature . " In the 3d  --  Sheh-ti-kuh  --  the stars and sun probably appear , as from this point the calendar begins . In the 5th  --  Chi-shii  --  all things in a torpid state begin to come forth . In the 8th  --  H ? en-hia  --  all things harmonize , and the present order of things is established ; that is to say , the effects of the catastrophe have largely passed away. 2 The kings who governed before the Drift were called the Rulers of heaven and earth ; those who came after were the Rulers of man . " Cheu Ching-huen says : ' The Rulers of man succeeded to the Rulers of heaven and the Rulers of earth in the government ; that then the atmosphere gradually cleared away , and all things sprang up together ; that the order of time was gradually settled , and the usages of society gradually became correct and respectful . " 3 And then we read that " the day and night had not yet been divided , " but , after a time , " day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we have the history of some event which changed 1 . " Compendium of Wong-shi-Shing 1526-1590 , " Crawford , pp. 4 , 5. 2 . Ibid. , p. 8. 3 . Ibid. 4 . Ibid. , p. 7. p. 212 the dynasties of the world : the heavenly kingdom was succeeded by a merely human one ; there were chaos , cold , and darkness , and death to vegetation ; then the light increases , and vegetation begins once more to germinate ; the atmosphere is thick ; the heavens rest on the earth ; day and night can not be distinguished from one another , and mankind dwell in caves , and live on raw meat and blood . Surely all this accords wonderfully with our theory . And here we have the same story in another form : " The philosopher of Oraibi tells us that when the people ascended by means of the magical tree , which constituted the ladder from the lower world to this , they found the firmament , the ceiling of this world , low down upon the earth  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the people climbed up , from the cave in which they were bidden , to the surface of the earth , the dense clouds rested on the face of the earth . " Machito , one of their gods , raised the firmament on his shoulders to where it is now seen . Still the world was dark , as there was no sun , no moon , and no stars . So the people murmured because of the darkness and the cold . Machito said , ' Bring me seven maidens ' ; and they brought him seven maidens ; and he said , ' Bring me seven baskets of cotton-bolls ' ; and they brought him seven baskets of cotton-bolls ; and he taught the seven maidens to weave a magical fabric from the cotton , and when they had finished it he held it aloft , and the breeze carried it away toward the firmament , and in the twinkling of an eye it was transformed into a beautiful and full-orbed moon ; and the same breeze caught the remnants of flocculent cotton , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft , and they were transformed into bright stars . But still it was cold ; and the people murmured again , and Machito said , ' Bring me seven buffalo-robes ' ; and they brought him seven buffalo-robes , and from the densely matted hair of the robes he wove another wonderful fabric , which the storm carried p. 213 away into the sky , and it was transformed into the full-orbed sun . Then Machito appointed times and seasons , and ways for the heavenly bodies ; and the gods of the firmament have obeyed the injunctions of Machito from the day of their creation to the present . " * Among the Thlinkeets of British Columbia there is a legend that the Great Crow or Raven , Yehl , was the creator of most things : " Very dark , damp , and chaotic was the world in the beginning ; nothing with breath or body moved there except Yehl ; in the likeness of a raven he brooded over the mist ; his black winds beat down the vast confusion ; the waters went back before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the earth  --  though how or when does not exactly appear  --  while the world was still in darkness , and without sun , moon , or stars . " 2 The legend proceeds at considerable length to tell the doings of Yehl . His uncle tried to slay him , and , when he failed , " he imprecated with a potent curse a deluge upon all the earth . . . . The flood came , the waters rose and rose ; but Yehl clothed himself in his bird-skin , and soared up to the heavens , where he stuck his beak into a cloud , and remained until the waters were assuaged . " 3 This tradition reminds us of the legend of the Thessalian Cerambos , " who escaped the flood by rising into the air on wings , given him by the nymphs . " I turn now to the traditions of the Miztecs , who dwelt on the outskirts of the Mexican Empire ; this legend was taken by Fray Gregoria Garcia4 from a book found in a convent in Cuilapa , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oajaca ; the book had been compiled by the vicar of the convent , " just as they 1 .

It will be observed they appeared before the light had returned , These gods built a temple on a high place , and laid out a garden , and waited patiently , offering sacrifices to the higher gods , wounding themselves with flint knives , and " praying that it might seem good to them to shape the firmament , and lighten the darkness of the world , and to establish the foundation of the earth ; or , rather , to gather the waters together so that the earth might appear  --  as they had no place to rest in save only one little garden . " Here we have the snakes and the people confounded together . The earth was afterward made fit for the use of mankind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deluge , wherein perished many of the sons and daughters that had been born to the gods ; and it is said that , when the deluge was passed , the human race p. 215 was restored , as at the first , and the Miztec kingdom populated , and the heavens and the earth established . " 1 Father Duran , in his MS . " History Antique of New Spain , " written in A. D. 1585 , gives the Cholula legend , which commences : " In the beginning , before the light of the sun had been created , this land was in obscurity and darkness and void of any created thing . " In the Toltec legends we read of a time when  --  " There was a tremendous hurricane that carried away trees , mounds , houses , and the largest edifices , notwithstanding which many men and women escaped , principally in caves , and places where the great hurricane could not reach them . A few days having passed , they set out to see what had become of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time they were in darkness , without seeing the light of the sun , nor the moon , that the wind had brought them . " 2 In the Aztec creation-myths , according to the accounts furnished by Mendieta , and derived from Fray Andres de Olmos , one of the earliest of the Christian missionaries among the Mexicans , we have the following legend of the " Return of the Sun " : " Now , there had been no sun in existence for many years ; so the gods being assembled in a place called Teotihuacan , six leagues from Mexico , and gathered at the time around a great fire , told their devotees that he of them who should first cast himself into that , fire should have the honor of being transformed into a sun . So , one of them , called Nanahuatzin . . . flung himself into the fire . Then the gods " ( the chiefs ? ) " began to peer through the gloom in all directions for the expected light , and to make bets as to what part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native Races , " vol. iii , pp. 71-73. 2 . " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 239. p. 216 first appear in . Some said ' Here , ' and some said ' There ' ; but when the sun rose they were all proved wrong , for not one of them had fixed upon the east . " In the long-continued darkness they had lost all knowledge of the cardinal points . The ancient landmarks , too , were changed . The " Popul Vuh , " the national book of the Quiches , tells us of four ages of the world . The man of the first age was made of clay ; he was " strengthless , inept , watery ; he could not move his head , his face looked but one way ; his sight was restricted , he could not look behind him , " that is , he had no knowledge of the past ; " he had been endowed with language , but he had no intelligence , so he was consumed in the water . " 1 Then followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their progeny ; they had intelligence , but no moral sense " ; " they forgot the Heart of Heaven . " They were destroyed by fire and pitch from heaven , accompanied by tremendous earthquakes , from which only a few escaped . Then followed a period when all was dark , save the white light " of the morning-star  --  sole light as yet of the primeval world "  --  probably a volcano . " Once more are the gods in council , in the darkness , in the night of a desolated universe . " Then the people prayed to God for light , evidently for the return of the sun : " ' Hail ! O Creator they cried , ' O Former ! Thou that hearest and understandest us ! abandon us not ! forsake us not ! O God , thou that art in heaven and on earth ; O Heart of Heaven I O Heart of Earth ! give us descendants , and a posterity as long as the light endure . ' " . . . In other words , let not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 46. p. 217 " It was thus they spake , living tranquilly , invoking the return of the light ; waiting the rising of the sun ; watching the star of the morning , precursor of the sun . But no sun came , and the four men and their descendants grew uneasy . ' We have no person to watch over us , ' they said ; ' nothing to guard our symbols ! ' Then they adopted gods of their own , and waited . They kindled fires , for the climate was colder ; then there fell great rains and hail-storms , and put out their fires . Several times they made fires , and several times the rains and storms extinguished them . Many other trials also they underwent in Tulan , famines and such things , and a general dampness and cold  --  for the earth was moist , there being yet no sun . " All this accords with what I have shown we might expect as accompanying the close of the so-called Glacial Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of the sun ; perpetual rains and storms fell ; the world was cold and damp , muddy and miserable ; the people were wanderers , despairing and hungry . They seem to have come from an eastern land . We are told : " Tulan was a much colder climate than the happy eastern land they had left . " Many generations seem to have grown up and perished under the sunless skies , " waiting for the return of the light " ; for the " Popul Vuh " tells us that " here also the language of all the families was confused , so that no one of the first four men could any longer understand the speech of the others . " That is to say , separation and isolation into rude tribes had made their tongues unintelligible to one another . This shows that many , many years  --  it may be centuries  --  must have elapsed before that vast volume of moisture , carried up by evaporation , was able to fall p. 218 back , in snow and rain to the land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket of the dark . " Starvation encountered the scattered fragments of mankind . And in these same Quiche legends of Central America we are told : " The persons of the godhead were enveloped in the darkness which enshrouded a desolated world . " 1 They counseled together , and created four men of white and yellow maize ( the white and yellow races ? ) . It was still dark ; for they had no light but the light of the morning-star . They came to Tulan . And the Abb ? Brasseur de Bourbourg gives further details of the Quiche legends : Now , behold our ancients and our fathers were made lords , and had their dawn . Behold we will relate also the rising of the sun , the moon , and the stars ! Great was their joy when they saw the morning-star , which came out first , with its resplendent face before the sun . At last the sun itself began to come forth ; the animals , small and great , were in joy ; they rose from the water-courses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads toward where the sun was coming . An innumerable crowd of people were there , and the dawn cast light on all these people at once . At last the face of the ground was dried by the sun : like a man the sun showed himself , and his presence warmed and dried the surface of the ground . Before the sun appeared , muddy and wet was the surface of the ground , and it was before the sun appeared , and then only the sun rose like a man . But his heat had no strength , and he did but show when he rose ; he only remained like " ( an image in ) " a mirror and it is not , indeed , the same sun that appears now , they say , in the stories . " 2 1 . " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 214. 2 . Tylor 's " Early History of Mankind , " p. 308. p. 219 How wonderfully does all this accord with what we have shown would follow from the earth 's contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud , the clay ; the sun is long absent ; at last he returns ; he dries the mud , but his face is still covered with the remnants of the great cloud-belt ; " his heat has no strength " ; he shows himself only in glimpses ; he shines through the fogs like an image in a mirror ; he is not like the great blazing orb we see now . But the sun , when it did appear in all its glory , must have been a terrible yet welcome sight to those who had not looked upon him for many years . We read in the legends of the Thlinkeets of British Columbia , after narrating that the world was once " dark , damp , and chaotic , " full of water , with no sun , moon , or stars , how these luminaries were restored . The great hero-god of the race , Yehl , got hold of three mysterious boxes , and , wrenching the lids off , let out the sun , moon , and stars . " When he set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in heaven , the people that saw it were at first afraid . Many hid themselves in the mountains , and in the forests , and even in the water , and were changed into the various kinds of animals that frequent these places . " 1 Says James Geikie : " Nor can we form any proper conception of how long a time was needed to bring about that other change of climate , under the influence of which , slowly and imperceptibly , this immense sheet of frost melted away from the lowlands and retired to the mountain recesses . We must allow that long ages elapsed before the warmth became such as to induce plants and animals to clothe and people the land . How vast a time , also , must have passed away ere the warmth reached its climax ! " 2 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 100. 2 . " The Great Ice Age , " p. 184. p. 220 And all this time the rain fell . There could be no return of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comet 's heat had been condensed into water , and falling on the earth had found its way back to the ocean ; and this process had to be repeated many times . It was the age of the great primeval rain . ### THE PRIMEVAL STORM . In the Andes , Humboldt tells us of a somewhat similar state of facts : " A thick mist during a particular season obscures the firmament for many months . Not a planet , not the most brilliant stars of the southern hemisphere  --  Canopus , the p. 221 Southern Cross , nor the feet of Centaur  --  are visible . It is frequently almost impossible to discover the position of the moon . If by chance the outlines of the sun 's disk be visible during the day , it appears devoid of rays . " Says Croll : " We have seen that the accumulation of snow and ice on the ground , resulting from the long and cold winters , tended to cool the air and produce fogs , which cut off the sun 's rays . " 1 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature by chilling the air and condensing the rays into thick fogs . The great strength of the sun 's rays during summer , due to his nearness at that season , would , in the first place , tend to produce an increased amount of evaporation . But the presence of snow-clad mountains and an icy sea would chill the atmosphere and condense the vapors into thick fogs . The thick fogs and cloudy sky would effectually prevent the sun 's rays from reaching the earth , and the snow , in consequence , would remain unmelted during the entire summer . In fact , we have this very condition of things exemplified in some of the islands of the Southern Ocean at the present day . Sandwich Land , which is in the same parallel of latitude as the north of Scotland , is covered with ice and snow the entire summer ; and in the Island of South Georgia , which is in the same parallel as the center of England , the perpetual snow descends to the very sea-beach . The following is Captain Cook 's description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary , ' he says , ' that an island between the latitudes of 54 ? and 55 ? should , in the very height of summer , be almost wholly covered with frozen snow , in some places many fathoms deep . . . . The head of the bay was terminated by ice-cliffs of considerable height , pieces of which were continually breaking off , which made a noise like cannon . Nor were the interior parts of the country less horrible . The savage rocks raised their lofty summits 1 . " Climate and Time , " p. 75. p. 222 till lost in the clouds , and valleys were covered with seemingly perpetual snow . Not a tree nor a shrub of any size was to be seen . ' " I return to the legends . The Gallinomeros of Central California also recollect the day of darkness and the return of the sun : " In the beginning they say there was no light , but a thick darkness covered all the earth . Man stumbled blindly against man and against the animals , the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Hawk happening by chance to fly into the face of the Coyote , there followed mutual apologies , and afterward a long discussion on the emergency of the situation . Determined to make some effort toward abating the public evil , the two set about a remedy . The Coyote gathered a great heap , of tules " ( rushes ) " rolled them into a ball , and gave it to the Hawk , together with some pieces of flint . Gathering all together as well as he could , the Hawk flew straight up into the sky , where he struck fire with the flints , lit his ball of reeds , and left it there whirling along all in a fierce red glow as it continues to the present ; for it is the sun . In the same way the moon was made , but as the tules of which it was constructed were rather damp , its light has always been somewhat uncertain and feeble . " 2 The Algonquins believed in a world , an earth , " anterior to this of ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake burst its bounds and submerged it wholly . " This reminds us of the Welsh legend , and the bursting of the lake Llion ( see page 135 , ante ) . The ancient world was united in believing in great cycles of time terminating in terrible catastrophes : 1 . Captain Cook 's " Second Voyage , " vol. ii , pp. 232-235 ; 2 . " Climate and Time , " Croll , pp. 60 , 61. 3 . Powers 's Pomo MS. , Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 86. p. 223 Hence arose the belief in Epochs of Nature , elaborated by ancient philosophers into the Cycles of the Stoics , the great Days of Brahm , long periods of time rounding off by sweeping destructions , the Cataclysms and Ekpyrauses of the universe . Some thought in these all things perished , others that a few survived . . . . For instance , Epietetus favors the opinion that at the solstices of the great year not only all human beings , but even the gods , are annihilated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macrobius , so far from agreeing with him , explains the great antiquity of Egyptian civilization by the hypothesis that that country is so happily situated between the pole and the equator , as to escape both the deluge and conflagration of the great cycle . " 2 In the Babylonian Genesis tablets we have the same references to the man or people who , after the great disaster , divided the heavens into constellations , and regulated , that is , discovered and revealed , their movements . In the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Legend3 we read : " 1 . It was delightful all that was fixed by the great gods . 2 . Stars , their appearance ( in figures ) of animals he arranged . 3 . To fix the year through the observation of their constellations , 4 . Twelve months or signs of stars in three rows he arranged , 5 . From the day when the year commences unto the close . 6 . He marked the positions of the wandering stars to shine in their courses , 7 . That they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That is to say , the civilized race that followed the great cataclysm , with whom the history of the event was 1 . Discourses , " book iii , chapter xiii . 2 . Brinton 's Myths of the New World , " p. 215. 3 . Proctor 's Pleasant Ways , " p. 393. p. 224 yet fresh , and who were impressed with all its horrors , and who knew well the tenure of danger and terror on which they held all the blessings of the world , turned their attention to the study of the heavenly bodies , and sought to understand the source of the calamity which had so recently overwhelmed the world . Hence they " marked , " as far as they were able , " the positions of the ' comets , ' " " that they might not " again " do injury , and not trouble any one . " The word here given is Nibir , which Mr. Smith says does not mean planets , and , in the above account , Nibir is contradistinguished from the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can only mean comets . And the tablet proceeds , with distinct references to the Age of Darkness : " 8 . The positions of the gods Bel and Hea he fixed with him , 9 . And he opened the great gates in the darkness shrouded . 10 . The fastenings were strong on the left and right . 11 . In its mass , ( i. e. , the lower chaos , ) he made a boiling . 12 . The god Uru ( the moon ) he caused to rise out , the night he overshadowed , 13 . To fix it also for the light of the night until the shining of the day . 14 . That the month might not be broken , and in its amount be regular , 15 . At the beginning of the month , at the rising of the night , 16 . His ( the sun 's ) horns are breaking through to shine on the heavens . 17 . On the seventh day to a circle he begins to swell , 18 . And stretches toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the in the horizon of heaven , in the east , 20 . . . . formed beautifully and . . . 21 . . . . to the orbit Shamas was perfected . " p. 225 Here the tablet becomes illegible . The meaning , however , seems plain : Although to left and right , to east and west , the darkness was fastened firm , was dense , yet " the great gods opened the great gates in the darkness , " and let the light through . First , the moon appeared , through a " boiling , " or breaking up of the clouds , so that now men were able to once more count time by the movements of the moon . On the seventh day , Shamas , the sun , appeared ; first , his horns , his beams , broke through the darkness imperfectly ; then he swells to a circle , and comes nearer and nearer to perfect dawn ; at last he appeared on the horizon , in the east , formed beautifully , and his orbit was perfected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the clearing heavens . But how did the human race fare in this miserable time ? In his magnificent poem " Darkness , " Byron has imagined such a blind and darkling world as these legends depict ; and he has imagined , too , the hunger , and the desolation , and the degradation of the time . We are not to despise the imagination . There never was yet a great thought that had not wings to it ; there never was yet a great mind that did not survey things from above the mountain-tops . If Bacon built the causeway over which modern science has advanced , it was because , mounting on the pinions of his magnificent imagination , he saw that poor struggling mankind needed such a pathway ; his heart embraced humanity even as his brain embraced the universe . The river which is a boundary to the rabbit , is but a landmark to the eagle . Let not the gnawers of the world , the rodentia , despise the winged creatures of the upper air . p. 226 Byron saw what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the world , and that which he prefigured the legends of mankind tell us actually came to pass , in the dark days that followed the Drift . He says : " Morn came , and went  --  and came , and brought no day , And men forgot their passions in the dread Of this their desolation , and all hearts Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light . . . . A fearful hope was all the world contained ; Forests were set on fire  --  but hour by hour They fell and faded ,  --  and the crackling trunks Extinguished with a crash ,  --  and all was black . The brows of men by the despairing light Wore an unearthly aspect , as by fits The flashes fell upon them ; some lay down And bid their eyes and wept ; and some did rest Their chins upon their clinch ? d hands and smiled ; And others hurried to and fro , and fed Their funeral piles with fuel , and looked up With mad disquietude on the dull sky , The pall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down upon the dust , And gnashed their teeth and howled . . . . And War , which for a moment was no more , Did glut himself again  --  a meal was bought With blood , and each sat sullenly apart , Gorging himself in gloom , . . . and the pang Of famine fed upon all entrails ;  --  men Died , and their bones were tombless as their flesh The meager by the meager were devoured , Even dogs assailed their masters . " How graphic , how dramatic , how realistic is this picture ! And how true ! For the legends show us that when , at last , the stones and clay had ceased to fall , and the fire had exhausted itself , and the remnant of mankind were able to dig their way out , to what an awful wreck of nature did they return . p . 227 Instead of the fair face of the world , as they had known it , bright with sunlight , green with the magnificent foliage of the forest , or the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted , an unknown land , covered with oceans of mud and stones ; the very face of the country changed  --  lakes , rivers , hills , all swept away and lost . They wander , breathing a foul and sickening atmosphere , under the shadow of an awful darkness , a darkness which knows no morning , no stars , no moon ; a darkness palpable and visible , lighted only by electrical discharges from the abyss of clouds , with such roars of thunder as we , in this day of harmonious nature , can form no conception of . It is , indeed , " chaos and ancient night . " All the forces of nature are there , but disorderly , destructive , battling against each other , and multiplied a thousand-fold in power ; the winds are cyclones , magnetism is gigantic , electricity is appalling . The world is more desolate than the caves from which they have escaped . The forests are gone ; the fruit-trees are swept away ; the beasts of the chase have perished ; the domestic animals , gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are buried deep in drifts of mud and gravel ; the people stagger in the darkness against each other ; they fall into the chasms of the earth ; within them are the two great oppressors of humanity , hunger and terror ; hunger that knows not where to turn ; fear that shrinks before the whirling blasts , the rolling thunder , the shocks of blinding lightning ; that knows not what moment the heavens may again open and rain fire and stones and dust upon them . God has withdrawn his face ; his children are deserted ; all the , kindly adjustments of generous Nature are gone . God has left man in the midst of a material world without law ; he is a wreck , a fragment , a lost particle , p. 228 in the midst of an illimitable and endless warfare of giants . Some lie down to die , hopeless , cursing their helpless gods ; some die by their own bands ; some gather around the fires of volcanoes for warmth and light  --  stars that attract them from afar off ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they may find projecting above the d ? bris , running to them , as we shall see , with outcries , and fighting over the fragments . The references to the worship of " the morning star , " which occur in the legend , seem to relate to some great volcano in the East , which alone gave light when all the world was lost in darkness . As Byron says , in his great poem , " Darkness " : And they did live by watch-fires  --  and the thrones , The palaces of crown ? d kings  --  the huts , The habitations of all things which dwell , Were burnt for beacons ; cities were consumed , And men were gathered round their blazing homes To look once more into each other 's face ; Happy were they who dwelt within the eye Of the volcanoes and their mountain-torch . " In this pitiable state were once the ancestors of all mankind . If you doubt it , reader , peruse again the foregoing legends , and then turn to the following Central American prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 186 , ante , addressed to the god Tezcatlipoca , himself represented as a flying or winged serpent , perchance the comet : " Is it possible that this lash and chastisement are not given for our correction and amendment , but only for our total destruction and overthrow ; that the sun will never more shine upon us , but that we must remain in perpetual darkness ? . . . It is a sore thing to tell how we are all in p. 229 darkness . . . . O Lord , . . . make an end of this smoke and fog . Quench also the burning and destroying fire of thine anger ; let serenity come and clearness , " ( light ) ; " let the small birds of thy people begin to sing and approach the sun . " There is still another Aztec prayer , addressed to the same deity , equally able , sublime , and pathetic , which it seems to me may have been uttered when the people had left their biding-place , when the conflagration had passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned , and while crops of grain as yet were not . There are a few words in it that do not answer to this interpretation , where it refers to those " people who have something " ; but there may have been comparative differences of condition even in the universal poverty ; or these words may have been an interpolation of later days . The prayer is as follows : " O our Lord , protector most strong and compassionate , invisible and impalpable , thou art the giver of life ; lord of all , and lord of battles . I present myself here before thee to say some few words concerning the need of the poor people of none estate or intelligence . When they lie down at night they have nothing , nor when they rise up in the morning ; the darkness and the light pass alike in great poverty . Know , O Lord , that thy subjects and servants suffer a sore poverty that can not be told of more than that it is a sore poverty and desolateness . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves with , but only certain rags rent in every part , that allow the air and the cold to pass everywhere . " With great toil and weariness they scrape together enough for each day , going by mountain and wilderness seeking their food ; so faint and enfeebled are they that their bowels cleave to their ribs , and all their body reechoes with hollowness , and they walk as people affrighted , the face and body in likeness of death . If they be merchants , they now sell only cakes of salt and broken p. 230 pepper ; the people that have something despise their wares , so that they go out to sell from door to door , and from house to house ; and when they sell nothing they sit down sadly by some fence or wall , or in some corner , licking their lips and gnawing the nails of their hands for the hunger that is in them ; they look on the one side and on the other at the mouths of those that pass by , hoping peradventure that one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bed on which they lie down is not a thing to rest upon , but to endure torment in ; they draw a rag over them at night , and so sleep ; there they throw down their bodies , and the bodies of children that thou hast given them . For the misery that they grow up in , for the filth of their food , for the lack of covering , their faces are yellow , and all their bodies of the color of earth . They tremble with cold , and for leaness they stagger in walking . They go weeping and sighing , and full of sadness , and all misfortunes are joined to them ; though they stay by afire , they find little heat . " 1 The prayer continues in the same strain , supplicating God to give the people " some days of prosperity and tranquillity , so that they may sleep and know repose " ; it concludes : " If thou answerest my petition it will be only of thy liberality and magnificence , for no one is worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only through thy grace . Search below the dung-hills and in the mountains for thy servants , friends , and acquaintance , and raise them to riches and dignities . " . . . " Where am I ? Lo , I speak with thee , O King ; well do I know that I stand in an eminent place , and that I talk with one of great majesty , before whose presence flows a river through a chasm , a gulf sheer down of awful depth ; this , also , is a slippery place , whence many precipitate themselves , for there shall not be found one without error before thy majesty . I myself , a man of little understanding and lacking speech , dare to address 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 204. p. 231 my words to thee ; I put myself in peril of falling into the gorge and cavern of this river .

" It is true that much of all this would apply to any great period of famine , but it appears that these events occurred when there was great cold in the country , when the people gathered around fires and could not get warm , a remarkable state of things in a country possessing as tropical a climate as Mexico . Moreover , these people were wanderers , " going by mountain and wilderness , " seeking food , a whole nation of poverty-stricken , homeless , wandering paupers . And when we recur to the part where the priest tells the Lord to seek his friends and servants in the mountains , " below the dung-hills , " and raise them to riches , it is difficult to understand it otherwise than as an allusion to those who had been buried under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor men do not dwell under dung-hills , nor are they usually buried under them , and it is very possible that in transmission from generation to generation the original meaning was lost sight of . I should understand it to mean , " Go , O Lord , and search and bring back to life and comfort and wealth the millions thou hast slaughtered on the mountains , covering them with hills of slime and refuse . " And when we turn to the traditions of the kindred and more ancient race , the Toltecs , 1 we find that , after the fall of the fire from heaven , the people , emerging from the 1 . " North Americans of Antiquity , " p. 240. p. 232 seven caves , wandered one hundred and four years , " suffering from nakedness , hunger , and cold , over many lands , across expanses of sea , and through untold hardships , " precisely as narrated in the foregoing pathetic prayer . It tells of the migration of a race , over the desolated world , during the Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very much like it , in the Book of Job . p. 233 CHAPTER IX . THE TRIUMPH OF THE SUN . A GREAT solar-myth underlies all the ancient mythologies . It commemorates the death and resurrection of the sun . It signifies the destruction of the light by the clouds , the darkness , and the eventual return of the great luminary of the world . The Syrian Adonis , the sun-god , the Hebrew Tamheur , and the Assyrian Du-Zu , all suffered a sudden and violent death , disappeared for a time from the sight of men , and were at last raised from the dead . The myth is the primeval form of the resurrection . All through the Gothic legends runs this thought  --  the battle of the Light with the Darkness ; the temporary death of the Light , and its final triumph over the grave . Sometimes we have but a fragment of the story . In the Saxon Beowulf we have Grendel , a terrible monster , who comes to the palace-hall at midnight , and drags out the sleepers and sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows in the darkness . Grendel is killed . But his fearful mother , the devil 's clam , comes to avenge his death ; she attacks Beowulf , and is slain. 1 There comes a third dragon , which Beowulf kills , but is stifled with the breath of the monster and dies , rejoicing , however , that the dragon has brought with him a great treasure of gold , which will make his people rich. 2 1 . Poor , " Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures , " p. 315. 2 . Ibid. p. 234 Here , again , are the three comets , the wolf , the snake , and the dog of Ragnarok ; the three arrows of the American legends ; the three monsters of Hesiod . When we turn to Egypt we find that their whole religion was constructed upon legends relating to the ages of fire and ice , and the victory of the sun-god over the evil-one . We find everywhere a recollection of the days of cloud , " when darkness dwelt upon the face of the deep . " Osiris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nocturnal or ruined condition , before the coming of day . M. Mariette-Bey says : " Originally , Osiris is the nocturnal sun ; he is the primordial night of chaos ; he is consequently anterior to Ra , the Sun of Day . " 1 Mr. Miller says : " As nocturnal sun , Osiris was also regarded as a type of the sun before its first rising , or of the primordial night of chaos , and as such , according to M. Mariette , his first rising  --  his original birth to the light under the form of Ra  --  symbolized the birth of humanity itself in the person of the first man . " 2 M. F. Chabas says : " These forms represented the same god at different hours of the day . . . . the nocturnal sun and the daily sun , which , succeeding to the first , dissipated the darkness on the morning of each day , and renewed the triumph of Horus over Set ; that is to say , the cosmical victory which determined the first rising of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time .

Miller , " Solar Symbolism , " " American Antiquarian , " April , 1881 , p. 219. p. 235 to a primordial form , Osiris , the nocturnal sun , or better , the sun before its first rising . " 1 " The suffering and death of Osiris , " says Sir G. Wilkinson , " were the great mystery of the Egyptian religion , and some traces of it are perceptible among other people of antiquity . His being the divine goodness , and the abstract idea of good ; his manifestation upon earth , his death and resurrection , and his office as judge of the dead in a future state , look like the early revelation of a future manifestation of the Deity , converted into a mythological fable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seb , or Typho , or Typhon , and was killed in the battle ; he was subsequently restored to life , and became the judge of the under-world. 3 Seb , his destroyer , was a son of Ra , the ancient sun-god , in the sense , perhaps , that the comets , and all other planetary bodies , were originally thrown out from the mass of the sun . Seb , or Typho , was " the personification of all evil . " He was the destroyer , the enemy , the evil-one . Isis , the consort of Osiris , learns of his death , slain by the great serpent , and ransacks the world in search of his body . She finds it mutilated by Typhon . This is the same mutilation which we find elsewhere , and which covered the earth with fragments of the sun . Isis was the wife of Osiris ( the dead sun ) and the mother of Horus , the new or returned sun ; she seems to represent a civilized people ; she taught the art of cultivating wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processions . When we turn to the Greek legends , we shall find 1 . " Revue Arch ? ologique , " tome xxv , 1873 , p. 393. 2 . Notes to Rawlinson 's " Herodotus , " American edition , vol. ii , p.:219. 3 . Murray 's " Mythology , " p. 347. p. 236 Typhon described in a manner that clearly identifies him with the destroying comet . ( See page 140 , ante . ) The entire religion of the Egyptians was based upon a solar-myth , and referred to the great catastrophe in the history of the earth when the sun was for a time obscured in dense clouds . Speaking of the legend of " the dying sun-god , " Rev. O. D. Miller says : " The wide prevalence of this legend , and its extreme antiquity , are facts familiar to all Orientalists . There was the Egyptian Osiris , the Syrian Adonis , the Hebrew Tamheur , the Assyrian Du-Zu , all regarded as solar deities , vet as having lived a mortal life , suffered a violent death , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How was it possible to conceive the solar orb as dying and rising from the dead , if it had not already been taken for a mortal being , as a type of mortal man ? . . . We repeat the proposition : it was impossible to conceive the sun as dying and descending into hades until it had been assumed as a type and representative of man . . . . The reign of Osiris in Egypt , his war with Typhon , his death and resurrection , were events appertaining to the divine dynasties . We can only say , then , that the origin of these symbolical ideas was extremely ancient , without attempting to fix its chronology . " But when , we realize the fact that these ancient religions were built upon the memory of an event which had really happened  --  an event of awful significance to the human race  --  the difficulty which perplexed Mr. Miller and other scholars disappears . The sun had , apparently , been slain by an evil thing ; for a long period it returned not , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , it arose from the dead , and came in glory to rule mankind . And these events , as I have shown , are perpetuated in the sun-worship which still exists in the world in many p. 237 forms . Even the Christian peasant of Europe still lifts his hat to the rising sun . The religion of the Hindoos was also based on the same great cosmical event . Indra was the great god , the sun . He has a long and dreadful contest with Vritra , " the throttling snake . " Indra is " the cloud-compeller " ; he " shatters the cloud with his bolt and releases the imprisoned waters " ; 1 that is to say , he slays the snake Vritra , the comet , and thereafter the rain pours down and extinguishes the flames which consume the world . " He goes in search of the cattle , the clouds , which the evil powers have driven away . " 2 That is to say , as the great heat disappears , the moisture condenses and the clouds form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the blazing heavens to intercept the terrible heat . " He who fixed firm the moving earth ; who tranquillized the incensed mountains ; who spread the spacious firmament ; who consolidated the heavens  --  he , men , is Indra . " He who having destroyed Ahi ( Vritra , Typhon , ) set free the seven rivers , who , recovered the cows , ( the clouds , ) detained by Bal ; who generated fire in the clouds ; who is invincible in battle  --  he , men , is Indra . " In the first part of the " Vendidad , " first chapter , the author gives an account of the beautiful land , the Aryana Vaejo , which was a land of delights , created by Ahura Mazda ( Ormaz ) . Then " an evil being , Angra-Manyus , ( Ahriman , ) pill of death , created a mighty serpent , and winter , the work of the Devas . " " Ten months of winter are there , and two months of summer . " 1 . Murray 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then follows this statement : " Seven months of summer are there ; five months of winter were there . The latter are cold as to water , cold as to earth , cold as to trees . There is the heart of winter ; then all around falls deep snow . There is the worst of evils . " This signifies that once the people dwelled in a fair and pleasant land . The evil-one sent a mighty serpent ; the serpent brought a great winter ; there were but two months of summer ; gradually this ameliorated , until the winter was five months long and the summer seven months long . The climate is still severe , cold and wet ; deep snows fell everywhere . It is an evil time . The demonology of the Hindoos turns on the battles between the Asuras , the irrational demons of the air , the comets , and the gods : " They dwell beneath the three-pronged root of the world-mountain , occupying the nadir , while their great enemy Indra , " ( the sun ; ) " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , in the zenith . The Meru , which stands between the earth and the heavens , around which the heavenly bodies revolve , is the battlefield of the Asuras and the Devas. " 1 That is to say , the land Meru  --  the same as the island Mero of the ancient Egyptians , from which Egypt was first colonized ; the Merou of the Greeks , on which the Meropes , the first men , dwelt  --  was the scene where this battle between the fiends of the air on one side , and the heavenly bodies and earth on the other , was fought . The Asuras are painted as " gigantic opponents of the gods , terrible ogres , with bloody tongues and long tusks , eager to devour human flesh and blood . " 2 And we find the same thoughts underlying the myths 1 . " American Cyclop ? dia , " vol. v , p. 793. 2 . Ibid. p. 239 of nations the most remote from these great peoples of antiquity . The Esquimaux of Greenland have this myth : " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' There shall be night and there shall be day , and men shall die , one after another . ' But the second said , ' There shall be no day , but only night all the time , and men shall live for ever . ' They had a long struggle , but here once more he who loved darkness rather than light was worsted , and the day triumphed . " Here we have the same great battle between Light and Darkness . The Darkness proposes to be perpetual ; it says , " There shall be no more day . " After a long struggle the Light triumphed , the sun returned , and the earth was saved . Among the Tupis of Brazil we have the same story of the battle of light and darkness . They have a myth of Timandonar and Ariconte : " They were brothers , one of fair complexion , the other dark . They were constantly struggling , and Ariconte , which means the stormy or cloudy day , came out worst . " Again the myth reappears ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , ( Baal ? ) is slain by the god Hodur , the blind one ; to wit , the Darkness . But Vali , Odin 's son , slew Hodur , the Darkness , and avenged Balder . Vali is the son of Rind  --  the rind  --  the frozen earth . That is to say , Darkness devours the sun ; frost rules the earth ; Vali , the new sun , is born of the frost , and kills the Darkness . It is light again . Balder returns after Ragnarok . And Nana , Balder 's wife , the lovely spring-time , died of grief during Balder 's absence . 1 . Brinton 's " Myths of the New World , " p. 200. p. 240 We have seen that one of the great events of the Egyptian mythology was the search made by Isis , the wife of Osiris , for the dead sun-god in the dark nether world . In the same way , the search for the dead Balder was an important part of the Norse myths . Hermod , mounted on Odin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice ? ) set out to find Balder . He rode nine days and nine nights through deep valleys , so dark that he could see nothing ; 1 at last he reaches the barred gates of Hel 's ( death 's ) dominions . There he found Balder , seated on a throne : he told Hel that all things in the world were grieving for the absence of Balder , the sun . At last , after some delays and obstructions , Balder returns , and the whole world rejoices . And what more is needed to prove the original unity of the human race , and the vast antiquity of these legends , than the fact that we find the same story , and almost the same names , occurring among the white-haired races of Arctic Europe , and the dark-skinned people of Egypt , Ph&oelig;nicia , and India . The demon Set , or Seb , of one , comes to us as the Surt of another ; the Baal of one is the Balder of another ; Isis finds Osiris ruling the underworld as Hermod found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The celebration of the May-day , with its ceremonies , the May-pole , its May-queen , etc. , is a survival of the primeval thanksgiving with which afflicted mankind welcomed the return of the sun from his long sleep of death . In Norway , 2 during the middle ages , the whole scene was represented in these May-day festivals : One man represents summer , he is clad in green leaves the other represents winter ; he is clad in straw , fit picture of the 1 . " Nome Mythology , " p. 288. 2 . Ibid. , p. 291. p. 241 misery of the Drift Age . They have each a large company of attendants armed with staves ; they fight with each other until winter ( the age of darkness and cold ) is subdued . They pretend to pluck his eyes out and throw him in the water . Winter is slain . Here we have the victory of Osiris over Seb ; of Adonis over Typhon , of Balder over Hodur , of Indra over Vritra , of Timandonar over Ariconte , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , in England , the rejoicing over the great event survived . Says Horatio Smith : " It was the custom , both here and in Italy , for the youth of both sexes to proceed before daybreak to some neighboring wood , accompanied with music and horns , about sunrise to deck their doors and windows with garlands , and to spend the afternoon dancing around the May-pole . " Stow tells us , in his " Survey of London " : " Every man would walk into the sweet meddowes and green woods , there to rejoice their spirits with the beauty and savour of sweet flowers , and with the harmony of birds praising God in their kindes. " 2 Stubbs , a Puritan of Queen Elizabeth 's days , describing the May-day feasts , says : " And then they fall to banquet and feast , to leape and dance about it , " ( the May-pole ) , " as the heathen people did at the dedication of their idolles , whereof this is a perfect picture , or rather the thing itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1550 A. D. , and for years afterward , were celebrating the end of the Drift Age , the disappearance of the darkness and the victory of the sun . 1 . " Festivals , Games , " etc. , p. 126. 2 . Ibid. , p. 127. 3 . Ibid. p. 242 The myth of Hercules recovering his cows from Cacus is the same story told in another form : A strange monster , Cacus , ( the comet , ) stole the cows of Hercules , ( the clouds , ) and dragged them backward by their tails into a cave , and vomited smoke and flame when Hercules attacked him . But Hercules killed Cacus with his unerring arrows , and released the cows . This signifies that the comet , breathing fire and smoke , so rarefied the air that the clouds disappeared and there followed an age of awful heat . Hercules smites the monster with his lightnings , and electrical phenomena on a vast scale accompany the recondensation of the moisture and the return of the clouds . " Cacus is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greek , and the worm Fafnir in Norse. " 1 The cows everywhere are the clouds ; they are white and soft ; they move in herds across the fields of heaven ; they give down their milk in grateful rains and showers to refresh the thirsty earth . We find the same event narrated in the folk-lore of the modern European nations . Says the Russian fairy-tale : " Once there was an old couple who had three sons . " Here we are reminded of Shem , Ham , and Japheth ; of Zeus , Pluto , and Neptune ; of Brahma , Vishnu , and Siva ; of the three-pronged trident of Poseidon ; of the three roots of the tree Ygdrasil . " Two of them , " continues the legend , " had their wits about them , but the third , Ivan , was a simpleton . " Now , in the lands in which Ivan lived there was never any day , but always night . This was a snake 's doings . Well , Ivan undertook to kill the snake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 236. p. 243 This is the same old serpent , the dragon , the apostate , the leviathan . " Then came a third snake with twelve heads . Ivan killed it , and destroyed the heads , and immediately there was a bright light throughout the whole land . " 1 Here we have the same series of monsters found in Hesiod , in Ragnarok , and in the legends of different nations ; and the killing of the third serpent is followed by a bright light throughout the whole land  --  the conflagration . And the Russians have the legend in another form . They tell of Ilia , the peasant , the servant of Vladimir , Fair Sun . He meets the brigand Solove ? , a monster , a gigantic bird , called the nightingale ; his claws extend for seven versts over the country . Like the dragon of Hesiod , he was full of sounds  --  " he roared like a wild beast , bowled like a dog , and whistled like a nightingale . " Ilia bits him with an arrow in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the earth . The wife of the monster follows Ilia , who has attached him to his saddle , and is dragging him away ; she offers cupfuls of gold , silver , and pearls  --  an allusion probably to the precious metals and stones which were said to have fallen from the heavens . The Sun ( Vladimir ) welcomes Ilia , and requests the monster to howl , roar , and whistle for his entertainment ; he contemptuously refuses ; Ilia then commands him and he obeys : the noise is so terrible that the roof of the palace falls off , and the courtiers drop dead with fear . Ilia , indignant at such an uproar , " cuts up the monster into little pieces , which he scatters over the fields "  --  ( the Drift ) . 2 Subsequently Ilia hides away in a cave , unfed by 1 . Poor , " Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures , " p. 390. 2 . Ibid. , p. .281. p. 244 Vladimir  --  that is to say , without the light of the sun . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him starved to death ; but the king 's daughter has sent him food every day for three years , and he comes out of the cave hale and hearty , and ready to fight again for Vladimir , the Fair Sun. 1 These three years are the three years of the " Fimbul-winter " of the Norse legends . I have already quoted ( see chapter viii , Part Ill , page 216 , ante ) the legends of the Central American race , the Quiches , preserved in the " Popul Vuh , " their sacred book , in which they describe the Age of Darkness and cold . I quote again , from the same work , a graphic and wonderful picture of the return of the sun " They determined to leave Tulan , and the greater part of them , under the guardianship and direction of Tohil , set out to see where they would take up their abode . They continued on their way amid the most extreme hardships for the want of food ; sustaining themselves at one time upon the mere smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in verity and truth they ate nothing . Their heart , indeed , it is again and again said , was almost broken by affliction . Poor wanderers ! they had a cruel way to go , many forests to pierce , many stern mountains to overpass , and a long passage to make through the sea , along the shingle and pebbles and drifted sand  --  the sea being , however , parted for their passage . At last they came to a mountain , that they named Hacavitz , after one of their gods , and here they rested  --  for here they were by some means given to understand that they should see the sun . Then , indeed , was filled with an exceeding joy the heart of Balam-Quitz ? , of Balam-Agab of Mahucutah , and of Iqui-Balam . It seemed to them that even the face of the morning star caught a new and more resplendent brightness . " They shook their incense-pans and danced for very gladness : sweet were their tears in dancing , very hot 1 . Poor , " Sanskrit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incense  --  their precious incense . At last the sun commenced to advance ; the animals small and great were full of delight ; they raised themselves to the surface of the water ; they fluttered in the ravines ; they gathered at the edge of the mountains , turning their beads together toward that part from which the sun came . And the lion and the tiger roared . And the first bird that sang was that called the Queletzu . All the animals were beside themselves at the sight ; the eagle and the kite beat their wings , and every bird both great and small . The men prostrated themselves on the ground , for their hearts were full to the brim . " 1 How graphic is all this picture ! How life-like ! Here we have the starving and wandering nations , as described in the preceding chapter , moving in the continual twilight ; at last the clouds grow brighter , the sun appears : all nature rejoices in the unwonted sight , and mankind fling themselves upon their faces like " the rude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedient breast , " at the first coming of the glorious day . But the clouds still are mighty ; rains and storms and fogs battle with the warmth and light . The " Popul Vuh " continues : " And the sun and the moon and the stars were now all established " ; that is , they now become visible , moving in their orbits . " Yet was not the sun then in the beginning the same as now ; his heat wanted force , and he was but as a reflection in a mirror ; verily , say the historians , not at all the same sun as that of to-day . Nevertheless , he dried up and warmed the surface of the earth , and answered many good ends . " Could all this have been invented ? This people could not themselves have explained the meaning of their myth , and yet it dove-tails into every fact revealed by our latest science as to the Drift Age . 1 . Bancroft 's " Native Races , " vol. iii , p. 46. p. 246 And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun petrified their gods : in other words , the worship of lions , tigers , and snakes , represented by stone idols , gave way before the worship of the great luminary whose steadily increasing beams were filling the world with joy and light . And then the people sang a hymn , " the song called ' Kamucu , ' " one of the oldest of human compositions , in memory of the millions who had perished in the mighty cataclysm : " We see ; " they sang , " alas , we ruined ourselves in Tulan ; there lost we many of our kith and kin ; they still remain there ! left behind ! We , indeed , have seen the sun , but they  --  now that his golden light begins to appear , where are they ? " That is to say , we rejoice , but the mighty dead will never rejoice more . And shortly after Balam-Quitz ? , Balam-Agab , Mahucutah , and Iqui-Balam , the hero-leaders of the race , died and were buried . This battle between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a contest between light and darkness ; and , by a natural transition , this became in time the unending struggle between the forces of good and the powers of evil  --  between God and Satan ; and the imagery associated with it has ,  --  strange to say ,  --  continued down into our own literature . That great scholar and mighty poet , John Milton , had the legends of the Greeks and Romans and the unwritten traditions of all peoples in his mind , when he described , in the sixth book of " Paradise Lost , " the tremendous conflict between the angels of God and the followers of the Fallen One , the Apostate , the great serpent , the dragon , Lucifer , the bright-shining , the star of the morning , coming , like the comet , from the north . p. 247 Milton did not intend such a comparison ; but he could not tell the story without his over-full mind recurring to the imagery of the past . Hence we read the following description of the comet ; of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven . " Milton tells us that when God 's troops went forth to the battle  --  " At last , Far in the horizon , to the north , appeared From skirt to skirt , a fiery region stretched , In battailous aspect , and nearer view Bristled with upright beams innumerable Of rigid spears , and helmets thronged and shields Various , with boastful arguments portrayed , The banded powers of Satan , hasting on With furious expedition . . . . High in the midst , exalted as a god , The apostate , in his sun-bright chariot , sat , Idol of majesty divine , inclosed With flaming cherubim and golden shields . " The comet represents the uprising of a rebellious power against the supreme and orderly dominion of God . The angel Abdiel says to Satan : " Fool ! not to think how vain Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ; Who out of smallest things could without end Have raised incessant armies to defeat Thy folly ; or , with solitary hand , Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legions under darkness . " The battle begins : " Now storming fury rose , And clamor such as heard in heav'n till now Was never ; arms on armor clashing brayed p. 248 Horrible discord , and the madding wheels Of brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise Of conflict ; overhead the dismal hiss Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew , And , flying , vaulted either host with fire . . . . Army ' gainst army , numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring and disturb Though not destroy , their happy native seat . . . . Sometimes on firm ground A standing fight , then soaring on main wing Tormented all the air , all air seemed then Conflicting fire . " Michael , the archangel , denounces Satan as an unknown being a stranger : " Author of evil , unknown till thy revolt , Unnamed in heaven . . . how hast thou disturbed Heav'n 's blessed peace , and into nature brought Misery , uncreated till the crime Of thy rebellion ! . . . But think not here To trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confines : heav'n , the seat of bliss , Brooks not the works of violence and war . Hence then , and evil go with thee along , Thy offspring , to the place of evil , bell , Thou and thy wicked crew ! " But the comet ( Satan ) replies that it desires liberty to go where it pleases ; it refuses to submit its destructive and erratic course to the domination of the Supreme Good ; it proposes  --  " Here , however , to dwell free If not to reign . " The result , of the first day 's struggle is a drawn battle . The evil angels meet in a night conference , and prepare gunpowder and cannon , with which to overthrow God 's armies ! " Hollow engines , long and round , Thick rammed , at th ' other bore with touch of fire p. 249 Dilated and infuriate , shall send forth From far , with thund'ring noise , among our foes Such implements of mischief , as shall dash To pieces , and overwhelm whatever stands Adverse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fire their cannon : " For sudden all at once their reeds Put forth , and to a narrow vent applied With nicest touch . Immediate in a flame , But soon obscured with clouds , all heav'n appeared , From these deep-throated engines belched , whose roar Emboweled with outrageous noise the air , And all her entrails tore , disgorging foul Their devilish glut , chained thunder-bolts and hail Of iron globes . " The angels of God were at first overwhelmed by this shower of missiles and cast down ; but they soon rallied : " From their foundations , loos'ning to and fro , They plucked the seated hills , with all their load , Rocks , waters , woods , and by their shaggy tops Uplifted bore them in their hands . " The rebels seized the hills also : So hills amid the air encountered hills , Hurled to and fro with jaculation. dire . . . . . And now all heaven Had gone to wrack , with ruin overspread , " had not the Almighty sent out his Son , the Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are overthrown , overwhelmed , driven to the edge of heaven : " The monstrous sight Struck them with horror backward , but far worse Urged them behind ; headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of heav'n ; eternal wrath Burnt after them to the bottomless pit . . . . p. 250 Nine days they fell : confounded Chaos roared And felt tenfold confusion in their fall Through his wide anarchy , so huge a rout Encumbered him with ruin . " Thus down into our own times and literature has penetrated a vivid picture of this world-old battle . We see , as in the legends , the temporary triumph of the dragon ; we see the imperiled sun obscured ; we see the flying rocks filling the appalled air and covering all things with ruin ; we see the dragon at last slain , and falling clown to hell and chaos ; while the sun returns , and God and order reign once more supreme . And thus , again , Milton paints the chaos that precedes restoration : On heav'nly ground they stood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Outrageous as a sea , dark , wasteful , wild , Up from the bottom , turned by furious winds And surging waves , as mountains to assault Heav'n 's height , and with the center mix the poles . " But order , peace , love , and goodness follow this dark , wild age of cold and wet and chaos :  --  the Night is slain , and the sun of God 's mercy shines once more on its appointed track in the heavens . But never again , they feel , shall the world go back to the completely glorious conditions of the Tertiary Age , the golden age of the Eden-land . The comet has " brought death into the world , and all our woe . " Mankind has sustained its great , its irreparable " Fall . " This is the event that lies , with mighty meanings , at the base of all our theologies. p. 251 CHAPTER X. THE FALL OF THE CLAY AND GRAVEL . I TRUST that the reader , who has followed me thus far in this argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the earth , in some remote age  --  before the Polynesians , Red-men , Europeans , and Asiatics had separated , or been developed as varieties out of one family  --  met with a tremendous catastrophe ; that a conflagration raged over parts of its surface ; that mankind took refuge in the caves of the earth , whence they afterward emerged to wander for a long time , in great poverty and hardships , during a period of darkness ; and that finally this darkness dispersed , and the sun shone again in the heavens . I do not see how the reader can avoid these conclusions . There are but two alternatives before him : he must either suppose that all this concatenation of legends is the outgrowth of a prodigious primeval lie , or he must concede that it describes some event which really happened . To adopt the theory of a great race-lie , originating at the beginning of human history , is difficult , inasmuch as these legends do not tell the same story in anything like the same way , as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instance from the same mind . While we have the conflagration in some of the legends , it has p. 252 been dropped out of others ; in one it is caused by the sun ; in another by the demon ; in another by the moon ; in one Pha ? ton produced it by driving the sun out of its course ; while there are a whole body of legends in which it is the result of catching the sun in a noose . So with the stories of the cave-life . In some , men seek the caves to escape the conflagration ; in others , their race began in the caves . In like manner the age of darkness is in some cases produced by the clouds ; in others by the death of the sun . Again , in tropical regions the myth turns upon a period of terrible heat when there were neither clouds nor rain ; when some demon had stolen the clouds or dragged them into his cave : while in more northern regions the horrible age of ice and cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of mankind . In some of the myths the comet is a god ; in others a demon ; in others a serpent ; in others a feathered serpent ; in others a dragon ; in others a giant ; in others a bird in others a wolf ; in others a dog ; in still others a boar .
