txt Half-way between Mentor and Willoughby , as the express train rushes along , the passengers catch a glimpse of gen . Garfield 's home . Near a clump of bare trees a sharply pitched and reddish roof is seen , now half covered with snow . A barn Ind one or two smaller roofs are come into view , and before the attention has subsided , the place is left away in the rear . Mentor station is small and commonplace . There is a ssood-pile , a water-tank , and a side-track that is little used in the way of Mentor freight , a small depot , and a smaller hotel . The snow today was two inches deep and the slush of anknown depth uuder that . No livery sign offers an invitation , and the voice of no hackman suggests a relief . It is a mile and a half to Gen. Garfield 's , and the outlook is not promising . A half-grown boy , whose specialty afterward turns out to bohorses , and whose chief detestation seems to be politics , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the General 's  --  he has some one on every train  --  so his bony nag " that used to lick everything hereabout in the way of running , " is brought into requisition , and the transportation problem is solved . A ? colored gentleman , with a cane , who has come down on the train , is overtaken and passed . " He wants a pension , " says the boy , who has made politicians a study . Two white men are passed a little further on . " Post Offices , " says the youth laconically . When asked how he had become possessed of so much Imowledge , the boy answered : " Oh , I worked five weeks for Garfield this Summer , and we saw lots of all kinds of ' em , but I tell you they did n't get many promises out of us . " " Lawnfield " is the fancy name that some writer has applied to Gen. Garfield 's farm home , although the Garfield family has rather ignored this appellation . The building is modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad veranda and its open hall and stairs . The surroundings are all of the farm , except the little office just back of the house and in the edge of that orchard so often invaded during the Summer past . ' A wheat field Lies across the road , a garden to the left of the house , a few tall locusts near the door , and an open gate through which the youth drives with a familiarity that suggests entire acquaintance backed up by young American self-confidence . Mrs. Garfield herself opens the door . " Will you walk in ? " A letter of introduction to Gen. Garfield is offered , but just then the General , on his way down stairs to dinner , takes the letter , looks at the direction , and then says heartily . " Glad to see you . Have you been to dinner ' ? " Happy in being able to say , " Yes , Sir , " without a falsehood , the visitor is seated , while the General leads his guests , two or three ladies and gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-room , and is so busy telling some little anecdote to a friend that he has to be called once or twice before he will take his place at the table . By this time the two gentlemen who were suspected of Post Offices have arrived , and turn out to be two warm personal friends of the General , who have come over from Mahoning County for a little quiet talk . The visitors all t in the open hall , about a new base-burner , and study architecture , pictures , and country life , while the General and his guests are at dinner . The building is neatly and plainly finished in a yellow wood , maple or pine , stained like maple . In one corner of the room is an ancient family clock , reaching from the floor to near the ceiling . Everything was warm and comfortable , and the " make-yourself-at-home " air all about , seemed almost sufficient to make even an office-hunter believe that he was welcome . Dinner over , the General entered , welcomed his old Youngstown constituents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two of those present had been with Garfield at Hiram School , and thither the conversation turned . It would be hard to fmd a group of Garfield 's friends in which there was not a little Hiram leaven . Said a prominent Cleveland gentleman once to the writer , " That college has been of great aid to Garfield . It is a close corporation in one sense , and when a youth is made a member of it his loyalty to every other member becomes a marked thing . As Iowa and KArtsuA , especially , are settled from Ohio , and as every town of any size in the West has Ohioans among her adopted citizens , Garfield , naturally , had a strong brigade of defenders all over the West , many of whom had either been his class-mates or pupils . Every one of them spoke up for him like a man , and silenced more than one slander that might otherwise have hurt him . " Any one who visits Gen. Garfield these days goes as a friendly caller , or goes not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation that occurs before his parlor or study fire is informal and universally respected as private . He has a keen sense of the responsibilities of us position , and also the good sense to " be a very good listener now , " to use his own expressdon , and yet not to say much . He has no hesitancy in speaking of the Chinese letter , and denounces it as an infamous transaction , deserving the most extreme punishment . He Zan joke about it now , and on seeing a Cleveland acquaintance in a buggy ready for home , he shouted good-naturedly , " Hello ! any more Chinese letters floating about Cleveland now ? " Of Cabinets and Senatorships and appointments , he might as well be in a deaf and dumb asylum , for he will say nothing . The General is a hearty man in a running conversation , and overflows with anecdote and good humor . He sees the lights as well as the shadows in events passing before the vision , and although too healthy in body and mind to grow morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness , and bring a judicial fairness to their settlement . The conclusion that one arrives at after hearing him talk is that he means to give the country a safe and careful Government , with the idea still forever in mind that the watchword of this country is " progress , " and that there is nothing so enervating as a stand-still . Some people In whom hot-headedness is a synonym for valor have accused Gen. Garfield of cowardice of a moral sort , but the next four years will prove that he can do brave things and yet be careful of the interests of his party and his country . His political ideas are stalwart , and he believes in his party with the hearty faith that is a characteristic of the constituency that sent him to Congress again and again . ' Yet he is open-eyed to the rights of minorities and the reasonable claims of opponents , and has never made a charge against the Democratic Party that he did not thoroughly believe to be true . A visit to his cozy office at the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congressional Globes at the right to the newspaper slips cut out and classified today by one of his Secretaries . His mail comes in large quantities , sometimes , letters and papers , making near a bushel a day . About onethird of the letters receive the General 's personal attention , and the others , after being attended to by his secretaries , are indexed and filed away . After an hour 's call the visitor bids the General adieu , and leaves him to the tender mercies of other callers who are propelled forward by ambition , newspaper enterprise , curiosity , or other motives . The large field opened by this latter classification is best illustrated by the colored gentleman above referred to . On returning he was found seated in the depot , close to the roaring stove , his cane against his knee , and a large coat thrown over his lap . With the voluble confidence of his class when encouraged to talk , he said that lie had been to Gen. Garfield 's to secure his aid in obtaining a pension . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be said that the General had treated him kindly , and , although making no promise , seemed interested in his story and took his name . " I told him I had borrowed money to WM down on . and with that he put his band in his pocket andgave me a dollar . I then said that though I 'd like to have that pension , I was like the colored preacher who said that , although he cared most for money , he was not above an old coat or pair of boots . With that , " concluded the smiling narrator , " he sent a young man in the house and got me this coat . " A prominent Republican of Cleveland asserts that all the stories now afloat about abargain between Gen. Garfield and Senator Conkhng and others are sensational and without foundation . Said he : " I was one of the party that went on that special train from Warren to Mentor , and I know that there was no private conference among Grant , Conkling , Garfield , and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference , and the story lately published that Conkling drew up a paper which Garfield then and there signed is bosh . " It is the general opinion here , where there are so many men near Gen. Garfield , that the President-elect has taken no position on the Ohio Senatorial question , and will take none . That he is a warm personal friend of Gov . Foster is a matter of knowledge to everybody , but it does not follow that he will exert an influence in behalf of that friend , and from present appearances it does not look as though Foster would need any help .
