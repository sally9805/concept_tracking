ONE of the most important subjects to be dealt with by the Forty-eighth Congress is that relating to the navy . At no time in our history has the public manifested mom interest in its condition . This is significant of a feeling of insecurity in our foreign relations which is not without reason . The object of this article is to prove : First . That an efficient naval force is essential to the welfare of the United States . &amp;cond . That the vessels now on our navy list are useless for any operations of modern naval warfare . Third . That our system of naval administration , and not Congress , is to blame for this . Fourth . That an efficient naval force may be created at a comparatively small outlay , and greatly to the advantage of our carrying trade . Ireland verges on revolution . The agitation is actively sustained by Irish-American citizens , who seek a rupture of friendly relations between the United States and England as the only means of freeing Ireland from British domination . Money , munitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in the event of an outbreak in Ireland . The Government would be powerless to prevent it . The Irish element is strong enough and aggressive enough to restrain us from interfering with its plans , however willing we might be to act in good faith toward England . This must be evident to all who have watched the course of our public men whenever the Irish question is touched upon , either in or out of Congress . England has purchased her right to demand from our Government the strictest neutrality whenever she is involved in war or has to deal with revolution . Without an efficient navy to enforce neutrality , war // between Great Britain and the United States would be difficult to avert in the event of an outbreak in Ireland . Our relations with Spain are liable at any moment to become strained by reason of another outbreak of her Cnban subjects . The revolution was smothered , not extinguished ; it will remain smoldering as long as the Spaniards continue to rule with reason , but it will burst forth with violence when least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coming revolution in Cuba will be in behalf of freedom , not only political but individual . In such a contest the force of public opinion in the United States will be irresistible . The cry of individual freedom for all men is one that would be heard and echoed by ali classes in this country whenever raised . Diplomacy , however astute and far-sighted , can not restrain the active sympathy of a free and powerful people for the enslaved and oppressed , and this sympathy becomes intensified and aggressive when the race is the same . The time is near by when the American negroes will be as active in seeking the freedom of the enslaved and oppressed members of their race in Cuba , as the Irish-Americans now are in seeking the overthrow of British rule in Ireland . With Mexico our relations are now most cordial and friendly ; but we are sowing the seed of discord that may ripen into war . American capital is now being invested in Mexico to an extent that is not generally appreciated . The investors are among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . If revolution in Mexico endangered their property , armed intervention would follow . Our relations with France must sooner or later become strained through her possession of the exclusive right of way over the shortest route across the American isthmus . By right of purchase a French company will very soon come into possession of the Panama railroad , one of the most important links in American inter-state communication . Whether republic , monarchy , or empire , France is ever ready to guard and defend the property of her citizens . The exclusive rights granted to citizens of the United States by the Government of New Granada can not but clash with the interests of a French company in control of the Panama railroad . The control of the Panama railway by a foreign company would be as irksome and as much opposed to the interests of the // United States as if it were a canal . We must be prepared to maintain our rights ou the isthmus , and our only means of maintaining . them lies in the possessiou of a powerful naval force in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative and conceding may be our future policy with Chili , the seeds of discord have already been sown and must sooner or later cause us serious controversy with that republic . An aggressive foreign policy has its supporters in the United States , perhaps not so numerous as the opposite policy , but unquestionably numerous enough to compel us to resent any act of Chili that has the semblance of snubbing . The immensity of our coast line , the proximity of Bermuda and Halifax , where the British maintain large naval establishments equal to any we possess , the long voyages necessary to effect a reinforcement of our Pacific fleet by a detachment from the Atlantic and the inverse , combine , with the foregoing considerations relative to our foreign relations , to demonstrate conclusively that an efficient naval force is essential to the welfare of the United States . That the vessels now on our navy list are useless for any operations of modern warfare is conclusively proven by an analysis of the report of the Advisory Board , which reveals a condition of the navy far worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report and accompanying documents , and compares the qualities of our naval vessels with those of other nations , must be impressed with the fact that our naval force concentrated at one point of our coast would be inadequate to defend it against the attack of a fleet of modern war-vessels . Analyzing the report , comparing it with the latest naval register , and taking into consideration notorious facts concerning several of the vessels classed as " in good condition , " or " serviceable , " result in fixing the number of vessels that are to-day available for war service at fourteen unarmored cruisers and twelve old-fashioned monitors . lThe fourteen cruisers are scattered over the globe , or , as it is generally put by naval officers , " distributed among our foreign squadrons , " and under the most favorable conditions could not be collected to form a fleet in less than six months . Their value for modern naval war service may be estimated from admitted facts , which are briefly as follows : The guns they carry are of obsolete types , long // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen , which is also the swiftest vessel built expressly for the navy , has a maximum speed under the most favorable conditions of 12.9 knots per hour , which would be equivalent to a mean speed of eleven knots per hour for a day 's run . The maximum speed of the slowest is seven knots per hour , which is equivalent to about five and a half knots per hour for a day 's run . The mean sea speed of the fourteen is about eight knots per hour . But the speed of a fleet is that of its slowest ship , and therefore the best fleet speed at sea of the fourteen vessels available for war operations would be five and a half knots per hour . The stowage capacity for coal of all our vessels , and not ably the fourteen available for war service , is so low that a fleet formed of them could not keep the sea long enough to steam at full speed nine hundred miles . Such a fleet could not operate against Bermuda , Halifax , or even Cuba from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an efficient ram in the navy . The Trenton , designed for ramming , has such comparatively low speed , and requires so much space and time to turn in , that she is useless for that purpose . Not one of the vessels on our navy list could operate advantageously against an enemy's commercial shipping . There are but three with a maximum speed , under the most favorable conditions , of twelve knots per hour . Without guns to fight and speed to escape from armed vessels , without coal capacity or speed to operate against unarmed ones , the unarmored vessels of our navy are utterly worthless for war service . As to the twelve monitors or armored vessels , comparatively their availability for war operations is less . They do not carry a gnu that would , if fired from a distance of one thousand five hundred yards , produce more than a slight indentation on the armor of the iron-clads of the world built since 1865 . Every foreign sea-going armored vessel carries one or more guns that would penetrate the side-armor of our monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . The maximum speed of our monitors is four knots per hour . It would be difficult and generally impossible to get any iron-clad built in Europe during the last fifteen years down to a speed of four knots an hour with her engines in operation . The officers of foreign iron-clads would , therefore , have only to select their distance from our monitors , and proceed with great deliberation // to the amusement of destroying them . Monitors are not , nor have they ever been , effective vessels for coast defense . If carefully battened down and tightly corked up they may safely make very short sea voyages . But their limited sea-going qualities , low speed and fuel capacity render them useless for operations at sea . As against forts this type is unquestionably superior to any other ; but to operate against foreign forts sea voyages are necessary , and ability to keep the sea for long periods and to fight at sea under all conditions are essential to success . Whoever reads the official reports that are issued from the department , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the navy , must be impressed with the unanimity with which it is condemned as inefficient and useless for the purpose for which it exists-war . The responsibility for this condition of affairs must be fixed definitely somewhere . If we compare the annual appropriatibns for the maintenance of our navy since 1865 with the amounts expended on foreign navies , it will appear that Congress has most liberally provided the means to maintain an efficient naval force . Take as an example the naval budgets of different countries for the five years , 1875-1879 inclusive . There we find that England , France , and Russia have expended more than we have , and all others much less . Italy has expended on her navy less than one-half the amounts appropriated by Congress for the United States navy . The average annual expenditure of Italy for the five years was $8,214,578-that of the United States was $19,157,234 . We ought , therefore , to have a naval force at Ileast equal to that of Italy . Every pound of iron and every piece of machinery that enters into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that country , while the materials that go to create an American man-of-war are all made in America . We have every advantage over Italy , except in the cost of labor , and in this we are not at great disadvantage , for in the United States labor-saving machines tend to equalize the cost of results as compared with other countries . If our naval administration had been efficient , we should to-day possess an effective naval force double that of Italy . Instead of this , we really have none worthy the name , while Italy ranks third among the naval powers in effective fighting vessels . A comparison with the Austrian expenditures and the Austrian navy will be still more damaging to our system of naval administration . The expendi // tures of Austria have been one-fourth those of the United States ; yet she has created and maintained an effective fighting force of fourteen heavily armored vessels , most of them of equal efficiency at sea or in harbors , armed with the most powerful rifled guns , and capable of offensive or defensive operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarmored vessels of snperior efficiency to ours . There must be something radically wrong in our system of naval administration that it can not , with four times the expenditure , maintain a navy as efficient as that of Austria . The first duty of Congress is , therefore , to provide a more efficient naval administration-one , also , less costly and less cumbersome . Under the present system , the hull , the engines , the guns , and the sail power to comprise a man-of-war are designed independently of each other , in the different bureaus , the officers of which generally entertain antagonistic views on every question that arises . The system requires eight distinct and independent organizations in each navy-yard , nominally under one commandant , but really receiving orders from their respective chiefs in Washington . Its absurdity and extravagance may be judged from the fact that each organization has its own workshops for each branch of mechanical operations , its separate executive staff of clerks , draughtsmen , and designers , besides its own foreman , watchman , messengers , mechanics , and laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval administration had been the multiplication of offices , the division of responsibility , and the obstruction of work , it may be regarded as a success without The antagonism that exists between line and staff had its origin in the bureau system . The cliques that have become the curse of naval life are the result of that system . The extravagance exposed by the Forty-sixth Congress would have been possible under no other . In brief , the demoralization of the personnel of the navy , under the bureau system , has been as rapid and as general as the deterioration of the materiaL The defects of the system are too glaringly apparent and too numerous for any one to find even an excuse for continuing it . The fact that , for an expenditure averaging over twenty millions a year , for the last ten years , it has nothing to show , should be enough to induce Congress to set it aside summarily , and to substitute something else . // It is not justifiable to destroy any part of our complicated and delicate social machinery called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute something that is better . It is not right to prove that our bureau system of naval administration is bad , *thout suggesting a better . The essential features of a new system to be inaugurated would be concentration of authority and responsibility ; a single directing administrative civil officer , aided and advised in professional matters by a board of recognized naval experts , acting conjointly on all matters referred to them . The administrative officer should be compelled by law to submit to the advisory board of experts for examination , and report all matters pertaining to construction , repair , equipment , armament , and manning of naval vessels , navy-yards , and their accessories . He should have discretion as to accepting or rejecting the decisions of the experts , but in the event of rejecting them he should be compelled to file with the report submitted to him his reasons in detail , all of which should be within reach of the public press , and therefore subject to public scrutiny . In the event of waste or extravagance resulting from the rejection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to trial and removal by a court of justice . The administrative officer should be the Secretary of the Navy . The board of experts should be selected by the President-one from each of the grades of captain , commander , and lieutenant-commander or lieutenant , one from the engineer corps , and one from the corps of constructors . At least ten years of actual service at sea in naval vessels , and an age not exceeding fifty-five nor less than thirty years , should be essential qualifications . The length of service of each member on the board should be limited to three years . To effect a gradual change of membership , the first terms of service of four of the five members should be two and a half , two , one and a half , and one year , and vacancies for unexpired terms from death , resignation , retirement , or dismissal should be filled only for the remainder of that term . Removals should only be possible by sentence of court martial . Such a system would insure independence of thought and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt administrator packing it with his tools . The board should be without initiative authority of any kind . Its duties should be advisory ouly. // Under existing law , the Secretary has the power to detail as many officers , of any rank and corps , as he pleases , to act as aids in the performance of his administrative duties . This power should be retained , but the aids should be without separate authority , and the Secretary should be specifically and personally responsible for every official act of the department . The chief clerk of the department should be designated by Congress as Acting Secretary , with full power during the prolonged absence of the Secretary or a vacancy in the office . One of the chief objections to the bureau system is , that it is beyond the reach and out of the influence of the active and most capable officers of the navy , and subject to the log-rolling , wirepulling , time-serving influences of civil and naval politicians of the worst type , who hang about the department and Congress and persistently seek their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into positions they are not competent to occupy and do not deserve . Our naval policy is also defective and needlessly expensive . We maintain from twenty to thirty vessels in commission , cruising in foreign waters under the pretense of " showing the flag , " " protecting commerce , " and " policing the seas. ** Four of the most efficient of these are in Europe ; as many more in the North Atlantic . Italy , with a much greater tonnage engaged in foreign trade , and with her citizens scattered all over the world , has only four cruisers in foreign waters , and her interests do not appear to suffer in comparison with our own . The estimated annual cost of maintaining our four vessels in European waters , and providing reliefs for them , is $3,000,000 . Let some one point out the benefits to the country resulting from this expenditure . If it is for instruction and experience , why Europe ? Why not Patagonia , or Oceanica , or other localities where there is work to be done , and valuable information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and reflect credit on the country , and especially the navy ? Actual work , something having an object , would bring about a higher efficiency in naval training than aimless cruising where temptation and diversion exist on every side . It is within bounds to say that at least ten millions of dollars a year have been squandered in the maintenance of ships in foreign waters , without one thing to show for it , without a tangible result , without even an ideal object . // The annual appropriation for " pay of the navy " is about $7,000,000 , which does not include the pay of civil employ&amp;*s . Four-fifths of this enormous sum has been absorbed in the payment of officers and sailors that have formed the crews of vessels cruising in foreign waters without aim or object . At least onehalf might have been applied to the creation of a navy that would be available for service . There is no stipulation of law that requires enlisted men to be sailors ; of the 7,500 men authorized , at least 4,000 mechanics should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast quantities of old material that presents , according to the last annual report of the Secretary , " a ghastly and discouraging appearance , ** and costs so much to preserve , by converting it into material available for use by means of the costly plant that lies idle in these yards . It is well within bounds to assert there is enough of this old material , and enough suitable machinery for converting the same , in each navy-yard , to make one efficient vessel , fully armed and equipped . Almost all naval powers employ enlisted mechanics in their arsenals , very much to their advantage , and not less to the advantage of the mechanics themselves . One of the measures annually presented to Congress is to make provision for navyyard employees who have been injured or grown old in the service . If they were enlisted men no new law would be required . Other governments find no difficulty in getting the most skillful mechanics to enlist , and they have nothing like the advantages to offer them which we have . Proportionately to the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our hours of work less . If this system were once inaugurated , the naval establishments would be freed from the curse of political influence in the selection of employees . The navy complains that work done in our navy-yards costs much more than that done in private establishments , owing to the class of employ*s forced on the former by political influences being much below the standards of the latter . A mechanic enlisted and amenable to military dicipline could be made to work . He , moreover , would not hesitate to give an equivalent for his pay , when so doing he felt secure against removal without cause , and knew that in the event of accident or the attainment of old age he would be provided against want by a pension . Every naval officer and every man m public life knows , but too well , the evils of our // present system of employing civil labor in our navy yards . The remedy lies wholly in the hands of the Navy Department . Five thousand enlisted mechanics , employed three hundred days , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equivalent to four millions five hundred thousand dollars , for labor . Intelligently directed this expenditure of human force and skill would work a revolution in our navy in a very short time . As labor and material enter into the construction of war vessels at the ratio of sixty per cent . to forty per cent. , three of the most powerful rams for coast defense , fully armed and equipped , could be turned out annually from our navy yards after the first three years . If there are not enough capable officers to intelligently direct this labor through every stage of creating a ship from raw material the country has a right to demand an explanation . The pretense that the employment of a considerable part of the naval force allowed by Congress as mechanics in the yards would result in leaving us without trained mariners in the event of war is hardly worthy of refutation . Where is the advantage of having trained seamen if we have no efficient vessels for them to man ? It takes three years to build a modern fighting ship ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . An adequate supply of trained mariners for a naval war can not be provided by our present system of three years ' service . The length of service for enlisted men serving afloat should be limited to one year . We would then be able to train effectively as many men as we do now , even if the number of enlisted men afloat were limited to two thousand five hundred , and the training of our merchant seamen would become more general , and the source of supply , in the event of war , be greatly eularged . It would clear away the mists that hang around the official naval minds when discussing the classes of vessels needed for our navy , if the axiom that a navy exists for war puposes only was kept constantly in view . Referring to the report of the Naval Advisory Board , we find that it was constituted to recommend the class of vessels best adapted to meet the exigencies of the navy at the present time . In utter disregard of this axiom , the Board proceeds to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different squadrons for surveying , deep-sea sounding , the protection and advancement of American commerce , exploration , the protection of American life and prop . // 496 THE NORTH AMERICAN foreign governments are concerned . " Every contingency is considered but that of war . First in order are surveying and deep-sea sounding . The inference naturaliy is that these are a necessary part of the duties of our naval vessels in commission ; yet if we examine the last annual report of the secretary , we find that of the thirty-two vessels in commission , forming our home and foreign squadrons and on special service , the Ranger was the only one engaged in surveying . None were then engaged in deep-sea sounding . In these occupations there is a wide field for the navy when not occupied with war . The whole Pacific ocean remains to be explored and correctly mapped . Not more than one-third of the coast line of the world is delineated on existing charts with approximate accuracy , and but about one-tenth of it has been accurately surveyed . Of the ocean beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific exploration and research there is nothing that offers to the navy , unoccupied as it is , a more promising field for useful work . The configuration of the ocean beds must be known before we can determine the causes of ocean currents . There lie hidden in the path of the mariner thousands of dangers that reveal themselves frequently and at unexpected moments , causing great sacrifice of life and property . To find these , and define their position so that they may be avoided , may well be considered the first and most essential duty of a navy during times of peace . No better service could be found for training officers and men . " The protection and advancement of American commerce , " in the opinion of the Advisory Board , is another of the " pressing * for which more naval vessels are required . Webster defines commerce as " the exchange of merchandise on a large scale between different places or communities . " What part naval vessels would be called upon to perform in its protection and advancement does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go together . The policy that Congress has pursued , in connection with our merchant-marine , may be termed protection and destruction . If by commerce the Board meant commercial vessels , the meaning would not be less obscure . " The exchange of merchandise " by water , between ports of the United States , does not appear to need " protection and advancement . " That between the United States and foreign // ports is carried on by means of foreign vessels , that can have no need of our protection . Even if American foreign commerce was carried on mainly in American ships , the need of its protection is not apparent . Where in the whole world to-day does an American ship need protection in order to receive or discharge its cargo ? What naval vessels are engaged in convoying American merchantmen at sea , or protecting them in port ? " Protection and advancement of American commerce " is a phrase without a meaning . In this connection , it would be instructive to ascertain what ports were visited by our naval vessels in 1881 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American merchant vessels had visited these ports . From this it could be determined just how much protection our navy afforded to American commerce , and the need of such protection . Other nations do not find it necessary to protect their shipping engaged in foreign trade . England , France , and Italy do nineteen-twentieths of the foreign carrying trade of the world , and find no need of such protection . England maintains a very large naval force in commission , but not in foreign waters . It is maintained for the defense of her home ports and colonial possessions . A few of her small cruisers are stationed in foreign waters exclusively . France and Italy have , together , ten times the amount of our tonnage engaged in foreign trade , and maintain no naval force in foreign waters for its protection . American commerce may be advanced by the navy only in rendering its pathways secure for navigation . " Exploration " is another object specified by the Advisory Board as demanding an increase of the navy . This may be regarded as coming under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding . " It has already been shown that there is abundant work for the navy in these directions while not occupied with war . If the naval service was really in earnest in this matter we might expect to find a considerable portion of it 80 occupied . Exploration of the great African rivers that flow into the region comprised within the limits of the European station is demanded ; yet what vessel on this station has ever been so engaged ? Exploration of the great rivers that flow eastward from the Andes through Patagonia would seem to offer a tempting field ; yet no United States naval vessel has recently entered the Santa Cruz or Rio Negro . In this region the climate is such that prolonged absence and exposure in boats // or steam-launches would not endanger life . Yet we find our naval vessels on this station frequenting the ports of Brazil , where yellow fever prevails , and at frequent intervals breaks out among their crews . More deaths have resulted from dissipation in the slums of Rio Janeiro than could by any combination of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board of naval vessels in commission are competent to make observations and surveys , and to prepare the original sheets from which charts are made . The training of youths in the naval academy comprises every requisite for such work , including drawing . Explorations , surveying , and deepsea sounding afford the best means of training officers and crews for the duties and hardships of actual warfare . They would teach self-sacrifice and endurance , which are , next to courage and ready resource , most essential to them . They would habituate the naval mind to the real object for which Congress grants such liberal appropriations to maintain the navy ; namely , service , not pleasure . They would reawaken the spirit that actuated the old naval heroes whose fame is world-wide . They would be the means of gaining and retaining public sympathy and support . Vessels best adapted to modern warfare are not the best for surveying , exploration , and sounding . These occupations may be resorted to by naval vessels , not occupied in war , as a means of useful employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving the organization for fighting . Every other occupation of a naval force , known to our day , involves its possible or actual use in warfare . " The protection of American life and property endangered by wars between foreign countries , and service in support of American policy in matters where foreign governments are concerned , " involve not only a demonstration , but an exercise of force , and necessarily , therefore , require fighting ships . In the re-creation of our navy the only question to be considered is , what classes of vessels are best adapted to possible offensive and defensive naval operations that may be forced on the United States . In the commencement of this paper it was shown that England , France , Spain , and Chili , are the naval powers with which we would be most likely to have wars . The British fleet is more powerful than the other three combined . The aggregate first // 499 cost of the British iron-clad fleet available for war operations is closely estimated at three hundred and fifty millions of dollars , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-clads that could cope with the British fleet successfully in actual battle would cost not less than five-hundred millions of dollars if built in the United States ; and it would require not less than fifteen years to complete it . But the British fleet is Great Britain 's strongest point . In warfare , attacking the enemies ' weakest points and strengthening your own are the essential elements of success . England 's weakest point is her vast foreign commerce , scattered , as it is , all over the globe , and carried on , as it is , by means of costly steamers . Paralyze her foreign commerce , capture , destroy , or imprison in port her merchant steamers , and the fabric on which British power and naval supremacy are based would collapse abruptly . A successful invasion of her North American possessions and the occupation of her West India Colonies would have less effect than the destruction of half a million of her eight million of steam tonnage . To neutralize the stupendous fighting power of the British navy , and not to contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to pursue . A large number of exceptionally swift cruisers , capable of catehing everything they pursue , of escaping from everything of superior force besetting the ocean highways , and destroying every British vessel intercepted , would soon bring her to terms . Against such vessels scattered over the globe the British navy would be powerless . The essential qualities of cruisers for such a purpose are : Prodigious speed , large capacity for coal , comparatively few and very long range guns , and the fewest men possible . The number needed for effective operations simultaneously on the most frequented ocean highways would be thirty or forty . Fighting would not be the business of such vessels . Destruction of unarmed trading steamers may seem an inglorious object for a navy to be devoted to , but if the pursuit of this object will insure a more speedy restoration of peace than any other method of warfare , it is fully justified . A sufficient reason for small crews for these cruisers is the limited number of mariners that would be available in a war with Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase . Sail power should be provided as // an auxiliary means of propulsion during peace . Everything above the bulwarks and pertaining to sail power should be landed anywhere , or thrown overboard , on the breaking out of hostilities . During the late rebellion the vessels with high sailpower made comparatively very few captures of steam blockaderunners . The Alabama had sail-power , because she was in pursuit of sailing vessels mainly . We had few steamers for her to capture ; England has now little else than steamers . The report of the Advisory Board recommending but two fast cruisers indicates that the destruction of British shipping and paralyzation of British commerce , in the event of war , were not in their catagory of possible uses for a navy . Vessels having less than an average sea speed of fifteen knots per hour can not be deemed exceptionally swift . The average sea speed of steamers under construction in England to-day exceeds thirteen knots per hour . A sea speed of fourteen knots would be inadequate for cruisers , because one knot advantage of speed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chase that can be prolonged until dark is equivalent to escape for the vessel chased . Another important consideration as regards high speed is the necessity for frequent and rapid change of cruising ground . The success of the Alabama was due to her not remaining long enough on one cruising ground to be intercepted . Liability to interception , and the laws of neutrality that England has paid so dearly to establish , would close the foreign ports of the world to our cruisers as coaling stations , in the event of war . These and other considerations , too numerous to produce here , demand that all naval vessels built in future for ocean service should have an average sea-speed of not less than fifteen knots per hour , and a storage capacity for three thousand tons of fuel . To satisfy these conditions a displacement of six thousand tons would be necessary . Moderate draft may be secured by giving comparatively great beam and length to depth . This would permit of the application of the motive power to two , or even three independent screws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one screw . Without sailpower the cruisers proposed would be helpless in the event of derangement of their machinery . Liability to this would be diminished one half with two screws and one-third with three . It is conceded that the proportion of cost of machinery and consumption of fuel to power developed , is increased by // dividing its application , but this increase is of no consequence when compared with the advantages of having liability to being rendered helpless reduced to one-half or one-third . Another important advantage in double and triple screws is the diminished weight and size of single pieces of the machinery which would facilitate construction , repair , and manipulation , and enable the vessels to keep on board a greater proportion of spare pieces applicable to either engine . Recent experiences with enormous machinery have indicated that the limit of size for shafting and other parts subjected to twisting strains has been almost reached in the largest transatlantic steamers . As to the material of which the swift cruisers should be constracted , there is no room for argument . By the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . over iron in weight of hull is secured , without materially increasing the cost . The manufacture of low grades of steel has taken such rapid strides toward economy , that the difference between iron and steel of equivalent strength and durability , is already very small . The demand for steel being greater than the supply , the high price is in a measure sustained , but the relative market prices are rapidly becoming equivalent . One of the weakest recommendations of the Advisory Board is that , " twenty ten-knot vessels of about seven hundred and ninety-three tons displacement should be built with live-oak frames and planked and celled with yellow pmeY The reasons given for this recommendation are that the lumber is on hand , " our eastern workmen " are familiar with wooden ship-building , and the resources of the country in this material are great . The reasons are manifestly inadequate , if not absurd . Because the naval appropriation has been squandered in purchasing timber that was not needed , is no reason for infficting on the country an obsolete type of vesseL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for this are widely known , and generally admitted . Prominent and most apparent is the rapid deterioration of timber from the action of heat radiated from the boilers and machinery , the action of moisture condensed from escaping steam and collected in the bilges through leakage of cocks and valves , and the vibration of the machinery in motion . Next to this is the impossibility of constructing a serviceable wooden hull , strong enough to resist the racking of high speed , for any length of time . The cost of maintenance in serviceable condition of the wooden hulls that // now form the majority of naval cruising vessels , when reported to Congress , will illustrate more forcibly than anything else could , the insufficient consideration given to this subject by the Advisory Board . It is held in Europe that the average life of an iron steamer is five times that of a wooden one , and that the cost of repairs to , and preservation of the hull of an iron steamer during any period of its life , is about one-fifth that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with wooden ship-building has nothing to do with the question , what classes of vessels are best suited to naval warfare . As a matter of fact , the number of skilled mechanics available for constructing iron ships in this country is far in excess of the number available for building wooden ones . This must be evident from the fact that *every boiler-maker , every bridge-builder , and every blacksmith , in fact every man who knows how to rivet or caulk iron is essentially an iron ship-wright . If the resources of the country in timber are good reason for building wooden hulls , what shall we say of its resources in iron ' ? It may have escaped the notice of the Advisory Board , that our diminishing resources in timber have begun to cause grave apprehension to those familiar with the waste and consumption of the last three decades ; and that the extensive substitution of iron for timber in all branches of manufacture and building is the direct result of the cheapening of the one aud the increasing cost of the other . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be inadequate to wholly neutralize the fighting power of the British navy . We must j*vide the cheapest effective means of defending our ports ag*wwt British iron-clads . The defense of southern ports and rivers during our late war without a naval force , although not invariably successful , was certainly remarkably effective , when we consider that the attacking force comprised the most formidable armored vessels and carried the most powerful guns then known . The defenses consisted of earthworks , speedily thrown up , and torpedoes of the simplest construction extemporized for the occasion . Both have been studied and improved on . But in few things , certainly not in guns or armor , have there been such strides towards perfection as there have been in the development of torpedoes . It has not been sufficiently dwelt on , in the discussion of coast and harbor // defense , that the destructive power of torpedoes against hulls has steadily increased , while the resistance of hulls to torpedoes has remained the same . Defense against torpedoes is limited to the use of torpedoes . Armor-plating hulls below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist their destructive force . Nets , booms , and all other guards around ships , are embarrassing to the ships , without affording security against offensive torpedoes . The only devices yet suggested for destroying torpedo defenses , submarine mines , are counter-mines and dragging  --  the one by concussion , the other by severing the electrical connections . It must be evident that conducting such operations would be impracticable from an attacking fleet , operating far from its base , under fire of land batteries . Not the least important feature of torpedo defense is the readiness with which small harbor , steamtugs , launches and yachts may be converted into formidable torpedo boats . Let it be known , for instance , that a British fleet was expected to attack New-York , even with the inadequate facilities we possess , every tug , etc. , in the harbor could be converted into a torpedo boat in ten days . We could well afford to sacrifice twenty tugs to the destruction of one Inflexible . And does any one suppose that a simultaneous attack of ten tugs , fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would fail to destroy her ? The question of harbor defense , therefore , is not one that concerns the navy beyond a systematic inquiry into the qualities of every steam harbor craft available for torpedo warfare , and a determination in advance of the best methods of applying torpedo apparatus to each one . Stationary torpedoes for harbor defense and land batteries , are matters that concern the army , not the navy . If the means of applying torpedo apparatus to tugs , &amp;c. , so as to make them effective for attack has not been developed at the torpedo station at Newport , Congress is certainly not to blame . The question of coast defense is one that exclusively concerns the navy . It would be impracticable to adequately fortify every available landing-place for an army on our enormous seaboard . This is our weakest point as England 's wide-spread commerce is hers . Taking into consideration the enormous cost of armored vessels , the length of time necessary to build them , and their very short life of usefulness compai*ed with other vessels , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other classes of vessels can be made available . An iron-clad , to be really formidable , must be of enormous size and therefore unwieldy . If the cost of a first-class modern armored vessel is estimated as low as three million five hundred thousand dollars  --  and this is very low-is there not some way of converting this enormous sum into vessels for coast defense that would be effective against one such iron-clad at sea , have a longer life of usefulness , and be more rapidly constructed ? For this sum , not less than six formidable rams of high speed , with one heavy gun and small storage capacity , could be constructed . It is absolutely certain that in an action between the most powerful iron-clad in the world and six moderate-sized rams the iron-clad would be speedily sunk . Admitting that she succeeded in destroying two of the rams before she was sunk , the balance would be four rams . This leads to the inevitable conclusion that a fleet of rams is what we want for coast defense . Not hampered with armor , operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense of any point , acting always in groups , there is no doubt whatever that the ram offers us the best means of strengthening our weak points . A fleet of twenty rams for the Atlantic and ten for the Pacific should be constructed at the earliest possible date . The design is a matter that needs careful consideration , but it is not necessarily difficult of determination . A displacement of two thousand tons would be ample for eighteen knots maximum speed , and the very smali stowage capacity required for vessels engaged in coast defense . One powerful gun , mounted en barbette , protected by a shield of steel thick enough to resist penetration by the improved Hotchkiss revolving cannon , which is aimed from the shoulder , would be enough armament for each ram . In the race between guns and armor , guns are far ahead , and the unarmored ram suggested would have the advantage over her iron-clad adversary of being provided with the means of flanking as well as penetrating her armor . The Inflexible is believed to be the most formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to attack her with two rams costing half a million each ; and the chances of sinking her by a simultaneous attack of four rams that would cost together about half of what she has cost , would be overwhelming . Besides an efficient navy , the United States needs , more than anything else , the development of ship building and associate // industries . The re-creation of a navy may be made the means of such development . The rapid strides made in England during the last twenty years in ship building , are due mainly to the enormous expenditures of the Government in private ship yards . Every engine , and about one-fifth of the tonnage of the British navy has been contracted for . The average annual expenditure in private ship and engine building yards is estimated at $15,000,000 . While it is true that England has never directly subsidized her iron ship-building industries , it is undeniable that the vast sums she has spent with them is more than anything else the cause of their prodigious growth . Let us profit by her example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When iron was substituted for wood as a material for ship building , England had us at a disadvantage , in that we were engaged in settling a sectional dispute that absorbed our resources and our time , while she was exceptionally free from such occupations . Now that steel is on the threshold of substitution for iron , we have our opportunity to surpass her in economic ship-building , and , as a consequence , in the world 's carrying trade . A steel ship , costing the same , will earn about eleven per cent . gross more than an iron one under identical conditions . As the ocean commerce of the world is carried on by those who do the work cheapest , building steel ships will enable us to compete with our great rival on the ocean . The general features of the cruising vessel here proposed are the same as those of a first-class transatlantic steamer . Orders for building thirty such vessels in private yards , would stimulate ship-building , and insure its permanent extension . Let Congress enact that twenty of the cruisers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Pacific , and at least two new establishments would be created to build them . The importance of having a first-class steel ship-yard on the Pacific can not be overestimated . Of the crude material from which and by which steel is made , Washington Territory would furnish an inexhaustible supply . Unskilled labor is neither scarce nor expensive ; skilled labor could be obtained from the crowded ship-yards of the Clyde , the Tyne , and the Thames with ease . The rams should be built in the navy-yards , and the debris that now goes under the name of " United States Navy " should be sold or utilized in their construction . Two-thirds of th' men // now allowed by Congress to be enlisted fo* the navy , should be enlisted to serve as mechanics in the navy-yards to build these rams . All vessels now serving on foreign stations , where peace prevails , that are not engaged in exploring , sounding , or surveymg , should be recalled . It is the duty , no less than the right of every citizen , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters pertaining to government and public policy . And as every man should have the courage of his convictions , there can be no impropriety in a naval officer expressing them franidy and honestly on matters pertaining to the navy . Hi*v H.
