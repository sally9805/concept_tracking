COMMENTS ON CANADA . BY CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER . I. THE area of the Dominion of Canada is larger than that of the United States , excluding Alaska . It is fair , however , in the comparison , to add Alaska , for Canada has in its domain enough arctic and practically uninhabitable land to offset Alaska . Excluding the boundary great lakes and rivers , Canada has 3,470,257 square miles of territory , or more than one-third of the entire British Empire ; the United States has 3,026,494 square miles , or , adding Alaska ( 577,390 ) , 3,603,884 square miles . From the eastern limit of the maritime provinces to Vancouver Island the distance is over three thousand five hundred miles . This whole distance is settled , but a considerable por // tion of it only by a thin skirmish line . I have seen a map , colored according to the maker 's idea of fertility , on which Canada appears little more than a green flush along the northern boundary of the United States . With a territory equal to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York-about five millions . Most of Canada lies north of the limit that was reckoned agreeably habitable before it was discovered that climate depends largely on altitude , and that the isothermal lines and the lines of latitude do not coincide . The division between the two countries is , however , mainly a natural one , on a divide sloping one way to the arctic regions , the other way to the tropics . It would seem better map-making to us if our line followed the northern mountains of Maine and included New Brunswick and the other maritime provinces . But it would seem a better rectification to Canadians if their line included Maine with the harbor of Portland , and dipped down in the Northwest so as to take in the Red River of the North and all the waters discharging into Hudson 's Bay . The great bulk of Canada is on the arctic slope . When we pass the highlands of New Hampshire , Vermont , and New York we fall away into a wide champaign country . The only break in this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest land above water , now degraded into hills of from 1500 to 2000 feet in height . The central mass of Canada consists of three great basins : that portion of the St. Lawrence in the Dominion , 460,000 square miles ; the Hudson 's Bay , 2,000,000 square miles ; the Mackenzie , 550,000 square miles . That is to say , of the 3,470,257 square miles of the area of Canada , 3,010,000 have a northern slope . This decrease in altitude from our northern *boundary makes Canada a pos sible nation . The Rocky Mountains fall . away north into the Mackenzie plain* The highest altitude attained by th ( Union Pacific Railroad is 8240 feet ; the highest of the Canadian Pacific is 5296 ; and a line of railway still further north , from the North Saskatchewan region , can , and doubtless some time will , reach the Pacific without any obstruction by the Rockies and the Selkirks . In estimating , therefore , the capacity of Canada for sustaining a large  |p6|pulation  we have to remember that the greater portion of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interior is modified by vast bodies of water ; that the maximum summer heat of Montreal and Quebec exceeds that of New York ; and that there is a vast region east of the Rockies and north of the Canadian Pacific Railway , not only the plains drained by the two branches of the Saskatchewan , but by the Peace River still further north , which have a fair share of summer weather , and winters much milder than are enjoyed in our Territories further south but higher in altitude . The summers of this vast region are by all reports most agreeable , warm days and refreshing nights , with a stimulating atmosphere ; winters with little snow , and usually bright and pleasant , occasional falls of the thermometer for two or three days to arctic temperature , but as certain a recovery to mildness by the " Chinook " or Pacific winds . It is estimated that the plains of the Saskatchewan-500,000 square miles-are capable of sustaining a population of thirty millions . But nature there must call forth a good deal of human energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come very late in the spring and very early in the autumn ; that persistent winds are hostile to the growth of trees ; and that varieties of hardy cereals and fruits must be selected for success in agriculture and horticulture . The winters are exceedingly severe on all the prairies east of Winnipeg , and westward on the Canadian Pacific as far as Medicine Hat , the crossing of the South Saskatchewan . Heavy items in the cost of living there must always be fuel , warm clothing , and solid houses . Fortunately the region has an abundance of lignite and extensive fields of easily workable coal . Canada is really two countries , separated from each other by the vast rocky wilderness between the lakes and James Bay . For a thousand miles west of Ottawa , till the Manitoba prairie is reached , the traveller on the line of the railway sees little but granite rock and stunted balsams , larches , and poplars  --  a dreary region impossible to attract settlers . Copper and other minerals there are ; and in the region north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land is spoken of ; but the country is really unknown . Portions of this land , like that // about Lake Nipigon , offer attractions to sportsmen . Lake navigation is impracticable about four months in the year , so that Canada seems to depend for political and commercial unity upon a telegraph wire and two steel rails running a thousand miles through a region where local traffic is at present insignificant . The present government of Canada is an evolution on British lines , modified by the example of the republic of the United States . In form the resemblances are striking to the United States , but underneath , the differences are radical . There is a supreme federal government , comprehending a union of provinces , each having its local government . But the union in the two countries was brought about in a different way , and the restrictive powers have a different origin . In the one , power descends from the crown ; in the other , it originates with the people . In the Dominion government all the powers not delegated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , all the powers not delegated to the federal government by the States are held by the States . In the United States , delegates from the colonies , specially elected for the purpose , met to put in shape a union already a necessity of the internal and external situation . And the union expressed in the Constitution was accepted by the popular vote in each State . In the provinces of Canada there was a long and successful struggle for responsible government . The first union was of the two Canadas , in 1840 ; that is , of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada - Ontario and Quebec-with Parliaments sitting sometimes in Quebec and sometimes in Toronto , and at last in Ottawa , a site selected by the Queen . This government was carried on with increasing friction . There is not space here to sketch the politics of this epoch . Many causes contributed to this friction , but the leading ones were the antagonism of French and English ideas , the superior advance in wealth and population of Ontario over Quebec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At length , in 1863-4 , the two parties , the Conservatives and the Liberals ( or , in the political nomenclature of the day , the " Tories " and the " Grits " -i . e. , those of " clear grit " ) , were so evenly divided that a deadlock occurred , neither was able to carry on the government , and a coalition ministry was formed . Then the subject of colonial confederation was actively agitated . Nova Scotia and New Brunswick contemplated a legislative union of the maritime provinces , and a conference was called at Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , in the summer of 1864 . Having in view a more comprehensive union , the Canadian government sought and obtained admission to this conference , which was soon swallowed up in a larger scheme , and a conference of all the colonies was appointed to be held at Quebec in October . Delegates , thirty-three in number , were present from all the provinces , probably sent by the respective legislatures or governments , for I find no note of a popular election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions as a basis of an act of confederation . The Canadian Parliament adopted this scheme after a protracted debate . But the maritime provinces stood out . Meantime the civil war in the United States , the Fenian invasion , and the abrogation of the reciprocity treaty fostered a spirit of Canadian nationality , and discouraged whatever feeling existed for annexation to the United States . The colonies , therefore , with more or less willingness , came into the plan , and in 1867 the English Parliament passed the British North American Act , which is the charter of the Dominion . It established the union of the provinces of Canada , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick , and provided for the admission to the union of the other parts of British North America ; that is , Prince Edward Island , the Hudson Bay Territory , British Columbia , and Newfoundland , with its dependency Labrador . Nova Scotia was , however , still dissatisfied with the terms of the union , and was only reconciled on the granting of additional annual subsidies . In 1868 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Company surrendered to the crown its territorial rights over the vast region it controlled , in consideration of ? 300,000 sterling , grants of land around its trading posts to the extent of fifty thousand acres in all , and one-twentieth of all the fertile land south of the north branch of the Saskatchewan , retaining its privileges of trade , without its exclusive monopoly . The attempt of the Dominion government to take possession of this northwest territory ( Mani // toba was created a province July 15 , 1870 ) was met by the rising of the squatters and half-breeds under Louis iRiel in 1869-70 . IRiel formed a provisional government , and proceeded with a high hand to banish persons and confiscate property , and put to death , on a drum-head court-martial , Thomas Scott , a Canadian militia officer . The murder of Scott provoked intense excitement throughout Canada , especially in Ontario . Colonel Garnet Wolseley 's expedition to Fort Garry ( now Winnipeg ) followed , and the government authority was restored . mel and his squatter confederates fled , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominion . In 1873 Prince Edward Island came in . The original act for establishing the province of Manitoba provided for a Lieutenant-Governor , a Legislative Council , and an elected Legislative Assembly . In 1876 Manitoba abolished the Council , and the government took its present form of a Lieutenant-Governor and one Assembly . By subsequent legislation of the Dominion the district of Keewatin was created out of the eastern portion of the northwest territory , under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant - Governor of Manitoba , cx officio . The territories of Assiniboin , Alberta , and Saskatchewan have been organized into a territory called the Northwest Territory , with a LieutenantGovernor and Council , and a representative in Parliament , the capital being IRegina . Outside of this territory , to the northward , lies Athabasca , of which the Lieutenant - Governor at Regina is cx officio ruler . Newfoundland still remains independent , although negotiations for union were revived in 1888 . Some years ago overtures were made for taking in Jamaica to the union , and a delegation from that island visited Ottawa ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Jamaica delegates thought the Dominion debt too large . The Dominion of Canada , therefore , has a central government at Ottawa , and is composed of the provinces of Nova Scotia ( including Cape Breton ) , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Quebec , Ontario , Manitoba , British Columbia , and the Northwest Territory . It has been necessary to speak in this brief detail of the manner of the formation of the union in order to understand the politics of Canada . For there are radicals in the liberal party who still regard the union as forced and artificial , and say that the provinces outside of Ontario and Quebec were brought in only by the promise of local railways and the payment of large subsidies . And this idea more or less influences the opposition to the " strong government " at Ottawa . I do not say that the liberals oppose the formation of a " nation " ; but they are critics of its methods , and array themselves for provincial rights as against federal consolidation . The federal government consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons . The Queen is represented by the Governor-General , who is paid by Canada a salary of fifty thousand dollars a year . He has his personal staff , and is aided and advised by a council , called the Queen 's Privy Council of Canada , thirteen members , constituting the ministry , who must be sustained by a Parliamentary majority . The English model is exactly followed . The Governor has nominally the power of veto , but his use of it is as much in abeyance as is the Queen 's prerogative in regard to acts of Parliament . The premier is in fact the ruler , but his power depends upon possessing a majority in the House of Commons . This respon sible government , therefore , more quickly responds to popular action than ours . The Senators are chosen for life , and are in fact appointed by the premier in power . The House of Commons is elected for five years , unless Parliament is sooner dissolved , and according to a ratio of population to correspond with the province of Quebec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . The voter for members of Parliament must have certain property qualifications , as owner or tenant , or , in a city or town , earning three hundred dollars a yearqualifications so low as practically to exclude no one who is not an idler and a waif ; the Indian may vote ( though not in the territories ) , but the Mongolian or Chinese is excluded . Members of the House may be returned by any constituency in the Dominion without reference to residence . All bills affecting taxation or revenue must originate in the House , and be recommended by a message from the Governor-General . The government introduces bills , and takes the responsi // bility of them . The premier is leader of the House ; there is also a recognized leader of the opposition . In case the government can not command a majority it resigns , and the Governor-General forms a new cabinet . In theory , also , if the crown ( represented by the Governor - General ) should resort to the extreme exercise of its prerogative in ref using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or resign and give place to others . The federal government has all powers not granted expressly to the provinces . In practice its jurisdiction extends over the public debt , expenditure , and public loans ; treaties ; customs and excise duties ; trade and commerce ; navigation , shipping , and fisheries ; light-houses and harbors ; the postal , naval , and military services ; public statistics ; monetary institutions , banks , banking , currency , coining ( but all coining is done in England ) ; insolvency ; criminal law ; marriage and divorce ; public works , railways , and canals . The provinces have no militia ; that all belongs to the Dominion . Marriage is solemnized according to provincial regulations , but the power of divorce exists nowhere in Canada except in the federal Parliament . Criminal law is one all over the Dominion , but there is no law against adultery or incest . The British Act contains no provision analogous to that in the Constitution of the United States which forbids any State to pass a law impairing the obligation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Supreme Court , consisting of a chief - justice and five puisne judges , which has original jurisdiction in civil suits involving the validity of Dominion and provincial acts , and appellate in appeals from the provincial courts . The federal government appoints and pays the judges of the Superior , District , and County courts of the provinces ; but the provinces may constitute , maintain , and organize provincial courts , civil and criminal , including procedure in civil matters in those courts . But as the provinces can not appoint any judicial officer above the rank of magistrate , it may happen that a constituted court may be inoperative for want of a judge . This is one of the points of friction between the federal and provincial authorities , and in the fall of 1888 it led to the trouble in Quebec , when the Otta wa cabinet disallowed the appointment of two provincial judges made by the Quebec premier . The Dominion has another power unknown to our Constitution ; that is , disallowance or veto of provincial acts . This power is regarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one party that it should only be exercised on the ground of unconstitutionality ; by the other , that it may be exercised in the interest of the Dominion generally . As a matter of fact it has been sometimes exercised in cases that the special province felt to be an interference with its rights . Another cause of friction , aggravated by the power of disallowance , has arisen from conflict in jurisdiction as to railways . Both the Dominion and the provinces may charter and build railways . But the British Act forbids the province to legislate as to lines of steam or other ships , railways , canals , and telegraphs connecting the province with any other province , or extending beyond its limits , or any such work actually within the limits which the Canadian Parliament may declare for the general advantage of Canada ; that is , declare it a Dominion work . A promoter , therefore , can not tell with any certainty what a charter is worth , or who will have jurisdiction over it . The trouble in Manitoba in the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a Dominion road in the meaning of the Act ) could scarcely have arisen if the definition of Dominion and provincial rights had been clearer . But a more serious cause of weakness to the provinces and embarrassment to the Dominion is in the provincial subsidies . When the present confederation . was formed the Dominion took on the provincial debts up to a certain amount . It also agreed to pay annually to each province , in half-yearly payments , a subsidy . By the British Act this annual payment was $80,000 to Ontario , $70,000 to Quebec , $60,000 to Nova Scotia , $50,000 to New Brunswick , with something additional to the last two . In 1886-7 the subsidies paid to all the provinces amounted to $4,169,341 .. This is as if the United States should undertake to raise a fixed revenue to distribute among the States-a proceeding alien to our ideas of the true function of the general government , and certain to lead to State demoraljzation , and tending directly to undermine its // self-support and dignity . It is an idea quite foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best for people to earn what they spend , and only spend what they earn . This subsidy under the act was a grant equal to eighty cents a head of the population . Besides this there is given to each province an annual allowaiice for government ; also an annual allowance of interest on the amount of debt allowed where the province has not reached the limit of the authorized debt . It is the theory of the federal government that in taking on these pecuniary burdens of the provinces they will individually feel them less , and that if money is to be raised the Dominion can procure it on more favorable terms than the provinces . The system , nevertheless , seems vicious to our apprehension , for nothing is clearer to us than that neither the State nor the general welfare would be promoted if the States were pensioners of the general government . The provinces are miniature copies of the Dominion government . Each has a Lieutenant - Governor , who is appointed by the Ottawa Governor - General and ministry ( that is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid by the Dominion Parliament . In theory he represents the crown , and is above parties . He forms his cabinet out of the party in majority in the elective Assembly . Each province has an elective Assembly , and most of them have two Houses , one of which is a Senate appointed for life . The provincial cabinet has a premier , who is the leader of the House , and the opposition is represented by a recognized leader . The government is as responsible as the federal government . This organization of recognized and responsible leaders greatly facilitates the despatch of public business . Affairs are brought to a direct issue and if the government can not carry its measures , or a dead-lock occurs , the ministry is changed , or an appeal is had to the people . Canadian statesmen point to the want of responsibility in the conduct of public business in our House , and the dead - lock between the Senate and the House , as a state of things that needs a remedy . The provinces retain possession of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manitoba , which had none when it was created a province out of northwest territory , has since had a VOL . LXXVIIL-No. 466-47 gift of swamp lands from the Dominion . Emigration and immigration are subjects of both federal and provincial legislation , but provincial laws must not conflict with federal laws . The provinces appoint all officers for the administration of justice except judges , and are charged with the general administration of justice and the maintenance of civil and criminal courts ; they control jails , prisons , and reformatories , but not the penitentiaries , to which convicts sentenced for over two years must be committed . They control also asylums and charitable institutions , all strictly municipal institutions , local works , the solemnization of marriage , property and civil rights , and shop , tavern , and other licenses . In regard to the latter , a conflict of jurisdiction arose on the passage in 1878 by the Canadian Parliament of a temperance act . The result of judicial and Privy Council decisions on this was to sustain the right of the Dominion to legislate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to deal with the subject of licenses for the sale of liquors . In the territories prohibition prevails under the federal statutes , modified by the right of the Lieutenant-Governor to grant special permits . The effect of the general law has been most salutary in excluding liquor from the Indians . But the most important subject left to the provinces is education , over which they have exclusive control . What this means we shall see when we come to consider the provinces of Quebec and Ontario as illustrations . Broadly stated , Canada has representative government by ministers responsible to the people , a federal government charged with the general good of the whole , and provincial governments attending to local interests . It differs widely from the English government in subjects remitted to the provincial legislatures and in the freedom of the municipalities , so that Canada has self-government comparable to that in the United States . Two striking limitations are that the provinces can not keep a militia force , and that the provinces have no power of final legislation , every act being subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged on general lines that we might expect from the organization of the central and the local governments . The conservative , which // calls itself Liberal-Conservative , inclines to the consolidation and increase of federal power ; the liberal ( styled the " Grits " ) is what we would call a State-rights party . Curiously enougjii , while the Ottawa government is conservative , and the ministry of Sir John A. Macdonald is sustained by a handsome majority , all the provincial governments are at present liberal . The conservatives say that this is because the opinion of the country sustains the general conservative policy for the development of the Dominion , so that the same constituency will elect a conservative member to the Dominion House and a liberal member to the provincial House . The liberals say that this result in some cases is brought about by the manner in which the central government has arranged the voting districts for the central Parliament , which do not coincide with the provincial districts . There is no doubt some truth in this , but I believe that at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Ottawa government . The general policy of the conservative government may fairly be described as one for the rapid development of the country . This leads it to desire more federal power , and there are some leading spirits who , although content with the present constitution , would not oppose a legislative union of all the provinces . The policy of " development " led the party to adopt the present moderate protective tariff : It led it to the building of railways , to the granting of subsidies , in money and in land , to railways , to the subsidizing of steam-ship lines , to the active stimulation of immigration by offering extraordinary inducements to settlers . Having a vast domain , sparsely settled , but capable of sustaining a population not less dense than that in the northern parts of Europe , the ambition of the conservative statesmen has been to open up the resources of the country and to plant a powerful nation . The liberal criticism of this programme I shall speak of later . At present it is sufficient to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leather , iron , including implements of agriculture , to the extent that they were more than able to supply the Canadian market . As an item , after the abrogation of the reciprocity treaty , the factories of Ontario were able successfully to compete with the United States in the supply of agricultural implements to the great Northwest , and in fact to take the market . I think it can not be denied that the protective tariff did not only build up home industries , but did give an extraordinary stimulus to the general business of the Dominion . Under this policy of development and subsidies the Dominion has been accumulating a debt , which now reaches something over $260 , 000,000 . Before estimating the comparative size of this debt , the statistician wants to see whether this debt and the provincial debts together equal , per capita , the federal and State debts together of the United States . It is estimated by one authority that the public lands of the Dominion could pay the debt , and it is noted that it has mainly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not in offensive or defensive wars . The statistical record of 1887 estimates that the provincial debts added to the public debt give a per capita of $48 88 . The same year the united debts of States and general government in the United States gave a per capita of $32 , but , the municipal and county debts added , the per capita would be $55 . If the unreported municipal debts in Canada were added , I suppose the per capita would somewhat exceed that in the United States . Before glancing at the development and condition of Canada in confederation we will complete the official outline by a reference to the civil service and to the militia . The British government has withdrawn all the imperial troops from Canada except a small garrison at Halifax , and a naval establishment there and at Victoria . The Queen is commander-in-chief of all the military and naval forces in Canada , but the control of the same is in the Dominion Parliament . The general of the military force is a British officer . There are permanent corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to about 950 men , exclusive of officers , and the number is limited to 1000 . There is a royal military school at Kingston , with about 80 cadets . The active militia , December 31 , 1887 , in all the provinces , the whole being under Dominion control , amounted to 38,152 . The military expenditure that year was $1,281,255 . The diminishing military pensions of that year amounted to $35,100 . The reserve militia // qwq interest ; he draws , say , one year 's superannuative allowance , and then dies . His family get nothing at all , not even the two months ' salary they would have had if he had died in service . This is illogical and unjust . If the two and a half per cent . had been put into a life policy , the insurance being undertaken by the government , a decent sum would have been realized at death . A civil service is also established in the provinces . That in Quebec is better organized than the federal ; the government adds to the pension fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half pensions are extended to widows and children . It will be seen that this pension is an essential part of the civil service system , and the method of it is at once a sort of insurance and a stimulation to faithful service . Good service is a constant inducement to retention , to promotion , and to increase of pension . The Canadians say that the systems work well both in the federal and provincial services , and in this respect , as well as in the matter of responsible government , they think their government superior to ours . The policy of the Dominion government , when confederation had given it the form and territory of a great nation , was to develop this into reality and solidity by creating industries , building railways , and filling up the country with settlers . As to the means of carrying out this . the two parties differed somewhat . The conservatives favored active stimulation to the extent of drawing on the future ; the liberals favored what they call a more natural if a slower growth . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective , to build up industries , which is now continued , in their view , as a necessity for raising the revenue needed for government expenses and for the development of the country . The liberals favored a low tariff , and in the main the principles of free-trade . It might be impertinence to attempt to say now whether the Canadian affiliations are with the Democratic or the Republican party in the United States , but it is historical to say that for the most part the Unionists had not the sympathy of the conservatives during our civil war , and that they had the sympathy of the liberals generally , and that the sympathy of the liberals continued with the Republican party down to the Presidential campaign of 1884 . It seemed to the conservatives a necessity for the unity and growth of the Dominion to push railway construction . The liberals , if I understand their policy , opposed mortgaging the future , and would rather let railways spring from local action and local necessity throughout the Dominion . But whatever the policies of parties may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grants of land all the great so-called Dominion railways . The chief of these in national importance , because it crosses the continent , is the Canadian Pacific . In order that I might understand its relation to the development of the country , and have some comprehension of the extent of Canadian territory , I made the journey on this line-3000 miles-from Montreal to Vancouver . The Canadians have contributed liberally to the promotion of railways . The Hand-book of 1886 says that $187,000,000 have been given by the governments ( federal and provincial ) and by the municipalities toward the construction of the 13,000 miles of railways within the Dominion . The same authority says that from 1881 to July , 1885 , the federal government gave $74,500,000 to the Canadian Pacific . The conservatives like to note that the railway development corresponds with the political life of Sir John A. Macdonald , for upon his entrance upon political life in 1844 there were only fourteen miles of railway in operation . The federal government began surveys for the Canadian Pacific road in 1871 , a company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results followed . The government then began the construction itself , and built several disconnected sections . The present company was chartered in 1880 . The Dominion government granted it a subsidy of $25,000,000 and 25,000,000 acres of land , and transferred to it , free of cost , 713 miles of railway which had been built by the government at a cost of about $35,000,000 . In November , 1885 , considerably inside the time of contract , the road was finished to the Pacific , and in 1886 cars were running regularly its entire length . In point of time , and considering the substantial character of the road , it is a marvellous achievement . Subsequently , in order to obtain a line from Montreal to the maritime ports , a subsidy of $186,000 // per annum for a term of twenty years was granted to the Atlantic and Northwest Railway Company , which undertook to build or acquire a line from Montreal vid Sherbrooke , and across the State of Maine to St. John , St. Andrews , and Halifax . This is one of the leased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . The main line , from Quebec to Montreal and Vancouver , is 3065 miles . The leased lines measure 2412 miles , one under construction 112 , making a total mileage of 5589 . Adding to this the lines in which the company 's influence amounts to a control ( including those on American soil to St. Paul and Chicago ) , the total mileage of the company is over 6500 . The branch lines , built or acquired in Quebec , Ontario , and Manitoba , are all necessary feeders to the main line . The cost of the Canadian Pacific , including the line built by the government and acquired ( not leased ) lines , is : Cost of road , $170,689,629 51 ; equipment , $10,570,933 22 ; amount of deposit with government to guarantee three per cent . on capital stock until Au* , ust 17 , 1893 , $10,310,954 75 . Total , $191,571,517 48 . Without going into the financial statement , nor appending the leases and guarantees , any further than to note that the capital stock is $65,000,000 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are $34,999,633 , it is only necessary to say that in the report the capital foots up $112,908,019 . The total earnings for 1885 were $8,368,493 ; for 1886 , $10,081,803 ; for 1887 , $11,606,412 , while the working expenses for 1887 were $8,102,294 . The gross earnings for 1888 are about $14,000,000 , and the net earnings about $4,000,000 . These figures show the steady growth of business . Being a Dominion road , and favored , the company had a monopoly in Manitoba for building roads south of their line and roads connecting with foreign lines . This monopoly was surrendered in 1887 upon agreement of the Dominion government to guarantee 3* per cent . interest on $15,000,000 of the company 's land grant bonds for fifty years . The company has paid its debt to the government , partly by surrender of a portion of its lands , and now absolutely owns its entire line free of government obligations . It has , however , a claim upon the government of something like six million dollars , now in litigation , on portions of the mountain sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not up to the standard guaranteed in the contract with the company . The road was extended to the Pacific as a necessity of the national development , and the present government is convinced that it is worth to the country all it has cost . The liberals ' criticism is that the government has spent a vast sum for what it can show no assets , and that it has enriched a private company instead of owning the road itself . The property is no doubt a good one , for the road is well built as to grades and road-bed , excellently equipped , and notwithstanding the heavy Lake Superior and mountain work , at a less cost than some roads that preceded it . The full significance of this transcontinental line to Canada , Great Britain , and the United States will appear upon emphasizing the value of the line across the State of Maine to connect with St. John and Halifax ; upon the fact that its western terminus is in regular steamer communication with Hong-Kong vid Yokohama ; that the company is building new and swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has granted an annual subsidy of ? 60,000 , and the Dominion one of $15,000 ; that a line will run from Vancouver to Australia ; and that a part of this round-theworld route is to be a line of fast steamers between Halifax and England . The Canadian Pacific is England 's shortest route to her Pacific colonies , and to Japan and China ; and in case of a blockade in the Suez Canal it would become of the first importance for Australia and India . It is noted as significant by an enthusiast of the line that the first loaded train that passe&amp; over its entire length carried British naval stores transferred from Quebec to Vancouver , and that the first car of merchandise was a cargo of Jamaica sugar refined at Halifax and sent to British Columbia . II . We left Montreal , attached to the regular train , on the evening of September 22d . The company runs six through trains a week , omitting the despatch of a train on Sunday from each terminus . The time is six days and five nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Shaughnessy , the manager , who was on a tour of inspection , and took it leisurely , stopping at points of interest on the way . The weather was bad , rainy and cold , in Eastern Canada , as it was all over New England , and as it continued to be through September and October . During our absence there was snow both in Montreal and Quebec . We passed out of the rain into lovely weather north of Lake Superior . Encountered rain again at Winnipeg ; but a hundred miles west of there , on the prairie , we were blessed with as delightful weather as the globe can furnish , which continued all through the remainder of the trip until our return to Montreal , October 12th . The climate just east of the Rocky Mountains was a little warmer than was needed for conifort ( at the time Ontario and Quebec had snow ) , but the air was always pure and exhilarating ; and all through the mountains we had the perfection of lovely days . On the Pacific it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue all winter , with scarcely any snow , were not far off . For mere physical pleasure of living and breathing , I know no atmosphere superior to that we encountered on the rolling lands east of the Rockies . Between Ottawa and Winnipeg ( from midnight of the 22d till the morning of the 25th ) there is not much to interest the tourist , unless he is engaged in lumbering or mining . What we saw was mainly a monotonous wilderness of rocks and small poplars , though the country has agricultural capacities after leaving Rat Portage ( north of Lake of the Woods ) , just before coming upon the Manitoba prairies . There were more new villages and greater crowds of people at the stations than I expected . From Sudhury the company runs a line to the Sault St. Marie to connect with lines it controls to Duluth and St. Paul . At Port Arthur and Fort William is evidence of great transportation activity , and all along the Lake Superior Division there are signs that the expectations of profitable business in lumber and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Division . On the Western , Mountain , and Pacific divisions the company has adopted the 24-hour system , by which A.M. and P.M. are abolished , and the hours from noon till midnight are counted as from 12 to 24 o'clock . For instance , the train reaches Eagle Riv er at 24.55 , Winnipeg at 9.30 , and Brandon at 16.10 . At Winnipeg we come into the real Northwest , and a condition of soil , climate , and political development as different from eastern Canada as Montana is from New England . This town , at the junction of the Red and Assiniboin rivers , in a valley which is one of the finest wheat-producing sections of the world , is a very important place . Railways , built and projected , radiate from it like spokes from a wheel hub . Its growth has been marvellous . Formerly known as Fort Garry , the chief post of the Hudson 's Bay Company , it had in 1871 a population of only one hundred . It is now the capital of the province of Manitoba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vancouver , and has a population of 25,000 : It is laid out on a grand scale , with very broad streets-Main Street is 200 feet wide - has many substantial public and business buildings , street-cars , and electriclights , and abundant facilities for trade . At present it is in a condition of subsided " boom " ; the whole province has not more than 120,000 people , and the city for that number is out of proportion . Winnipeg must wait a little for the development of the country . It seems to the people that the town would start up again if it had more railroads . Among the projects much discussed is a road northward between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba , turning eastward to York Factory on Hudson 's Bay . The idea is to reach a short water route to Europe . From all the testimony I have read as to ice in Hudson 's Bay harbors and in the straits , the short period the straits are open , and the uncertainty from year to year as to the months they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem so to its advocates , and there is no doubt that a portion of the line between the lakes first named would develop a good country and pay . A more ir*portant line - indeed , of the first importance-is built for 200 miles northwest from Portage la Prairie , destined to go to Prince Albert , on the North Saskatchewan . This is the Manitoba and Northwest , and it makes its conndction from Portage la Prairie with Winnipeg over the Canadian Pacific . An antagonism has grown up in Manitoba toward the Canadian Pacific . This arose from the monopoly privileges enjoyed // by it as a Dominion road . The province could build no road with extraterritorial connections . This monopoly was surrendered in consideration of the guarantee spoken of from the government . The people of Winnipeg also say that the company discriminated against them in the matter of rates , and that the province must have a competing outlet . The company says that it did not discriminate , but treated Winnipeg like other towns on the line , having an eye to the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble was that it refused to discriminate in favor of Winnipeg , so that it might become the distributing point of the whole Northwest . Whatever the truth may be , the province grew increasingly restless , and determined to build another road . The Canadian Pacific has two lines on either side of the Red River , connecting at Emerson and Gretna with the Red River branches of the St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba . It has also two branches running westward south of its main line , penetrating the fertile wheat fields of Manitoba . The province graded a third road , paralleling the two to the border and the river , southward from Winnipeg to the border , connecting therewith a branch of the Northern Pacific , which was eager to reach the rich wheat fields of the Northwest . The provincial Red River Railway also proposed to cross the branches of the Canadian Pacific , and connect at Portage Ia Prairie with the Manitoba and Northwest . The Canadian Pacific , which had offered to sell to the province its Emerson branch , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted upon its legal rights and resisted this crossing . Hence the provincial and railroad conflict of the fall of 1888 . The province built the new road , but it was alleged that the Northern Pacific was the real party , and that Manitoba has so far put itself into the hands of that corporation . There can be no doubt that Manitoba will have its road and connect the Northern Pacific with the Saskatchewan country , and very likely will parallel the main line of the Canadian Pacific . But whether it will get from the Northern Pacific the relief it thought itself refused by the Canadian , many people in Winnipeg begin to doubt ; for however eager rival railways may be for new territory , they are apt to come to an understanding in order to keep up profitable rates . They must live . I went down on the southern branch of the Canadian Pacific , which runs west , not far from our border , as far as Boissevain . It is a magnificent wheat country , and already very well settled and sprinkled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacks , and teams loaded with wheat were wending their way from all directions to the elevators on the line . There has been quite an emigration of Russian Mennonites to this region , said to be 9000 of them . We passed near two of their villages-a couple of rows of square unbeautiful houses facing each other , with a street of mud between as we see them in pictures of Russian communes . These people are a peculiar and somewhat mystical sect , separate and unassimilated in habits , customs , and faith from their neighbors , but peaceful , industrious , and thrifty . I shall have occasion to speak of other peculiar immigration , encol4raged by the governments and by private companies . There can be no doubt of the fertility of all the prairie region of Manitoba and Assiniboin . Great heat is developed in the summers , but cereals are liable , as in Dakota , to be touched , as in 1888 , by early frost . The great drawback from Winnipeg on westward is the intense cold of winter , regarded not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . The region , by reason of extra expense for fuel , clothing , and housing , must always be more expensive to live in than , say , Ontario . The province of Manitoba is an interesting political and social study . It is very unlike Ontario or British Columbia . Its development has been , in freedom and self-help , very like one of our Western Territories , and it is like them in its free , independent spirit . It has a spirit to resist any imposed authority . We read of the conflicts between the Hudson 's Bay and the Northwestern Fur companies and the Selkirk settlers , who began to come in in 1812 . Gradually the vast territory of the Northwest had a large number of " freemen , " independent of any company , and of half-breed Frenchmen . Other free settlers sifted in . The territory was remote from the government , and had no facilities of communication with the East , even after the union . The rebellion of 1870-71 was repeated in 1885 , when Rid was called // back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get patents for their lands , and they had many grievances , which they demanded should be redressed in a " bill of rights . " There were aspects of the insurrection , not ' connected with the race question , with which many well-disposed persons sympathized . But the discontent became a violent rebellion , and had to be suppressed . The execution of Rid , which some of the conservatives thought ill-advised , raised a race storm throughout Canada ; the French element was in a tumult , and some of the liberals made opposition capital out of the event . In the province of Quebec it is still a deep grievance , for party purposes partly , as was shown in the recent election of a federal member of Parliament in Montreal . Manitoba is Western in its spirit and its sympathies . Before the building of the Canadian Pacific its communication was with Minnesota . Its interests now largely lie with its southern neighbors . It has a feeling of irritation with too much federal dictation , and frets under the still somewhat undefined relations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen in the railway conflict . Besides , the natural exchange of products between south and north-between the lower Mississippi and the Red River of the North and the northwest prairies - is going to increase ; the north and south railway lines will have , with the development of industries and exchange of various sorts , a growing importance compared with the great east and west lines . Nothing can stop this exchange and the need of it along our whole border west of Lake Superior . It is already active and growing , even on the Pacific , between Washington Territory and British Columbia . For these geographical reasons , and especially on account of similarity of social and political development , I was strongly impressed with the notion that if the Canadian Pacific Railway had not been built when it was , Manitoba would by this time have gravitated to the United States , and it would only have been a question of time when the remaining Northwest should have fallen in . The line of the road is very well settled , and yellow with wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the line , as the railway sections are for the most part still unoccupied ; and there are many thriving villages : Portage la Prairie , from which the Manitoba and Northwestern Railway starts northwest , with a population of 3000 ; Brandon , a busy grain mart , standing on a rise of ground 1150 feet above the sea , with a population of 4000 and over ; Qu'Appelle , in the rich valley of the river of that name , with 700 ; Regina , the capital of the Northwest Territory , on a vast plain , with 800 ; Moosejoy , a market-town toward the western limit of the settled country , with 600 . This is all good land , but the winters are severe . Naturally on the rail we saw little game , except ducks and geese on the frequent fresh-water ponds , and an occasional coyote and prairie-dogs . But plenty of large game still can be found further north . At Stony Mountain , fifteen miles north of Winnipeg , the site of the Manitoba penitentiary , we saw a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going easily fifteen miles an hour . They were captured only thirty-five mil*s north of the prison , where moose are abundant . Colonel Bedson has the only large herd of the practically extinct buffalo . There are about a hundred of these uncouth and picturesque animals , which have a range of twenty or thirty miles over the plains , and are watched by mounted keepers . They were driven in , bulls , cows , and calves , the day before our arrival-it seemed odd that we could order up a herd of buffalo by telephone , but we did-and we saw the whole troop lumbering over the prairie , exactly as we were familiar with them in pictures . The colonel is trying the experiment of crossing them with common cattle . The result is a halfbreed of large size , with heavier hindquarters and less hump than the buffalo , and said to be good beef . The penitentiary has taken in all the convicts of the northwest territory , and there were only sixty-five of them . The institution is a model one in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another for Protestants . All along the line settlers are sifting in , and there are everywhere signs of promoted immigration . Not only is Canada making every effort to fill up its lands , but England is interested in relieving itself of troublesome people . The experiment has been tried of bringing out East - Londoners . These barbarians // of civilization are about as unfitted for colonists as can be . Small bodies of them have been aided to make settlements , but the trial is not very encouraging ; very few of them take to the new life . The Scotch crofters do better . They are accustomed to labor and thrift , and are not a bad addition to the population . A company under the management of Sir John Lister Kaye is making a larger experiment . They have received sections from the government and bought contiguous sections from the railway , so as to have large blocks of land on the road . A dozen settlements are projected . The company brings over laborers and farmers , paying their expenses and wages for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , tools and cattle are supplied , and the men are to begin the cultivation of the soil . At the end of a year they may , if they choose , take up adjacent free government land and begin to make homes for themselves , working meantime on the company land , if they will . By this plan they are guaranteed support for a year at least , and a chance to set up for themselves . The company secures the breaking up of its land and a crop , and the nucleus of a town . The further plan is to encourage farmers , with a capital of a thousand dollars , to follow and settle in the neighborhood . There will then be three ranks  --  the large company proprietors , the farmers with some capital , and the laborers who are earning their capital . We saw some of these settlements on the line that looked promising . About 150 settlers , mostly men , arrived last fall , and with them were sent out English tools and English cattle . The plan looks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proprietor , farmer , and laborer . It would not work in the United States . Another important colonization is that of Icelanders . These are settled to the northeast of Winnipeg and in southern Manitoba . About 10,000 have already come over , and the movement has assumed such large proportions that it threatens to depopulate Iceland . This is good and intelligent material . Climate and soil are so superior to that of Iceland that the emigrants are well content . They make good farmers , but they are not so clannish as the Mennonites ; many of them scatter about in the towns as laborers . Before we reached Medicine Hat , and VOL . LXXVITI. - No. 466-48 beyond that place , we passed through considerable alkaline country - little dried - up lakes looking like patches of snow . There was an idea that this land was not fertile . The Canadian Pacific company have been making several experiments on the line of model farms , which prove the contrary . As soon as the land is broken up and the crust turned under , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat and vegetables . Medicine Hat , on a branch of the South Saskatchewan , is a thriving town . Here are a station and barracks of the Mounted Police , a picturesque body of civil cavalry in blue pantaloons and red jackets . This body of picked men , numbering about a thousand , and similar in functions to the Guardct Civil of Spain , are scattered through the northwest territory , and are the Dominion police for keeping in order the Indians , and settling disputes between the Indians and whites . The sergeants have powers of police justices , and the organization is altogether aa admirable one for the purpose , and has a fine csprit dc corps . Here we saw many Cree Indians , phvsically a creditable-looking race of men and women , and picturesque in their gay blankets and red and yellow paint daubed on the skin without the least attempt at shading or artistic effect . A fair was going on , an exhibition of horses , cattle , and vegetable and cereal products of the region . The vegetables were large and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28th ) untouched by frost in the gardens . These Crees are not on a reservation . They cultivate the soil a little , but mainly support themselves by gathering and selling buffalo bones , and well set-up and polished horns of cattle , which they swear are buffalo . The women are far from a degraded race in appearance , have good heads , high foreheads , and are well-favored . As to morals , they are reputed not to equal the Blackfeet . The same day we reached Gleichen , about 2500 feet above the sea . The land is rolling , and all good for grazing and the plough . This region gets the " Chinook " wind . Ploughing is begun in April , sometimes in March ; in 1888 they ploughed in January . Flurries of snow may be expected any time after October 1st , but frost is not so early as in eastern Canada . A fine autumn is common , and // fine , mild weather may continue up to December . At Dunmore , the station before Medicine Hat , we passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , and Dunmore station is a large coal depot . The morning at Gleichen was splendid ; cool at sunrise , but no frost . Here we had our first view of the Rockies , a long range of snow peaks on the horizon , 120 miles distant . There is an immense fascination in this rolling country , the exhilarating air , and the magnificent mountains in the distance . Here is the beginning of a reservation of the Bh*ckfeet , near 3000 . They live here on the Bow River , and cultivate the soil to a considerable extent , and have the benefit of a mission and two schools . They are the bestlooking race of Indians we have seen , and have most self-respect . We went over a rolling country to Calgary , at an altitude of 3388 feet , a place of some 3000 inhabitants , and of the most distinction of any between Brandon and Vancouver . On the way we passed two stations where natural gas was used , the boring for which was only about 600 feet . The country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junction of the Bow and Elbow rivers , rapid streams as clear as crystal , with a greenish hue , on a small plateau , surrounded by low hills and overlooked by the still distant snow peaks . The town has many good shops , several churches , two newspapers , and many fanciful cottages . We drove several miles out on the McCloud trail , up a lovely valley , with good farms , growing wheat and oats , and the splendid mountains in the distance . The day was superb , the thermometer marking 700 . This is , however , a ranch country , wheat being an uncertain crop , owing to summer frosts . But some years , like 1888 , are good for all grains and vegetables . A few Sarcee Indians were loafing about here , inferior savages . Much better are the Stony Indians , who are settled and work the soil beyond Calgary , and are very well cared for by a Protestant mission . Some of the Indian tribes of Canada are self-supporting . This is true of many of the Siwash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Lytton , on the upper Fraser , I saw a village of the Siwash civilized enough to live in houses , wear our dress , and earn their living by working on the railway , fishing , etc . The Indians have done a good deal of work on the railway , and many of them are still employed on it . The coast Indians are a different race from the plains Indians , and have a marked resemblance to the Chinese and Japanese . The polished carvings in black slate of the Haida Indians bear a striking resemblance to archaic Mexican work , and strengthen the theory that the coast Indians crossed the straits from Asia , are related to the early occupiers of Arizona and Mexico , and ought not to be classed with the North American Indian . The Dominion has done very well by its Indians , of whom it has probably a hundred thousand . It has tried to civilize them by means of schools , missions , and farm instructors , and it has been pretty successful in keeping ardent spirits away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothed by the government . It is doubtful if the plains Indians will ever be industrious . The Indian fund from the sale of their lands has accumulated to , 000,000 . There are 140 teachers and 4000 pupils in school . In 1885 the total expenditure on the Indian population , beyond that provided by the Indian fund , was $1,109,604 , of which $478,038 was expended for provisions for destitute Indians . At Cochrane 's we were getting well into the hills . Here is a large horse and sheep ranch and a very extensive range . North and south along the foot-hills is fine grazing and ranging country . We enter the mountains by the Bow River Valley , and plunge at once into splendid scenery , bare mountains rising on both sides in sharp , varied , and fantastic peaks , snow-dusted , and in lateral openings assemblages of giant summits of rock and ice . The change from the rolling prairie was magical . At Mountain House the Three Sisters were very impressive . Late in the afternoon we came to Banif . Banif will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a judicious plan is formed and adhered to for the development of its extraordinary beauties and grandeur , it will be second to few in attractions . A considerable tract of wilderness about it is reserved as a National Park , and the whole ought to be developed by some master landscape expert . It is in the power of the government and of the Canadian Pacific Company to so manage its already famous curative hot // sulphur springs as to make Banif the resort of invalids as well as pleasure-seekers the year round . This is to be done not simply by established good bathing-places , but by re*ulations and restrictions such as give to the German baths their virtue . The Banif Hotel , unsurpassed in situation , amid magnificent mountains , is large , picturesque , many gabled and windowed , and thoroughly comfortable . It looks down upon the meeting of the Bow and the Spray , which spread in a pretty valley closed by a range of snow peaks . To right and left rise mountains of savage rock ten thousand feet high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandeur . The place is attractive for its climate , its baths , and excellent hunting and fishing . For two days , travelling only by day , passing the Rockies , the Selkirks , and the Gold range , we were kept in a state of intense excitement , in a constant exclamation of wonder and delight . I would advise no one to attempt to take it in the time we did . Nobody could sit through Beethov en 's nine symphonies played continuously . I have no doubt that when carriage roads and foot-paths are made into themountainrecesses , astheywillbe , and little hotels are established in the valleys and in the passes and advantageous sites , as in Switzerland , this region will rival the Alpine resorts . I can speak of two or three things only . The highest point on the line is the station at Mount Stephen , 5296 feet above the sea . The mountain , a bald mass of rock in a rounded cone , rises about 8000 feet above this . As we moved away from it the mountain was hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeding rapidly on the down grade , carrying us away from the base , and we stood upon the rear platform watching the apparent recession of the great mass , when suddenly , and yet deliberately , the vast white bulk of Mount Stephen began to rise over the intervening summit in the blue sky , lifting itself up by a steady motion while one could count twenty , until its magnificence stood revealed . It was like a transformation in a theatre , only the curtain here was lowered instead of raised . The surprise was almost too much for the nerves ; the whole company was awe-strickea . It is too much to say that the mountain " shot up " ; it rose with conscious grandeur and power . The effect , of course , depends much upon the speed of the train . I have never seen anything to compare with it for awakening the emotion of surprise and wonder . The station of Field , just beyond Mount Stephen , where there is a charming hotel , is in the midst of wonderful mountain and glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From there the descent down the caflon of Kickinghorse River , along the edge of precipices , among the snow monarchs , is very exciting . At Golden we come to the valley of the Columbia River and in view of the Selkirks . The river is navigable about a hundred miles above Golden , and this is the way to the mining district of the Kootenay Valley . The region abounds in gold and silver . The broad Columbia runs north here until it breaks through the Selkirks , and then turns southward on the west side of that range . The railway follows down the river , between the splendid ranges of the Selkirks and the Rockies , to the mouth of the Beaver , and then ascends its narrow gorge . I am not sure but that the scenery of the Selkirks is finer than that of the Rockies . One is bewildered by the illimitable noble snow peaks and great glaciers . At Glacier House is another excellent hotel . In savage grandeur , nobility of mountain-peaks , snow ranges , and extent of glacier it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of which is seen from the road , is , I believe , larger than any in Switzerland . There are some thirteen miles of flowing ice ; but the monster lies up in the mountains , like a great octopus , with many giant arms . The branch which we saw , overlooked by the striking snow cone of Sir Donald , some two and a half miles from the hotel , is immense in thickness and breadth , and seems to pour out of the sky . Recent measurements show that it is moving at the rate of twenty inches in twenty - four hours-about the rate of progress of the Mer de Glace . In the midst of the main body , higher up , is an isolated mountain of pure ice three hundred feet high and nearly a quarter of a mile in length . These mountains are the home of the mountain sheep . From this amphitheatre of giant peaks , snow , and glaciers we drop by marvellous loops - wonderful engineering , four apparently different tracks in sight at one time-down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is fertile , and blooming with irrigated farms . We pass a cluster of four lovely lakes , and coast around the great Shuswap Lake , which is fifty miles long . But the traveller is not out of excitement . The ride down the Thompson and Fraser cailons is as amazing almost as anything on the line . At Spence 's Bridge we come to the old government road to the Cariboo gold mines , three hundred miles above . This region has been for a long time a scene of activity in mining and salmon-fishing . It may be said generally of the Coast or Gold range that its riches have yet to be developed . The villages all along these mountain slopes and valleys are waiting for this development . The city of Vancouver , only two years old since the beginnings of a town were devoured by fire , is already an interesting place of seven to eight thousand inhabitants , fast building up , and with many substantial granite and brick buildings , and spreading over a large area . It lies upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the north arm of the Fraser IRiver . The inner harbor is deep and spacious . Burrard Inlet entrance is narrow but deep , and opens into English Bay , which opens into Georgia Sound , that separates the island of Vancouver , three hundred miles long , from the main-land . The round headland south of the entrance is set apart for a public park , called now Stanley Park , and is being improved with excellent driving roads , which give charming views . It is a tangled wilderness of nearly one thousand acres . So dense is the undergrowth , in this moist air , of vines , ferns , and small shrubs , that it looks like a tropical thicket . But in the midst of it are gigantic Douglas firs and a few noble cedars . One veteran cedar , partly decayed at the top , measured fiftysix feet in circumference , and another , in full vigor and of gigantic height , over thirty-nine feet . The hotel of the Canadian Pacific Company , a beautiful building in modern style , is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and service , not excelled by any in Canada , equalled by few anywhere . Vancouver would be a very busy and promising city merely as the railway terminus and the shipping point for Japan and China and the East general ly . But it has other resources of growth . There is a very good country back of it , and south of it all the way into Washington Territory . New Westminster , twelve miles south , is a place of importance for fish and lumber . The immensely fertile alluvial bottoms of the Fraser , which now overflows its banks , will some day be diked , and become exceedingly valuable . Its relations to Washington Territory are already close . The very thriving city of Seattle , having a disagreement with the North Pacific and its rival , Tacoma , sends and receives most of its freight and passengers vi&amp; Vancouver , and is already pushing forward a railway to that point . It is also building to Spokane Falls , expecting some time to be met by an extension of the St. Paul , Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found that many of the emigrants in the loaded trains that we travelled with or that passed us were bound to Washington Territory . It is an acknowledged fact that there is a constant " leakage " of emigrants , who had apparently promised to tarry in Canada , into United States territories . Some of them , disappointed of the easy wealth expected , no doubt return ; but the name of " republic " seems to have an attraction for Old World people when they are once set adrift . We took steamer one afternoon for a five hours ' sail to Victoria . A part of the way is among beautiful wooded islands . Once out in the open , we had a view of our " native land , " and prominent in it the dim , cloud-like , gigantic peak of Mount Baker . Before we passed the islands we were entertained by a rare show of rightwhales . A school of them a couple of weeks before had come down through Behring Strait , and pursued a shoal of fish into this land-locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monsters in sight , spouting up slender fountains , lifting their huge bulk out of water , and diving , with their bifurcated tails waving in the air . They played about like porpoises , apparently only for our entertainment . Victoria , so long isolated , is the most English port of Canada . The town itself does not want solidity and wealth , but it is stationary , and the Canadians elseWhere think slow . It was the dry and dusty time of the year . The environs are broken with inlets , hilly and picturesque ; there are many pretty cottages // and country places in the suburbs ; and one visits with interest the Eskimalt naval station , and the elevated Park , which has a noble coast view . The very mild climate is favorable for grapes and apples . The summer is delightful ; the winter damp , and constantly rainy . And this may be said of all this coast . Of the thirteen thousand population six thousand are Chinese , and they form in the city a dense , insoluble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperous Nanaimo coal mines . The island has abundance of coal , so me copper , and timber . But Vancouver has taken away from Victoria all its importance as a port . The government and Parliament buildings are detached , but pleasant and commodious edifices . There is a decorous British air about everything . Throughout British Columbia the judges and the lawyers wear the gown and band and the horse-hair wig . In an evening trial for murder which I attended in a dingy upper chamber of the Kamloops court-house , lighted only by kerosene lamps , the wigs and gowns of judge and attorneys lent , I confess , a dignity to the administration of justice which the kerosene lamps could not have given . In one of the government buildings is a capital museum of natural history and geology . The educational department is vigorous and effective , and I find in the bulky report evidence of most intelligent management of the schools . It is only by traversing the long distance to this coast , and seeing the activity here , that one can appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian Pacific Railway as a bond of unity , a developer of resources , and a world 's highway . The out-going steamers were crowded with passengers and laden with freight . We met on the way two solid ti*ains , of twenty cars each , full of tea . When the new swift steamers are put on , which are already heavily subsidized by both the English and the Canadian governments , the traffic in both passengers and goods must certainly increase . What effect the possession of such a certain line of communication with her Oriental domains will have upon the English willingness to surrender Canada either to complete independence or to a union with the United States , any political prophet can estimate . It must be added that the Canadian Pacific company are doing everything to make this highway popular as well as profitable . Construction and management show English regard for comfort and safety and order . It is one of the very most agreeable lines to travel over I am acquainted with . Most of it is well built , and defects are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convenient . The first-class carriages are luxurious . The dining-room cars are uniformly well kept , the company hotels are exceptionally excellent ; and from the railway servants one meets with civility and attention . III . I had been told that the Canadians are second-hand Englishmen . No estimate could convey a more erroneous impression . A portion of the people have strong English traditions and loyalties to institutions , but in manner and in expectations the Canadians are scarcely more English than the people of the United States ; they have their own colonial development , and one can mark already with tolerable distinctness a Canadian type which is neither English nor American . This is noticeable especially in the women . The Canadian girl resembles the American in escape from a purely conventional restraint and in self - reliance , and she has , like the English , a wellmodulated voice and distinct articulation . In the cities , also , she has taste in dress and a certain style which we think belongs to the New World . In features and action a certain modification has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater social independence . It is unnecessary to make comparisons , and I only note that there is a Canadian type of woman . But there is great variety in Canada , and in fact a remarkable racial diversity . The man of Nova Scotia is not at all the man of British Columbia or Manitoba . The Scotch in old Canada have made a distinct impression in features and speech . And it may be said generally in eastern Canada that the Scotch element is a leading and conspicuous one in the vigor and push of enterprise and the accumulation of fortune . The Canadian men , as one sees them in official life , at the clubs , in business , are markedly a vigorous , stalwart race , well made , of good stature , and not seldom handsome . This physical prosperity needs to be remembered when // we consider the rigorous climate and the long winters ; these seem to have at least one advantage-that of breeding virile men . The Canadians generally are fond of out-door sports and athletic games , of fishing and hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do . They are , a little less driven by the business goad . Abundant animal spirits tend to make men good-natured and litte quarrelsome . The Canadians would make good soldiers . There was a time when the drinking habit prevailed very much in Canada , and there are still places where they do not put water enough in their grog , but temperance reform has takt*n as strong a hold there as it has in the United States . The feeling about the English is illustrated by the statement that there is not more aping of English ways in Montreal and Toronto clubs and social life than in New York , and that the English superciliousness , or condescension as to colonists , the ultra-English manner , is ridiculed in Canada , and resented with even more warmth than in the United States . The amusing stories of English presumption upon hospitality are current in Canada as well as on this side . All this is not inconsistent with pride in the empire , loyalty to its traditions and institutions , and even a considerable willingness ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative titles . But the underlying fact is that there is a distinct feeling of nationality , and it is increasing . There is not anywhere so great a contrast between neighboring cities as between Quebec , Montreal , and Toronto . Quebec is medkeval , Toronto is modern , Montreal is in a conflict between the two conditions . As the travelling world knows , they are all interesting cities , and have peculiar attractions . Quebec is French , more decidedly so than Toronto is English , and in Montreal the French have a large numerical majority and complete political control . In the Canadian cities generally municipal affairs are pretty much divorced from general party politics , greatly to the advantage of good city government . Montreal has most wealth , and from its splendid geographical position it is the railway centre , and has the business and commercial primacy . It has grown rapidly from a population of 140,000 in 1881 to a population of over 200,000- estimated , with its suburbs , at 250,000 . Were it part of my plan to describe these cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public buildings and public institutions of Montreal , the handsome streets in the Protestant quarter , with their solid , tasteful , and often elegant residences , the many churches , and the almost unequalled possession of the Mountain as a park and resort , where one has one of the most striking and varied prospects in the world . Montreal , being a part of the province of Quebec , is not only under provincial control of the government at Quebec , but it is ruled by the same French party in the city , and there is the complaint always found where the poorer majority taxes the richer and more enterprising minority out of proportion to the benefits the latter receives . Various occasions have produced something like race conflicts in the city , and there are prophecies of more serious ones in the strife for ascendency . The seriousness of this to the minority lies in the fact that the French race is more prolific than any other in the province . Perhaps nothing will surprise the visitor more than the persistence of the French type in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , and language , the French have not only failed to assimilate , but have had hopes - maybe still have - of making Canada French . The French " national " party means simply a French consolidation , and has no relation to the " nationalism " of Sir John Macdonald . So far as the Church and the French politicians are concerned , the effort is to keep the French solid as a political force , and whether the French are liberal or conservative , this is the underlying thought . The province of Quebec is liberal , but the liberalism is of a different hue from that of Ontario . The French recognize the truth that language is so integral a part of a people 's growth that the individuality of a people depends upon maintaining it . The French have escaped absorption in Canada mainly by loyalty to their native tongue , aided by the concession to them of their civil laws and their religious privileges . They owe this to William Pitt . I quote from a contributed essay in the Toronto Week about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // population of Canada was in a position to be converted into an English colony with traces of French sentiment and language , which would have slowly disappeared . But at that date William Pitt the younger brought into the House of Commons two Quebec acts , which constituted two provinces-Lower Canada , with a full provision of French laws , language , and institutions ; Upper Canada , with a reproduction of English laws and social system . During the debate Pitt declared on the floor of the House that his purpose was to create two colonies distinct from and jealous of each other , so as to guard against a repetition of the late unhappy rebellion which had separated the thirteen colonies from the empire . " The French have always been loyal to the English connection under all temptations , for these guarantees have been continued , which could scarcely be expected from any other power , and certainly not in a legislative union of the Canadian provinces . In literature and sentiment the connection is with France ; in religion , with IRome ; in politics England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no prevailing sentiment in favor of annexation to the United States so long as the Church retains its authority , nor would it be favored by the accomplished politicians so long as they can use the solid French mass as a political force . The relegation of the subject of education entirely to the provinces is an element in the persistence of the French type in the province of Quebec , in the same way that it strengthens the Protestant cause in Ontario . In the province of Quebec all the public schools are Roman Catholic , and the separate schools are of other sects . In the council of public instruction the Catholics , of course , have a large majority , but the public schools are managed by a Catholic committee and the others by a Protestant committee . In the academies , model and high schools , subsidized by the government , those having Protestant teachers are insignificant in number , and there are very few Protestants in Catholic schools , and very few Catholics in Protestant schools ; the same is true of the schools of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public instruction of the province of Quebec ( which is translated into English ) shows a vigorous and intelligent attention to education . The general sta tistics give the number of pupils in the province as 219,403 Roman Catholics ( the term always used in the report ) , and 37,484 Protestants . In the elementary schools there are 143,848 Roman Catholics and 30,461 Protestants . Of the ecclesiastical teachers , 868 are Roman Catholics and 8 Protestants ; of the certificated lay teachers , 256 are Roman Catholic and 105 Protestant ; the proportion of schools is four to one . It must be kept in mind that in the French schools it is French literature that is cultivated . In the Laval University , at Quebec , English literature is as purely an ornamental study as French literature would be in Yale . The Laval University , which has a branch in Montreal , is a strong institution , with departments of divinity , law , medicine , and the arts , 80 professors , and 575 students . The institution has a vast pile of buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Besides spacious lecture , assembly rooms , and laboratories , it has extensive collections in geology , mineralogy , botany , ethnology , zoology , coins , a library of 100,000 volumes , in which theology is well represented , but which contains a large collection of works on Canada , including valuable manuscripts , the original MS. of the Journal des J*suitcs , and the most complete set of the Relation des J*suites existing in America . It has also a gallery of paintings , chiefly valuable for its portraits . Of the 62,000 population of Quebec city , by the census of 1881 , not over 6000 were Protestants . By the same census Montreal had 140,747 , of whom 78,684 were French , and 28,995 of Irish origin . The Roman Catholics numbered 103,579 . I believe the proportion has not much changed with the considerable growth in seven years . One is struck , in looking at the religious statistics of Canada , by the fact that the Church of England has not the primacy , and that the so-called independent sects have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of 4,324,810 , given by the census of 1881 , the Protestants were put down at 2,436,554 and the Roman Catholics at 1,791,982 . The larger of the Protestant denominations were , Methodists , 742,981 ; Presbyterians , 676,165 ; Church of England , 574,818 ; Baptists , // sus of 1886 , we get these statistics of the larger sects Presbyterians , 28,406 Church of En* , land , 23,206 ; Methodists , 18,648 ; Roman Catholics , 14,651 ; Mennonites , 9112 ; Baptists , 3296 ; Lutherans , 3131 . Some statistics of general education in the Dominion show the popular interest in the matter . In 1885 the total number of pupils iu the Dominion in public and private schools , was 968,193 , and the average attendance was 555,404 . The total expenditure of the year , not including school buildings , was $9 , 310,745 , and the value of school lands , buildings , and furniture was $25,000,000 . Yet in the province of Quebec , out of the total expenditure of $3,162,416 , only $353,677 was granted by the provincial legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $267,084 was granted by the le*islature . The McGill University at Montreal , Sir William Dawson principal , is a corporation organized under royal charter , which owes its original endowment of land and money ( valued at $120,000 ) to James McGill . It receives rmall grants from the provincial and Dominion governments , but mainly depends upon its own funds , which in 1885 stood at $791,000 . It has numerous endowed professorships and endowments for scholarships and prizes ; among them is the Donalda Endowment for the Higher Education of Women ( from Sir Donald A. Smith ) , by which a special cOurse in separate classes , by university professors , is maintained in the university buildings for women . It has faculties of arts , applied sciences , law , and medicine  --  the latter with one of the most complete anatomical museums and one of the best selected libraries on the continent . It has several colleges affiliated with it for the purpose of conferring university degrees , a model school , and four theological colleges , a Congregational . a Presbyterian , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may supplement their own courses in the university . The professors and students wear the university cap and gown , and morning prayers are read to a voluntary attendance . The Redpath Museum , of geology , mineralo , , y , zoology , and ethnology , has a distinction among museums not only for the size of the collection , but for splendid arrangement and classification . The well-selected library numbers about 30,000 volumes . The whole university is a vigorous educational centre , and its well-planted grounds and fine buildings are an ornament to the city . Returning to the French element , its influence is not only felt in the province of Quebec , but in the Dominion . The laws of the Dominion and the proceedings are published in French and English ; the debates in the Dominion Parliament are conducted indifferently in both languages , although it is observed that as the five years of anyParliamentgoonEnglish is more and more used by the mcmihers , for the French are more likely to learn English than the English are to learn French . Of course the Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman Catholic Church is pretty much coextensive with the language . The system of tithes is legal in provincial law , and tithes can be collected of all Roman Catholics by law . The Church has also what is called the fabrique system ; that is , a method of raising contributions from any district for churches , priests ' houses , and conventual buildings and schools . The tithes and the fabrique assessments make a heavy burden on the peasants . The traveller down the St. Lawrence sees how the interests of religion are emphasized in the large churches raised in the midst of humble villages , and in the great Church establishments of charity and instruction . It is said that the farmers attempted to escape the tithe on cereals by changing to the cultivation of pease , but the Church then decided that pease were cereals . There is no doubt that the French population are devout , and that they support the Church in proportion to their devotion , and that much which seems to the Protestants extortion on the part of the Church is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden is heavy on land that is too cold for the highest productiveness . The desire to better themselves in wages , and perhaps to escape burdens , sends a great many French to New England . Some of them earn money , and return to settle in the land that is dear by tradition and a thousand associations . Many do not return , and I suppose there are over three-quarters of a million of French Canadians now in New England . They go to better themselves , exactly as New-Englanders leave their homes for more productive farms in the // West . The Church , of course , does not encourage this emigration , but does encourage the acquisition of lands in Ontario or elsewhere in Canada . And there has been recently a marked increase of French in Ontario-so marked tbat the French representation in the Ontario Parliament will be increased probably by three members in the next election . There are many people in Canada who are seriously alarmed at this increase of the French and of the Roman Catholic power . Others look upon this fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the Protestant element overwhelming . It is to be noted also that Ontario furnishes Protestant emigrants to the United States in large numbers . It may be that the interchange of ideas caused by the French emigration to New England will be an important make-weight in favor of annexation . Individuals , and even French newspapers , are found to advocate it . But these are at present only surface indications . The political leaders , the Church , and the mass of the people are fairly content with things as they are , and with the provincial autonomy , although they resent federal vetoes , and still make a " cry " of the Rid execution . The French element in Canada may be considered from other points of view . The contribution of romance and tradition is not an unimportant one in any nation . The French in Canada have never broken with their past , as the French in France have . There is a great charm about Quebec  --  its language , its social life , the military remains of the last century . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Canadian literature as too little known to English-speaking Canada . And it is true that literary men have not realized the richness of the French material , nor the work accomplished by French writers in history , poetry , essays , and romances . Quebec itself is at a commercial stand-still , but its uniquely beautiful situation , its history , and the projection of mediawalism into existing institutions make it one of the most interesting places to the tourist on the continent . The conspicuous , noble , and commodious Parliament building is almost the only one of consequence that speaks of the modern spirit . It was the remark of a high Church dignitary that VOL . LXXVIIL-No. 466-49 the object of the French in Canada was the promotion of religion , and of the English , commerce . We can not overlook this attitude against materialism . In the French schools and universities religion is not divorced from education . And even in the highest education , where modern science has a large place ; what we may call the literary side is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric , and in public life the French are distinguished for the graces and charm of oratory . It may be true , as charged , that the public schools of Quebec province , especially in the country , giving special attention to the interest the Church regards as the highest , do little to remove the ignorance of the French peasant . It is our belief that the best Christianity is the most intelligent . Yet there is matter for consideration with all thoughtful men what sort of society we shall ultimately have in states where the common schools have neither religious nor ethical teaching . Ottawa is a creation of the federal government as distinctly as Washington is . The lumber-mills on the Chaudi*re Falls necessitate a considerable town here , for this industry assumes gigantic proportions , but the beauty and attraction of the city are due to the concentration here of political interest . The situation on the bluffs of the Ottawa River is commanding , and gives fine opportunity for architectural display . The group of government buildings is surpassingly fine . The Parliament House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly effective in color and in the perfection of Gothic details , especially in the noble towers . There are few groups of buildings anywhere so pleasing to the eye , or that appeal more strongly to one 's sense of dignity and beauty . The library attached to the Parliament House in the rear , a rotunda in form , has a picturesque exterior , and the interior is exceedingly beautiful and effective . The library , though mainly for Parliamentary uses , is rich in Canadian history , and well up in polite literature . It contains about 90,000 volumes . In the Parliament building , which contains the two fine legislative Chambers , there are residence apartments for the Speakers of the Senate and of the House of Commons and their families where entertainments are given during // the session . The opening of Parliament is an imposing and brilliant occasion , graced by the presence of the GovernorGeneral , who is supposed to visit the Chambers at no other time in the session . Ottawa is very gay during the session , society and politics mingling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds a good deal to the excitement and brilliancy of the Parliamentary proceedings . The growth of the government business and of official life has made the addition necessary of a third department building , and the new one , departing from the Gothic style , is very solid and tasteful . There are tli irteen members of the Privy Council with portfolios , and the volume of public business is attested by the increase of department officials . I believe there are about 1500 men attached to the civil service in Ottawa . It will be seen at once that the federal government , which seemed in a manner superimposed upon the provincial governments , has taken on large proportions , and that there is in Ottawa and throughout the Dominion in federal officials and offices a strengthening vested interest in the continuance of the present form of government . The capital itself , with its investment in buildings , is a conservator of the state of things as they are . The cabinet has many able men , men who would take a leading rank as parliamentarians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish a good quota of the same material . The power of the premier is a fact as recognizable as in England . For many years Sir John A. Macdonald has been virtually the ruler of Canada . He has had the ability and skill to keep his party in power , while all the provinces have remained or become liberal . I believe his continuance is due to his devotion to the national idea , to the development of the country , to bold measures-like the urgency of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction - for binding the provinces together and promoting commercial activity . Canada is proud of this , even while it counts its debt . Sir John is worshipped by his party , especially by the younger men , to whom he furnishes an ideal , as a statesman of bold conceptions and courage . He is disliked as a politician as cordially by the opposition , who attribute to him the same policy of adventure that was attributed to Beaconsfield . Personally he resembles that remarkable man . Undoubtedly Sir John adds prudence to his knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he gets to it has gained him the sobriquet of " Old To-morrow . " He is a man of the world as well as a man of affairs , with a wide and liberal literary taste . The members of government are well informed about the United States , and attentive students of its politics . I am sure that , while they prefer their system of responsible government , they have no sentiment but friendliness to American institutions and people , nor any expectation that any differences will not be adjusted in a manner satisfactory and honorable to both . I happened to be in Canada during the fishery and " retaliation " talk . There was no belief that the " retaliation " threatened was anything more than a campaign measure ; it may have chilled the rapport for the mpment , but there was literally no excitement over it , and the opinion was general that retaliation as to transportation would benefit the Canadian railways . The effect of the moment was that importers made large foreign orders for goods to be sent by Halifax that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishery question is not one that can be treated in the space at our command . Naturally Canada sees it from its point of view . To a considerable portion of the maritime provinces fishing means livelihood , and the view is that if the United States shares in it we ought to open our markets to the Canadian fishermen . Some , indeed , and these are generally advocates of freer trade , think that our fishermen ought to have the right of entering the Canadian harbors for bait and shipment of their catch , and think also that Canada would derive an equal benefit from this ; but probably the general feeling is that these privileges should be compensated by a United States market . The defence of the treaty in the United States Senate debate was not the defence of the Canadian government in many particulars . For instance , it was said that the " outrages " had been disowned as the acts of irresponsible men . The Canadian defence was that the " outra* , es " - that is , the most conspicuous of them which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of them , which excited indignation in the United States , were declared by a // cabinet minister to have no foundation in fact , and after proof of the falsity of the allegations the complainants were not again heard of . Of course it is known that no arrangement made by England can hold that is not materially beneficial to Canada and the United States ; and I believe I state the best judgment of both sides that the whole fishery question , in the hands of sensible representatives of both countries , upon ascertained facts , could be settled between Canada and the United States . Is it not natural that , with England conducting the negotiation , Canada should appear as a somewhat irresponsible litigating party bent on securing all that she can get ? But whatever the legal rights are , under treaties or the law of nations , I am sure that the absurdity of making a casus belli of them is as much felt in Canada as in the United States . And I believe the Canadians understand that this attitude is consistent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States as it is by Canada . The province of Ontario is an empire in itself . It is nearly as large as France ; it is larger by twenty-five thousand square miles than the combined six New England States , with New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Maryland . In its varied capacities it is the richest province in Canada , and leaving out the forests and minerals and stony wilderness between the Canadian Pacific and James Bay , it has an area large enough for an empire , which compares favorably in climate and fertility with the most prosperous States of our Union . The climate of the lake region is milder than that of southern New York , and a considerable part of it is easily productive of superior grapes , apples , and other sorts of fruit . The average yield of wheat , both fall and spring , for five years ending with 1886 , per acre , was considerably above that of our best grain - producing States , from Pennsylvania to the farthest West . The same is true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ontario , and the barley is of a superior quality . On a carefully cultivated farm in York County , for this period , the average was higher than the general in the province , being , of wheat , 25 bushels to the acre ; barley , 47 bushels ; oats , 66 bushels ; pease , 32 bushels . It has no superior as a woolproducing and cattle-raising country . Its water-power is unexcelled ; in minerals it is as rich as it is in timber ; every part of it has been made accessible to market by railways and good highways , which have had liberal government aid ; and its manufactures have been stimulated by a protective tariff . Better than all this , it is the home of a very superior people . There are no better anywhere . The original stock was good , the climate has been favorable , the athletic habits have given them vigor and tone and courage , and there prevails a robust , healthful moral condition . In any company , in the clubs , in business houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical development of the men , and even on the streets of the chief towns with the uncommon number of women who have beauty and that attractiveness which generally goes with good taste in dress . The original settlers of Ontario were 10,000 loyalists , who left New England during and after our Revolutionary war . They went to Canada impoverished , but they carried there moral and intellectual qualities of a high order , the product of the best civilization of their day , the best materials for making a state . I confess that I never could rid myself of the school-boy idea that the terms " British redcoat " and " enemy " were synonymous , and that a " Tory " was the worst character Providence had ever permitted to live . But these people , who were deported , or went voluntarily away for an idea , were among the best material we had in stanch moral traits , intellectual leadership , social position , and wealth ; their crime was superior attachment to England , and utter want of sympathy with the colonial cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to them , at any rate , that Ontario owes its solid basis of character , vigor , and prosperity . I do not quarrel with the pride of their descendants in the fact that their ancestors were U. E. ( United Empire ) loyalists-a designation that still has a vital meaning to them . No doubt they inherit the idea that the revolt was a mistake , that the English connection is better as a form of government than the republic , and some of them may still regard the " Yankees " as their Tory ancestors did . It does not matter . In the development of a century in a new world they are more like us than they are like the English , except in a certain sentiment and in traditions , and in adherence to English gov // erumental ideas . I think I am not wrong in saying that this conservative element in Ontario , or this aristocratical element which believes that it can rule a people better than they can rule themselves , was for a long time an anti-progressive and anti-popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , which they were never accused of using for personal profit in the way of money . But I suppose that the " rule of the best " is only held to-day as a theory under popular suffrage in a responsible government . The population of Ontario in 1886 was estimated at 1,819,026 . For the seven years from 1872-9 the gain was 250,782 . For the seven years from 1879-86 the gain was only 145,459 . These figures , which I take from the statistics of Mr. Archibald Blue , secretary of the Ontario Bureau of Industries , become still more significant when we consider that in the second period of seven years the government had spent more money in developing the railways , in promoting immigration , and raised more money by the protective tariff for the establishing of industries , than in the first . The increase of population in the first period was 17* per cent. ; in the second , only 8*- per cent . Mr. Blue also says that but for the accession by immigration in the seven years 1879-86 the population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1879 . The natural increase , added to theimmigration reported ( 208,000 ) , should have given an increase of 442,000 . There was an increase of only 145,000 . What became of the 297,000 ? They did not go to Manitoba  --  the census shows that . " The lamentable truth is that we are growing men for the United States . " That is , the province is at the cost of raising thousands of citizens up to a productive age only to lose them by emigration to the United States . Comparisons are also made with Ohio and Michigan , showing in them a proportionally greater increase in population , in acres of land under production , in manufactured products , and in development of mineral wealth . And yet Ontario has as great natural advantages as these neighboring States . The observation is also made that in the six years 1873-9 , a period of intense business stringency , the country made decidedly greater progress than in the six years 1879-85 , " a period of revival and boom , and vast expenditure of public money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal ( caused mainly by the increase of Canadian duties on American products ) of the reciprocity treaty in 1866 ( under which an international trade had grown to $70,000,000 annually ) discouraged any annexation sentiment that may have existed , aided the scheme of confederation , and seemed greatly to stimulate Canadian manufactures , and the growth of interior and exterior commerce . We touch here not only political questions active in Canada , but economic problems affecting both Canada and the United States . It is the criticism of the liberals upon the " development " policy , the protective tariff , the subsidy policy of the liberal-conservative party now in power , that a great show of activity is made without any real progress either in wealth or population . To put it in a word , the liberals want unrestricted trade with the United States , with England , or with the world-preferably with the United States . If this caused separation from England they would accept the consequences with composure , but they vehemently deny that they in any way favor annexation because they desire free-trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union , their advantage is said to consist in having free exchange of conimodities with sixty millions of people , spread over a continent . As a matter of fact it seems plain that Ontario would benefit and have a better development by sharing in this large circulation and exchange . Would the State of New York be injured by the prosperity of Ontario ? Is it not benefited by the prosperity of its other neighbor , Penn-sylvania ? Toronto represents Ontario . It is its monetary , intellectual , educational centre , and I may add that here , more than anywhere else in Canada , the visitor is conscious of the complicated energy of a very vigorous civilization . The city itself has grown rapidly-an increase from 86,415 in 1881 to probably 170,000 in 1888-and it is growing as rapidly as any city on the continent , according to the indications of building , manufacturing , railway building , and the visible stir of enterprise . It is a very handsome and agreeable city , pleasant , for one reason , because it covers a large area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . I noticed especially the effect of noble churches , occupying a square-ample grounds that give dignity to the house of God . It ex // tends along the lake about six miles , and runs back about as far , laid out with regularity , and with the general effect of being level , but the outskirts have a good deal of irregularity and picturesqueness . It has many broad , handsome streets and several fine parks ; High Park on the west is extensive , the university grounds ( or Queen 's Park ) are beautiful  --  the new and imposing Parliament Buildings are being erected in a part of its domain ceded for the purpose ; and the Island Park , the irregular strip of an island lying in front of the city , suggests the Lido of Venice . I can not pause upon details , but the town has an air of elegance , of solidity , of prosperity . The well-filled streets present an aspect of great business animation , which is seen also in the shops , the newspapers , the clubs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animation , of hospitality . There are a few delightful old houses , which date back to the New England loyalists , and give a certain flavor to the town . If I were to make an accurate picture of Toronto it would appear as one of the most orderly , well-governed , moral , highly civilized towns on the continentin fact , almost unique in the active elements of a high Christian civilization . The notable fact is that the concentration here of business enterprise is equalled by the concentration of religious and educational activity . The Christian religion is fundamental in the educational system . In this province the public schools are Protestant , the separate schools Roman Catholic , and the Bible has never been driven from the schools . The result as to positive and not passive religious instruction has not been arrived at without agitation . The mandatory regulations of the provincial Assembly are these : Every public and high school shall be opened daily with the Lord 's Prayer , and closed with the reading of the Scriptures and the Lord 's Prayer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scriptures shall be read daily and systematically , without comment or explanation . No pupil shall be required to take part in any religious exercise objected to by parent or guardian , and an interval is given for children of Roman Catholics to withdraw . A volume of Scripture selections made up by clergymen of the various denominations or the Bible may be used , in the discretion of the trustees , who may also order the repeating of the ten commandments in the school at least once a week . Clergymen of any denomination , or their authorized representatives , shall have the right to give religious instruction to pupils of their denomination in the school-house at least once a week . The historical portions of the Bible are given with more fulness than the others . Each lesson contains a continuous selection . The denominational rights of the pupils are respected , because the Scripture must be read without comment or explanation . The state thus discharges its duty without prejudice to any sect , but recognizes the truth that ethical and religious instruction is as necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collate the statistics to show the effect of this upon public morals . I can only testify to the general healthful tone . The schools of Toronto are excellent and comprehensive ; the kindergarten is a part of the system , and the law avoids the difficulty experienced in St. Louis about spending money on children under the school age of six by making the kindergarten age three . There is also a school for strays and truants , under private auspices as yet , which re-enforces the public schools in an important manner , and an industrial school of promise , on the cottage system , for neglected boys . The heads of educational departments whom I met were Christian men . I sat one day with the police magistrate , and saw something of the workings of the Police Department . The chief of police is a gentleman . So far as I could see there was a distinct moral intention in the administration . There are special policemen of high character , with discretionary powers , who seek to prevent crime , to reconcile differences , to suppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erring as well as on the side of the law . The central prison ( all offenders sentenced for more than two years go to a Dominion penitentiary ) is a well-ordered jail , without any special reformatory features . I can not even mention the courts , the institutions of charity and reform , except to say that they all show vigorous moral action and sentiment in the community . The city , though spread over such a large area , permits no horse-cars to run on Sunday . There are no saloons open on Sunday ; there are no beer - gardens or places of entertainment in the suburbs , // and no Sunday newspapers . It is believed that the effect of not running the cars on Sunday has been to scatter excellent churches all over the city , so that every small section has good churches . Certainly they are well distributed . They are large , and fine architecturally ; they are well filled on Sunday ; the clergymen are able , and the salaries are considered liberal . If I may believe the reports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is in matters of education . And I do not see that this interferes with an agreeable social life , with a marked tendency of the women to beauty and to taste in dress . The tone of public and private life impresses a stranger as exceptionally good . The police is free from political influence , being under a commission of three , two of whom are life magistrates , and the mayor . The free-library system of the whole province is good . Toronto has an excellent and most intelligently arranged free public library of about 50,000 volumes . The library trustees make an estimate yearly of the money necessary , and this , under the law , must be voted by the city council . The Dominion government still imposes a duty on books purchased for the library outside of Canada . The educational work of Ontario is nobly crowned by the University of Toronto , though it is in no sense a state institution . It is well endowed , and has a fine estate . The central building is dignified and an altogether noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . It has a university organization , with a college inside of it , a school of practical science , and affiliated divinity schools of several denominations , including the Roman Catholic . There are fine museums and libraries , and it is altogether well equipped and endowed , and under the presidency of Dr. Daniel Wilson , the venerable ethnologist , it is a great force in Canada . The students and officers wear the cap and gown , and the establishment has altogether a scholastic air . Indeed this tradition and equipmentwhich in a sense pervades all life and politics in Canada-has much to do with keeping up the British connection . The conservation of the past is stronger than with us . A hundred matters touching our relations with Canada press for mention . I must not omit the labor organizations . These are in affiliation with those in the United States , and most of them are international . The plumbers , the bricklayers , the stone-masons and stone-cutters , the Typographical Union , the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners , the wood-carvers , the Knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in Canada ; the railway conductors , with delegates from all our States , held their conference in Toronto last summer . The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners is a British association , with head-quarters in Manchester , but it has an executive committee in New York , with which all the Canadian and American societies communicate , and it sustains a periodical in New York . The Society of Amalgamated Engine Builders has its office in London , but there is an American branch , with which all the Canadian societies work in harmony . The Cigar-makers ' Union is American , but a strike of cigar-makers in Toronto was supported by the American ; so with the plumbers . It may he said generally that the societies each side the line will sustain each other . The trade organizations are also taken up by women , and these all affiliate with the United States . When a " National " union affiliates with one on the other side , the name is changed to ' International . " This union and interchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best information , and notwithstanding the denial of some politicians , the Canadian unions have love and sympathy for and with America . And this feeling must be reckoned with in speaking of the tendency to annexation . The present much-respected mayor of Toronto is a trade-unionist , and has a seat in the local parliament as a conservative ; he was once arrested for picketing , or some such trade-union performance . I should not say that the trades-unions are in favor of annexation , but they are not afraid to discuss it . There is in Toronto a society of a hundred young men , the greater part of whom are of the artisan class , who meet to discuss questions of economy and politics . One of their subjects was Canadian independence . I am told that there is among young men a considerable desire for independence , accompanied with a determination to be on the best terms with the United States , and that as between a connection with Great // Britain and the United States , they would prefer the latter . In my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States is general in Canada ; the desire for independence is not . The frequency of the question , " What do you think of the future of Canada ? " shows that it is an open question . Undeniably the confederation , which seems to me rather a creation than a growth , works very well , and under it Canada has stead- , ily risen in the consideration of the world and in the development of the sentiment of nationality . But there are many points unadjusted in the federal and provincial relations ; more power is desired on one side , more local autonomy on the other . The federal right of disallowance of local legislation is resisted . The stated distribution of federal money to the provinces is an anomaly which we could not reconcile with the public spirit and dignity of the States , nor recognize as a proper function of the government . The habit of the provinces of asking aid from the central government in emergencies , and getting it , does not cultivate self-reliance , and the grant of aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be a growing embarrassment . The French privileges in regard to laws , language , and religion make an insoluble core in the heart of the confederacy , and form a compact mass which can be wielded for political purposes . This element , dominant in the province of Quebec , is aggressive . I have read many alarmist articles , both in Canadian and English periodicals , as to the danger of this to the rights of Protestant communities . I lay no present stress upon the expression of the belief by intelligent men that Protestant communities might some time be driven to the shelter of the wider toleration of the United States . No doubt much feeling is involved . I am only reporting a state of mind which is of public notoriety ; and I will add that men equally intelligent say that all this fear is idle ; that , for instance , the French increase in Ontario means nothing , only that the habitant can live on the semisterile Laurentian lands that others can not profitably cultivate . In estimating the idea the Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface indications . One can go to Canada and get almost any opinion and tendency he is in search of . Party spirit-though the newspapers are in every way , as a rule , less sensational than ours-runs as high and is as deeply bitter as it is with us . Motives are unwarrantably attributed . It is always to be remembered that the opposition criticises the party in power for a policy it might not essentially change if it came in , and the party in power attributes designs to the opposition which it does not entertain : as , for instance , the opposition party is not hostile to confederation because it objects to the " developnment " policy or to the increase of the federal debt , nor is it for annexation because it may favor unrestricted trade or even commercial union . As a general statement it may be said that the liberalconservative party is a protection party , a " development " party , and leans to a stronger federal government ; that the liberal party favors freer trade , would cry halt to debt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Even the two parties are not exactly homogeneous . There are conservatives who would like legislative union ; the liberals of the province of Quebec are of one sort , the liberals of the province of Ontario are of another , and there are conservativeliberals as well as radicals . The interests of the maritime provinces are closely associated with those of New England ; popular votes there have often pointed to political as well as commercial union , but the controlling forces are loyal to the confederation and to British connection . Manitoba is different in ori* , in , as I pointed out , and in temper . It considers sharply the benefit to itself of the federal domination . My own impression is that it would vote pretty solidly against any present proposition of annexation , but under the spur of local grievances and the impatience of a growth slower than expected there is more or less annexation talk , and one newspaper of a town of six thousand people has advocated it . Whether that is any more significant than the same course taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know . As to unrestricted trade , Sir John Thompson , the very able Minister of Justice in Ottawa , said in a recent speech that Canada could not permit her financial centre to be shifted to Washington and her tariff to be made there ; and in this he not only touched the heart of the difficulty of an arrangement , but spoke , I believe , the prevailing sentiment of Canada . // As to the future , I believe the choice of a strict conservatism would be , first , the government as it is ; second , independence ; third , imperial federation : annexation never . But imperial federation is generally regarded as a wholly impracticable scheme . The liberal would choose , first , the framework as it is , with modifications ; second , independence , with reer trade ; third , trust in Providence , without fear . It will be noted in all these varieties of prelection that separation from England is calmly contemplated as a definite possibility , and I have no doubt that it would be preferred rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I must express the belief that , underlying all other thought , unexpressed , or , if expressed , vehemently repudiated , is the idea , widely prevalent , that some time , not now , in the dim future , the destiny of Canada and the United States will be one . And if one will let his imagination run a little , he can not but feel an exultation in the contemplation of the majestic power and consequence in the world such a nation would be , bounded by three oceans and the Gulf , united under a restricted federal head , with free play for the individuality of every State . If this ever comes to pass , the tendency to it will not be advanced by threats , by unfriendly legislation , by attempts at conquest . The Canadians are as high-spirited as we are . Any sort of union that is of the least value could only come by free action of the Canadian people , in a growth of business interests undisturbed by hostile sentiment . And there could be no greater calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-speaking interest in the world , than a collision . Nothing is to be more dreaded for its effect upon the morals of the people of the United States than any war with any taint of conquest in it . There is no doubt with many an honest preference for the colonial condition . I have heard this said : " We have the best government in the world , a responsible government , with entire local freedom . England exercises no sort of control ; we are as free as a nation can be . We have in the representative of the crown a certain conservative tradition , and it only costs us ten thousand pounds a year . We are free , we have little expense , and if we get into any difficulty there is the mighty power of Great Britain behind us ! " It is as if one should say in life , I have no re sponsibilities ; I have a protector . Perhaps as a " rebel , " I am unable to enter into the colonial state of mind . But the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was never a nation great until it came to the knowledge that it had nowhere in the world to go for help . In Canada to-day there is a growing feeling for independence ; very little , taking the whole mass , for annexation . Put squarely to a popular vote , it would make little show in the returns . Among the minor causes of reluctance to a union are distrust of the government of the United States , coupled with the undoubted belief that Canada has the better government ; dislike of our quadrennial elections ; the want of a system of civil service , with all the turmoil of our constant official overturning ; dislike of our sensational and irresponsible journalism , tending so often to recklessness ; and dislike also , very likely , of the very assertive spirit which has made us so rapidly subdue our continental possessions . But if one would forecast the future of Canada , he needs to take a wider view than personal preferences or the agitations of local parties . The railway development , the Canadian Pacific alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political situation . It has brought together the widely separated provinces , and has given a new impulse to the sentiment of nationality . It has produced a sort of unity which no act of Parliament could ever create . But it has done more than this : it has changed the relation of England to Canada . The Dominion is felt to be a much more important part of the British Empire than it was ten years ago , and in England within less than ten years there has been a revolution in colonial policy . With a line of fast steamers from the British Islands to Halifax , with lines of fast steamers from Vancouver to Yokohama , Hong - Kong , and Australia , with an all-rail transit , within British limits , through an empire of magnificent capacities , offering homes for any possible British overflow , will England regard Canada as a weakness ? It is true that on this continent the day of dynasties is over , and that the people will determine their own place . But there are great commercial forces at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Canada for a long time on her present line of development in a British connection .
