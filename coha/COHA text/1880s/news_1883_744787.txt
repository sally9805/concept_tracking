txt The Presidential insect is buzzing again under the hat of the Hon. STEPHEN J. FIELD , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , who has already blown one gentle blast out of his trumpet . No one would blow it for him . For months he has been forced to hear the praises of , the " old ticket , " HOLMAN , and other Democrats of more or less eminence , but never has the name of FIELD fallen upon his longing ear . From his lofty and secluded station on the Supreme Bench he has eagerly scanned the country from ocean to ocean and from the lakes to the gulf for some sign of a popular demand for FIELD . But no sign has gladdened his eye . " Can it be , " he has cried , " that they , have forgotten me ? I must remind them that I still live and still long to move from Capitol Hill to the White Rouse . I will write a letter to a friend . " Judge FIELD has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been published . In it he tells . his friend , a gentleman of Virginia , many things which that gentleman already knew . " You know , " he says , " that my candidacy in 1880 was not of my own seeking , " and in setting forth the articles of his political creed he prefaces each statement by the assertion that the Virginia gentleman already knows what he is about to say . Some captious persons may ask why a learned Judge should undertake to tell a friend what , as he admits , that friend knows so well . It is very plain , of course , that the letter is a bid for delegates ' votes instead of a piece of private correspondence . Judge FIEI4D remembers that nearly all of the 65 votes that were cast for him at Cincinnati came from the South , and therefore he tells his intelligent friend how he longs to do something for that part of the country . He would have a system of levees along the banks of the Mississippi , " built in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would treat the Southern States " on terms of equality , " and lead the Southern people to feel " that they are a part and parcel of the Nation . " He would call Southern men into the national councils , and give them an equal share of national " emoluments . " He would advocate a return of the " unjust cotton tax . " He would do all sorts of things to bring about a " reconciliation " and to make the North and the South " one people . " The tone of his letter leads one to suppose that he regards the North and the South as still warring against/ each other and in sore need of a peacemaker . He also advocates a reorganization of the judicial system of the Nation , and touches upon the tariff . " You know also , " he writes to his knowing friend , " that while favoring a careful revision of our tariff , I would not at once make such changes in it as would derange and disturb the business of the country ; that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenue , incidental protection may be given to our industries . " This is the Judge 's platform , which his friend has , with admirable indiscretion , given to the public . By this ho fondly hopes to awaken in the minds of Southern politicians the slumbering memories of his band-wagon canvass at Cincinnati three years ago . And in the course of time this unwilling candidate will have the old biographies with which he filled the paes of Cincinnati newspapers during the sessions of that memorable convention rewritten and brought down to date , the faded posters on which his rare qualities were blazoned forth will be retouched , the same old bands will be hired , and the same blundering agents will be employed to make him ridiculous . It is a melancholy spectacle . A Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States who has held this high judicial office for twenty years throws aside his robe and bargains for the favor of politicians . " Give me your votes , make me President , and I will do all in my power to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indestructible levees for the protection of your farms : I will take your representative men into my Cabinet ; your share of the ' emoluments ' shall be equal to that of the North , and I will strive to put back In your hands nearly $70,000,000 of cotton taxes . " Is not this man trying to " drive a bargain " for the highest office in the Nation ? The people of the United States can not regard with pleasure and satisfaction this proof that a Judge who sits in their highest court has been unable to fling away political ambition or to avoid the expedients of the most unscrupulous office  --  seeker .
