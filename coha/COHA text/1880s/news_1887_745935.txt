txt In our news columns is printed an analysis of the reports of the surface railroad . companies in this city . The analysis is made in order to test the feasibility of the proposition that has been . made for a reduction of fares on these roads to three cents , in order to meet the reduction to five on the elevated roads . It seems clear not only from the statements of the managers of all the lines , but from the figures themselves , that that reduction can not be effected . Upon all the lines , with one exception , the cost of carrying passengers , for operating expenses alone , excluding the taxes and interest on the bonded debt , was at a higher rate than that to which it is proposed to reduce the fare . Upon these lines the average cost is something over three cents and a half . The exception is furnished by the Third-Avenue Road , which includes its " income taxes " with its operating expenses , and . thus raises the cost of carrying a passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles during the year . That is to say , the business of carrying passengers can not be done for less than four cents except at a loss , while the additional cent in the fare actually charged very nearly represents the profit . The cost of carrying passengers on the Brooklyn roads is considerably over four cents . The difference is no doubt mainly to be accounted for by the fact that a larger proportion of the business of the Brooklyn roads is what may be called through traffic , the carrying of passengers from the water front or near it to remote parts of the city . The most profitable business for a surface road is well known to be furnished by the passengers who ride short distances . These are upon some roads changed so frequently that a car in going over its route may carry two or three times as many ' passengers it could hold at one time . The most profitable line in this respect is undoubtedly the Broadway ; but . the report of this road . is rendered almost unintelligible by the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called funded debt , and is in fact merely the plunder which was secured by SHARP , and of which a small part was " diffused generally " in buying Aldermen and hiring lawyers . The report of-the ThirdAvenue Road is misleading for a different reason . The inroads made ttpon the surface roads by the elevated . have been more serious in this road than in any other . and during the period covered by the report its receipts were seriously affected by the strike , with the boycott that accompanied and followed the strike . The Second-avenue line shows an actual gain of traffic , although it is upon this avenue that the reduction of fare on the elevated first took effect . In compensation it was to this road that much of the surface traffic went which was diverted by the strike from Third-avenue , although the Fourth-avenue line gained almost exactly as many passengers as the Third-avenue line lost . The most curious fact shown by a compilation of the reports is the slight extent to which the reduction of elevated fares seems - to have affected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its falling off is largely due to the strike , though no one knows how largely . Its loss is not far from 15 per cent . It seems safe to predict that another year will show a better result . The falling off on the Sixthavenue was due to the competition , partly of the Broadway line and ? partly of the elevated at the old rates of fare . It amounted . at the date of the report to less than 112 per cent. , though this was the last road on which the fare by the elevated was reduced , and the next report will not be so favorable . The Second and Ninth avenue roads show an actual increase , inthe face of the competition . ** ; the former the increase is in part duo , as we have seen , to special and transient causes ; but on neither is there reason to apprehend any disastrous loss of business . It is dangerous to be too positive in drawing deductions from figures reported at the end . of last September , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any of the surface roads . From the reports and from what has come to light since there is little danger , however , in predicting ' that while the roads that come most directly into competition with the elevated roads will make somewhat less money than they made before , a handsome profit will still be ' left to their stockholders . They have no occasion to resort ? to lowering their fares , or to any other desperate expedient to retain their business .
