TIlE DESPOTISM OF PARTY . A OThEAT variety of recent events have combined to obscure the old and correct notion of a political party , and to substitute for it something radically different and vastly more dangerous . There has been for several years a visible tendency , both in the habits of speech and in the acts of legislation , to regard parties as actual corporations , susceptible of legal definition , endowed for certain purposes with what lawyers call a juridical personality ; not indeed exactly capable of sueing and being sued , but stopping only just short of that , and in many other respects entitled to claim the same protection from the laws , and to enforce the same obedience from the minority to the majority , // as is enforced in the case of all legally organized joint-stock companies . A slight variation from this theory is the one which prefers to compare a party to a church , and to exact of every person who at any time acts with it a rigid subscription to certain articles of faith . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears ; for since the ecclesiastical view of party adopts also the modern spirit of religious liberality , political cr*eds are generally made broad or vague enough to offer an asylum to nearly every class of believers . It is therefore chiefly in enforcing support of nominations , or obedience to duly constituted party authorities , that the iron rigor of the new system becomes most obnoxious . There are many objections to this system , and they will appear in the course of the present article . As a preliminary text , it may be said at the outset that it places parties above the state , or at least above the community ; and , in doing this , renders them also less efficient for the fulfillment of their true mission . The definition of party by the lexicographers is of very little benefit to the discussion . With slight variation of language , they agree substantially in de . fining a party as a part or portion of a community , less than the whole , united in the support of some principle or in the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , though not exclusively so , of political parties . In order to find the authoritative definition of a political party , it is necessary to search the declarations of eminent men who have been party leaders . Edmund Burke is perhaps the man who has announced in his writings and illustrated in his life the most correct notions of the nature of party and of party obligations . It could less fairly be said of him than of many of his contemporaries that he gave up to party what was meant for mankind . But it is also not true that he utterly ignored the advantage , and within certain limits the sanctity , of party ties , and was a mere freebooter in the field of politics . " Party , " he says , in the Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents , which Mr. John Morley calls the pamphlet where he exhibited for the first time , on a conspicuous scale , the strongest qualities of his understanding , - " party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all agreed . For my part , I find it impossible to conceive that any one believes in his own polities , or thinks them of any weight , who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced to practice . . . . Therefore every honorable connection will avow it is their first purpose to pursue every just method to put the men who hold their opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution with all the power and authority of the state . " The agreement on certain principles or policies thus precedes the formation of the party which is to apply them in legisla. tion . Nothing could have been more repulsive to Burke 's political philosophy than the theory that a party is above its own doctrines , or even needs no doctrines ; or that , being already organized , it can lay in a stock of principles , as a merchant does his wares The further assumption that a man can be enrolled in a party as in a regiment , and be forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , is one which he would have been quite unable even to comprehend . Daniel Webster is another statesman who , like Burke , adhered , through the best years of his life , to the party with which he began his career . What is called his final apostasy was , indeed , in a merely partisan aspect , less offensive than that of Burke ; for he simply foresaw the disruption of the Whig party , // owing to the differences of opinion among the members in regard to the question of slavery , and prepared to follow one section rather than the other . It can not , therefore , be said that he deserted the Whig party , for at the time there practically was no Whig party . Yet no man in the long list of American statesmen has left on record stronger protests against the dangers of excessive party spirit . In the Declaration of Whig Principles and Purposes , ( lraf ted by Mr. Webster , and put forth in 1840 , it is affirmed that " party spirit , when it gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substitute party for country , to seek no ends but party ends , no approbation but party approbation , and to fear no reproach or contumely so that there be no party dissatisfaction , not only alloys the true enjoyment of our institutions , but weakens , every day , the foundations on which they stand . " Again , in a speech before a Whig convention at Valley Forge , in 1844 , Mr. Webster said , " When party spirit carries men so far that they will not inquire into men and measures that are placed before them for their sanction and support , but will only inquire to what party the men belong , or what party recommends the measures , that is a state of things which is dangerous to the stability of a free government . " These declarations are signifi. cant , not less on account of the man who made them , than of the occasions on which they were made . They were not ingenious sophisms , by which a traitor to a party sought to excuse his treachery , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a recognized party leader before conventions of a party ; and one of them was even embodied in the party 's address to the country . If now the great Whig leader could safely announce such doctrines before members of his own organization , and even cause their adoption by a repre sentative meeting of the party , it follows , of course , that he would permit himself at least equal freedom on occasions of a less formal character , and in mere academical discourses . It will be found that this was the case . In the Eulogy of Washington Mr. Webster refers with approval to the grave admonitions of the Farewell Address , and mentions the danger that through the excess of party spirit " the government itself may become nothing but organized party . " Nothing but organized party ! These words , which were apparently thrown out only as a patriotic warning against the evils of excessive partisanship , have been transformed by the course of events almost into an inspired prophecy . The danger that organized party will , in authority at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influence in political affairs , eventually supersede organized government has been steadily increasing for many years , and has now assumed proportions at which the thoughtful citizen may well be appalled . The need of parties , as human nature is now constituted , and as political affairs are conducted in every free government , is conceded by nearly all writers and observers . By none is the admission made more frankly than by the two illustrious statesmen whom I have just quoted . It is also evident that some form of organization is essential to every party ; and that , other things being equal , the party which has the best organization has also the best chances of success . But there are many methods of effecting this object , and the method adopted in a particular case , though it may be from one point of view singularly calculated to insure success , is not necessarily evidence that success is deserved . The very perfection of the organization may , on thc contrary , show that the triumph of the party has been placed before the triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a want of confidence in those principles , or the absence of any principles whatever , has made the party dependent for victory upon the rigor and vigilance of its discipline , and upon the skill with which it can hold together the voters who on other occasions have given it their support . Party organization has taken many forms in the course of ages , and still has different forms in existing states . In England , the couniry which has the longest and most brilliant record of government by parties , this organization has always been and still is extremely loose . It is true that strenuous efforts are now making to repair this supposed defect . Mr. Chamberlain is an ardent advocate of the introduction of the American caucus system into English politics ; and from the opposite side Lord Randolph Churchill is trying to knit the conservatives into a close corporation , which he or some other leader shall control by the mere force of numbers . But these efforts have not as yet met with resplendent success . Any sympathetic American would counsel against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the instincts and traditions of English political life . To Englishmen a party stands simply for a policy or a set of measures supported by a cabinet and a majority of the House of Commons , or by another group of leaders and a minority of the I-louse of Commons opposed to that policy or to those measures . It is indeed the voters who make the majority or the minority , the government or the opposition . But after a general election has been held the scene of party divisions is transferred to Parliament ; and while her majesty 's opposition has clearly defined constitutional duties , like those of her majesty 's government , it is as responsible members of Parliament , and not as representatives of a party . The usage on the Continent is somewhat different , and is a species of compromise between the English and the American systems . In France and Germany the term party is rarely extended to the voters at the polls . It means a group of representatives within the legislature , who are united with nearly the firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a party , it is not enough that a deputy act with it usually , or even always ; he must solemnly announce his adhesion , and inscribe himself , as the French say , on the roll . The attitude of such groups toward peiiding measures is determined by formal conferences , which are strictly legislative caucuses , arid the decision of the majority is enforced with a degree of stringency unknown even in America . These groups make their own platforms , issue addresses to the voters , point with pride to their achievements , and arraign the records of their opponents . They are a conspicuous part of the parliamentary machine , and are regularly announced in the official manuals . But outside the legislative halls they have hardly any recognized existence . A dissolution puts an end to them ; and when , after a general election , a new Parliament meets , and the members again crystallize into groups , different combinations , and perhaps even strange names , may appear . It is evident now that neither of these systems , neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely organized machine . To our professional politicians they must look crude , clumsy , inefficient ; worthy only of a people still in the infancy of selfgovernment , and fatally defective in their neglect of the people . Yet an almost equal looseness of organization characterized American parties in what were at least not the worst days of the republic . In the time of Adams and Hamilton and Jefferson , a party meant the supporters of a distinct set of principles , formulated , represented , and advocated by a few statesmen , who for the most part were in public office , and were // instinctively accepted as leaders ; while it was only by gradual steps , by a really striking process of evolution , that we reached the system under which the great parties now conduct their affairs . The mechanical perfection of that system must be admitted . The parts are adjusted with the greatest nicety , and work , from the primary up to the national convention , with a precision , an ease , a docility , which would fill the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unsurpassed . But it is also unsurpassed as a device for stifling discuss ion , for fostering intrigue , for depressing talent and elevating mediocrity , for crushing all spontaneity out of political life , and reducing what ought to be the vigorous , healthy , buoyant action of a free people to a base procession of mathematical factors . From such laborious efforts to perfect the mere mechanical organization of party must result , as a natural consequence , a grossly exaggerated view of the sacredness of party itself . The party becomes a species of imperium in imperio . Its forms , its agents , its organs , are closely patterned after those of the state ; it exercises the three great functions of government ; it has its hierarchy of officials , acting within the circumscriptions , and ranging through all the grades which obtain in our political system . These officials feel the responsibility of their positions , which they compare to places of trust in civil administration . The struggles for place within the party are scarcely less keen than the struggles of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used ; the same acquiescence in the result of a contest is always expected , and rarely withheld . Thus the force of imagination alone , excited by the constant spectacle of this vast machine , completely equipped and manned and always in movement , leads people to regard it as a permanent institution , having a corporate existence in the state , and therefore entitled to be treated as an end in itself , and not as means to the attainment of an end . It is not , however , by the imagination alone that this illusion is maintained . This of itself would make the error dangerous ; but it has , besides that , led to the announcement of certain audacious propositions , and even to measures of actual legislation , which grossly confuse the distinction between a political party and a political commonwealth , and disclose a fatal tendency toward the very evil against which Mr. Webster so solemnly warned his countrymen . The most obnoxious of the new doctrines which are thrusting themselves upon public recognition concerns what may be called the discipline of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of members toward it . The doctrine flows easily from the fiction which compares a party to a state . In a state with democratic institutions the majority rules ; and the minority must obey the officers whom it chooses , and respect the laws which it enacts . Any other system is absurd in thought , and would lead to chaos . But this principle of democratic fairness is capable of a wide application . It is recognized in the most varied concerns of human society ; wherever , in fact , a body of men meet to deliberate upon common interests , and to express their views in some authoritative and binding form . Everywhere the majority prevails , and the minority acquiesces . This , it is said , should also be the case with a party . In the management of its affairs , in the attitude which it is to take toward pending public measures , in the choice of its leaders , the decision of the majority should be final , and the minority should accept it with perfect loyalty and good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cogency almost axiomatic , will be found on examination to be not only fallacious , but even absolutely irreconcilable with the true notion of party . // A party is a body of men united in support of a political principle , or set of principles , in which they all believe . This is an accepted definition , which no one will contest . It follows , then , that a body of men , in which a majority forces upon a minority adhesion to , or at least a formal acquiescence in , doctrines or policies opposed to its convictions , may be indeed legitimate and useful within its sphere , but is not a party . Nor is it necessary to my point that the definition above given be taken in a rigid and inflexible sense . It may be freely conceded that when a party is united upon some one great political principle , or some general view of governmental policy , much freedom of opinion upon minor points of political belief may be allowed , without robbing the association of the main quality which determines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this liberality becomes an utter indifference to any political convictions ; or , on the other hand , when , on any division of opinion , an attempt is made to coerce the minority by the majority . An illustration of this truth is offered in the history of the Whig party . So long as the party was contending mainly for protection it could properly tolerate among its members different views on the question of slavery . But when this question became the leading issue , it was impossible for the majority to force its views upon the minority , or for the party to keep up its formal organization by ignoring the real problem of the hour . The Whig party met , therefore , a natural death , because the elements which composed it bad become so inharmonious that it ceased to be a party . The case is scarcely less strong in regard to the choice of candidates and leaders . Many persons will indeed say , though without sufficient reflection , that , while the principles of a party ought to be shared by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to repre sent and advocate them ought to be left to the majority . But this theory overlooks the fact that men stand for principles , and that each member of a party must exercise his own judgment , if not in regard to the success with which a proposed leader is likely to support them , at least in regard to the sincerity with which he holds them . A party may indeed be formed about and be held together by the name of some great leader , instead of by a measure . Some organizations of this kind have been among the most powerful in history . But would it not be absurd to insist that the question of leadership should be submitted each year to the vote of the members , and that the minority should accept any new leader whom the majority might choose , even one of opinions radically opposed to those of the man who originally gave the party its name and character ? Could the party , after such a revolution , be said still to preserve its identity ? But the sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai ' - gument . It is asked , in a tone which suggests that there can be only a single answer , whether every member of a party has not a right to a voice in the selection of candidates , and whether , if so , the choice of the majority ought not to prevail . Is any other system compatible with popular government ? This has undeniably a very plausible and convincing look . Yet the interests of truth , of sound political thought , and of correct political methods require that it be met with an emphatic denial . The theory is as false as it is deceptive , and as mischievous as it is false . It could never even be entertained if the true conception of party were kept in view . There is no such thing as the right of the people to participate in the nomination of candidates . Under our present system they may of course exercise such a participation ; but it is not a right , adds nothing whatever to the validity of // the nomination , and affects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The right of universal suffrage begins only at the polls , and refers to the choice between , not the choice of , candidates . Indeed , to make it begin at the stage of nominations may in practice actually impair its exercise at the polls . If the nomination of a candidate by the popular suffrage of a party has the binding validity which is claimed for it , a member of the minority , who , because he concedes this validity , or has a mistaken sense of honor , or fears some kind of persecution or proscription , supports against his conscientious convictions a candidate thus nominated , is really not a voter at the polls . He is rather under a most degrading species of coercion . Thus , in order to force the principle of universal suffrage into a sphere where it does not belong , politicians strike a deadly blow at its freedom and purity in the realm where it ought to reign supreme and be preserved immaculate . There is , also , sometbing disingenuous in the form which is commonly given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asked whether every man has not a right to a voice in behalf of the candidate whom he wisbes to support . One answer to this is that the laws give him such a right at the polls , and protect him in the exercise of it . But a better answer is that the question does not correctly describe the right for which the advocates of the present system really contend . What they demand is , not that each member of a party shall be heard in behalf of the candidate whom he wishes to support , but that he shall , in certain contingencies , be permitted to name a candidate whom somebody else shall be obliged to support . This , stripped of all disguise , is what the proposition means , and it would not be easy to imagine anything more iniquitous . The summit and crowning achievement of the American party system is , of course , the national convention . The party being regarded as a body politic , the convention becomes an official legislature , with officers , rules of order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is pronounced , even by the most strenuous champions of its dignity , to be a deliberative body . Yet it has nearly lost this characteristic . It is always largely composed of men whose opinions are mortgaged , or who are merely the clerical bearers of instructed votes , or who , if unpledged and uninstructed , can still l ) e influenced by no arguments more cogent than numbers and combinations . Many of the conventions in recent years have been perfectly useless formalities . The result could have been ascertained and made known by telegraph , without any meeting of the delegates . From this fact the friends of independent politics might indeed derive a legitimate though selfish and narrow advantage , since a convention which excludes deliberation , and is controlled by mere brute force , unreflecting , intolerant , despotic , almost challenges a revolt , while men of strong though modest convictions would be more reluctant to reject the decision of a perfectly free and frank conference , conducted in a spirit of liberality and forbearance . But the caucus ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its effect as an educating agent upon American youth . Is this elaborate machinery of caucuses and conventions the one which is to produce in the future a high type of statesmen for the service of the republic ? Is it fitted to broaden the faculties ; to liberalize the judgment ; to stimulate independence , courage , manliness , fidelity to principle ; and to make an unswerving devotion to elevated , noble , chivalrous methods in political life the aspiration of all our youth ? I should be appalled by the audacity of an affirmative answer // to these questions . Yet , lest one may be offered , I present in advance a single consideration , which seems to me conclusive against not only the claim for despotic power made for our conventions , but also , and more especially , against anything that may be said in behalf of the lawfulness or propriety of the position which they hold in our political system . The consideration is this : that it is distinctly unwise to familiarize young men with the idea of service in a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded . All gatherings of a free people ought to permit an exchange of views ; a canvass of questions or candidates ; an opportunity , in short , for those who have strong convictions to present them in the best possible light , and an equal opportunity for those who come undecided to hear the arguments on all sides , and to act after mature reflection .. This is of the very essence of republican institutions . Anglo-Saxon self-government has been called government by town meeting , or government by debate ; yet a demand is made for recognizing as a part of that system - and a very important part - a scheme of party administration which is peculiarly calculated to make debate and consultation impossible . Can anybody suppose that such a scheme will train a class of men fitted to conduct in the future the affairs of this great com-monwealth ? From the idea of party as a legal corporation to the expression of the idea in laws and institutions the step is easy and natural . Yet a step precisely like that , an innovation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such vast possibilities for evil , was needed to show how powerful a hold the error under discussion had taken upon the imaginations of men . The measures to which I refer may be arranged in two groups : the one consisting of those which recognize party in the adjustment of certain administrative organs ; the other , of those which seek to regulate the action of certain functions within the parties themselves . The first class is illustrated by various executive boards or commissions , the members of which are divided in some ratio between the two parties ; as the police commission of iNew York city , where they are shared equally , or the federal civil service commission , where the ratio is two to one . This last provision , it may be added , has been slavishly copied in the similar act of the State of New York , and in all bills on the same subject which have been presented or prepared in other States . The best example of the other class of measures is the New York act to regulate primary elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each has also evils peculiar to itself . Let us consider these classes in their order . Of all devices for taking parties formally into the machinery of administration it is first to be said that they involve a logical absurdity . Their object is , of course , to secure non-partisanship in the conduct of certain charges ; and yet it is the very provision for dividing the places in a board between men of different political views which makes the board partisan . It necessarily does that in form , and often in substance . Each member is appointed , not because he is independent , but because he is a partisan ; and each sits in the board as the representative of a party , the interests of which , if they are in question , he is practically authorized , and very often disposed , to prefer to those of good government . At the same time the seat of responsibility is obscured , and misconduct made difficult to punish . There is , however , a further objection to all schemes of this kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , if taken in its true sense , and the only one permitting it any usefulness , can not be reduced to exact pre // cision ; or party must take a different sense , a stricter form , and lose all its wholesome and beneficent flexibility , in order that a vicious condition may be satisfied . The tests which the laws may require the appointing power to apply to candidates for office are of two kinds : they are tests of fact , and tests of opinion . Tests of fact are such as are judicially ascertainable , as , for instance , a candidate 's height , or age , or color , or nationality . Tests of opinion , again , are those which are applied by the judgment , as a candidate 's character or fitness . But it is evident that when a law says that of certain places to be filled only half shall go to members of the same political party , it imposes a test or qualification which can be ranged in neither of the two classes that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-judicial process , to what party a certain person belongs , or what constitutes legal membership in a party , or even what a party is in law ? The test seems , therefore , to be one of opinion and interpretation , and worth no more than a clause providing that an appointee must be a person of good moral character , or of ability , or a patriot . Yet this is not the case . The spirit and purpose of such provisions permit no other conclusion than that they are to he regarded as imperative tests of fact , as actual restrictions upon the discretion of the executive , as surrounding his freedom of choice in certain directions with concrete and tangible harriers . But the logical or metaphysical difficulties called into being by this vicious policy are after all not the gravest evil . These will be dismissed as purely speculative . The real objection is that , as the policy was suggested by a false conception of party , it was sure to lead to further measures , required as a natural development of the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed to an office because he is a member of a certain party , exactly as if it were because he is a citizen of a certain State , it is obviously necessary that means be found for giving parties a more clearly defined corporate existence , and their rolls of membership a species of legal authority . A beginning in this direction has now been made in the class of measures which was illustrated by the New York statute for protecting the primaries . That act , it is well known , was intended to secure a fair expression of party opinion at the caucuses by giving the presiding officers powers analogous to those of inspectors of election , and by imposing stringent penalties upon false swearing , repeating , and other offenses against the purity of the ballot . The measure had the support of many independent and thinking men , - men who would be the first to revolt against the tyranny of the caucus . It was in fact carried as a triumph of the reformers over the politicians . Yet it seems not the less open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the remedy is wholly inadequate to the evil . All reforms should of course aim at the original sources of the disease , and a purification of our nominating system ought therefore plainly to start with the primaries . But what is a primary ? The thing is as difficult to define as the original element in matter . Like matter , indeed , the frame of our party organization is infinitely divisible , and no investigator can ever be sure that he has reached the ultimate atoms . If the primary be fortified against corruption , corruption will organize a pre-primary or an ante-primary , and thus elude the most dexterous attempt to fetter its activity . These doubts , which more than one person felt at the time the act was passed , have been singularly justified by results . The act was aimed , by those who most earnestly supported it , at one peculiarly obnoxious leader in New York city politics . , But he issued tri // umphant , as usual , from the very first trial of strength under the new system . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves to be condemned for that , if for no other reason . But it deserves , perhaps , even more severe condemnation because it started from false principles , and gave encouragement to an evil tendency already portentously strong . The advice is often addressed to young men and good citizens , who deplore the vices of our present political methods , to attend the party caucuses . It is made a reproach to them that they neglect this important duty ; and when they complain of bad nominations , or platforms which are but as sounding brass , the retort is that they might have secured good candidates , and platforms with some meaning , if they had not left the primaries to demagogues and blatherskites . This line of reasoning I have never been able to comprehend . I have never seen any sufficient reason for a political system in which , except at the polls , the voice of demagogues and blatherskites has equal weight with that of honest men who can think and reason , who have convictions , and who are unselfishly devoted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary , that what is needed is not greater servility to , but greater independence of , the caucus and the convention . This may be a false position ; but to anybody who holds it , all attempts to invest primary meetings with a legal character must appear to be steps in the wrong direction . For they surround with the majesty of the law an institution whose chief function is to coerce the action of voters at the polls . INow there is but one kind of force to which the voter 's independence is properly subject . His own conscience ought to compel him to prefer good candidates to bad , and wholesome principles to pernicious ; and since this is largely a matter of individual judgment , obedience to such a law is , like obedience to any proper law , the largest freedom . The legalized caucus is , however , a real abridgment of that freedom . It practically pledges the participant to exercise his freedom of judgmeat at a stage antecedent to the election , and to abide by an unknown result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its true light , as a mere conference of men who hold similar views of public policy , there is perhaps not much danger to the freedom of the ballot . But this theory has long since ceased to be generally held , and the New York statute seemed destined to give it a final blow . It enticed into the caucus many who had previously been conspicuous rather by their absence , but who affected to see in the safeguards which the law provided an opportunity to rescue the institution from the control of the corrupt and the vicious ; yet at the same time this increased the number of good citizens who surrendered their freedom of judgment in advance of the election . For if the primary could control the actions of men even under the old loose and irregular methods , what must be its authority when the legislature has endowed it with sanctions carrying a vastly greater degree of legal , and accordingly of moral , force ? The act abridges the sacred right of bolting , and without bolting there can be no healthy political life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if pushed to its logical consequences , the politicians ' view of party would lead . It is known that they abhor independents , and often express the patriotic opinion that every citizen should join a party . The majority in each party should again control its action , and the minority should frankly obey . A careful organization , with executive agents and representative assemblies , would furnish the machinery for making the system effective . This seems to be a fair statement of the politicians ' ideal . Now what would be the result if this // ideal were realized ? The result would be to collect the voters of the country into two or three great parties , held together by inflexible rules of discipline and fealty , and each forbidden in effect to allow desertion or to receive deserters . As no changes of allegiance could take place , the relative strength of parties would be changed from year to year only by the death of existing members , and the enrollment of new ones from young men just reaching their majority and from newly naturalized immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced . The annual death-rate would probably bear the same ratio to the total membership in all the parties . Again , young men generally follow in the political footsteps of their fathers ; and as the birth-rate in the various parties would be also approximately equal , the balance of power would be little affected from this cause . We are confined , therefore , to the immigrants ; they would hold the key to the situation . If now it be assumed that the Irish would in general go to one party , and the Germans to the other , the issue would really lie between these two classes , which compose the great body of our foreign population . The problem of immigration would assume a ne and startling interest . One party would find a potent ally in Irish famines , which encourage emigration from the Emerald Isle . The other would have a keen sympathy with the high taxes and the military system of Germany , which drive so many excellent men from the fatherland . The battles of American politics would be fought out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all liberally supplied with money from the campaign funds of the parties , and perhaps also with platforms , to be posted in the leading seaports and distributed by colporteurs iii the interior . This would be politics reduced to a practical science . But while this noble ideal may never be realized , the progress already made toward its acceptance in thought and in legislation has caused a distinct loss of vitality to our political affairs . The next phases of development are hidden with the mysteries of the future . But it may safely be said that any event which shakes the doctrine of indefeasible allegiance to party , any revolt which emphasizes the citizen 's right of individual judgment , even though it may involve the downfall of a party whose annals are resplendent with great deeds , is an inestimable gain to the cause of good government . It is even a gain to the cause of government by party . For if the evil tendency of recent years should be arrested , and the earlier , truer conceptions resume their place , the result would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should have better ones . We should have parties inspired by principles and led by statesmen . These parties would also be organized ; but the organizations would be elastic , liberal , forbearing , and would aim to conciliate the wiser and better class of citizens . Politics would then mean the art of government , not the art of primaries ; and an electoral canvass would be an honest struggle between clearly defined and sharply antagonized opinions or policies for the suffrages of the people . This is also , unhappily , only an ideal . But the future of the republic is involved in the choice between it and that other ideal , against which this paper has attempted to utter an earnest warning . Herbert Tuttle .
