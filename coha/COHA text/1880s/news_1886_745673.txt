txt Mr. JACOB SHARP has decided , it appears , that it would be a breach of decorum for him to vindicate himself against the charge of having bribed the Board of Aldermen until he has secured the consent of the Court of Appeals . This is perhaps an overstrained sensitiveness ; at any , rate , it is an overruled sensitiveness . Judge BARRETT has decided that Mr. SHARP and his associates must appear and vindicate themselves or else suffer the penalties of contempt of court , which Mr. MONMOUTH B. WILSON has lately found too grievous to be borne . From a practical point of view the difficulties in the way of a vindication are manifest . The only process by which the vindication can be made complete is by a full showing of what was done with the $2,500,000 , more or less , raised by mortgage upon the Broadway Road and the Broadway and Seventh-Avenue Road . It is easily understood that this process may have its inconveniences . The Cable Railroad scheme at Albany is believed to have taken a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in opposition to it , and Mr. SHARP is not believed to be the sort of man who , in Scriptural language , goeth a warfare at his own cost . His expenses , if he incurred any , were probably reimbursed . His answer to an inquiry what they were would doubtless be that that was nobody 's business except that of the person on whose account they were incurred and by whom they were repaid . He can not make that answer in the suit now pending . He has in effect made it already and it has been overruled . The court has decided that the dissatisfied stockholders of the Seventh-avenue road are entitled to know where the money went that was raised by mortgaging their property . The case is the same with regard to the means by which the Broadway franchise was secured . - The Aldermen of last year were not for the most part men whose opinions upon a financial question would have received much consideration in Wallstreet . But they were believed at the time to have had a roughly accurate notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a large amount of money in it was firmly rooted in their minds . Here also the parties immediately concerned were satisfied with the transaction , whatever it was , by which the issue of the charter was secured , and if the courts would kindly rule that , no person who was dissatisfied had a right to make inquiries , such a ruling would leave nothing to be desired . They have thus far ruled the other way . It must be evident to the promoters of the Broadway surface road that . they have been too eager to reserve for themselves all the gains of that enterprise . It may be paying a very handsome profit on all the money put into it , but it does not seem to be paying that profit to all the persons who have put in the money . Two and a half millions of dollars is a very large sum to be oent upon three miles of surface rails , even including the  --  gorgeous vans in which the passengers upon the Broadway roads- have the privilege of standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; contributed to thissum without partaking the profits of the inner circle of promoters , who know what was done with the excess of it over the costs of the road , should be anxious to share this knowledge . If these stockholders had been satisfied with their share of the profits , it is probable that the suit would not have been begun in which Mr. SHARP and his associates have been summoned to ? appear as witnesses . It is painful for a modest man to be dragged from the retirement which he loves into the glare of publicity , even for his own vindication . It must be doubly painful in this case , when not only the officers of the Seventh-avenue road but their books are to be exposed to an unfeeling scrutiny . Their vindication must now take the shape of a - statement which shall be consistent , not only with itself , but with the books , and with any other facts that may come to light during the investigation . Upon the whole , it is not so much to be wondered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeals before exposing themselves to this ordeal . They have at least learned already that the troubles of benefactors who are trying to confer boons upon an inappreciative public are not over when they have enlisted the sympathies of the Legislature and of the Board of Aldermen .
