PRESIDENT CLEVELAND . THE career of President Cleveland is nnique in our history . Save for a single day , he had never been in Washington until he went there to assume the duties of his great office . Just past forty-seven years of age , he was the youngest of all our Presidents , except President Grant . No presidential candidate had been so little known to the people , knew so little of the official life of the country , or was acquainted with so few of the great men of his party . He had never met a member of his cabinet except those from his own State . He had never been in New England , nor further south than Washington , nor further west than Ohio . He had been neither a popular orator , an editor , nor a public writer on any question . He had had no part in military affairs or in any popular movement . He had not been a party leader , or the head of a faction , nor had he rendered any party services which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no personal followers . No candidate , ever so dependent upon his own personality , ever so utterly destitute of adventitious aid , ever made President for reasons so original , personal , and peculiar . Never a partisan , he was a sturdy Democrat always . His official experience , when made President , had been far less than that of any one of his predecessors . Until November , 1881 , when he was elected Mayor of Buffalo  --  but thirty-six months before his election as President-Mr . Cleveland had held no other offices than those of Assistant District-Attorney for a few months and Sheriff for three years . Beyond his own section of his State , even his name was unknown . He had served as Mayor less than eleven months when he was nominated for Governor of New York , and as Governor less than twenty months when he was nominated for the Presidency . Nothing in our history so extraor // dinary , or , upon the theory of the politicians , so inexplicable as this . No national crisis , no military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his predecessors , to the highest place . Lincoln had been in Congress , and had been nominated for the Vice-Presidency nearly three years before the uprising for freedom and his rare genius raised him to the highest place . Mr. Cleveland suffered not a little , in his own party , from a feeling that he had not earned his nomination , that it had done injustice to old leaders-Tilden , Thurman , McDonald , Carlisle , Hoadley , Randall  --  and that he could not be relied on to give its managers the universal patronage which they craved ; and , in addition , he was heavily handicapped by the natural feeling that a party which , in the crisis of a war for liberty and the union , had declared that war " a failure " - that a party , a large proportion of whose adherents had lately stood in arms against their country-could not be safely trusted to pay pensions to Union soldiers , and yet refuse to pay Confederate pensions , debts , or losses . No Presidential candidate , in this generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had so little aid from office-holders or political assessment . His most distinctly avowed principles , on the other hand , damped the zeal of the working politicians of his party ; their belief that they could force him to abandon them being their main inducement to exertion . The Republican party had been twenty years in power , with the vast prestige of continuous victory in a noble cause . Its achievements in a general way had been honorable and brilliant beyond all precedent in the party history of the world . Patriotism itself , gratitude for a Union restored , the pride and joy of the nation by reason of slavery destroyed , were associated with the very name of the party . The thrilling memories of the battlefields , the grandest triumphs of peace , the prestige of the nation exalted the world over , crowned its heroes and statesmen , and gave immortal glory to its policy . Its adherents  --  a large portion of them selected and disciplined for efficient party service-filled more than 100,000 offices and the whole labor service of the nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thoroughly trained for victory , at least on the partisan 's theory , than the Republican party in 1884 . It had for its leader and candidate a gentleman of the highest natural aptitude and the most thorough training // for partisan politics , but , strange enough , without identification with any event of war or any great measure of peace , upon which the glory of his party rested . He was the ideal politician and statesman , according to that theory ,  --  the impersonation of strength and the pledge of victory . Long experience as an editor and member of Congress , six years as Speaker of the House , repeated preparations , thorough beyond precedent , for his candidacy , made his acquaintance with party methods and party leaders nearly universal . Twenty skillful personal followers labored devotedly for him for every one who thus served his opponent . According to every theory accepted by politicians ,  --  or which does not sound the deeper forces of politics ,  --  a victory for the Democratic party , under such circumstances and with such a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cleveland was elected . It is by far the most important election since that of Lincoln . Better than any other , it deserves careful study at this moment , for without understanding it no man can understand the strength of President Cleveland or the greatest force in the next election . He was nominated and elected on a new and single issue-his opinions on all the old subjects being unknown to his party  --  and that an issue which his opponent despised . It is plain there was a new force , if not the opening of a new era , in politics . The claim lately made by Senator Sherman that the Republican party has always been right , and its administration always honest and pure , is simply an impeachment of the people for overturning it . It is not wise to attempt to conceal the true cause of that defeat , nor possible to do so . Why had the Republican party been growing weaker and the Democrats stronger for several years ? Is that fact . evidence of national decay or of the decay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy the best effort of that Senator . As the defeated party had all the patronage-and , therefore , the victors none of it-what shall we think of the value of patronage to a party ? If the distinguished Senator thinks , as I assume he does , that public virtue and intelligence , as a whole , had suffered no decay under Republican rule , why did the majority of the people support the Democratic candidate ? It is idle to refer to the tariff question , the silver question , or any of the old issues as decisive , for each party was divided upon them , and Mr. Cleveland had never dealt with either or // made his views known concerning them . There was nothing new in connection with the old issues , great and vital as they are . Nothing spasmodic or extraneous decided the contest of 1884 . There were three new things-new to many voters-involved in it , and they were the decisive forces : 1 . The remarkable personality of Mr. Cleveland . 2 . The principle and need of administrative reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The acceptance of such a candidate and principle by the Democratic party as a political necessity . It is not important to nicely estimate the relative influence of these elements , but we need to understand them . This new man in national affairs , whom the statesmen of his party sagaciously supported , whom its partisan leaders accepted in mere despair of electing one of their kind , whom vast numbers of greedy office seekers voted for in the belief that they could force him to universal proscription ,  --  this man , who has risen far more rapidly than any other in our history ,  --  has . in the 32 months since taking the Presidential chair , become not only the greatest moral and political force in his party , but the statesman most respected and trusted by those whose judgments are least biased by party prejudice . When Mr. Theodore Roosevelt declared , in this REVIEW , in October , 1885 , that President Cleveland had agreeably disappointed those who " looked upon his advent to power with dread , " he recognized the early stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents in both parties which has continued ever since . He has become the real leader of his party , so far as it has any as a whole , not by going down the way of its passions , but by calling it up to the plane of its duty . In a cabinet as able , perhaps , as any in this generation , he is conspicuously foremost . If we except Jackson and Lincoln , no President since Jefferson has been so great a political force . His acts and state papers would be a better platform for his party than any its leaders could frame . He has elevated the leadership of his party and made a new career possible for it . His death would be the severest loss it could suffer , and more than that of any other three m*n in the country would change all the problems of the next election . The assault of Senator Eustis , which accompanied the article of Mr. Roosevelt , must now appear as contemptible even to himself , as the partisan scheming of Mr. Randall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to everybody else . When a party has been a long time engaged in a guerilla warfare , its captains reluctantly submit to a true general who tries to suppress pillage . From the personality of the President , let us turn to those new and peculiar principles and sentiments involved in his election . We must go back a few years to get a clear view . So long as the great issues of the war filled the public mind , it overlooked lesser evils . When half of the adherents of the Democratic party were hostile at the South , few persons at the North would complain of such abuses as political assessments , of prosrciptive removals , or of partisan work by officials , under pretense of keeping the only patriotic party in power . These vicious practices ,  - -  of which the Democrats had long before been guilty ,  --  very soon made the Republican managers arrogant , corrupt , and despotic . The moral tone of their party was debased . Demagogues and schemers more and more secured the high places which noble men had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another the war questions were settled . Their exposure made them appear intolerable . Mr. Jeuckes opened the war upon them in 1866 . Here was a chance and a duty for the Republican party and a Republican Congress to take up a great reform befitting its noblest spirit and its greatest achievements . Had that duty been performed the career of Grover Cleveland would have been impossible in our politics . President Grant in some degree appreciated the situation . In 1870 he had the moral courage to declare the need of entering upon such a reform . He then persuaded the Republican leaders in Congress to aid him in such a work by one meagre sentence of law . In 1871 he appointed a commission and promulgated rules for substituting civil service examinations of merit , irrespective of political opinion , for the old partisan tests for appointments . Some feeble legislation against assessments soon followed . This , in a technical and practical sense , was the beginning of Civil Service Reform . The party thus entered upon the second stage of its career . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to make " a reform within the party** by responding to the higher sentiments of the people . But would it hold out ? The // answer was prompt . When the examinations began to diminish the patronage of party leaders and members of Congress , it became plain that the effort was too much for their public virtue . The rank and file of the party  --  the soldiers who had followed General Grant and the farmers and mechanics who had fed and paid his army-were too ill informed to make their patriot*m effective in his warfare on patronage and spoils . He was deserted by civil officers under him , by Congressmen and by party leaders in acts of cowardice , treachery , and venality hardly less disgraceful and disastrous than an open desertion of his flag by his staff officers would have been on the battlefield of Appomattox . Congress , abandoning the President , slunk from its duty , and repudiated the party pledges of 1872 . Twice in 1874 , President Grant appealed by message for the appropriation needed in the work of reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . On his suggestion to me as a commissioner , I explained to leading members of both houses-some of whom have since voted for a Civil Service Reform law  --  the reasons for his request . It was all in vain . Every member of the House committee on the subject , which Speaker Blame had appointed , was as hostile as himself to the reform ; and Gen. B. F. Butler was their appropriate leader . He and Mr. Blame , with Senator Conkling and General Logan , and their followers-who had at all times opposed the President-formed a combination too strong for him to overcome . Shrinking from all record of a vote , both Houses of Congress , under their lead in 1874 , condemned and abandoned the President-thus committed before the country and the world-by refusing all appropriations for a reform he had done so much to advance ; a censure and defeat which that man of few words declared in a message to be a " mortification . " Thus , at this point where two roads were open , these Republican leaders deliberately took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the party . President Grant bringing to this reform but a small part of the persistency and faith he had shown on many a battlefield  --  but a small part of those virtues exhibited by President Cleveland in support of the same cause , allowed himself to be led by Mr. Conkling into the follies and humiliations of a third term candidacy , which the reform would have made impossible . // It is familiar knowledge how soon the New York Senator was hopelessly deserted and ruined by the minions of his own partisan despotism . Every one knows how rapidly General Butler sunk to the profoundest depths of spoils system demagogism . The Republican party , Mr. Blame , and General Logan were defeated together in 1884 , by an opponent and a party made strong enough for victory , as we shall see , only by adopting that very reform policy which those gentlemen were the chief actors in suppressing just ten years before . The author of the " history of Our Own Times " tells us that " the most important lessons a nation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exposure of its own errors . " It is not for me to explain why , in the 1,300 pages of Mr. Blame 's " Twenty Years in Congress , " where many trivial matters find space , and the leading Independents are voluminously censured , not a line is given to this condemnation of President Grant or the overthrow of reform in 1874 , by far the most important matters then before Congress , and from which the most important lesson might be learned . Does he still approve those acts , or does he regard them as too disgraceful for recomJ* Thus rebuffed by the Republican leaders , the friends of reform turned to the people , irrespective of party . A literature of reform soon appeared . Scores of associations , made up of adherents of both parties , were organized . This movement , first called the " Independent movement , " is far more comprehensive than what is technically termed " Civil Service Reform , " the latter being but a particular , though farreaching , expression of its spirit . It requires parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so regulated by law as to prevent fraud . It repudiates excessive party organization and discipline , and demands open appeals to the people on the basis of sound principles and meritorious candidates alone . It rejects patronage and manipulation as the sources of political strength . It forbids public officers being degraded into party minions . It insists that municipal government shall be taken out of party politics . It censured Speaker Colfax as it did Speaker Blame . Before 1879 this movement had become a political power in New York . By opposing Mr. Cornell for Governor , its friends ,  --  called " scratchers " by the supporters of the machine ,  --  // reduced his vote 20,000 below the votes of his associates on the ticket . Such was the situation in 1881 , when Mr. Cleveland was elected Mayor of the Republican city of Buffalo . He had had , I believe , no real connection with these organizations or with the independent movement . His most important acts , however , were a spontaneous expression of the spirit of both , being quite original in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by his acts he emphasized the truth- " that the affairs of the city should be conducted upon the same principles that a good business man manages his private concerns . " He became known as the VetoMayor , vetoing more measures than all his predecessors for many years . He periled all his future prospects of office , according to the views of politicians , by telling the common council  --  the party despots of city politics-that its action in a certain case was " an impudent , shameless scheme to destroy the interests of the people . " His pure , able , and economical administration began a new era in Buffalo . To the horror of its little politicians , it gave him the nomination for Governor before he had been ten months in office . What could more forcibly show how imperative was the demand for executive reform , how widely the views of the people differed from those of the politicians , how absurd it is to look upon what took place as something sporadic and temporary . Mr. Pendleton , at Washington , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate . The reform association at New York City was preparing the much better reform bill which is now a law . Such was the situation in 1882 , when the Republican managers nominated Mr. Folger-ex-Chief Justice of the State , and a pure and able man-for Governor of New York . But he was Secretary of the Treasury , and under him in the State were two thousand or more subordinates who could be made to work servilely for his party . The old leaders of 1874 , who had learned little and were still in the ascendant , sneered at the reform element which they could not comprehend . The Democratic platform on which Mr. Cleveland was standing , after condemning this menace of an army of office holders , added this language : " We repeat our demand of 1881 for a reform and the purification of the Civil Service , " and then condemned " the levying of blackmail from dependent office holders* // to promote the interests of a party . " In his letter of October 7th , accepting the platform , Mayor Cleveland declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency ; tenure should depend on ability and merit ; levying assessments for partisan purposes can not be too strongly condemned . " Here , under Mr. Cleveland as a candidate , was the first direct Civil Service Reform issue made in a State election . On the twenty-eighth day of October , he declared his views in a public letter to the Chairman of New York Association , in which he said : " I fully approve the principles embodied in the Pendleton bill " ( then pending for the next session of Congress ) , and expressed the hope that those principles would be extended to municipal affairs . No previous candidate for Governor had thus committed himself . He boldy told the patronage-mongers and office-seekers of his party that he would close the doors of extortion and spoils against them-which to mere politicians seemed like digging his own grave . Nevertheless , the people , breaking all party lines , elected him Governor , on such issues , by the unprecedented majority of more than 190,000 votes . Such was the suppressed discontent and resolve for reform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune of Mr. Cleveland not merely to be lifted to an exalted station by the rising tide of a noble sentiment , but to be a part of the creative power which raised it . His reform pledges were made more than three months before a Republican Congress , repenting of its folly in 1874 , and compreliending the dangers from that sentiment which it had repelled , passed the Civil Service Reform bill-presented in both houses by Democrats-January 16th , 1883 . In his annual message of January 2d , of that year , covering the points of his reform policy , Governor Cleveland recommended a Civil Service Reform law for New York . It was enacted , and he promptly appointed a commission and promulgated rules , which extend to the municipal as well as the State service , covering in all more than fifteen thousand places . This new State system has since been enforced with great benefit to the public . Republican Massachusetts , the next year , adopted the same system , extending it to nearly 6,000 places . Governor Cleveland , in a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress made in practical and // thorough Civil Service Reform , " " in the prohibition of political assessments , " " and in the protection of citizens at primary elections . " Some other acts of the Reform Governor should have prepared his party for his career as President . One of the first of his many vetoes suppressed a cunning partisan scheme in aid of the Democratic politicians of Buffalo . His veto of the bill for reducing fares on the elevated railroads of New York City was as dangerouh in the eyes of partisans , and as bold and righteous in the view of just-minded men , as his veto of the indigent pension bill . The vetoes of bills relating to hours of labor and the selection of a Superintendent of Public Works illustrated the same bold performance of duty despite the threats of party managers . Such had been the career , such were the character and the principles of the man whom the Democrats nominated for President in July , 1884 . It is plain that he was both a Civil Service Reformer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided Democrat with a sturdy faith in his party . What , in politics , more incredible than that any intelligent , honest Democrat should have believed that such a Governor could be degraded into a partisan President , or what more unfair and disgraceful than for party leaders , after having gained power by the strength of such a character and such principles , to combine to force a repudiation of both for patronage and spoils under the pretended purpose of strengthening a party ! The Republican party had in its ranks at the last election much the larger share of the conviction and sentiment which demanded reform ; and even to this time , I think , it has the larger portion . The one thing , then , most essential to victory was a due regard for these elements in selecting its candidate . That portion of its voters demanded nothing for themselves . They could not be coerced . They were resolved to support no party unfaithful to great principles of policy or morality , upon which the public safety depended . With a folly and perversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican leaders nominated a candidate who-omitting all other objections-had been , as we have seen , one of the foremost in defeating the very reform policy which the Republicans had been forced to resume , and which had just given New York to their more sagacious opponents , who chose for their candidate in the approaching // election the reformer who had led them to victory in the la*st .. With the admonition to Cornell , the ruin of Conkling , the profound burial of Folger , the elevation of the Democrats to power before their eyes  --  and all alike due to attempts of the machine to ride down the independent sentiment of the Empire State  --  the blindness and folly of the Republican nomination of 1884 seems almost incredible . The Republicans did the most suicidal thing possible by giving the lead to their most partisan , intolerant , and scheming elements , at the decisive moment when the Democrats did their best to subordinate these elements to their most patriotic and independent statesman . The Republican managers seem the doomed victims of the adroit Democratic leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate was certain to repel . As between such candidates , every fair minded man must see that the Independents and Reformers could have but one choice . However anxious the Republicans among them were to believe that the views of the candidate of their party had changed , they were deprived of that hope by the facts that , not long before his nomination , there had appeared a long series of articles in the great New York daily most friendly to Mr. Blame and most unfriendly to reform , over the familiar pseudonym of a devoted member of his own family , in which a reform policy was denounced as utterly needless and silly , and its chief supporters , and the Independents generally , were unsparingly ridiculed-views which naturally interpreted many acts of that gentleman himself . The Republicans must make it clear by their platform and candidate whether they propose a policy of proscription or a resumption of the reform policy of Presidents Grant and Arthur . Nothing certainly could make the former purpose more probable than the renomination of the man who rejected the hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the house and over the dead body of the last Republican President . It is not difficult to imagine the fate of the humble servants of the nation with such a man as President when the most distinguished Senator , with a devoted State behind him , is thus treated . President Cleveland is certain to be renominated . To substitute another , no matter on what pretense or with what platform , would be held by every voter , intelligent enough to be an // independent or a reformer , to mean a repudiation of his policy and a triumph of the patronage-mongers and office-seekers whom he has baffled and offended . Feeble indeed would the Democratic party be , hopeless its prospects , if they depended on what has been done in Congress , or by the old party leaders . It is the indescribable contrast between President Buchanan and President Cleveland , which has made so many people , fortunately for it , forget even the nominal identity of the party behind them . A new Buchanan would ruin the Democratic party . There are hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but deeply interested in good government , and having the courage of their convictions , who have taken notice that the vigor and moral tone of this administration will bear comparison with any in their time . They have seen with satisfaction the honor and dignity of the Nation firmly upheld in every quarter of the globe , and would dread a change , especially to a policy of diplomatic meddlesomeness . The moneyed interests of the country have lost their anxiety and gained confidence in the evidence that the finances of the Government have never in their day been more wisely or honestly administered . They not only see a navy being built , but apparently without frauds . If neither our customs duties nor our currency systems have been materially improved , they do not see how it would have been better had the last election been decided differently . The not unnatural distrust , lest Confederate debts should be paid and rebel soldiers pensioned , has given place to gratitude towards a President who has had the courage to veto more than a hundred indefensible bills for squandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , which the demagogues and schemers of both parties alike united in passing . No bill especially beneficial to the South has been favored by the dominant party or administration , but such a bill presented by a Republican Senator was defeated by the aid of Democratic arguments and votes . In other words , the Southern question is dead , sectional issues are no more available , the outs can not get in on the feebleness or the faults of those in power . The record of the Republican party stands in immortal glory , but is as useless as Pegasus for the war chariots of the next election . With my strong conviction that the Republican party yet contains // the highest qualifications for good government , its success in the next election seems hopeless , save on the basis of the most absolute commitment to those great principles with which it has so disastrously trifled , illustrated in the most unequivocal manner in the career and character of its candidates . The mistakes and follies of 1874 and 1884 can be retrieved against such a leader as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patriotism . Senator Hawley , who was Chairman of the Senate Committee in charge of the the Reform bill ; Senator Allison , who has done more than anyone else to secure the appropriations needed for carrying it into effect , and ex-Secretaries Lincoln and Gresham , who were faithful in its execution , could be trusted by its friends . Senator Sherman has of late declared himself for a reform policy . The last Republican candidate would be more bitterly opposed by every friend of reform than he was in the last election . He was then silent on the reform issue until he returned from the West to New York to find the State threatening to deal him a fatal blow . The same member of his family who had once before , as we have seen , interpreted his silence , repeated that service in Lippincott 's Magazine for January of last year , by declaring all reform needless and all reformers dupes , if not hypocrites ; to which that candidate himself , a few months ago , in a speech in Pennsylvania , apparently set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a reform policy so grossly and needlessly that only an antagonism , intense enough to preclude ordinary knowledge of the subject , affords an adequate explanation . In no instance has he encouraged the work of reform , by word or deed , and under President Garfield he appears to have seriously obstructed it . There is no occasion to compare the intrinsic importance of the questions of reform with those relating to the tariff and the currency . It is certain , however , that , after the latter questions have been settled ,  --  that as long as the greed for office and the selfishness of human nature shall endure ,  --  the irrepressible conflict between all those who hold office to be a trust and all those who grasp for it as spoils ,  --  between hostile parties contending for the Government ,  --  between all that is pure and patriotic , and all that is selfish and corrupt in public administration , will not only continue , but tend to become more dangerous with every increase of wealth and population . // The tariff and currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . The President can do but little , as public opinion is now divided . But , on the reform issue , the President is the source of power , action , and responsibility alike . His courage and his opinions are of supreme importance . It has been what President Cleveland has done and said on this subject , far more than on both the others which has perplexed his party , given character to his administration , fixed his name in history , and made him a great political force . It is the vital relation of the next President to this subject ; his stupendous power of appointmeiit , promotion , and removal ; his ability to prevent official interference with elections ; his vast veto power ; his capacity to invigorate or arrest the work of reform ; his right and duty to extend the examinations to many more post-offices and customs ofilcers ,  --  to the District of Columbia , to the railway and the consular service and promotion generally ; it is thin mighty pervading discretionary power , far more than anything that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of both patriots and partisans make the character and opinions of the next President of such transcendent interest . It is not without deep significance that the whole partisan press and the politician , class who most decry the reform issue , nevertheless find the motives of their activity and the rewards of their exertions almost wholly within its sphere . The President must be judged , not by an ideal standard , but by the facts of his situation  --  the possibilities open to him . He could advance neither the cause of reform nor good government in any way by open hostilities with his party . Though a wrongful act may never be done to gain a working majority , yet an executive officer must always keep the measure of his attempts at improvement within that of his supporting force . He can not be held absolutely to the standard of purposes like those expressed a month or more after his election , in a letter to Mr. Curtis , as if they were pledges ; and they should perhaps be regarded as excessive declarations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems clear that he should have promptly cast out the scandalous Higgins ; that the nomination of the disreputable Thomas and Rasin are not excused by their confirmation by a Republican Senate ; that Senator Gorman , the most // insidious of all patronage-mongering S*ators , should have been politically kicked down the back-stairs , where he is always climbing and scheming , though it had disrupted a cabinet ; and that such short-comings and the indefensible removal of Combs , have made the President in some degree responsible for the condition of the politics of Maryland  --  the most degraded in the Union . The cunning and powerful influence of the late Vice-President no more excused the almost universal removals which have dishonored the administration in Indiana than the gain of Republican votes there proves them to have been profitable . The great pledge of the President in the matter of reform was to enforce the Civil Service act  --  a bold pledge ; indeed , ten times more difficult for him than for his predecessors , as it would tend to retain mostly Republicans in office . Senator Edmunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties when he declared that no cabinet could be found to support him , and that he would slide into the spoils system faster and faster , like a boy from a steep roof . Nevertheless , that pledge has been kept . No cabinet of any one of the five Presidents , while I was a commissioner , was more loyal to reform than that of President Cleveland . The President has allowed no one of the 14,000 and more places brought under the examinations by President Arthur 's rules to revert to patronage , and has made material additions to them , notably , a class of more highly compensated officers in the Pension Office , that scandalous old hot-bed of partisan favoritism . He has also extended the examination to certain promotions . The first change President Cleveland made in the rules was to avoid the need of turning from the public service several supernumerary Republican clerks in his own office , whom he was thus enabled to transfer to other places ; and the five left , with a single new one , have done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more places in the departments at Washington , to which the examinations extend , there have been only fourteen removals in the past year , against eleven in a year under President Arthur , and 381 appointments , against 438 in 1884-very small indeed , therefore , must have been the effects of political opinions and interests . The failure of the last administration to approve that part of the rules as prepared by the Commission which required examinations for filling positions of Chief Clerk and Chiefs of Bureaus and Divisions , left about 200 such offices // at Washington at the mercy of the appointing power . To its credit , it can be said , that a hard contest with the spoilsman has saved many from the axe . In the Treasury Department , for example , there are 101 such officers , of whom 28 hold their old places and 26 have been transferred to others ; more than half , consequently , being still in the service . In considering so much beyond the scope of the examinations which is unsatisfactory , we must not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solicitationbeyond all precedent in his office , and which a whole article could not describe  --  to which the President has been subjected for proscription and spoils . Day after day , month after month , from early morning until late into the night , he has maintained the contest , one standing for the common interests against tens of thousands seeking their own advantage  --  the President against an army of partisan chiefs and spoilsmen of his own party . Hundreds of journals and tens of thousands of office-seekers have united in arraigning him as ungrateful and unjust to that party , as reprehensibly indulgent to Republican officeholders , as foolishly and disastrously devoted to reform . Nothing but a lofty sense of duty and power to resist and to work , given to few men , could have withstood all this and performed his other functions-all the more difficult by reason of his inexperience and the wish of many to embarrass him , because he would not pander to their greed . As we regret that he has allowed so much that is bad , we should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efforts in the spirit of his pledges . He has done more than any other President for reform in administration and manhood in politics . DORMA2 B. EATO*r.
