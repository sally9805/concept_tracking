WH* Messrs . William Orton and Jackson S. Schultz reported , in 1871 , their plan for the reorganization of the Republican party of the city of New York , the former admitted that it would not hold for more than ten years . " For , " said he , " everything degenerates in New York , and nothing degenerates so fast as a political organization . " Time has proved the truth of his words . The system which worked fairly well at first has , as a settled institution , become rotten to the core . By 1876 Mr. Schultz declared that he would no longer waste his time in attending the primaries , for the " workers " always " fixed things " before he got there , and if he tried to " fix things " they would promptly adjourn so as to beat him at the game . Three years later , Mr* George Bliss , than whom no better authority on the subject can be named , and who for years warmly supported the organization , suddenly awoke to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was making rapid progress . From year to year the abuses have grown worse . Controlling the vast federal patronage in the city , and having their representatives on the Board of Aldermen and in the State Legislature , these little evening clubs , to which admittance is denied unless the candidate will bind himself hand and foot by a disgraceful and humiliating pledge , and from which the slightest sign of independence will cause expulsion by a majority vote , have for thirteen years held absolute direction of the party policy , allowingthe other fifty or sixty thousand Republicans , to whom they refused any share in the party management , the barren right of registering their decrees . To go through the empty form of depositing at the polls a ticket in the preparation of which they have not been allowed the most insignificant part , is all that is left of the " divine right of suffrage " to the great mass of Republicans 257 // in the city of New York . In spite of an adverse majority of nearly two hundred thousand in the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable newspapers and voters of the party , backed by the emphatic declaration of the last party platform , in spite of assnred defeat to the party in elections to come , the old policy of exclusion , " discipline , " and expulsion is still in force , the old iron-clad pledges are still exacted , the old " leaders " still retained ; while the chairmanship of the Central Committee is refused to David Dows and Theo . W. Dwight , to be conferred upon Mr. John J. O'Brien , whose chief qualification seems to have been the fact that his obstinate candidacy for the office of Sher* , in the face of protests from his own colleagues , divided the party vote and gave to the Democrats the municipal election of 1882 . But , it may be said , while no candid man denies that the primary system of the city of New York is full of the grossest abuses , yet , elsewhere in the State , the voice of the caucus may still be relied upon for a fair expression of party opinion . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1881 was held the primary election for the second ward of Newburgh , N. Y. , under the management of the ward committee , whose chairman , in the face , it is claimed , of a majority of " noes , " appointed as chairman and secretary of the caucus two of the candidates on the " ward committee ticket . " These two were put into a little low-roofed , ten by fifteen shanty , the door was locked , an unopened ballot-box was handed in through a little window , and after refusing the opposition , or " People 's Ticket , " a representative , the chairman of the caucus announced that he was ready to receive the votes , which were passed in through the window , and the balloting began . The night was dark and the street iflled by a crowd collected from all parts of the city . When the polls were closed , the supporters of the People 's ticket again demanded an inspector at the counting , and were again refused . The chairman , with his back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count the votes , and announced that of the three hundred and seventyfive cast , his own ticket had received two hundred and six against one hundred and sixty-nine . A protest against the farce was filed , and on appeal to the convention the affidavits of two hundred and one persons were exhibited ,  --  thirty-two more than declared by the chairman , and thirteen more than a majority ,  --  // who swore to having voted the People 's Ticket , a copy of which was attached to the declaration of each affiant . The chairman of the caucus , on the other hand , simply swore that the result as given was correct , but admitted on cross-examination that he did not count all the tickets , presuming his colleague 's statement to be correct ! He further admitted that he had destroyed the poll lists and tickets , " as usual , " a few minutes after the result was announced . Yet , in the teeth of this evidence , the committee on contested seats , upon the selection of which the holders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , decided against the contestants . From other parts of the Empire State the same story comes in . " Our Republican ring , ** writes a gentleman from Buffalo , " tries to keep away respectable voters from the caucuses by appointing inconvenient times and places , giving short notice , and sometimes getting up rows , or so fixing* the organization beforehand . . . that respectable people will not go to them . By fixing ' the new ward committees at the caucuses they can repeat this operation next year . . . so that even in the ninth , tenth , and eleventh wards , where respectability is actually in the majority , the respectable vote can not now be got out for a caucus . When they can not get a majority vote by these means , they bring in repeaters from other wards , and have resorted to frauds in counting the votes . " The full history of the " snap " primaries of 1880 in Albany County , that shameful attempt to throttle the majority , which our present system of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority , should be known to every Republican who wishes to guard against a repetition of the abuse , and who still clings to a lingering hope that the wished-for reform may be brought about within the party before another " tidal wave** carries the independent vote , which he now sees can decide any election in the State of New York , over to his opponents for good and all . Before the election for district delegates , preceding the national campaign of 1880 , a petition , representing over fifteen hundred Republicans of Albany County , was presented to the general committee , requesting the appointment of certain gentlemen to secure a fair count at the polls . The response to this appeal was prompt and decisive . Refusing even to hear the communication read through , a minority of the committee , who , // however , took pains to attend and make a majority of the meeting , laid it on the table , and at once ordered a call for the holding of the primaries on the following day ( Friday ) , to elect delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday . The " slated " delegates , ten in number , were straightway elected in accordance with the preconcerted scheme , and subsequent disclosures showed that a deliberate conspiracy exter*ded throughout the entire county . In Bethlehem , the notice was posted in the evening for an election to be held on the following day . As it takes time to get the farmers together , a week 's notice had been customary . In New Scotland , the call was posted on Thursday for a meeting on Saturday to elect delegates to Monday 's convention . Afterward , as it appeared , the two days ' time seemed a dangerous concession , and so the machine leaders sent about one O'Brien to pull down the notices and post others for an election on Friday instead ; and the same trick was played at Berne , Cocymans , and Guilderland . In Rensselaerviie , the notice was published on Thursday for Friday 's election . In Knox , five henchmen awaited the coming of the mail , on receipt of which , with instructions , they immediately posted notices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electing three out of the five delegates to Albany ! At Westerloo , no meeting was held nor any notices given ; yet at the convention two delegates claiming to represent that place were promptly on hand . At Albany itself , in every ward , one or both of the inspectors of election appointed by the general committee , and over whom any other supervision was peremptorily refused , were office-holders directly controlled by the machine boss . Such are a few examples of the operation of the present system of primary elections in the State of New York . If it were necessary to multiply instances , . the writer could give similar facts , reported and vouched for , from other cities and towns . Those which are here detailed have been taken from the history of the Republican party , for the reason that within that organization the system has reached its highest development . But the words " Republican " and * have no more significance for the " practical " politicians who trade and dicker in offices and votes than they had in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheapest way , by far , was to buy up the Republican caucus , " run ' 7 the Republican primaries , and then aliow the // innocent voters to go through the form of a spirited contest at the polls. * But let us see how the system works under a different party name . In Democratic caucuses in the city of Baltimore , Md. , it is stated , on the authority of a former United States Senator , the abuses have become intolerable . Frequently , with but a score of men to vote , thirty or forty ballots have been found in the hat . " The roughs of both parties , " writes a Maryland legislator , " unite to carry for each other primaries in their class interests , to drive away the respectable element , and when not numerically strong enough , to stuff the ballot-box with pudding tickets , ' - one ticket sometimes inclosing some twenty slips ,  - -  which the rascally election judges deliberately open and count for their nominee . . . - Each party in Baltimore is instructed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; copy of the last revision of registration . Sometimes they obey ; but , as we have over thirty thousand grave-yard and imaginary names on the registration lists , these are used by primary election manipulators for hired repeaters . This being the case , gentlemen will no longer attend primaries or support the class of men they force on each party . " In the primary elections of 1879 , a city councilman and member of the " Three-Tenths Social Club , " together with a city magistrate , brought wagon loads of hired repeaters from the Eighteenth Ward , " voted " them for the ring candidate in the Twentieth Ward , and then drove them over to the Eleventh Ward , where they again voted their roughs for another ring candidate . The reward to one of the principals for this sort of work , it is claimed , was a $1600 clerkship in the City Appeal Court . In May , 1881 , the power of the Democratic machine in Baltimore was so strong that it controlled the appointment of all the judges and clerks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing year . In the Twentieth Ward , the only one where a stand was made against the ring , the machine candidate was " given " two of the three judges  --  a saloon-keeper , and the boss of a gang of street-cleaners . The " leaders " collected some three hundred or four hundred repeaters in a saloon in an adjoining ward , where " refreshments " and a registration * Tweed disclosed his shrewd methods with much cynical frankness shortly before his death . See testimony taken before a committee of New York Aldermen m 1877. // book of the Twentieth Ward were provided , the men were " ftxed ' * ( i.e. , furnished with names to vote under ) , and sent in lots to the Twentieth Ward to vote for the ring 's choice . These facts were brought out on sworn testimony at the convention on the following day . " Two years ago , " writes a gentleman from whose letter these statements are taken , " I found eight hundred names to strike off our registration lists , and this autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clean ward . I could fill pages with instances like those already given . " In Philadelphia , under a similar system , like abuses sprang up and flourished . The rules of both parties were practically the same , and operated as they were meant to ,  --  only to afford facilities to the " workers " to accomplish their purposes under a show of fair dealing . To control the inspectors meant to secure the primary election , without regard to the lawful ballots cast ; to control the temporary chairman meant to secure the nomination , without regard to the number of delegates actually elected . The experience of a private gentleman , who supposed that he was performing a public duty by undertaking to join in the preliminaries of a political canvass , bears out this statement : " At a convention here to nominate a District Attorney in 1877 , I sat as a delegate , or rather should have sat , for the purpose of nominating for that office the present Attorney-General of the United States , my friend Mr. Brewster . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which elected a delegate to a ward convention , which was charged with the duty of electing three delegates to the county convention . The ward convention was held in strict conformity to the party rules , and three of us were elected delegates without opposition , receiving thirteen out of twenty votes , the other seven not voting at all . It turned out that these seven subsequently met and held what they called a convention , and proceeded to elect three other persons as delegates . When the convention met , we discovered that a printed list had been made up of the delegates to be recognized as prima facie entitled to sit in the convention , and our names were not on the list . Of course , we had no notice , were not even placed in the position of contestants , and were simply turned out . This was done in a sufficient number of wards to give one candidate , who controlled the temporary chairman , a large majority . It happened that I had greater facilities at my command than others , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest in accordance with the rules , when the hat trick ' * was played upon me and I was again put out . This was the uniform practice here for years . The man who succeeded in getting the temporary chairman always got the nomination , without regard to the number of delegates actually elected for him . " No one , though beaten by the most outrageous cheating , could make a successful stand against this iron-clad machine : for a solemn pledge in writing was exacted from every candidate before the balloting began to abide by the result of the vote in any event . From other cities come similar facts . In Chicago , the local politicians long ago employed the methods familiar to the henchmen of Brooklyn and New York . In the spring of 18817 the notices of a primary in the Eighteenth Ward were sent out either the evening before or the very morning of the election , so as to foflow the letter of the regulations , whilst giving to the insiders " alone an opportunity of arranging to be on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omaha , Neb. , the Republican primaries , at which Democrats are frequently brought in , are under the management of a central committee , and the faction which musters the largest crowd at the opening of the polls controls the election of judges and clerks , and through them the result of the vote . At Indianapolis , md. , the machine arranges everything in advance . At the Eighteenth Ward caucus of that city , in 1881 , more tissue ballots were found in the box than there were voters in the whole ward . All were counted , and the tissue-ballot delegates declared elected . In the Twenty-fourth Ward , Democrats were brought in by both factions of a Republican caucus . Two delegations presented themselves at the convention , the chairman of one maintaining his side by the declaration : " Dey say ye had Temocrats , but it 's a lie ! Ye had n't no more Temocrats dan dey did ! "  --  a tu quo quo argument which had its weight , for each side was allowed one-half its delegates  --  the customary method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged statement of an old politician , who is said to have declared that he never knew a contest to be settled in any other way . In Cincinnati , Ohio , the primaries are controlled by the ward " leaders " much as they are in New * The rules provided that the committee to whom eases of contested seats were referred should be drawn by lot . As the temporary chairman appointed the tellers , he had little difficulty in " fixing " the result . // York . " The game , ** writes a gentleman whose name is well known in that city , " is to make the caucuses and primaries so disorderly and nasty that well-behaved people are glad to remain away "  --  a practice which , I am assured , is by no means uncommon at Milwaukee , Wis . In certain parts of New England , the spirit of the caucus of Samuel Adams still , in a measure , survives . " In local elections , " writes a formerAssistant Attorney-General , speaking for Concord , Lynn , Salem , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the candidate , unless such candidate is a corrupt man " - an encouraging limitation , if allowed . Yet the exception is itself limited : " If he is only weak , a voter loses caste who bolts ; and , as the Attorney-General says , he is considered a black sheep , and when he seeks for favors he gets the penalty of his independence . . . . In Springfield , the popular will generally finds free expression . . . . Both parties use the public ward-room . The Mayor is nominated at city caucus , at which many respectable voters attend , and where charges of fraud are seldom , if ever , raised . " But in the political circles of Boston no such laxity of discipline is tolerated . There the evolution of the system follows the usual lines of development . The ward elections are preceded by " back-parlor caucuses , " where the * made up which generally wins ; and the discipline of both machines is as strict as any New York leader could wish . Mr. Patrick Magnire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a refusal to support the regular candidate causes the offender " to be cut off from the party and not allowed to afterward participate in caucuses , " and to be expelled from his political association or club . The Republican City Committee is composed of five members from each ward , who constitute the ward committees . They elect their own members , subject to confirmation by the Executive Committee , which controls the time of holding the caucus and the preparation of the ballots , decides contested elections , and holds exclusive ownership of the rolls . Their power , as defined by the constitution and rules , is more centralized and arbitrary than that of any other political organization of which the writer has knowledge . Their chairman also declares that a refusal to support the " regulars " is punished by striking the bolter 's name from the rolls , refusing his vote , and expelling him ; while a member of the City Committee who even belongs to any other political committee or // convention is liable to expulsion . Such is the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in convention assembled , unanimously adopted the following statement of the doctrine of party allegiance : " The duty of all Republicans loyally to support the candidates of the party , and the duty of the nominating conventions to present candidates who are acceptable to all Republicans , are reciprocal duties of equal force and obligation . " This , too , was the party which refused to expel , at the urgent solicitation of the present Governor ,  --  it was at one of the times when he happened to be a Republican ,  --  a delegate who declined to pledge himself as the General demanded . And yet it was in this party and in this State that Judge Adin Thayer gained the twenty-five years ' political experience which leads him to the conclusion that " no better system could probably be devised . " * People do not everywhere agree with Judge Thayer , for in certain States substitutes for the primary system have been adopted with , it must be admitted , but scanty success . Of these the best known is the " Crawford County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly for the candidates of their choice , instead of voting for delegates to select the nominees in convention . The system , as might be expected , works fairly well in small cities and towns where candidates and voters are known to each other , and where the opportunities for fraud may thus be kept in check . In Springfield , Worcester , and some other cities of New England , for example , the custom of voting directly in town meeting for the nominees to local offices works very well , because the inspectors have little difficulty in " spotting " repeaters , and the balloting takes place in fit places at convenient hours . So , too , in Richmond , Va. , the Democrats , for over ten years past , have tried the plan of keeping the polls open all day and allowing the voter a direct vote on the nominees with undoubtedly good results . The party action , it is *2Mote. - Judge Thayer takes pains to qualify his declaration in this way : " If I attend , and , contrary to my advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can refuse to ratify its doings with clean hands ; but not otherwise . " Can he ? Where in the rules of either party can he find this limitation admitted , expressly or by inference ? And does Judge Thayer suppose that the " workers " will , for one instant , allow him or any other private citizen to decide for himself whether a candidate is or is not " corrupt " so long , as he is " regular " ? // claimed , has been harmonious , effective , and pure , with an actual gain of popular interest . The fact that respectability is thus allowed a voice here and there leads observers like Judge Thayer to conclude that the same system may be applied with equal success everywhere , provided only the respectable element will " come out " and do its duty . But the system in its present forms has never yet , in the long run , worked with any but disastrous results in even the respectable districts of thickly populated cities , where it has proved totally inadequate to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness which an honest system should secure . For example , a California correspondent of the New York " Nation " writes , in 1881 : " The primary works here about as it does everywhere else , with reasonably fair results in the country , and in the cities in a way which is well-nigh the despair of good citizens . " * In 1880 , the Republican primaries were alleged to have been " fixed " for the election of United States Senator . " The vast and complicated intrigue , " says Mr. Nye , " wire-pulling and log-rolling necessary to accomplish this result had been carried on under the very noses of the voters without exposing w*hat was in progress. ** One cause of all this is patent . The California statute , like that of Ohio , makes it entirely optional with any political body whether or not it will conduct its proceedings under the general election law . The result is simply to hasten the abuses a single step . As the primaries in New York and Brooklyn lix " in advance every measure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the " back-parlor caucuses " and " conferences " of California , Ohio , and Pennsylvania arrange every nomination which the independent voter at the primary may record or not , as he chooses , with imperceptible influence either way upon the final result . We may go further afield if . necessary for examples of the degeneracy of the caucus . The " Birmingham Model , " which was imported to England from the United States some sixteen years ago , is our caucus system adapted to English environment . The party " whips " naturally approve of the plan , finding it so conducive to the strictest party discipline . Mr. Chamberlain , for example , sings its praises in notes which strongly remind us of Senator Conkling , or Mr. Bliss.t But the sturdy Briton ha* * A. B. Nyc , of San Francisco , in New York " Nation , " No. 865. t " Tlie Caucus , " Fortnightly Review , 1878 , p. 721. // already begun to fret under the paralyzing grip of the machine , with its attendant evils , **pledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * Whenever we examine , we find the same results attending the development of the caucus system in all large cities and towns . That the mass of voters have no choice in the selection of the candidates who depend upon their ballots for election must be conceded . While it is true that the majority of intelligent men do not take such interest in these matters as the public good demands , do not come out " to the primaries and attend the caucuses ; while it may be true , as Judge Thayer asserts , that " hundreds of thousands of intelligent men to-day pride themselves upon their indifference to politics , " - are they to blame ? Does any really " practical " politician believe that the respectable voter can " make his influence felt , " as Judge Thayer demands , or that the primary of to-day is open to him , except as the term is defined by a gentleman who , writing of Syracuse , New York , says : " It is open to any one who will do the dirty work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be otherwise ? It is not a day , a month , or an evening , or two evenings a week that a man must give to do effective political work under the present system of our nominating machinery . He must give his whole time morning , noon , and night . Does Judge Thayer understand all that is required of a district leader in the city of New York ? Or does he flatter himself that he could " make his influence felt " against " Barney " or " Jake " or " Mike " better than Mr. Schultz or Mr. David Dows or Prof. Dwight has done 6 ? Can Mr. Freshman who sparred so neatly at the Harvard gymnasium on the last Ladies ' Day stand up for ten minutes in a twenty-four foot ring against Mr. John L. Sullivan of Boston ? With two-thirds of the Republican bosses in New York holding federal office , it is easy to see how polities can be made to pay ; and we may reform , and reorganize and re*nroll annually , quarterly , or monthly if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonelective offices , federal , St ate , or municipal , to be used as a reward for certain sorts of work , certain sorts of men will always be on hand to do it ; and it is not the kind of work that Judge Thayer * " The Caucus and its Consequences , " Nineteenth Century , Oct. , 1875 ; " Political Clubs and Party Organizations , " Ibid . May , 1878 . An unsuccessf iii attempt was made to " discipline " no less a person than Mr. Forster for his course on the Government Education Bill in 1878. // or Mr. Schultz or Prof. Dwight would care to do . Yet , under the present system , it is the only sort of work that tells . Let any one who feels as Judge Thayer does , that " his duty to himself , his country and mankind can only be performed by attending and . makinghis presence felt at theprimary meeting , " attempt to carry out his convictions in Brooklyn or New York . Listen to the experience of an innocent gentleman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two regular Republicans I repaired to the primary , to which I supposed all Republicans were invited ; and although we were forty-year-old native citizens , accredited intelligent in ordinary things , yet to our surprise , not being members of the association , we had no voice whatever in a primary . We had gone on a fooPs errand . I then learned that a few leaders had cut and dried matters , and that a host of men like ourselves , without the necessary wire-pulling knowledge and influence , would prove powerless even though we were members . Men voted for delegates and substitutes*with a most absurd ignorance of what they might do . Until caucuses and primaries are conducted differently from this , I for one do not care to waste my time over them , however much I may deplore the dormant attitude it places me in as a citizen . " The nation has taken one wide step in aid of the needed reform . A large part of the federal offices will cease to be disposed of as **patronage. ** As Mr. Dorman B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely dependent upon the reform of the civil service . " The same principle must be applied to State and municipal offices as well , so that another Tweed may not have it in his power to control the caucus of his opponents by his disposal of the places which he holds in his grasp . When the independent vote , which can at any time decide a national election or a State election , certainly in Massachusetts , Ohio , Pennsylvania , or New York , has secured this reform , has enforced the passage of statutes extending the operation of the general election laws to the primaries ; when we punish fraud at the primary like fraud at the polls , and insist that all parties shall hold their primaries on the same day , at convenient polling places , open from sunrise to sunset ; when we have extended the penalties against bribery , fraud , and perjury so as to cover all preliminary meetings , primaries , or conventions for the selection of candidates , so as to prevent the " heelers " " getting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Judge Thayer and men // who believe as he does to throw the blame for the decay of the caucus on honest people who neglect their public duties . But until we have thrown about the primary at least the same safeguards by which we protect the general election ; until the honest citizen can feel assured that his vote will be counted as cast , and that by time and attendance he can really do effective service for his country , without stooping to the dirty work which is admittedly essential to success at the primary to-day ,  --  - no man can justly be charged with neglect of his duty who declines to be a party to the farce . On the contrary , as matters now stand , he who , with a full knowledge of what is before him , continues to run about to ward meetings and district associations , deserves to be called either a fool for his pains or a knave for his purposes . When we have done all that we can do and all that we ought to do to give any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the intelligent and honest citizen , and have ceased to say , in effect , that if he wants to be successful at the primary he must leave his honesty at home , it will be time for us to demand his attendance and to insist that his indifference means a speedy verification of Macaulay 's prophetic warning .
