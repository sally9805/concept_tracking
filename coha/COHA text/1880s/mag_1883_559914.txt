IT is encouraging that there is at last an effort to stop the assessment of Government employees for political funds ; but it should not be forgotten that behind such assessments is the larger fact that political parties require great sums for election purposes . These shameless levies are in truth rather a result than a cause of political corruption . That appointed officials are assessed for political purposes is secondary to the fact that elect .. ive officials ( or others for them ) must pay roundly for election . The election is the initial point in our political system ; and so long as elections are to be gained by the use of money , and can not be gained without it , no subsequent precautions will prevent corruption . Popular government must be a sham and a fraud unless the popular will alone tells in elections . It has in many parts of the Union come to this ,  --  that only a rich man , or a man who expects to make money illegitimately out of the position , can afford to run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who devotes his time to the public service should be fairly compensated , is the correct one , as whoever observes the working of the opposite principle in such governments as that of England may see ; and on the whole we pay our officials reasonably well . But in the cases of many elective officers , these salaries , minus the expenses of election , leave an 15 // inadequate remuneration , or nothing at all . What does the pay of a United States senator amount to as compared with the cost of many senatorial elections ? Or take even the Lower House . Some time ago a rich young man of New York spent between eighty and ninety thousand dollars in a congressional canvass . He was beaten , and the newspapers said it was a popular rebuke to the attempt of a rich man to buy place with money . Perhaps it was , after a fashion ; for his opponent , who did get elected , spent only some twenty-odd thousand dollars . In the recent election a gentleman of high character and national reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually no opponent , and whose election was certain , spent , it is said , ten thousand dollars in what are considered legitimate expenses . He is rich , and therefore , although there was in his case really no contest , was expected to contribute liberally to election expenses . In another case , six thousand dollars was spent by a gentleman , also of national reputation , who is not accounted rich , who has frequently gone through the ordeal of elections , who spent no money save for " legitimate " purposes , and is considered a careful manager . After the election , I heard the friends of a defeated candidate for Congress , in Brooklyn , blaming him bitterly for having made no exertion . He only spent two thousand five hundred dollars . Thus it is in large cities . But it is doubtful if it is in the large cities that our system of government has really become most corrupt . Sparsely settled Nevada is notoriously a rotten borough , and Kansas , Nebraska , Colorado , and other new States , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election corruption we must go , not to the large cities with their masses of proletariat voters , nor yet to the new States with their shifting populations , but to the older agricultural communities , where population is most stable , and the voters are in largest proportion of " native American* ' stock . There is , so " practical politicians* ' say , more buying of votes among the rural population of Long Island  --  the descendants of the settlers of the colonial times-than there is in the city of Brooklyn ; and in sheer and flagrant corruption there are many agricultural districts of the State of New York that outdo the city . The Thirteenth Congressional District , composed of Dutchess , Putnam , and Columbia ,  --  long-settled agricultural counties , - has been notorious in this respect . Not long since a candidate for Congress // spent one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in his election , beating a competitor wlio spent seventy-five thousand dollars . In this district substantial farmers , the owners of even five and six hundred acres of valuable land , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell their votes , and the prevalence of the custom is illustrated by a story of a candidate who , going into a country village , asked , " How many voters have you in this township ? " " Four hundred , " was the reply . " How many of them are floaters ? " -i . e. , merchantable voters-continued the candidate . " Four hundred , " was again the answer . Thanks to the efforts of the Civil Service Reform Association , a branch of which has recently been started in this district , such a stand was made against this corruption in the recent charter election in Poughkeepsie , that the money spent in buying votes was , it is said , reduced one-half , and four persons ( of whom one was a deputy sheriff and two were policemen ) were arraigned for bribery . They were tried before a judge who is reputed to have spent twenty tliousand dollars in getting his place , prosecuted nominally by a district attorney of the same kind , and counsel for the defense made no scruple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jury-box who had not been concerned in like practices . The men were acquitted , though nobody seems to have doubted their guilt . Illustrations might be given from other parts of the Union , but it is not necessary to accumulate illustrations of a notorious fact . What shows most significantly how deeply the virus of corruption is eating into our political system , is that it is only occasionally that the use of money in elections excites comment , and even then the comment can hardly be called reprobation , at least effective reprobation . The prodigal expenditure first alluded to excited some attention , but that mainly because it was a by-election , when there were no other struggles to distract . And no one dreamed of sending either of the candidates to the penitentiary . On the contrary , as a reward for the spending of a fortune in influencing the voters of his district , the loser was sent to represent the American republic at a European court , just as another New York man , who had himself contributed a moderate fortune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had induced others to contribute , had been previously rewarded by being made our national representative to the French republic . So the Republican who , in the // country district to which I have referred , spent seventy-five thousand dollars in a losing struggle with a Democrat who spent one hundred and fifty thousand dollars , was given an opportunity to " recover his usefulness " as Commissioner of the District of Columbia , while his brother got a contract for soldiers ' tombstones . This is natural . So long as money is necessary for the carrying of elections , the spending of money will be deemed laudable , and those who furnish money may claim what successful parties have to give . As to where the money comes from , that will not much matter . " Beggars can not be choosers . " When Mr. Garfield wrote the " My dear Hubbell " letter , he of course knew that he was as1*ing a ring engaged in swindling the Govern . ment to contribute to his election ; when Mr. Arthur went down-town to gather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry Indiana , he of course applied to those who were pecuniarily interested in the retention of power by his party . If Garfield and Arthur had been too " squeamish " to take such money , they would never have reached the Presidential chair . Washington and Jefferson once sat there , it is true . But that was some time ago . Even Lincoln had to trade off Cabinet places to get there , and to wink at the robbery of the nation when mothers were sending their sons to die for her . The most suggestive assessment during the last presidential election was that levied upon the New York police . These policemen are appointed by a commission intended to be nonpartisan , after tin examination as to competency , and , once appointed , can not be removed except upon trial and conviction of misconduct . The commission at the time of the last presidential election , was composed of both Republicans and Democrats . Here , at least , it would be thought political assessments were impossible . Yet the New York policemen were assessed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been divided between the two parties . Each party wanted money so badly , that it was willing to join its opponent in plundering and dividing . What hope for preventing political assessments by prohibition , when under such conditions political assessments can be levied ? Nor can we hope to cure corruption by mere improvement in administrative machinery . The disease is deeper seated . Growing inequality in the distribution of wealth begets a tendency to // political corruption that can be cured by nothing that does not go to the causes of inequality . And beyond this , we have induced corruption by extending the functions of government too much in one direction , and too little in anothe*r . Our absurd attempt to " protect American industry " by a tariff brings enormous moneyed interests into politics , and , from the blackmailing tide-waiter to the wood-pulp senator , debauches ' the public service . The Federal internal revenue system , and in large part the revenue systems of our State and local governments , also powerfully foster corruption , while minor misuses of , governmental power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have in large part abandoned to corpoi*ations the true ' governmental function of coining money , and thus raised up a power of corruption whenever their interests are at stake ; and we have in most important part left to other private corporations the true governmental function of opening and maintaining highways . The truth of the axiom that " the Government must own the railroads , or the railroads will own the Governments " is seen in every American State , as it is in the halls of Congress ' or on the bench of the Supreme Court . Nevertheless , any reform that can be made in administration or political machinery is not only good in itself , but clears the way for more radical reforms . Money is power ,  --  power of all kinds ; and in normal times it will exert its power in politics just as it exerts its power in the press , and even in the Church . But while the " money power " will always exert an influence upon elections in which it is interested , that power becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WJaen it requires a large expenditure for any candidate to be elected , or even to try the chances of election , it is only such as have money of their own , and are willing to thus spend it , or such as will make engagements with those who have money to spend , that can hope for election or really become candidates , and the popular choice is restricted to the rich or unscrupulous . And when a political party must raise large sums of money , it must turn to those who have money-interests in politics , and become to that extent their servant . We have laws enough against bribery in elections ; but laws against bribery are of the nature of the Pope 's bull against the comet . Where some want to buy and others to sell , the bribery goes on all the same . Some of our States have endeav // ored to prevent the illegitimate use of money in elections by other means . The Constitution of Pennsylvania , for instance , requires the officer-elect to swear that he has spent no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the Iirst instance of this requirement having any effect occurred in the last Legislature , when a senator from one of the interior counties confessed inability to take the oath , and his seat being declared vacant , he was reillected by his constituents without any illegitimate use of money . Perhaps this , and the fact that proceedings have been commenced against an officer who did , as is averred , falsely take the oath , indicate a rising sentiment that may make this clause something more than a dead letter . But the prospect is hardly hopeful . The fact is , that the illegitimate expenses of elections grow naturally out of the legitimate expenses . The habit of raising and using money for improper purposes begins in the raising and using of money for proper purposes . To prevent the one , it is necessary to do away with the other . There should be no necessary election expenses , either to the candidate or to those who support him . This is required by the theory of our government . In that theory office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public service to which the citizens freely elect one of their number , and for which any citizen is free to propose another citizen , or to offer himself . Yet , in making it a costly thing to run for office , we not only effect a discrimination between rich and poor opposed to the genius of our institutions ; we do worse*-we discriminate against the scrupulous in favor of the unscrupulous . Here is the root of the spoils system : In our elections , which are the foundation of our whole governmental structure , we treat offices as things to be paid for . To make poor and rich alike eligible to office , to prevent public plunderers having an advantage over honest men , to give voters freedom of choice , it is necessary to so order our elections that any citizen may run for office without expense . Let n*e dwell for a moment on the point that elections must be inexpensive to give freedom of choice . What we call machine politics springs from the cost of elections . Parties are necessary and useful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other organizations , power tends to concentrate in the hands of those who make a business of their management , // and that in proportion as the details and machinery of organization become relatively important . Evils which thus arise can be held in check only by the independence of mere organization on the part of voters , * by the ease with which new organizations can be formed , and candidates can be run outside of regular organizations . Under present conditions , the expenses of election are so great , and organization so costly and important , that it is a very difficult thing to start a new party , and , except in very rare cases , a hopeless , as well as a very expensive , thing for an independent candidate to run . The two great existing party organizations may be compared to two railroad lines . Those who do not like the terms of the one must close with the terms of the other , or else accept an alternative as hopeless as building a railroad for themselves , or trying to walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , so , practically , does the competition between parties only operate as to the heads of tickets . It is only as to a few of their nominees that party managers need take public opinion into account ; the fortunes of the rest , save in very rare instances , depend upon the fate of the head of the ticket . As the same general causes operate in both parties to put their practical control into the hands of the men who make of politics a business , the voter is , in most cases , confined to a choice between the nominee of a Republican machine and the nominee of a Democratic ring . And , too , the axiom that railroads will not long compete when they can combine , is as true of our political machines . Nothing is more common than to find the same combination running both political parties , and playing with the people a game of " heads* I win ; tails , you lose . " Thus freedom of choice is destroyed , and , under the forms of popular sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized ' a governing class . To get rid of machine rule , we must adopt such measures as will lessen the importance of the political machines in elections by lessening the cost of elections . This must be sought in various ways , adapted to the necessities of the case or the abuses that have grown up . In addition to pointing out this as a direction which effort for the purification of our politics should take , I only wish to offer some general suggestions . The legitimate election expenses of political parties , which make it necessary first to assess the candidates and then to // assess office-holders , and to levy or solicit contributions , are mainly the expenses of presenting the ticket to voters , and the printing and distribution of ballots . Under the first head fall the expenses of advertising , distributing documents , holding meetings ; and in presidential elections , or strongly contested State elections , of banners , transparencies , uniformed clubs , and torch-light processions . Under the second come not merely the expense of printing very many more tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailing or sending them to voters , but of employing " workers " to stand at the polls to offer ballots and solicit voters . In some sections , where the payment of a poll-tax is a requisite to voting , it has become customary for the parties to pay poll-taxes ; in others , it has become customary to send carriages , not only for sick voters , but for those at work . To begin with what I conceive would be the greatest single reform . By adopting the Australian plan of voting , now for some years in successful operation in England , we could abolish at one stroke all the expenses of printing and distributing tickets , and all the expense and demoralization consequent on the employment of " workers , " and very much lessen the importance of party nominations and party machinery . Under that plan the ballots are printed at public expense , and contain the names of all persons duly registered as candidates . When the voter approaches the poll he is handed one of these ballots . He enters a compartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , concealed from observation , strikes off the names of those he does not wish to vote for , or , as in England , indicates by a mark those he prefers , and then folding up the ballot , presents it . Some objections may doubtless be urged against this plan , but they seem to me trivial as compared with the gains . The final date for the registration of candidates should be fixed at such a length of time before election as to secure opportunity for scrutiny , and the lists then advertised at public expense , as election proclamations are now advertised . To prevent the swelling of the lists by trivial nominations , either the number of indorsing voters required to secure registration might be made large , or a fee might be exacted ; or , what would probably be still better , a deposit might be required , which , in case the candidate did not receive a certam number of votes , or reach a certain rank in the voting , should be retained for the public treasury , in other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus suffice , where now hundreds of thousands are printed . The power of nominating conventions would be reduced to the moral effort of their indorsement , since any candidate indorsed by the required number of citizens would be as well presented to each voter as the nominee of the strongest party convention . Thus the corruptions of primary politics , and the practice of selling votes in nominating conventions , would be destroyed , and the practice of blackmailing candidates by the so-called indorsements of political clubs whose only object is to make money , would also be destroyed . And not only would a large amount of money now required from political committees and from individual candidates be saved , but the practice of buying votes , and that of coercing voters by terror of discharge from employment , would be in large part , if not altogether , broken up by the difficulty of telling how a man voted . There could be no putting a ticket in a man 's hand and keeping an eye on it until deposited . And thus , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is retained , and the sending of carriages for voters , would become risky investments . As for the banners , the torch-lights , and the marchings of uniformed clubs , which have become such a feature in our presidential elections , there would , I think , be little objection to their prohibition save on the part of manufacturers of " election goods . " Each party resorts to them , mainly because the oppo&amp; ing party resorts to them ; and a prohibition which would put all parties on the same level and save large expenditures would meet little opposition , and would be , I think , generally approved by public opinion . Pennsylvania has already prohibited torchlight processions within a certain time preceding election , and there is more to be said for absolute prohibition than the mere saving of cost . When a man puts on a uniform , or carries a torch in procession , his self-pride is enlisted in the success of the party , and all appeals to his reason are vain ; and these glittering displays of partisanship are not merely disgraceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reason of the masses , but they are positively injurious . It seems to me , moreover , that it would be good public policy , and a wise and fruitful expenditure of public money , * One of the faults of our system that most neod reform is the election of m&amp;uy officials who properly should be appointed . // to lessen the expenses of election campaigns by the provision of public halls for political meetings . Every town and city ought to have its public hail or hails , which , like Faneuil Hall in Boston , could be had , under proper restrictions , for any public meeting on the payment of the cost of lighting and cleaning . In the country districts the school-houses are frequently used for such purposes , and in the cities every grammar school might be provided with such a hail , which would have other good uses than for political meetings . The practice of " treating " by candidates has , in many parts of the country , grown into an evil of formidable magnitude . The old custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , degenerated into a visiting of liquor saloons and " corner groceries . " The candidate is expected to visit each groggery in his district , to present his card , and leave on the bar a ten or twenty-dollar bill , for which no change is given , while all the loungers about the place are called on to take a drink . In some places the custom is for him to pay for a keg of beer . So large in the aggregate are the amounts of money thus disbursed by candidates , that in many towns it is said that one-half of the saloons could not be kept open but for the elections . So strong is this custom that even avowed temperance men , when running for office , frequently feel themselves obliged to conciliate the bar-room influence . A very prominent member of a great temperance society was a while ago a candidate for office in Brooklyn . He , too , went the regular rounds . He did not enter the saloons , however . At each one he gave " the boys " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they left his card and " set up the drinks . " At another election , in New York , the president of a national temperance society ran for Congress . He did not go around the corner while the drinks were set up for him by proxy . He ascertained about what each saloon-keeper in his district expected to make out of him , and sent him the money . It might be worth while to consider how far prohibitory legislation would be useful in preventing this and similar customs by which candidates are bled . As a great deal of the money spent in elections is extorted from candidates rather than voluntarily spent by them , it might to some extent be useful as furnishing an excuse for refusing . But I am inclined to think that a change in the manner of voting , which would dispense with // the " worker " and the " ticket-peddler , " and render it impossible to see how any man voted , would so destroy the influence of the groggery in politics as to do away with this species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of extortion practiced upon candidates . No mere improvement of political machinery will suffice of itself to give us pure government ; but it ought to be possible to so improve our methods that a citizen can run for office , and be elected to office , without spending a large sum or mortgaging his official acts . It ought to be possible to break up that system which tends to bar all but the unscrupulous rich , or the still more unscrupulous poor , and which demoralizes the people while it corrupts the government . We need in public service the very highest character and the very best ability , and this need increases with social development . We can command them , if we make character and ability free to come forward and offer their services without derogation to manhood , and the people free to select them : for there is in the public service that which is attractive to the proper ambition strong in every unspoiled man . What most astonishes one who realizes how corrupt and corrupting is the mire of our practical politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in our public service . That democratic government is with us becoming a failure , is clear ; that we are driving toward oligarchy and Ca*sarism in a new form , may be seen by whoever will look . But they are weak and foolish who say that democracy is therefore condemned , or that universal suffrage must be abandoned . Let us fairly try democracy before we condemn it ; let us give universal suffrage opportunity before we vainly talk of curtailing it . Not only is it impossible to go back ; but the dangers which menace us come merely from bad adjustments . When there is danger that his sails may be taken aback , the good seaman shifts his helm and trims his yards . He does not chop away his masts . Nor does the good surveyor condemn a stanch ship because she has been suffered to foul with barnacles . Hm** GEORGE .
