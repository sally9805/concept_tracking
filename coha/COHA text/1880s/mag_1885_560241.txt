THE clause of the Constitution of the United States that prescribes the manner in which the President and Vice-President shall be elected , was adopted only a short time before the adjournment of the convention . It was a substitute for a provision that had , in principle , already received the approval of the body among its earliest acts , and had been re-affirmed in successive reconsiderations of the subject . Nobody can rise from a perusal of the journal of the convention without being thoroughly convinced that that original provision embodied the deliberate judgment of the majority ( we may say , perhaps , of the entire body , since the votes were occasionally unanimous ) as to the wisest mode of disposing of this difficult subject . At the opening of the convention , late in May , 1787 , a series of resolutions was introduced by Edmund Randolph , of Virginia , which formed the principal text of a long-continued discussion of the provisions that the new Constitution ought to embrace . The first clause of one of these was in the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be chosen by the national *egis1ature for the term of years . " // Four days later this was adopted , the blank having been filled with the word " seven . " Two months later still , in the first draft of the Constitution reported from committee , this provision re-appeared in the following form : " The executive power of the United States shall be vested in a single person He shall be elected by ballot by the legislature . He shall hold his office during a term of seven years ; but he shall not be elected a second time . " Another month elapsed , in the course of which the details of the reported Constitution were critically examined ; and on the last day of that month , all matters that had not been finally disposed of , among which was the manner of electing a President , were referred to a committee consisting of one member from each State . It was on the recommendation of this committee that the provision on this subject was adopted which was finally incorporated into the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification not affecting the mode of election , still stands in the twelfth amendment . And it is the unfortunate change thus made in the text of the Constitution as first drawn up which has entailed upon us the perpetually recurring scenes of angry political controversy and wild public excitement that have marked the close of each presidential term . So grave have become these evils , that peaceful citizens are beginning to tremble at the approach of a presidential election ; and men of business hold their breath and curtail their operations , as experienced mariners take in sail in anticipation of a coming hurricane . No consequence could have been more wholly unlooked for than this , by the authors of the provision that has proved to be so mischievous . On the other hand , the plausibility of the proposition to confide the selection of a chief magistrate to a council composed of " the wisest . virtuousest , discreetest , best * of the nation , seems momentarily to have captivated the imaginations and disturbed the judgments of those sages of the Revolution to such a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this expedient to lift this purely mundane question to a region far above the influence of vulgar human passion . Singularly enough , too , the contemporary generation of their countrymen seems to have accepted this part of their work at the valuation put upon it by themselves ; for , while every other provision of the Constitution // was the subject of very sharp and even condemnatory criticism in one quarter or another , and the acceptance of the entire instrument , long doubtful , was finally secured only with great difficulty , this seems to have received some moderate commendation from those who noticed it at all . In No. 68 of " The Federalist , ** Mr. Hamilton expresses himself in these words " It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided It was equally desirable that the immediate election should be made by men capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station , and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation , and to a judicious combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice . A small number of persons , selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass , will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation . It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder . This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government . " This was the theory ; the contrast between the anticipation and the experimental result is almost ludicrous . Had there never been any such thug as political parties in the country , the practice might have corresponded more nearly with the expectation . During Washington 's time there were no parties , and at each election in which he was a candidate every Elector gave him his vote . Party nominations were first made in 1800 , and the Electors , however well qualified " to analyze " in candidates " the qualities adapted to the station , " and to act with " a judicious combination of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very quietly shut their eyes , declined to take the trouble of analysis , and voted for their party nominees . And so have their successors continued to do in every election since . The members of the Electoral College are thus reduced to the ridiculous attitude of mere automata . Ever since 1800 they have exercised no more important or dignified function than that of mechanically depositing ballots already prepared for them . It is evident , therefore , that an amendment of the Constitution is to be desired , if it were only to rid us of this electoral rubbish . But the Electoral College , useless as it has become as a piece of our political machinery , is at least harmless ; and an amendment that should stop with its abolition would do nothing to // avert those grave evils and even serious dangers which , as experience has proved to us , are of unavoidable recurrence , under our present system , in every closely contested presidential struggle . As examples of these evils may be enumerated the long-continued agitation and excitement of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular operations of business , protracted anxiety on the part of multitudes who have , or imagine that they have , important interests at stake in the contest , attempts to corrupt or intimidate voters or to exclude them from the polls , the fabrication and circulation of false statements on the eve of election , and frauds upon the ballot-boxes . To these may be added the disgraceful practice of trading votes , frequent among the low political intriguers of our larger towns - transactions known in the slang of their own vulgar circles as " deals , " in which a manager accepts one of the candidates of the opposing party for the sake of an equivalent in votes for another on his own ticket ; and , finally , the degradation of the political press , which lends itself to the lowest abuse of opposing candidates . Still another very grave evil is connected with these contests , to which , as it seems to me , attention has not been sufficiently directed , and that is the obstruction that the question of the presidential succession interposes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second Congress in every presidential term is to a great degree paralyzed for usefulness . During the first session of that Congress , every measure of great and general interest is invariably thrust aside , on the ground that a presidential election is impending , and that any action might prejudice the prospects of the party responsible for it . The second session is equally unproductive , for the reason that a presidential election has just taken place , and all such questions must be left to the new administration . Thus , although in the forty-eighth Congress , still in existence , there was a majority in favor of some reform of the oppressive tariff under which the country is suffering , and though the prevalence of this feeling was made manifest in the choice of Speaker , yet the shadow of the approaching presidential contest benumbed the spirit of both parties alike , and deprived them of the courage of their opinions . Even so moderate a measure as that proposed by Mr. Morrison was deemed to involve too serious a hazard , and it failed for lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts . We are told that we have nothing better to expect during the present session , because there is not time , in the small lease of life that remains to Congress , to matnre a measure of such importance . Time is not the thing that is wanting , but courage ; and it is a very serious fact , which our people would do well to ponder , that , owing to the reflex action of our vicious system of presidential elections , the national legislature , for two years out of every four , is mentally incapacitated for the discharge of its proper functions . These are grave evils , but graver still are those angry disputes that have arisen , and are liable continually to arise , over the final count , resulting from real or asserted falsification of the Electoral vote , or from conflicting returns and duplicate certificates from the same States . The danger is that the disappointed party may appeal to open violence in support of their claims , and plunge the nation into civil war . A catastrophe like that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved mainly by the moderation and patriotism of the Democratic candidate . With a defeated competitor as passionate and as selfwilled as the soldier President of 1828 , the result might have been very different . And in the contest that has just ended , there were many who for a time believed we were very near a similar crisis , though with a pretext far less plausible . If the electoral system is to be retained in form as provided in the Constitution , legislation is necessary to secure the final settlement of controversies in regard to the result of the election in each State , by judicial proceedings within the States themselves ; so that the certificates forwarded to Washington shall be conclusive , and nothing shall remain for Congress to do but to sum up the returns and announce the names of the successful candidates . Very judicious propositions to this effect have been laid before Congress from time to time , without receiving the attention they deserved ; as , for example , the joint resolution offered in the Senate by Mr. Eaton , of Connecticut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hewitt , of New York , introduced in February , 1882 . Better than this , however , the Electors might be appointed directly by the State legislatures . New York , Delaware , South Carolina , and Vermont appointed them in this manner down to 1824 ; Georgia did the same , except in the single election of 1796 , when she resorted to the general ticket ; and Connecticut maintained the practice down to 1820 . Other States // employed this alternately with other methods . Massachusetts , for example , employed the district-ticket system in the first three elections , legislative appointment in the fourth , the general ticket in the frfth , the legislative in the sixth , the district system in the seventh , the legislative in the eighth , the district system in the ninth and tenth , and she has employed the general ticket ever since . New Jersey practiced appointment by legislature down to 1816 , and South Carolina till 1868 , in which two years these States resorted severally to the method of general ticket. * This plan , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it proves to have nothing about it objectionable , and which obviates most of the evils attendant on the mode of election now universally practiced , is nevertheless objectionable equally with that , in the respect that it throws the entire electoral vote of the State in favor of one party , when it may happen that the numerical difference between the two great parties is insignificant , and in case there are minor parties in the field , the prevailing party may be in a minority . This happened in the late election in New York , in which Mr. Cleveland 's plurality was only about one thousand , and he was actually in a minority of more than forty thousand . In 1844 , the fate of the entire election was determined by the vote of New York ; and the vote of New York was thrown for a candidate that was in a popular minority in the State of more than ten thousand votes . The contest was between Mr. Polk and Mr. Clay . The issue was annexation of Texas and extension of slavery on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Clay was anti-annexation and anti-extension , but he was a citizen of a slave State , and he was not an abolitionist . The extreme Free-soilers , therefore , nominated James G. Birney as a third candidate , and the fifteen thousand votes they gave to him , which would otherwise naturally have gone to Mr. Clay , lost New York to the latter by about five thousand votes , and thus gave the election to his competitor . In the last election , had the electoral vote of New York been divided between the parties in the proportion of their voting strength , Mr. Cleveland would have received only seventeen votes , and Mr. Blame would have received seventeen , while Mr. St. John and General Butler would have had one vote each . It is evident * * am indebted for these particulars to my young friend , Charles A. O'Neill , Esq. , of this city , who has made a study of the subject . // that the application of this principle in all the States might sometimes have the effect to reverse the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitntion ; and in fact that it must do so whenever the defeated candidate has heavy popular majorities in the States that support him , while his competitor succeeds in others by light ones . Presidents have come into power with a popular majority against them . This was true in the election of 1844 , when Mr. Polk 's vote was 24,000 below that of the united opposition . It was true in the case of General Taylor in 1848 , when Mr. Van Buren , the nominee of the Free-soilers , drew off avery heavy body of partisans , so that the successful candidate was in a popular minority of 151,000 . In 1856 Mr. Buchanan was elected , though outnumbered in the popular vote by 377,000 . Mr. Lincoln came into the Presidency in 1860 ( there being three opposing candidates ) , though failing of an absolute majority by a number nearly as large - 354,000 . In 1876 the honesty of the popular vote in several of the States was disputed , but the majority against the successful candidate , Mr. Hayes , was apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by State legislatures , the injustice of throwing the solid vote of the State for one party only might be obviated by applying the principle above applied to the popular vote , and dividing the Electors between the parties in the proportion of their strength in the legislature itself . Or , according to a plan suggested some years since by the present writer , the lower house of each legislature might resolve itself into committees , equal in number to the number of Congressional districts in the State , each committee composed of all the delegates from a particular Congressional district and having power to choose one Elector ; the Senatorial Electors to be elected by the State Senate , or dispensed with altogether . Though this suggestion was not received with favor , the plan it proposes is entirely feasible , and it is obviously more just than that which was long and very generally practiced , of choosing the entire Electoral College of each State by the entire legislature . In proceeding to consider whether it is possible to devise any remedy for the evils that environ this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proceedings of the Convention of 1787 , and inquire what were the expedients then suggested for securing , peacefully and fairly , the appointment of a chief // executive . We find that there were eleven , which may be stated as follows , the name of the proposer being annexed in each case , except where the record is silent in regard to it : 1 . By the national legislature . Edmund Randolph , of Virginia . 2 . By the State executives . Elbridge Gerry , of Massachusetts . 3 . By the Congress constituted as under the articles of Confederation . William Patterson , * of New Jersey . 4 . By electors to be chosen by electors to be chosen by the people . Alexander Hamilton , of New York . 5 . By electors to be chosen by the people of the States ( general ticket ) . 6 . By electors to be chosen by the people in districts . James Wilson , of Pennsylvania . 7 . By electors to be appointed by the State legislatures . Oliver Ellsworth , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the national legislature . James Wilson , of Pennsylvania . 9 . By the national legislature , each State having one vote . 10 . By the direct vote of the whole people . 11 . By electors to be chosen for each State , in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct . Committee of August 31 , 1787 . Adopted . To these may be added the following propositions more recently made : 12 . Direct election by the people , in districts , without personal electors . Senator 0 . P. Morton , of Indiana , in 1873. 13 . By the people of the States , in general ticket , the electoral votes to be divided in proportion to the voting strength of parties . Proposed above . 14 . By State legislatures , the electoral vote to be divided in proportion to the voting strength of parties in the same . Proposed above . 15 . By the lower houses of State legislnturcs in committees composed severally of the delegates from the several Congressional districts . Proposed by this writer in 1877 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only assured security for the future possible to us against the formidable dangers that surround the question , is to be found in a return to the plan of placing the election of the President in the hands of the national legislature , which commended itself so strongly to the wisdom of the fathers . The members of Congress possess necessarily all the qualities of fitness that are possible to be looked for in any electoral college ; although , as the system works at present , it is of no * Mr. Patterson proposed a revision of the articles of Confederation rather than a new constitution . // consequence whether Electors are fit or not . Congressmen represent , as the Electors of the present system do not , the people of limited districts , and therefore , when political opinion in a State is divided , the Congressional delegation of the State is divided also , and will not commit the injnstice that is now invariably committed , of throwing the entire vote of the State in favor of one party . But in an election by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significance that it has not under the present system , for the Members of Congress , if not in all cases accomplished statesmen , are nevertheless much more familiar with affairs of state , and much more competent to act on and decide political questions than the average citizen . It may be said that the caucus would replace the convention ; but the caucus of the dominant party will in such case become itself the electoral body . Congress affords us an Electoral College in which the theory of the fathers of the Constitution is a reality . Moreover , since it would be impossible , by any process , to bring together an equal number of men more capable of representing the party interests or the party intelligence , it is certain that we can not expect from any other electoral body , however constituted , a more judicious or satisfactory appointment of a President . In the cases in which , under the Constitution , an election by the Electoral College fails , examples of which we have had in 1800 and 1824 , the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had every election from 1788 downward been decided by Congress , especially with the exclusion of the provision that requires the vote to be taken by States , in general the same parties that were actually successful would have prevailed . Whenever a case like that of 1800 or that of 1824 occurs , it happens , under the Constitution as it stands , that the election is made by an outgoing Congress . This , in some points of view , is advantageous , and in others the reverse . It is advantageous in that it finds members free from liability to be influenced by considerations as to their own reelection , a new Congress having been already chosen , and a new term being about to begin . It is an advantage also , that , having been elected more than a year before , they have not been chosen merely ad hoc , but their selection has been determined by general considerations of public policy ; so that , while they would continue generally to represent the bias of political // opinion among their constituents , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a disadvantage , however , that , in case of the occurrence of such a remarkable and sudden change of public opinion as we have occasionally seen , the new Congress might not be politically in harmony with the old , nor , by consequence , with the executive elected by it . Should the Constitution be so amended as to throw the presidential election into the hands of Congress , it would , therefore , be well to adjust the limitations of the terms of service so that the election may be made by an incoming Coligress , and be in fact its first duty after its own organization . The President would thus be secure of a sympathetic legislature , and we should be spared the conflicts that we have seen so often between coordinate departments of our Federal government . Curiously enough , these conflicts have been more persistent and more bitter between Congress and the Presidents that have received the office through the vice-presidency than with those that have been directly chosen . The pitiable histories of the administrations of John Tyler , Millard Fillmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this remark ,  --  a remark which , but for the prudence and good sense that have distinguished the official life and conduct of our present excellent chief magistrate , might seem to indicate a law . It is greatly to be hoped that , under an improved system of election , whatever it may be , there will be no more successions to the presidency by inheritance . In such cases , at least , let Congress fill the vacancy . Though the President may die , Congress is a body that never dies , and may make a new election without delay . Should even such a calamity befall as the death of the President during the recess , Congress might be called together by telegraph , and re-assemble within a week . A Vice-President would be no longer necessary . The President pro tern . of the Senate might also be President pro tern . of the United States for the few days of unavoidable interregnum . The contemporary republic of France has afforded us a felicitous illustration of the working of this principle . Three successive Presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger to the peace , and with the result of maintaining an executive in harmony with the legislative body . The parliamentary and ministerial government of Great Britain furnishes another example , which , in so far as the principle involved is concerned , is equally in point . The Commons do not // make the ministry , it is true , but they unmake it ; and all the power of the Queeu is not smfficient to make a new one unacceptable to them . And there is not a government in the world in which the transfer of power from one party to another is accomplished more peacefully or more safisfactorily to the people that live under it than that of the British Empire . These reasons are conclusive with me ; yet I am aware that the plan I propose is not likely to find general acceptance . The plan that will probably prove to be most popular , and , if we have any change at all , is most likely to be preferred , is that of election by the people directly . There is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will probably be claimed that it is more in harmony with the democratic principle than any other . Senator Morton , in his speech on the subject in the Senate in 1873 , advocated this view with great eloquence , and in a manner well adapted to win the approval of the multitude , yet hardly likely to convince thinking men . The Senator 's principal argument is this : that , in the choice of a chief magistrate , every citizen has a right to give his vote for the man of his choice ; whereas , under our present system , he is compelled to vote for the choice of somebody else , or lose his vote altogether . We may admit this without being able to perceive the hardship . If the man whom an individual voter prefers is not also the preference of several millions of his countrymen besides , his vote is of no avail , and he might as well not cast it . In other words , votes are not worth the paper they are printed on , without organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment of the Constitution , the election should be made direct , party conventions will continue to name candidates precisely as they do now , and individuals will continue to cast their votes as completely under dictation as they do at present , unless , out of mere caprice , they choose to throw them away . Senator Morton 's argument , therefore , is the flimsiest sort of fallacy . But Senator Morton argued further that the electoral system operates unjustly to the whole people , in the respect that under it a candidate may fail of election , although having a majority of the popular vote in his favor . This indeed is true , and it has actually happened . But , on the other hand , a popular majority may often be due to a sectional majority , and even to a majority of a comparatively small section , overpowering adverse , though inferior , majorities in the much larger portion of the Union . // To illustrate : in the late election , the single State of Texas gave for the Democratic candidate a plurality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a plurality in the same direction of only about 1000 . The case is conceivable in which thirty-seven States should give pluralities of 1000 each to a candidate of one and the same party , while Texas should again give 135,000 for the other . In a direct election , Texas , in such a case , would give the nation a chief magistrate by a popular majority of nearly 100,000 . It will easily be seen that the plan of electing Presidents by direct popular vote would soon extinguish the last vestiges of State independence ; and though to many this result might not be unacceptable , it ought to be regarded with apprehension by the party that , for nearly a century , in its profession of faith , has given to " the resolutions of 1798 and 1799 " a place a little above the scriptures of the Old and New Testament . But the conclusive objection to the plan of direct election is the fact that it leaves all those grave evils that have hitherto attended our quadrennial presidential contests wholly unremedied , if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public quiet , the conflicts at the polls , the practices of intimidation or corruption of voters , the bargainings , or " deals " between local political managers , the degradation of the press and consequent demoralization of public sentiment , the obstruction to legislation , and all the other evils that attend our elections now would continue unchecked . Only one conceivable advantage can attend the change , but it is one of some importance . A great State , with a majority of , let us say , 100 , would no longer be able to overwhelm half a dozen smaller ones with a joint majority of more than 100,000 . F. A. P.
