INTRODUCTION I. Charles Hale Hoyt was born in Concord , N.H. , on July 26 , 1859 . There was no theatrical or literary background in his family . He was the son of George W. Hoyt , of Concord , and his wife , Mary Ann Hale Hoyt , originally of Wells River , Vt . At the time of Hoyt 's birth his father was operating a hotel in Concord . When the boy was eight years old , his father gave up the hotel and moved the family to the village of Charlestown , N.H. , which thereafter remained the legal residence of the playwright . Hoyt , senior , became a railway mail clerk . Later he served one term in the state legislature . Mrs. Hoyt was a woman of no particular gifts or attainment . There were no other children . She died in 1868 , and her one son was thereafter left much alone while the father was away on the rail trips . Charles Hoyt 's formal education was meager . He attended a small private school in Charlestown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was successively a law student in a Boston office , a journalist in St. Albans , Vt. , and a worker on a cattle ranch in Colorado , before he became a permanent fixture on the staff of the Boston Post at the age of nineteen . He made use of many of his experiences in these fields in his plays . His first employment on the Post was as a reporter ; in a few months he took over the conduct of a semi-humorous column on the front page . He wrote daily , under the heading " All Sorts , " a combination of small news items , announcements of impending events , humorous comments , and epigrammatic statements . In this column is to be found the genesis of many of the humorous characters in his plays . Just as Dulcy and the Old Soak were born into print in newspaper columns , so were Hoyt 's characters of the office-seeking Negro , the dilatory plumber , and the temperance crank brought forth as butts to the author 's wit under the " All Sorts " heading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hard to imagine Hoyt as a musical critic ; he could not sing and his ear was hopelessly bad . The sporting assignment he could handle in satisfactory manner ; evidence of his interest in organized sports is afforded by his play , A Runaway Colt , built up around the game of baseball and having for its hero Captain " Pop " Anson of the old Chicago " Cubs . " As a dramatic critic Hoyt was conservative , more likely to praise than to condemn ; he prided himself on being impersonal in his criticisms and scrupulously kept himself in the background . He was quick to censure vulgarity , a significant point when one remembers how clean he kept his own plays . He realized that , in his own time , offending good taste was had business . He recommended revision , and in his own plays constantly watched for audience reactions and frequently changed dialogue and stage business during the course of a play 's run . The variety of his experiences , his interest in human nature , and his spontaneous wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer of farce comedies . When he was twenty-one years old Hoyt attained his first experimental knowledge of dramatic composition . In his rambles about Boston he met , in 1881 , William Harris , who controlled the old Howard Athenaeum . During that year Harris once faced the situation of a cancelled booking , and he found himself in dismal possession of a stock company with no play in which to present it . He told young Hoyt of his predicament . Immediately Hoyt 's mind began to work in a field wholly new . He proceeded to create a melodrama ; he wrote it , rehearsed it , and produced it in a week . It was called Gifford 's Luck . Although the play has not survived , it was a success . It was played by a company that included Frank Wright , Leonora Bradley , and Ben Gilfoil . The next year Hoyt wrote a four-act comedy called Cazalia , produced in May 1882 , at the Globe Theatre , Boston , with W. J. Ferguson , R. J. Dillon , Frank Losee , Emmie Wilmot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure , it was quickly junked . One of the cleverest comedians of the day , Mr. Willie Edouin , was appearing with his wife , Alice Atherton , in a play by Nathaniel Childs called Dreams . The first Boston performance was vigorously panned by the critics , including Hoyt . Childs and Edouin knew Hoyt personally and had heard of his success with Gifford 's Luck . They came to Hoyt with Dreams , appealing for help . Hoyt took the play , revised it , wrote in a couple of new scenes of his own , and made it a success . One day in 1883 Hoyt remarked to Edouin that he knew a man who had tried to run a hotel without any previous experience in the business . Undoubtedly Hoyt was thinking of his own father . Edouin was highly amused by the recital and said that he would like to produce a play based on the incidents of the tale . Hoyt thereupon wrote what was to be the first of the typically Hoytian farces , entitled A Bunch of Keys . Edouin and Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put the play into rehearsal . It was first produced in Providence , R.I. , and went rather badly . Hoyt , having seen it acted , believed he knew what was the matter and fell that he could doctor it up successfully . Charles W. Thomas , a fellow worker on the Post staff , had told him that it was the beginning of a new type of farce writing , but he insisted that the actors were doing the thing in an antiquated style . Hoyt attempted to buy the play hack from Edouin , but Miss Atherton , who had urged its purchase in the first instance , still had faith in it and dissuaded her husband from selling his rights . They , however , hired Hoyt to rewrite it ; he revised carefully in the light of audience reaction , directing all the rehearsals himself . It was produced again , this time in Lowell , Mass . Immediately it was a hit . On March 26 , 1883 , it was produced in New York in the San Francisco Opera House on the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a great success ; Edouin played it from one end of the country to the other ; it was performed as late as 1900 . It made Edouin rich , but Hoyt received only the sum Edouin paid for the manuscript and its revision . At this time Hoyt formed a partnership with Charles W. Thomas , his friend and newspaper colleague . The two men retired from the staff of the Post and devoted their time exclusively to the writing and producing of plays . Thomas handled all the business details , for Hoyt realized that his own business talents were mediocre . For ten years the two men worked together , and were very successful , their greatest achievement being the leasing in 1892 of the famous Madison Square Theatre , later known as Hoyt 's Theatre . Before Hoyt was thirty he was a very rich man . In the ' nineties he was a " big shot " on Broadway , largely because of the financial acumen of his business associates . The partnership with Thomas continued uninterrupted until the latter 's untimely death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Frank McKee , who survived Hoyt and helped to administer his estate after the playwright 's death on November 20 , 1900 . Hoyt was twice married . His first wife was an actress , Flora Walsh , whom he married in July 1887 . She died in January 1893 . His second wife , also an actress , was the beautiful Caroline Miskel , whom he married in March 1894 . She also died before her husband did ; after her death in October 1898 . Hoyt himself became ill . His complete physical breakdown occurred early in 1899 . In July 1900 he was committed to an insane asylum in Hartford , Conn. , from which , however , he was released in a short time ; but soon thereafter , on November 20 , he died in his home in Charlestown , N.H. He was buried in a mausoleum in the town 's cemetery beside his two wives . He had no surviving children . II . By one of the oddities that govern the minds of dramatic chroniclers . Hoyt has been unaccountably neglected . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Professor Quinn , who also mentions Hoyt briefly in his History of the American Drama . Hornblow refers to him twice ; Brown has a few comments to make . But Hoyt is important in the history of American farce comedy . He does not follow entirely the tradition of his predecessors , Harrigan and Hart , for they emphasized types  --  the Negro and the Irishman  --  while Hoyt 's characters are all individuals , living persons . Hoyt is the forerunner of George M. Cohan and Messrs . Kaufman , Connelly , and Moss Hart . Like their work , his comedy was purely national in tone . He did not make use of unpleasant marital complications in the manner of French farce ; he did not suggest the sex motives that appear so frequently in twentieth-century plays ; he was seldom vulgar and never nastily offensive . His material came from the everyday experiences of ordinary people ; he poked genial fun at the impatient traveller and the harassed railroad officials , the plumber who overcharged his customers , the woman who wanted to vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shyster lawyer , the superstitious clerk , the worthless but wholly lovable drunkard . Hoyt 's satire was pleasant , kindly , universal in tone ; even he who was hit hardest could find something laughable in the presentation . In the sixteen years between 1883 and 1899 . Hoyt wrote and produced seventeen farce comedies and one comic operetta . One of the plays and the operetta were failures ; all the rest may he designated as successful , several of them tremendously so . A Trip to Chinatown , here printed for the first time , was performed 657 consecutive times , a record of continuous running that was not broken until Frank Bacon produced Lightnin ' . Simultaneously , road companies were performing the play in every section of the country , and on one occasion a secondary company entered New York and exhibited at another theatre in the city while the original company was still performing on Broadway . The list of actors who appeared from time to time in the Hoyt farces comprises the best-known names of the time . Anna Held made her American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a nice little way wiz me ... I should like to have you play wiz me , Play wiz me all the day long . " Maude Adams 's first New York appearance was as Dot Bradbury in A Midnight Bell . Lillian Russell and Tony Hart teamed in The Maid and the Moonshiner , Hoyt 's operetta that failed , and , incidentally , the only play Hoyt wrote after A Bunch of Keys that did not begin its title with the article " A. " James T. Powers , Otis Harlan , Evans and Hoey , Tim Murphy , Harry Conor , Richard J. Dillon , Frank Keenan , and a host of others , the best in their time , were engaged in various Hoyt pieces . Bessie Clayton danced in A Black Sheep , and Loie Fuller did her famous skirt dance in a Hoyt play . Julian Mitchell , Hoyt 's producer , later became famous as the stage manager of most of the Ziegfeld musicals . Hoyt gave the country several of its best-known songs . " Reuben , Reuben , I 've Been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's singing habit . Charles K. Harris wrote his melancholy " After the Ball " when he was an impecunious young man in Milwaukee and persuaded the manager of a travelling company of A Trip to Chinatown to insert it experimentally , without Hoyt 's knowledge , into a matine performance . It stopped the show and was thereafter part of the regular routine of the play , despite Hoyt 's usual feeling against material that he did not contribute himself . Nothing of a musician in his own right , Hoyt was fortunate in having Percy Gaunt associated with him to write the melodies for his lyrics . III . The earlier Hoyt plays are farce , purely and simply . There is little connected plot structure in them and the effects are secured almost wholly by fast action and slapstick comedy . A Bunch of Keys , here printed , is representative of the type . Later Hoyt became more socially conscious and his plays took on a theme . In A Contented Woman he satirized the movement for women 's suffrage ; in A Temperance Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement ; in A Milk White Flag he poked gorgeous fun at the hypocrisy of the home guard companies . A Midnight Bell is simple melodrama , and A Runaway Colt deals with baseball and a gambler 's attempt to bribe one of its players . Even , however , in these satires , Hoyt could not overcome the temptation to insert farce elements . When the prohibitionists entered Oakhurst 's saloon in A Temperance Town , the second act closed with an explosion of a barrel of beer and the resultant discomfiture of the raiders . The most sentimental scene in the play , as well as the most ironic  --  the one in which the outcast daughter listens to her father , the minister , preach a Thanksgiving sermon while she sits abjectly outside the church in a snowstorm  --  ends with general turmoil as the emerging congregation tumbles in an undignified heap over the piece of farm machinery that Mink Jones carelessly left on the church steps . Such instances throughout the plays might be multiplied ; they are the rule , not the exception . Hoyt knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always caused laughter and delighted the audience ; so he put them in . Hoyt 's method of workmanship was a combination of sloppiness and careful technique . He made notes at odd limes on bits of paper , putting down witty remarks he heard or conceived , remembering strange names or peculiar people . Later he assembled his scrambled notes and made from them a working script of the play . After a piece was put in rehearsal it was constantly being altered . Later , before the New York openings , Hoyt would travel with the company , sitting night after night in the audience and watching the reactions of those about him to the situations and quips ; after the performance he made still other changes to suit the needs of an actual production before an audience . Frequently he kept a piece on the road for months , sometimes almost a year , before he let it open in New York . Always through that period he was trying to perfect its gags and business so that it would run smoothly with the maximum effects when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the Hoyt plays with dates of their New York openings and the theatres in which they were performed : 1 .

It played only one week in Washington , D.C. , opening on January 30 , 1899 , and was never revived . ) V. One of the bequests in Hoyt 's will provided for the typing and binding of five sets of his plays to be distributed as follows : one set to the Lambs ' Club Library ; one set to the New York Public Library , then known as the Tilden Library ; one to the Actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlestown , N.H. ; and one to his partner , Mr. Frank McKee . The first four copies are still in the possession of the libraries to which they were assigned . I do not know where the fifth one is ; probably it is owned by the heirs of Mr. McKee . But no one knows what became of the original manuscripts from which these copies were made . I have written to Mr. Daniel Frohman of the Actors ' Fund ; to Sanger and Jordan , play agents , Times Building , New York ; to the law firm that settled the estate ; to the trust company that acted as agents for the trustees under the will ; to the librarian of the Silsby Free Public Library in Charlestown . N.H. ; and to several of Hoyt 's friends . None of them could direct me to any autograph manuscripts ; it is doubtful in my mind that they are now extant . Therefore the matter of the texts of the plays is somewhat perplexing . Only one play by Hoyt has ever previously been printed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Dramas , National and Local ( Boston : Little , Brown and Company ) ; he used the copy in the New York Public Library and compared it to one which he found in the files of Sanger and Jordan , noting some variant readings . There are a number of prompt copies of the different plays in existence in various places ; I have made use of several in preparing this volume . Had Hoyt himself made the copies that are now in the bound volumes above mentioned we might be sure that they were as he wanted them to be . But the fact remains that they were typed after his death . Furthermore I have been assured by several persons who knew Hoyt , some of them actors who had appeared in the plays , that the copies in the New York Public Library are not , in all respects , as the plays were acted . Nevertheless , they remain , so far as there is such a thing , the authentic copies , made in accordance with the terms of his will , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Bunch of Keys and A Milk White Flag are here printed directly from the bound volumes in the New York Public Library and the Lambs ' Club , both of which I have used . They apparently are identical . I have not seen the copies in Charlestown and the Actors ' Fund collection , but I assume they are carbons of the two I have examined . A Temperance Town is here printed from a typed copy of the play in the University of Chicago Library , with a few slight emendations made on the basis of the " official " copy in New York . In that copy appear two characters that are not found in the play as here printed : a litigious widow and her daughter , somewhat in the manner of the Widow Blackacre and her son in Wycherley 's The Plain Dealer . They are very minor characters and their omission from the prompt copy examined indicates that they were left out of at least one acting version of the play . This bit of evidence is further proof of the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Different companies performed the plays in different ways ; those on the road may not have used at all the same versions that were performed in New York , and many of the plays were acted for years in travelling and stock companies long after the New York performances had been closed . A Midnight Bell is here printed from a ropy of the play supplied me by Mr. Barrett H. Clark , the general editor of this series . It differs in numerous instances from the New York Public Library 's copy , but it is undoubtedly a version that was performed , for the stage directions are much fuller than those in the " official " copies . A Trip to Chinatown is primed as supplied to me in a copy of the play sent me by Mr. George W. Poultney of San Francisco , Calif. , a gentleman who appeared in at least one of the Hoyt companies playing on the Pacific coast . He assures me that it is the form of the play in which he acted . It differs radically from the copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , in fact , that I have printed the entire last act of both versions . The first version is Mr. Poultney 's copy ; the second is the New York Public Library 's copy . The music for the songs from A Trip to Chinatown was also supplied me through Mr. Poultney 's kindness . The copy of the play which he gave me , however , has some very obvious faults in it . In Acts I and II the character of Flirt is presented as a friend of the Gays ; in Act III she appears as Mrs. Guyer 's maid . Somewhere in Mr. Poultney 's copy was a bad mix-up which the manuscript does not straighten out , nor could Mr. Poultney offer any explanation when I questioned him on the subject . On the other hand , in the Public Library 's version . Act III , the character of Slavin is wrongly given as Noah . Mr. Poultney could not tell me at exactly what point and in what order the songs were to be introduced into the play . I have placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the most famous song that Hoyt ever wrote , " The Bowery , " appears in the third act of Mr. Poultney 's copy and not at all in the New York copy indicates certainly that in one respect at least the former is the more accurate . Furthermore , Mr. Poultney could not supply me with all the songs mentioned in the script ; there are , therefore , several omissions of songs that I have not been able to supply . And there is no indication where Mr. Harris 's famous " After the Ball " was sung in the play . However , I have already remarked that it was inserted into the piece first in a road company playing in Milwaukee and very likely did not appear in all companies . As a matter of fact , there is ample evidence that the plays differed so vastly as presented that it is not at all certain that even Hoyt 's own songs were always sung in the same spots or that the same songs were sung all through the long run and by the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plays printed from prompt copies contain much fuller stage directions than do the ones in the bound volumes . I have faithfully included all the directions for action to indicate how greatly Hoyt depended on fast movement for his effects . In all copies the punctuation is so unbelievably bad that I have repunctuated according to decent standards and modern demand .

And her sister ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Oh , she 's engaged . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Engaged ? Who to ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Why , Tom Harding . May 's very spoons on Tom . Snag . Littleton Snaggs May , and her sister ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Oh , Rose is charming . Going to marry me . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Poor girl , poor girl . Gil . Gilly Spooner Sir ! Snag . Littleton Snaggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Brother ? There is no brother . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Of course not ; but  --  er  --  what is her name ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Perhaps you mean Teddy . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Yes , that 's it : Teddy . How is Teddy ? Gil . Gilly Spooner Just the same : harum-scarum , ne'er-do-well . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Too bad , too bad . Prettiest girl of the lot . Gil . Gilly Spooner Oh , you 're wrong ! Rose is far prettier . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Nothing of the sort , sir ! Rose is pretty , but Teddy is a beauty . Gil . Gilly Spooner Well , we wo n't quarrel about it . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Now then , when the ladies are ready , we 'll proceed to business . See here , it 's pleasant out-of-doors . Better bring a table out , and have the will read outside here . Gil . Gilly Spooner I 'll see to it . Exit Gilly to cottage Snag . Lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! Do n't know much , but he 's not to blame for that . Lots just like him . And he 's a frightful bad judge of beauty . Why , Teddy is far prettier than her sister ! I can see it . It takes a mighty pretty girl to look handsome to you after she has played a dozen practical jokes on you . But Teddy does , and it 's not paid-for good looks , either . She does n't trouble the dressmaker . I think she 'd be happy in a hat of this description . Holds up hat . Brick flies over . Snaggs rises and looks around ; then sits Ha ! Somebody trying to get square with the hotel . Probably Grimes . That Grimes is evidently a desperate character . Teddy ought not to associate with him . She should go into refined society . I do n't see why an ordinary brush and comb would n't make her hair look decent , and there is no good reason why she should wear men 's shoes size No. 8 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in the land chose to ride a horse as Teddy does , sidesaddles would never have been invented . Holds up hat and scratches head . Brick flies and strikes hat . He starts up . C. Great heavens ! That 's Grimes ! I 'll bring action ! Teddy laughs No , it 's Teddy ! Teddy , where are you ? Enter Teddy , with pole , which she drops on stage Ted . Te ddy Keys Here I am . I 've been trying for ten minutes to hit that . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Hit what ? Ted . Teddy Keys Why , that ! Knocks hat up . When it falls , Snaggs puts it on hotel steps Grimes calls ' em dicers . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Pretty , but unlaundered . Ted . Teddy Keys Say , why do n't you wear a white hat ? The bloods all do . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Thank the Lord , I 'm not a blood . Business of shaking hands . Teddy pulls him from R. to L. Snaggs falls on hands and knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes him Teddy , this is not the way to treat a friend . Ted . Teddy Keys Oh , I believe in a good , hearty greeting . Makes you feel at home . Snag . Littleton Snaggs How are you ? Ted . Teddy Keys Oh , I 'm pretty comfortable . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Well , that 's right . But why do n't you ask how I am ? Ted . Teddy Keys Do n't want to know . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Do n't you care whether I 'm well or sick ? Ted . Teddy Keys Yes , I 'd rather you 'd be well . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Yet you said you did n't care . Ted . Te ddy Keys Well , I did n't just mean that , but I did n't quite like to ask you how you were . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Why not ? Ted .

If you knew that Tom and May were in the parlor courting , I 'll bet you a pretty you 'd be just as apt as I would to have business under the parlor window . Snag . Littleton Snaggs I believe I would . Teddy brings down chair . When Snaggs approaches to take it , she twirls it on one leg so that it strikes his shins ; he tries to take it three times during the succeeding dialogue Well , Teddy , are you glad to see me ? Ted . Teddy Keys Yes , indeed , I am . Mike 's been sick for three days , and I 've been dreadful lonesome . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Hm , yes . Too bad about Mike . Who 's Mike ? Ted .

Mike 's dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snag . Littleton Snaggs Well , I 'll be hanged if I do n't think I 'm better company than a donkey . Ted . Teddy Keys I du n no . He 's so different from you . He 's so lively . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Thank you . I 'm glad I 'm different . Ted . Teddy Keys Say , would you kick Grimes into the pool and then squeal ? Snag . Littleton Snaggs I would . Teddy , D.C. , takes frog from her pocket unseen by Snaggs Ted . T eddy Keys The donkey did , and when Grimes got out he grabbed a board and made him squeal some more . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Good for Grimes . Laughs Ted . Teddy Keys Mr. Snaggs , why do n't you wear a larger coat ? One that would fit a shorter man . The bloods all do . Snaggs rises from chair , looks at coat , back to Teddy Mr. Snaggs , do you see May at the parlor window ? Teddy puts frog down his back Snag .

Littleton Snaggs I 'd like to sing like a parrot  --  all swear-words . Damn ! Ted . Teddy KeysCrosses to him You must n't swear within half a mile of any house in this town . Snag . Littleton Snaggs I must remember that . Crosses to corner R. Ted . Teddy Keys Hold on ! I 'll fish for you . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Hold on , Teddy . There 's no law to justify you in putting a frog down my back . Ted . Teddy KeysGets fishing-pole . Puts line down his back Sh ! I think I have a nibble . Hi ! Jerks up pole . Snaggs jumps up and yells Snag . Littleton Snaggs Oh , you 've hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going ? Snag . Littleton Snaggs Half a mile into the country . Rushes out L. Ted . Teddy Keys He 's awful funny . I do wish I could make him sing . Enter Grimes and Dolly , R.3 . Gri . Jonas Grimes Maybe you think a man 's of no account . Ted . Teddy Keys Say , what 's the row ? Dol . Dolly Dobbs Mr. Grimes has been very disagreeable . He says woman is inferior to man . Ted . Teddy KeysRushes Grimes to corner , R. What ! Gri . Jonas Grimes Hold on , hold on , I say ! I merely told her that scientists said so . I read it in a paper . Ted . Teddy Keys Do n't you take any stock in science , Grimes ? Gri . Jonas Grimes Well , probably you know . Ted . Teddy Keys Of course I do . I know all about science . That 's just where I live . Say , are you busy ? Grimes goes upstage , but watches Teddy Are you very busy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.

Enter Snaggs with frog in hand from L. Snag . Littleton Snaggs With such evidence as this , I actually think I could get a verdict . Ted . Teddy Keys I did catch him after all ! I knew I should . That 's the jolliest fishing I ever had . Let 's try it again . Snag . Littleton Snaggs Well , I should say not ! Throws frog down . Goes R. As I once said to a jury  --  Ted . Teddy Keys What 's a jury ? Snag . Littleton Snaggs A jury , Teddy , is a body of twelve men organized for the purpose of deciding which party to a lawsuit has the smartest lawyer .

Teddy KeysWho has been looking for frog and ca n't find it Say , where did you throw that frog ? Sees frog , picks it up , and puts it in her pocket Snag .

As I once remarked to the jury  --  set down  --  Teddy sits  --  regarding certain evidence introduced by the other side , " May it please Your Honor , this evidence is as much out of place as a parrot in a Sunday School .

Littleton SnaggsReads " Know all men by these presents , that I , Jotham Keys , of the town of Leominster , state of Massachusetts , being of sound and disposing mind , do hereby declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating my bequests , I have a few suggestions to offer . A homely woman has a hard time in this world ; a pretty one may be a fool , but she will get a husband . Beauty , I am also aware , is a matter of opinion . We are apt to consider the people we like beautiful . Therefore , the only competent judge of beauty is a total stranger to the person judged . For these reasons , I direct that my property consisting of the Grand View Hotel , cottage , and personal property , etc. , etc. , be disposed of as follows : The hotel shall be opened within one month of the date of my death , and the first drummer who is a total stranger , that shall arrive at the hotel , shall be requested to decide which of my three nieces , otherwise the Bunch of Keys , Rose , May , and Theodosia Keys , is the homeliest  --  " Omnes .

Teddy is willing to cook or do anything that is required . Teddy 's a treasure , but I do n't think I 'd have discovered it if it had n't been for the opportunity of getting this hotel with her . Queer how a rich girl 's good points stand out more prominently than a poor one 's . There was Matilda . I wonder where 's Matilda . Teddy 's a far prettier girl than Matilda .

You economize on the width to be enabled to furnish enough to sweep the ground . If this is style , I do n't like it . How can anybody dance with a train like that switching about one 's heels ? It 's the most uncomfortable dress I ever had on . I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tightly I ca n't draw a long breath . When I sent for the fashion plate , they sent me a fan with it . A fan is no use to cool one , but it 's mighty convenient to flirt with . Now how do they curtsy to a partner ? Curtsies and stumbles Why , one of these things in a ballroom with a thousand people carrying on a conversation must be worse than death . Fancy saying to Mr. Alphonso Jones : " Now , really , you do n't mean it ! You say that you do , but you do n't ! You men are such flirts . What 's that ? Will I dance with you ? But I have just danced with you . Will I waltz with you ? Then I will . Here 's my card . Now , do n't put down more than one ! I waltz nicely ? Ah , you say that to every girl in the room !

Teddy Keys Grimes , he 's a lawyer , and you know what tricky fellows these lawyers are . If he calls you Grimesy , no good will come of it .
