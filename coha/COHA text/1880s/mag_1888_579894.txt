THE TELEPHONE CASES . ON the 19th of March , 1888 , the Supreme Court of the United States reassembled in Washington , after the usual spring vacation . It was generally expected that the long-deferred decision in the telephone suits would then be made , and the court-room was filled with inventors , lawyers , and shareholders who had taken part in the protracted and bitter contest over Mr. Bell 's patent , and whose fortune in some cases , whose fame in others , depended upon the result . The audience , on this occasion , were not disappointed , for the Chief Justice announced that the court was prepared to render its judgment in the six causes known as the Telephone Suits . " But , " he added , " as the opinion is rather long , and my voice is weak and not under control , I have asked Judge Blatchford to read it . " These were his last words in the Supreme Court , for he was then suffering from the disease which ended in his death , a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which was read for him in the deep and somewhat tense silence of the court-room , proved to be the final act of his public career . That opinion , as everybody knows , decided - and doubtless the decision will be accepted by history - that Mr. Alexander Graham Bell was the first inventor of the telephone , and that neither Reis , the German professor , nor anybody else succeeded in transmitting human speech by the aid of electricity until Mr. Bell had shown the world how it could be done . Three judges dissented from the opinion , holding that Daniel Drawbaugh , an intelligent mechanic of Eberly 's Mills , Pennsylvania , had invented and used a complete telephone , much better than any that Bell ever devised , years before the latter made his discovery . The dissenting judges did not deny that Mr. Bell also was an original inventor of the telephone , and that it was he who introduced it to public use . " We have nothing to say , " Mr. Justice Bradley remarked , " depreciatory of Mr. Bell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that this obscure mechanic did do the thing , and that he is entitled to the merit of being the first inventor . " Whatever Daniel Drawbaugh had done or attempted in this line ( and I shall glance at his history in a subsequent article ) , it is well known tb*at about the year 1875 the transmission of speech by electricity was a problem with which many able invent-ors were struggling , and there was a general feeling that it would be solved before long . A word or two as to the manner in which speech is produced will show what the probleni was , and enable the reader to understand how much or how little had already been accomplished . When one speaks , what he does is to set in vibration the particles of air with which he is surrounded . Motion is communicated from one particle to another in the air , just as it is communicated from one particle to another in water , when the wind springs up and waves are formed . In each case , the particles move only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is communicated to the adjoining particles , and the same character is preserved just so far as the movement extends . It would be erroneous , however , to conceive that the vibrations of the air take the shape of waves , like those of the sea ; they are not curved , but move in a straight line , and they cover a very small space , - usually about one one - hundred - thousandth of an inch . The particles of air , when words are spoken , are first crowded together , and then , when the pressure is removed , their elasticity comes into 1888. 113 // play , and causes them to resume their former place . Waves require a surface , but the air is all about us ; we are below it as well as above it . The movement of air particles during speech has been illustrated as follows - " If you are in a tightly packed and excited crowd , you are pressed on all sides ; but as the people in the crowd sway a little , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little more elbow-room . You and each of your neighbors touch each other all the time ; but if the people in the part where you are move closer together , in their efforts to see something , you are pressed a little more ; if some of them are attracted to turn and move a little away from you , you are pressed less . These movements of greater or less pressure are due to a slight to-andfro movement of the different individuals composing the crowd . " Such is the case with the air particles . Under the influence of the voice or some sounding body , those immediately near it are first , perhaps , pressed together ; presently , by virtue of their elasticity , they spring apart a little more widely than they were before , and thus zones of condensation or rarefaction are produced . These zones of disturbance are propagated onward at the rate of about 1120 feet a second , very much as sea waves are propagated onward , without any traveling motion of the air or water itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as these zones are produced by and correspond to the slight vibratory motions of the air particles , it is found more convenient to study the motions of the particles themselves . " This to-and-fro , or vibratory , motion o*2 the air , being started by the speaker , and communicating itself gradually but speedily to all the air particles that lie between him and the listener , finally impinges upon the drum of the listener 's ear . The drum is a diaphragm , which is alternately pushed and pulled forward and backward as the vibrating particles strike against it or recede from it , according to their condensation or rarefaction . The motions of the drum are communicated to the interior parts of the ear , which in turn act upon the auditory nerves , conveying through them to the brain , in some unexplained manner , the impression of sound . If each vibration occupied the same length of time , the matter would be a very simple one ; but the duration of each condensation ( which forms the first half of the vibration ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which forms the second half ) , differs , or may differ , widely from that of the others . Moreover , - and here lies the chief difficulty , - the character of each vibration , which will be explained presently , continually varies . Shortly before Mr. Bell 's invention of an electric telephone , the string or mechanical telephone was much in vogue , and was sold on the streets . It was thought by most people to be a new affair ; but in reality it is a very old invention , dating back almost , if not quite , two hundred years . The " string telephone " is easily constructed by taking a small cylindrical tin box , knocking out the bottom , and affixing in its place a diaphragm of bladder or parchment . The diaphragms of two such devices are connected by a string , or , better yet , by a wire . When one of the boxes is spoken into , the diaphragm vibrates in accordance with the air particles thus set in motion ; the vibrations are taken up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other diaphragm , which in turn sets the air particles in its vicinity vibrating , and thus the sound is repeated . By using a wire supported by poles , the mechanical telephone can be made to transmit speech about a quarter of a mile . The problem , then , in 1875 , was to substitute electricity for the string or wire in the mechanical telephone , and // to make an electric current the conveyer of those sound vibrations in which human speech consists . This problem , for reasons now to be explained ( although they may be perfectly familiar to the reader ) , was much more difficult than it appeared to uninstructed persons ; and in fact , the more a man knew about acoustics and electricity , the more likely he would be to despair of a successful solution . The air vibrations or sound waves have been described already in a general way ; but the differences between them , which constitute the differences between one word and another , have not yet been indicated . There are three respects in which one sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudness . The next is that of pitch ; sounds may differ in loudness while they are the same in pitch , and they may differ in pitch although they are the same in loudness . But a note of a certain pitch sounded with a certain loudness on a violin is distinguishable from a note of the same pitch sung with the same loudness by the human voice . These differences in the character of sound , which are neither loudness nor pitch , are known te0hnically as differences of timbre or " quality . " Quality , then , embraces all the differences which distinguish words from other sounds and from each other . In order to transmit words , therefore , it is necessary to reproduce the quality of the sound , a reproduction of the pitch , merely , being of no avail . Such being the differences in sound , what are the mechanical differences in the air vibrations which correspond to them ? The particles of air , when set in motion by the human organs of speech , vibrate , as has been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , usually rather less than that which would be measured by one one-hundredthousandth of an inch . The pitch of a sound is determined by the time which it takes the air particle to perform this complete vibratory movement to and fro . Ordinarily , it moves over its path and back again in one one-hundredth of a second ; it may do so in half that time , in which case the pitch will be an octave higher than it was in the former instance . But the length of the path , although always very small , varies in accordance with the violence of the impetus given to the air particle ; and this length , or " amplitude , " as it is called , determines the loudness of the sound . If the air particle which has been supposed in the preceding paragraph vibrates through an increased range , but in the same time , by moving at a faster rate , then the pitch will remain the same , and the loudness will be greater . But we have not yet arrived at those differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are summed up by the terms " character , " " timbre , " or " quality . " Given the length of the path over which the air particle vibrates ( which is loudness ) , and given the time allowed for its vibration ( which is pitch ) , it is obvious that it may perform this journey in countless different ways . It may pass at a uniform rate , and stop ; it may go fast at first , then slower , then fast again , and so on ; it may go part of the way at a certain speed , then return on itself at a different speed , then go forward again at still another rate , and yet reach its goal at the appointed time . It is these eccentricities of travel , so to say , irrespective of the length of the journey or of the time occupied in performing it , which determine the quality of sound and distinguish one word from another . It is plain that in 1875 the apparent difficulty of transmitting sound vibrations by electricity must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , measure in space less than one onehundred-thousandth of an inch , and in time they measure one one-hundredth of a second at the most ; yet the vibration itself may be reproduced accurately , // so far as its length and time are concerned , without reproducing speech : it is the peculiarities of the vibration , so minute that they take place within these excessively small limits of time and space , and so complex that they correspond to all possible words , which must be copied by the electric current . It is no wonder , then , that the persons who knew most about the subject were , as a rule , the least inclined to believe that a telephone was possible . This knowledge , how ever , - that is , knowledge of the wonderfully minute and complex movements of the air particles by which the quality of spoken words is produced , - was not common , even among men of science , until the year 1862 , when Helmholtz published his famous work upon the subject . Before that time , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gained a more correct notion ) that " the endless variety of tones depends entirely upon the rapidity and amplitude of the sound waves . " The " rapidity and amplitude of the sound waves " do determine , as we have seen , the pitch and loudness of the sound ; but they have nothing to do with the " endless variety of tones . " The quotation just made is taken from a magazine published at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1854 . The writer was an ingenious Frenchman , named Bourseul , from whom Philipp Reis is supposed to have derived much inspiration ; and in this article Bourseul predicted that speech would some day be transmitted by electricity , not knowing the difficulty of the achievement . He said : - " Suppose that a man speaks near av movable disc , sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice ; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery . You may have at a distance another disc , which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations . . . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech will be transmitted by electricity . I have made some experiments iii this direction . They are delicate , and demand time and patience ; but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result . " It will be noticed that Bourseul speaks of his disc or diaphragm as alternately making and breaking the current ; and this alternate make and break of the current , in obedience to the movements of the diaphragm spoken against , was an essential feature in the apparatus which Philipp Reis constructed a few years later . Reis used a wooden box , with a membrane of thin sausage-skin stretched across an opening on one side of the box . ( So far he copied the mechanical or string telephone . ) A light piece of metal or two pieces joined together , so that the whole was shaped like the two equal sides of a triangle , projected over the membrane , the two ends of the piece being provided with short legs , which were fastened to the framework about the membrane or diaphragm . The angle of this metal piece was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle was attached a little foot of platinum , which , in turn , rested upon another small piece of platinum affixed to the centre of the diaphragm . Such electrical connections were made that a current passed into the metal piece at one of its open ends , and so through the platinum foot , through the platinum piece attached to the diaphragm , and off over a wire to the receiver . The receiver consisted simply of a coil of wire , inside of which was a knitting-needle , the whole being placed upon a sounding board . The operation of this apparatus was as follows : When musical sounds were produced in the transmitter , the vibrating air particles thus set in motion beat against the membrane , and caused it to move upward , so that the platinum foot of the steel piece or hopper resting on the membrane was thrown up at each vibration , as a boy is tossed in a blanket . The effect of this was of // course to break the current , by momentary severing of the contact , and the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of vibration ) was copied by the current passing over the wire . The needle in the middle of the coil at the end of the wire was alternately magnetized and demagnetized , as the current was made and broken , and this operation had the effect of changing its size correspondingly , though in the slightest degree . These slight and imperceptible changes in the needle were , however , sufficient to move the air particles in its vicinity , causing them to vibrate in exact accordance with the broken electric current ; and the air vibrations thus caused being the same in duration as those originally started at the transmitter , the pitch of the sound there made was reproduced . Pitch merely , not quality , was transmitted by this instrument , because it was a circuit - breaker . Pitch , as we have seen , corresponds to and varies with the time consumed by the vibration of the air particles . Pitch , in other words , is the measure , in time , of vibration ; and inasmuch as in Reis 's apparatus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did reproduce pitch . It did not reproduce words , because many vibrations must take place in the creation of a single word , and the sound of the word depends on the form of these vibrations ; but if the current breaks at each vibration , the word is chopped in pieces , and can not , of course , be repeated . For the same reason , this contrivance did not , except very imperfectly , transmit the loudness of the sound , or , in other words , the amplitude of vibration , the break in the current being made in accordance with the time ( pitch ) occupied by the vibration , and not in accordance with the length or amplitude ( loudness ) of the vibration . The instruments of Reid were made in various forms early in the sixties , and although Helmholtz 's full exposition of . quality or timbre was published in 1862 , neither Reis nor anybody else profited by his discoveries until the time of Bell . The apparatus of Reis , though not practically useful , was a great invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was sold extensively in Europe and in England as a curiosity , and Professor Henry procured a Reis telephone for the Smithsonian Institution at Washington . Perhaps , indeed , the conc*ption that the electric current might be made to repeat and transmit sound vibrations , and the imperfect means to that end which Reis devised , constituted as great an advance , intellectually speaking , as the subsequent discovery made by Mr. Bell . However this may be , Reis was , as we have seen , on the wrong track ; his theory , though right so far as the transmission of pitch goes , was essentially wrong so far as the transmission of quality is concerned . It is true , therefore , as Judge Lowell said , in the first suit upon Mr. Bell 's patent , - and it would be difficult to overestimate the value to the Bell Company of his remark : " A century of Reis would never have produced a speaking telephone by mere improvement in construction . " But the peculiar and the striking fact about the Reis apparatus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a practical telephone . It is necessary only so to adjust the metal piece or armature that the platinum foot in which it ends shall always be in contact with the membrane , instead of parting from it at each vibration , and the thing is done . In that case , and provided that one speaks gently into the transmitter , the diaphragm is always in circuit with the hopping-piece , the contact is never broken , the vibrations of the diaphragm are copied exactly by variations or undulations in the electric current which is constantly flowing from the battery . These variations magnetize and demagnetize the knitting-needllein the coil which constitutes the receiver , and the air par- // qwq He was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , his father being a professor of vocal physiology there . The son followed in his father 's steps , and before reaching the age of twenty-three years had made a profound study of articulate speech . He was familiar with the work of Helmholtz , and had some knowledge of electricity . In the fall of 1874 , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had already invented , and the telephone , which he hoped to invent . Some men of means , in whose families Mr. Bell had taught , agreed to advance the money for further experiments in the harmonic telegraph , and for taking out a patent upon it , but they had no faith in the telephone . Like most inventors , Mr. Bell was exceedingly poor ; and it was a question with him whether he should for a time abandon his teaching ( the only means of support he had ) , and borrow a little money , upon which he might live until he had either failed or succeeded with his great project of the telephone . He decided to take this bold step , gave up his pupils , and staked his fortune on the success of the invention . Before the summer of 1874 was out , Mr. Bell had conceived the apparatus which he patented two years later , although - and this is another singular fact in the history of the telephone - he believed it to be defective , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , when he accidentally discovered that the supposed defect did not exist . Without attempting to analyze the different steps of the intellectual process by which Mr. Bell finally arrived at his invention , it will be sufficient to describe the apparatus which he first designed . This was very simple . It consisted , to begin with , like the string telephone , of a box or funnel , as a transmitter , over an opening in which was stretched a membrane . To this membrane a soft-iron armature was attached . Directly in front of the arniature , but not quite in contact with it , was the core of a magnetized electro-magnet . It is well known that when a piece of iron or steel , like an armature , is moved toward and away from such a core , an electrical disturbance is produced in the coils surrounding the core . When the armature is moved toward the core , an electrical flow takes place through the coils in one direction ; when the armature is withdrawn again , an electrical flow in the other direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the armature is kept still , but whenever the armature moves the current is started , and it moves in the same direction and with the same degree of violence as the armature . When words are spoken in the transmitter above described , the vibrations of the air particles thus caused are repeated in the diaphragm , and the vibration of the diaphragm causes the armature attached to it to move forward and back in front of the electro-magnet . Of course the vibrations thus transmitted are the same in the armature as they were in the air , and consequently the electrical disturbances produced in the coils of the magnet by the movement of the armature also correspond to the air vibrations . The same operation , but in the inverse order , occurs at the receiving station . The electrical changes produced in the electro-magnet near the transmitter are conveyed along the wire to another electromagnet , which attracts and repels an armature ; this armature , in turn , communicates to the diaphragm attached to it the same vibrations ; the air , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm , and thus the sound is reproduced . This contrivance Mr. Bell had devised by the fall of 1874 , and he described it then to Dr. C. J. Blake , of Biston . But the apparatus had never been constructed , for Mr. Bell ( and Dr. Blake agreed with him ) felt sure that it would not operate , and that further improvements were necessary . He considered that the very slight current which would be de // veloped would be too weak altogether to transmit the countless and complex Vanations which should correspond to the form of vibration assumed by the air particles . Other persons skilled in electrical science , with whom Mr. Bell consulted , were of the same opinion ; and indeed , the more thoroughly anybody had mastered what was known at that date about the electric current , the more sure he would have been that Mr. Bell 's invention was not yet complete . The seeming reasonableness of this view may be gathered from the fact that the current generated by the Bell telephone is about one thousand million times weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in great straits , harassed for money , overworked , and anxious . At Christmas time he was at home in Canada for a few days , and his father 's diary contains these significant items - " Sunday , Dec. 27 , 1874 . Long talk on multiple teleg. and speech trans . Al . his son sanguine . " Tuesday , Dec. 29 , 1874 . Talking half the night , motor and telephone . " A month or two later , Mr. Bell was in Washington on business connected with his invention of the ha1*monic telegraph , and he had an interview with Professor Henry , which he described as follows in a letter to his father and mother - " I felt so much encouraged by his interest that I determined to ask his advice about the apparatus I have designed for the transmission of the human voice by telegraph . I explained the idea , and said , What would you advise me to do - publish it amid let others work it out , or attempt to solve the problem myself ? ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention , and advised me to work at it myself instead of publishing . I said that I recognized the fact that there were mechanical difficulties in the way that rendered the plan impracticable at the present time . I added that I felt that I had not the electrical knowledge necessary to overcome the difficulties . His laconic answer , was GET IT . ' I can not tell you how much these two words have encouraged me . I live too much in an atmosphere of discouragement for scientific pursuits . Good is , unfortunately , one of the cui bono people , and is too much in the habit of looking at the dark side of things . Such a chimerical idea as telegraphing vocal sounds would indeed to most minds seem scarcely feasible enough to spend time in working over . " Again , a month later , he wrote as follows : - " I have just returned from my trip to New York , thoroughly worn out ; found your letters of the 14th inst. awaiting me . I am now beginning to realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the apparatus that of the harnionic multiple telegraph as thoroughly as possible , I have decided to give up all professional work for some weeks . I have put off all pupils and classes until the 12th of April . Flesh and blood could not stand much longer such a strain as I have had upon me . " At this time , then , Mr. Bell had real* ly invented the telephone , without knowing it ; that is , he was not aware that the exceedingly minute and complex vibrations of the air particles would yet move the diaphragm and armature with sufficient force to generate a current of electricity which would reproduce and transmit the sound vibrations . He knew that the principle of his apparatus was correct , excepting for the lack of power ; and an accident disclosed the fact that , contrary to his belief , the current generated by the armature vibrations in front of the electro-magnet was at least strong enough to reproduce thedoudness of a sound . In the course of some oxperimemmts with the harmonic telegraph apparatus , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitting instrument with his hand , and simultaneously a sound was heard at the // receiving instrument . A mere trembling of the armature of one instrument had , apparently , produced an audible sound at the other ; and if this were so , then the strength of the armature vibrations had been very much underestimated . " The moment the discovery was made , " says Mr. Bell , " the practicability of the speaking telephone devised by me in 1874 flashed upon me , and I instantly gave instructions to have the instrument made . " But this instrument was imperfectly constructed , and the membrane broke at the first trial . Mr. Bell still supposed that some means must be devised to increase the strength of the electric current , before quality as well as loudness could be transmitted by his apparatus . On the same day , he wrote as follows - " I have accidentally made a discovery of the very greatest importance in regard to the transmitting instruments . - . . I have succeeded to-day in transmitting signals without any battery whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equivalent of that at the transmitting end in loudness as well as pitch . " And a month later , in a letter to the same person , he said ? - " I feel sure that a study of Ladd 's or Wilde 's magneto-electric machine will reveal a means of increasing the intensity of the induced currents . I am told that Professor Lovering has one of Wilde 's instruments in his possession , so I shall call upon him to-morrow for information concerning it . " This was in June , 1875 . Mr. Bell was laboring under great difficulties . A legal controversy in regard to the harmonic telegraph was pending between him and Mr. Gray ; he was obliged to live on money which he borrowed upon the strength of the tuition fees that he expected to earn during the succeeding winter . It was very difficult for him to prosecute his experiments , for he was not a skilled workman , and he could ill afford to buy tools or to hire assistance . Shortly before , he had written to his father : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Morse conquered his electrical difficulties , though he was only a painter , and I do n't intend to give in , either , till all is completed . " And yet he had reached the goal , though he did not know it : he had but to stretch out his hand , and pluck the fruit which he had been seeking . After some further and more successful experiments , in the fall of 1875 he drew his application for a patent . It was t*ken to Washington early in December by one of Mr. Bell 's partners in the harmonic telegraph , but this cautious person came back just before Christmas , having done nothing with it . Finally , after many delays and disappointments , the application was filed in February , 1876 ; and even up to that time Mr. Bell had never succeeded in transmitting speech through the telephone . This highly interesting and significant fact was brought out in the subsequent litigation , and on it were based many ineffectual arguments against the validity of the patent . It is undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that he had done would have been held to anticipate a subsequent inventor . But this only serves to show the mathematical accuracy of his reasoning , and the firmness of his intellectual grasp . He bad not himself made a telephonic apparatus which was a practical device , but he described it in his specification , so that skilled workmen , following his directions , were able to construct operative instruments . The patent was barely sufficient for this , but still it was sufficient , and thus the invention was saved to the inventor . The telephone first came into public notice at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition . It had been arranged that on Sunday , June 25 , 1876 , a private entertainment should be given to a few // distinguished persons by Mr. Elisha Gray , a well-known electrician and inventor . Mr. Gray desired to show his harmonic multiple telegraph for sending numerous messages at one time over a single wire , by means of musical notes . Sunday was chosen , because on that day the main hail , where the instruments were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too might display an invention on this occasion , not mentioning what it was , and he was told , in substance , that if any odds and ends of time were left over , after Mr. Gray 's apparatus had been shown , he might occupy them . Among the company were Sir William Thomson and the Emperor of Brazil . The day was intensely hot . Mr. Gray 's explanation and exhibition of his invention had already detained the audience beyond the luncheon hour , and they were extremely anxious to get away . However , they curbed their impatience , and Mr. Bell was allowed to proceed . Presently , he sent his assistant to the further end of the line , and , putting the receiver to his ear , he repeated what he heard . This aroused the tired audience . Sir William Thomson rose from his seat , saying , " I will go and speak , myself ; " and Professor Barker took the receiver . " I heard , " he relates , " the well-known accents of Sir William Thomson 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A moment later I heard him say , Ay , there s the rub , ' and repeated the words to the company . I then passed the receiver to the Emperor . He placed it to his ear with an expression of doubt upon his countenance ; but immediately this expression changed , and he repeated slowly the words , To be , or not to be . ' " The Emperor hastily put down the receiver , and started away to the transmitting end . Mr. Gray then took the receiver . " I listened intently , " he says , " for some moments , hearing a very faint , ghostly , ringing sort of sound , and finally I thought I caught the words , Ay , there s the rub ; ' I turned to the audience , repeating these words , and they cheered . " On his return to England , at a meeting of the British Association , Sir William Thomson gave the following account of what he saw and heard at Philadelphia on this hot Sunday : - " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , ' Ay , there s the rub , ' through an electric telegraph wire ; but , scorning monosyllables , the electric articulation rose to higher flights , and gave me passages taken at random from the New York newspapers ; S. S. Cox has arrived ' ( I failed to make out the S. S. Cox . ' ) ; The city of New York ; ' Senator Morton ; ' The Senate has resolved to print a thousand extra copies ; The Americans in London have resolved to celebrate the coming Fourth of July . ' All this my own ears heard , spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the thin , circular disc armature of just such another little electro-magnet as the one which I now hold in my hand . . . . This , the greatest by far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph , is due to a young countryman of our own , Mr. Graham Bell , of Edinburgh and Montreal and Boston , now becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States . Who can but admire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the mathematical conception that if electricity is to convey all the delicacies of quality which distinguish articulate speech , the strength of its current must vary continuously , and as nearly as may be in simple proportion to the velocity of a particle of air engaged in constituting the sounds ? " Mr. Bell 's work was now done , and his fame assured . Other inventors took up the telephone and made the improvements to which it owes a large part of its commercial value . A great corporation was formed to manage and develop the business founded upon the patent . Lawyers were employed to defend it , 122 July , // and others were engaged to pick a flaw in it , if any such might be found . State Street took an interest in the invention , and the possibility of great wealth began to dawn upon the owners of the patent , and upon others who thought they saw how it might be evaded . Litigation soon began , and learned experts were called in , college professors and the like , who swore with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more and more common in all parts of the country . An army of mechanics , clerks , and laborers were occupied in constructing , maintaining , and operating it , and a vastly greater army of practical persons were employing it every day in their business . What was the source of all this activity , physical and intellectual ? It was a scientific and mathematical problem , worked out in a garret by a penniless teacher of deaf mutes . Man is a thieving , rapacious creature ; if he were not , there would be no patents and no courts ; but it is impossible to contemplate such inventions as the telephone without considering that he is also a wonderfully clever animal .
