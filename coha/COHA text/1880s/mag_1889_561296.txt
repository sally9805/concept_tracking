EIGHT men of every ten in this conntry , who have thought upon the subject , have reached the conclusion that Canada ought to belong to the United States . This decision has not been reached by an elaborate process of reasoning , nor by a mature consideration of the consequences of such an event . The general belief that the United States comprises nearly all that is worth having on the continent makes it easy for the average American to jump to the conclusion that what remains ought to be included within the Union . Without realizing the magnitude of the country to the north , or making any estimate of its possibilities , the general conclusion is that its addition to the United States would not disturb or imperil the existing system . A more careful study of the matter might lead to a different conclusion ; but , in view of the feeling which now prevails , the eventual acquisition of Canada as a National policy would be approved by an immense majority . While the opinion that Canada should belong to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than peaceable means . In the event of war with England , public sentiment would entirely change , and Canada would then be the battle-ground . It might even happen that a persistence by the Canadian Government in a nagging and unfriendly policy , as shown in the harsh and antiquated interpretation of the Fishery Treaty , the constant invitation to retaliation by acts of bad neighborhood , by hostile tariffs and other irritating influences , might work up a sentiment in the United States that would demand and justify the military capture of Canada . If , indeed , the antiBritish vote in the United States had any real influence upon the policy of the country ( which it has not ) , some military advan // tage might be taken of Canada 's weakness , by reason of its remoteness from Great Britain and the enormous preponderance of the United States . But up to the present hour there is not the slightest sign , in any class or in any direction , of a desire to acquire Canada other than by the free and unbiassed consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth , that eight of every ten men in the United States would like to see Canada a part of the Union , it could , until recently , with equal truth be alleged that , in Canada , eight of every ten Canadians preferred to preserve existing political conditions and to remain part and parcel of the British Empire . An agitation for closer commercial relations , which have been denied to them ; a persistence in a restrictive and offensive policy toward the United States , and an attempt to divert public opinion in favor of some form of Imperial Federation with other colonies , have , it is true , created a sentiment in favor of annexation nearly as pronounced as the Tory manifesto of 1849 . This tendency has recently been quickened by the encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church and its evident hold upon legis. lation , as evinced in large grants of public money to Jesuits in Quebec , which were afterwards confirmed by a preponderating vote of the Dominion Parliament . It is true that this growth of the annexation sentiment is dellied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its existence for any present political purpose is ignored . Yet it is claimed by some observers that , if a secret ballot were taken in Canada today on the question , a majority of the voters would be found to favor a political union . But the fact that a secret ballot would have to be taken in order to evoke any pronounced opinion in its behalf is the significant circumstance by which the force of the movement is to be judged . No man , however favorable he may be to a political union between the two countries , can believe that such a revolution in public sentiment is possible as would elect within a period of twenty years a Parliament whose main plank should be annexation to the United States . True , now and then there are indications of a growing party in favor of political union ; but their rarity and inconsequent character show that , while the sentiment may be a growing one , many years will pass before it is sufficiently effective to become a force in practical politics . // The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political condition . In the absence of universal suffrage , and wanting the constant additions of a foreign vote which threatens the political extinction of the American ; in the absence also of an elective judiciary ; with a system of government less dependent upon the corner saloon , the professional politician , and the ward boss ; with an admirable code of election laws , under which bribery Is difficult , if not impossible ; and with many other improvements upon the American system , the political contentment of the Canadian is assured . Aside from this , there is a sincere and ardent attachment to British institutions , and especially to the person of Her Majesty , Queen Victoria . It could hardly fail to be otherwise . England has treated Canada with the utmost liberality , and it has often been said that if , prior to the Revolution , Great Britain had treated the colonies with the same consideration and cooperation , there would have been no I ) eclarat.ion of Independence . Made up as Canada largely is of descendants of United Empire Loyalists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between whom and the mother-country there is a close business and social connection , how is it possible that au allegiance so constant and beneficial should be suddenTly and without justification severed ? This is all the more unlikely when it is recalled that there is now a steady stream of immigration into the great Northwest , made up of English people who deliberately prefer to live under British rule . Perhaps the most serious barrier , however , to the vital change in the political condition of Canada which would follow annexation to the United States is the French Canadian element , under the dominant influence of the Roman Catholic Church . It may be doubted if anywhere else in the world this great clerical institution rules more absolutely than in Quebec . Elsewhere its power and influence diminish ; its wealth is stationary or decreases ; but here in free North America , in the Nineteenth Century , the Roman Catholic Church is becoming so dominant , so successful in a business point of view , and so generally aggressive , as to create serious alarm for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The marvellous fecundity of the French race , their thrift , industry , and contentment , are elements of vital strength in this religious propaganda ; and // already considerable areas , formerly jointly occupied by Protestant and Catholic communities , are given up to French domination . Special privileges , the right to levy tithes , protection , and other important advantages are assured to the French church under existing political conditions . These , it is feared , would be materially lessened should annexation to the United States ever occur . The complete control of education , the possession of vast estates for religious purposes , freedom from taxation , and public grants could hardly be tolerated in a free State of the Union ; while , above and beyond all , would be feared the danger of an influx into Quebec of intelligent Protestants , owing to the development of natural resources and the increase of foreign capital . The influences of a progressive spirit , greater intelligence , higher forms of education , and freedom of inquiry into the power and influence of the church , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . It will thus be seen that great impediments stand in the way of annexation in Quebec . On the other hand , it is a fact that recent events have so alarmed a large body of thinking Canadians that no other escape seems possible from the despotism of the church than that which a complete revolution in political conditions would afford by annexation with the United States . While this consideration may have weight with the more intelligent and independent , as a means of lessening the undue influence of the church , the very fact that it is urged with that end in view alarms the devout and arrays both priest and people against political union . Meantime an influence adverse to annexation prevails in Canada , the force and universality of which very few in the United States apprehend . It is a Protestant force , and its reason for existence is opposition to the encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church ; and yet , so pronounced is its loyalty , so prejudiced and ignorant is it in regard to the United States , that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This force is the secret society known as the Orange order , which , owing to recent events in the progress of Jesuitism , is likely to become , in conjunction with various sectarian bodies , the most powerful organization in Protestant Canada . It is impossible to conceive of a body of men more vociferously loyal to the Crown ; and in view of the antecedents of its members , // their prejudices and peculiar rites ,  --  in which an oath to maintain the British rule is the chief obligation assumed ,  --  it is difficult to see how political union can be attained while such an organization exercises an influence so powerful . Jt would , therefore , seem that two great organized forces  --  to wit , Protestant and Catholic Canada-are arrayed against any political change whatever . In considering the obstacles to a political union with the United States , nothing has been said as to the feeling of Great Britain on this question . It would seem almost incredible that the official and aristocratic class , which is so powerful in England , will favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colonial policy of Great Britain has been largely stimulated by the expectation that trade would follow the flag , and that , if the English flag ceased to be emblematic of governmental control , English trade would languish and cease . Republican sentiment in Great Britain would , it is presumed , receive an enormous impulse should these principles of government , by a single act , be extended over so large a part of the British Empire as Is included within the greater half of the continent of North America . If Great Britain has spent millions of money and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives to make conquests in distant parts of the world , it would be a complete reversal of policy to abandon or cede so great a country as Canada cheerfully and without a murmur . When one recalls how essential to her political and military supremacy is the possession of outlying posts , such as Gibraltar , Malta , Bermuda , and other strongholds , it seems incredible that she would willingly relinquish Halifax on the Atlantic or Vancouver on the Pacific . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to her vast eastern possessions , and the expectations that have been raised in the minds of English capitalists as to the development of a great eastern trade through English channels , are all opposed to the assumption that England would for a moment consider favorably a proposition that her great colony of Canada should become part and parcel of the United States . In all this enumeration , difficulties in the way of the annoxation of Canada to the United States which for the moment seem insurmountable present themselves . How many years must VOL OXLVIH. - NO. 391. 43 // elapse before these difficulties will disappear so as to permit the election of a Parliament in Canada that will demand separation from the mother-country ? How many will elapse before it puts an end to its own existence , and , filtering into a requisite number of State legislatures , merges itself into the Congress at Washington ? The possibility of such a catastrophe to the Senate of Canada , who are all selected for life and whose animating sentiment is loyalty to the British crown , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive to tell the tale . Certainly not within the present generation does such a consummation as the extinction of Parliament seem possible to the average Canadian , who is familiar with the feeling of loyalty to the British crown on the one hand , and , on the other , the political cowardice and mock sentimentality that exist throughout Canada , which , even in the presence of a marked change favorable to open trade relations with the United States , and while one-fourth of its adult population is already in this country , shrieks hysterically , " Treason ! " " Rebellion ! " Under these circumstances a political union seems too remote to justify its present consideration from a business point of view . The peculiarities of the Canadians - their sturdy AngloSaxon nature-make the task a hopeless one , either to drive or force them into submission . Moreover , the great mass of the American people would disapprove such a policy . Those who might favor it would soon find that the people at large , especially the great mass of business men , would much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a union of nations on this continent is to be brought about except by conquest , it must be brought about by a union of interests . Unless a political union can be achieved by a perfect acquiescence in the advantages and superiority of the institutions of the United States , a political union would be a serious and fatal mistake . It remains , therefore , to consider whether a Commercial Policy can not be inaugurated by both countries which will materially benefit both nations , without political union , and which might have the eventual effect of removing the obstacles to political union . There are those who think that a policy of retaliation-for which Canada has afforded abundant justification-would starve the Dominion into submission ; there are others who believe that a // 671 steady persistence in the policy of rigid and , perhaps , offensive indifference will result in Canada dropping like a ripe plum into the ever-open month of the United States . But life is too short for either of these policies to work out a union of the Englishspeaking people on this continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement in favor of a Commercial Union between the two countries has been for some time making steady progress on both sides of the border . It has met with surprising favor in the United States among merchants , bankers , and manufacturers , and especially among the intelligent class of artisans in New England industrial centres , who see in it a hopeful sign for cheapened food and a supply of raw material , on the one hand , and an enlarged market for the product of their industry , on the other . Nova Scotia to the New England States is a new Alabama , within easy reach , with resources equally important , especially to the regeneration of her iron industries . Without some such advantage these are doomed to extinction , in view of the competition of the Southern and Western States . With , however , sources of supply of iron and coal and coke from Nova Scotia , New England iron industries , with a slight reduction of taxation , should compete in all the markets of the world , owing to their advantageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the latter comprising five times the area of New York State ) there would be found supplies of raw material of the most useful character ; from the great Province of Ontario  --  the most favored spot on the continent-there would be derived an infinite variety of products , from the mine , the forc*t , and the field ; while in the enormous wheat-producing areas of the Canadian northwestern territories there would be found a receptacle for immigration from all the world , thus affording a field for western trade and for western transportation of the greatest possible consequence . As for the Pacific coast , no boon could be afforded to California and Oregon greater than is implied in the essential supplies from British Columbia of the finest coal , the largest timber , and the enormous fishing wealth which the coast of that province affords  --  a coast the extent of which the reader will realize when he is told that it covers a mileage as great as from Florida in the south to the boundary of Maine on the north . In furtherance of the pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these palpable advantages // almost immediately available , a most significant event was the passage at the close of the last session of Congress , by the ionse of Representatives , of a resolution which , had it been assented to by the Senate , would have proved a great stride towards a permanent and most beneficent settlement of all difficulties between the two nations . This resolution , the movement towards which originated in the fertile mind of the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth , but was eventually promoted by that sagacious statesman , the Hon. R. IR . llitt , of Illinois , is in the following words : Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States , etc. , That whenever it shall be duly certified to the President of the United States that the Government of the Dominion of canada has declared a desire to establish Commercial Union with the United States , having a uniform revenue system , like Internal taxes to be collected , and like import duties to be imposed , on articles brought into either country from other nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , he shall appoint three Commissioners to meet those who may be likewise designated to represent the Government of Canada , to prepare a plan for the assimilation of the import duties and internal-revenue taxes of the two countries , and an equitable division of receipts , in a Commercial Union ; and said Commissioners shall report to the President , who shall lay the report before Congress . The effect in the United States of the passage of this resolution would simply be to give shape and form to a desire for an enlarged relation with the greater half of the continent , on terms of a mutuality of interest as perfect as is possible to be created , and to disclose , as the result of inquiry , for the subsequent action of Congress , the advantages to both countries which would flow from the adoption of this policy . The effect in Canada of the adoption of such a policy by the United States would be , at the proper time , an acquiescence in it of a most marked character . The vast majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be enormously advanced by an open market in the United States and a cheapened supply of manufactured goods ,  --  composed largely as that people is of farmers , lumbermen , miners , and fishermen . These number three to one the class who would be adversely affected , such as manufacturers , artisans , and professional men . But even among these latter it is certain that a very large contingent are favorable to improved relations with this country . It is believed by those who watch the trend of affairs that a general parliamentary election , which occnrs within three years , will result in a triumph for Commercial Union , should the United States continue to offer terms similar to those set forth in the above resolution . The elec* // tion of a Parliament having a Commercial-Union complexion would result in the passage of a bill giving practical shape to the proposition above set forth . Such an event may have most momentous consequences , not only in Canada and in the United states , but upon the relations that will thereafter exist between Canada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus be created between Great Britain and her greatest colony that the attention of the people of the United States is now most earnestly asked . Heretofore the Dominion has shaped her own fiscal policy and has been permitted , in her freedom of action , to create a customs barrier against English goods in common with those from the United States and from other countries . But it is pushing this freedom of action to an extreme to ask Great Britain to consent to let one part of the British Empire charge a high rate of duty against the goods of another part of that Empire , while admitting free of duty the manufactures of the United States , her great commercial rival . It is even going a step further than this , because if the tariff under the proposed continental Commercial Union is to be regulated anywhere , it must be at Washington ; so that in the event of the Canadian Parliament passing a bill for Commercial Union with the United States , the spectacle would be presented of Congress fixing the rate of duty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as against the goods manufactured in another portion of that Empire . It will be seen , therefore , that , if the people of Canada were in earnest in their desire for open and unrestricted trade with the United States , and made such an expression of their views through Parliament ,  --  as they certainly would ,  --  the dilemma of the Imperial Government would be extreme . That Government would either have to renounce the principles of free trade which her people have preached with such force for so many years , or she would have to give perfect liberty to Canada to trade with whom she chose . The Imperial Government , on the one hand , would be compelled to refuse Canada that liberty which she has hitherto enjoyed , and thus afford a justification for a severance of the tie which has hound her with silken cords and with such affectionate regard that to talk of severing it now is considered as the highest form of treason . If Her Majesty should refuse to // advance the interests of five millions of her Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million English manufacturers , a serious shock would be given to the relations that now exist , and the annexation sentiment would then be justifiable . If , on the other hand , Imperial consent were given for a Commercial Union with the United States , as in the end it no doubt would be , the effect upon Canada and its future would be decisive and remarkable . An open market for her minerals , her vast fishing possibilities , and enormous timber resources , with other stores of wealth , would soon beget an immigration into Canada of Americans and their followers that might so change the political complexion of the country that within two or three Parliaments she might find an outcome in an altered destiny . If , in the meantime , the great problem of self-government had been successfully worked out in the United States ,  --  if a right solution had been achieved of many troublesome questions now impending , and the attractiveness of American institutions were such as to induce an annexation propaganda ,  --  it could then , with far greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial Union some will see a short cut to annexation , while to others this indefinitely postpones it . The destiny that awaits the greater half of the continent , now included within the British possessions in North America , is a subject of the most profound interest . If , as resulting from a Commercial Union with the United States , and the political consequences that would follow from an enormous increase in population , with a dissatisfaction with colonialism and the development of a real national life , a movement should set in for the Independence of Canada , it would take but a few years to achieve it . Already there is a tendency in this direction in the Canadian mind , especially among the young men of Canada ; and there would be less disinclination on the part of English statesmen to favor a movement of that character in preference to absorption by the United States . The Independence of Canada could result only in the creation of a great Republic , founded upon very much the same principles as those that now pervade the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be divided advantageously into thirty States ; and if the movement towards a Republic should have the hearty ci*operation and all the commercial advantages of a close // union with the United States , no greater achievement could be imagined than to build up a great nation , composed of people of the same lineage , the same language , the same laws , and the same literature , governed by the same principles , and having the same destiny in the advancement of civilization . England would be benefited , the United States would have a constant contribution to it greatness without increased responsibility , and the new Canadian Republic would occupy a place before the world such as her magnificent proportions , her vast wealth , and the genius of her people would entitle her to .
