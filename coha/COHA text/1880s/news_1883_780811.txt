txt Conflicting reports regarding the Reed &; Breneman mystery kept the oil market in a state of feverish excitement to-day . the price , under the influence of the various rumors , fluctuating in a way that was calculated to make the average dealer in certificates a fit subject for a lunatic asylum . This well had been , boarded up with a guard around it for several days , and this morning it was announeed , upon what was considered good authority , that it had been thrown open and was doing 1.000 barrels a day . The feeling prior to this was quite strong . but with the reception of it , a break occurred which almost amounted to a panic , and the price , in less time than it takes to-write it , droped from 9414 to 84%. when . by strenuous efforts of the bulls , coupled with a report that the well was about a 500-barrel one , the decline was checked , and the market rallied t. , 92 , but closed weak again at noon with sales at 9114 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 15 minutes afterward calls were made at 93% , a report having been received that the well was not doing more than 200 barrels . Another decline to 92% followed upon a contradiction of the latter story , and at the close 92 was bid . It was stated on good authority that all reports concerning the Reed and Breneman well were without foundation . and were promulgated by the company to force down the market and enable them to load up at a low figure . They bought large blocks last week at 85114 and closed out yesterday at an advance of 10 cents . The deal was so profitable that they were anxious to repeat it , and so caused the manipulation of the market . No trustworthy dispatches could be obtained during the day in contradiction of the reports sent out by the Reed &; Breneman people , as the wires were eut between Warren and Sheffield by industrious scents .
