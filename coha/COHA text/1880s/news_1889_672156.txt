txt The recent decision of the highest court in Connecticut in the matter of certain railroad crossings of highways at grade seems to be one of exceptional importance so far as this subject of almost endless discussion and litigation is concerned . In that State the Railroad Commissioners are empowered to apportion between the towns and the companies the expense of a separation of grades whenever it has been decided that such a separation shall be made . As a rule , however , the towns have been unwilling to bear any part of the cost . Of the 1,247 grade crossings in the State more than 500 are on the lines owned or controlled by the New-York , New-Haven and Hartford Company . The grade crossings on this company 's main line in this State have been removed at the company 's cost , and when it was proposed that the work of improvement should be continued between the State line and NewHaven with a division of the expense there was so much opposition that an extra session of the Legislature was demanded . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioners have required the towns to pay a very large share of the expense , for in the decisions of the board during the year 1888 the sum apportioned to 22 towns was only $49,195 , while the railroads ' share for the same improvements was to be $394,433 . The decision of the Supreme Court relates to the order of the Commissioners assessing $12,000 upon the town of Fairfield for the separation of grades at several crossings and the closing of a highway . A lower court decided that the entire cost should be borne by the railroad company , and that the highway should remain open . The company appealed , and now this decision has been affirmed by the court of last resort . There are now before the Legislature of Connecticut bills providing that the entire cost of such improvements shall be paid by the companies , and it is predicted that this decision will cause one of them to be enacted . The New-York , New-Haven and Hartford Company is now seeking permission to increase its capital stock from $15,500,000 to $50,000,000 , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of leased lines and for the construction of additional tracks , it is understood that a part of it would be used . in paying the cost of separating grades . The subject of grade crossingswas studied last year in Massachusetts by a special commission appointed by the Legislature , and the report of this commission was recently submitted . In that State there are 2,267 such crossings . The average cost of a separation of grades for nearly half of these would be $7,000 , but the expense in the cases of many of the remaining crossings would be much greater , and the cost of making a separation at all of the crossings is estimated at $40,766,000 . The commission recommends that the gradual removal of such crossings shall be required by law , at the rate of 5 per cent , of them per year on the roads of dividend-paying companies , and at the rate of 212 per cent . on the roads of companies paying no dividends . The work should be , it suggests , in the hands of a permanent commission , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A considerable decrease of the number of crossings at grade in the Eastern States in the next ten years seems to be assured by the growing interest in the subject and the earnest recommendations of public officers . The first step to be taken should be the enactment of laws absolutely forbidding the making of any new crossings of the kind on old roads or new ones , except upon the order of a court in certain extraordinary cases . The number of new crossings made in Massachusetts during the last ten years has exceeded the number of old ones removed by 80 . In the last few years the number has been increased in Connecticut with the consent of the Railroad Commissioners , who authorized 35 to be made on one new road and 15 on another that is only 12 miles long . The making of new crossings at grade is forbidden in the first clauses of the bill relating to this subject that has been sent to the Legislature at Albany by the Commissioners of this State .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
