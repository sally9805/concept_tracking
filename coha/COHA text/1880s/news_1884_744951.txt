txt If Mr. ALBERT FINK 'S reasoning in defense of the management of the freight business of competing railroads by a co-operative commission is accepted as sound , then his argument in support of the course adopted to protect the co-operating family of lines from the consequences of the Lackawanna 's misbehavior must be considered strong , if not unanswerable . Without the pool system wars of rates are inevitable , and the public , as we have often pointed out , suffers more from these than from the higher freight charges which the co-operative plan enables the roads to maintain ; and if it is admitted that the pool is to this extent a good thing , its power to protect itself must also be admitted . But while Mr. FUCK is thus far in substantial agreement with views expressed by THE Ti 's , it will be seen that he seems content with the pool system as a final and perfect solution of the problem , while THE TIMPS has always held it to be a temporary makeshift , worthy to stand only until these matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and the public shall be regulated by a national statute . Mr. FDIK tacitly admits the fatal weakness of the present plan when he dwells upon the risk of a war of rates incurred by the combined roads if they tolerate the conduct of the Lackawanna Road , and when he says that a single short road has it in its power to " disturb the whole adjustment of railroad tariffs " and thereby affect the earnings of half the roads in the country . It is plain that some authority more solid than that of Mr. FMK 'S Trunk Line Commission must be called into play here , and we are not at all disposed to agree ' with him in considering legislation of this kind impracticable .
