txt The buildings , stock , and machinery of the Charles W. Allen Manufacturing Company , makers of plug , fine cut , and smoking tobacco at Monroe and Canal streets , was this afternoon taken possession of by a Deputy Sheriff on two confessions of judgment aggregating $120,150 . The head of the company is Charles W. Allen , who came here from Cincinnati five or six years ago , and has done a good business up to within a few months . One of the judgments was in favor of Elijah Allen , father of Charles W .. for $50,100 , and the other was for $75,050 in favor of the Barker Tobacco Company of . Cincinnati , with whom the Allen company hashed very large dealings . In addition to these debts the company owes the Merchants ' Loan and Trust Company , of this city , $130,000. and there are other claims against the concern which will bring the liabilities up to nearly . if not quite , $300,000 . Mr. J. W. Doane , President of the Loan and Trust Company , learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was very much surprised , saying that he had had an interview - with . Mr. Allen to-day and nothing was said about any judgment against the company . Mr. Doane says that his company will lose nothing by the failure , as it is amply secured by collaterals indorsed by Elijah . Allen , by mortgages on the property , and by warehouse receipts for tobacco in store . It has held a first mortgage for $30,000 on the property for some time , and within a.fortnight has further secured . its claim by a second mortgage of $60,000 . The assets consist of stock valued at $25,000 , book accounts estimated at $75,000 , and machinery which when new cost $100,000 . The failure is attributed mainly to the shrinkage in value of the stock and the losses which the company suffered by reason of the great Southwestern railroad strike . It did a large business in the Southwest , shipping sometimes three carloads of tobacco a week to that section . Detentions arising from the railroad strike caused the company to lose much of its trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay roll of about $900 a week , was one of the first to accede to the demands of its workmen , and it has since been laboring under the burden which that movement imposed . The failure is the largest which has occurred in Chicago this year .
