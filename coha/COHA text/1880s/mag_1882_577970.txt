THE NEW EASTERN QUESTION AFTER a short period of what the Germans would call organic development , the Eastern Question has again reached a point at which war seems , if not inevitable , at least possible , perhaps probable . The signs may deceive , but the signs are certainly not pacific . In view , therefore , of such a contingency , and utilizing what may be only a brief interval of peace , it seems important to review the history of the past four years , to seek out the causes and tendencies favorable to another collision , and to forecast some of the probable conditions of the struggle . It is important and useful not alone because the situation is full of grave possibilities for the whole family of nations , nor yet merely because its development may disclose incidents of startling dramatic interest , but also because there is involved in it , as in all international disputes , the question of right and wrong , the issue between justice and injustice ; because it affects the interests of oppressed and suffering yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , are not less deserving of our sympathy than the brigands of the Land League or the spoliated Jews of Russia ; and finally because it will prepare the student to pronounce upon the rival aspirations of two or three great empires which connect the East , in politics as in geography , with the West . The actual form of the question is new , or is at least a serious modification of any form in which it has hitherto appeared . Both the parts and the actors are changed . Some which were prominent in the past have dropped out ; others which were once passive have become active ; one at least must probably he added ; and the entire cast shows striking novelties . It seems impossible , for instance , to think of an Eastern Question without Turkey . The fate of the Ottoman Empire , or , what is the same thing , the assumed interest of the Great Powers in its fate , has always been the leading issue in the diplomatic intrigues of Constantinople , and in the wars which have raged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at this time Turkey has been practically eliminated , either by her own choice or by the natural conditions of the problem , from the diplomatic skirmishing which is now in progress ; and she may remain a quiet spectator even in case of actual war . England , too , which in the Crimea was a belligerent , and in 1877-78 was a watchful and jealous censor , is now governed by statesmen who are bound by all their traditions and by every law of consistency to refrain from premature and officious interference . But if these actors disappear from the stage , their places will be supplied by two others far more powerful and imposing . Austria seems likely to be the chief belligerent on the other side , when Russia again takes the field , while Germany is committed by pledges , as well as by what politicians call her " interests , " to support the house of Hapsburg . As for France and Italy , their course would probably be guided by events , but each is a factor on which Russia has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a war menacing the German Empire would offer might not be rashly seized by France , nor yet would it be magnanimously rejected ; and Italy , skilled in the art of profiting by the embarrassments of others , has still unsatisfied aspirations on the Adriatic . It may indeed be regarded as certain that , without having secured at least one of these two powers as an eventual ally , Russia would not only shrink from war , // but would even guard herself more carefully against the contingency of war . The Russian Empire is passing through severe internal convulsions , which would seem to paralyze the arm of foreign adventure . Nihilism and Jewbaiting , assassination and persecution , conspiracies against the House of Romanoff and outrages upon the children of Israel , are problems of home policy , which require for their solution the best efforts of Russian statesmen . Either they divide the effective resources of the empire , and thus weaken its belligerent capacity ; or they alienate the good opinion of the world , and thus deprive the empire of an important source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be overestimated . Tbe Jewish incident , cruel as it was , and permanent as are the passions which led to it , has probably passed its worst stage , and will not at once be revived as a disturbing force . Nihilism , instead of being an obstacle to war , is in a measure the product of peace and inaction , and as an evil would be mitigated by war . It is a sincere and resolute conviction , able to withstand the influence of a patriotic and popular struggle , only with a few gloomy fanatics ; while the bulk of the faction is made up of giddy students , full of crude knowledge , inflamed by chauvinism , and ready to cease ploting against the Czar if the Czar will lead them against a foreign foe . Russia is not different from other states in regard to the effects which may be expected from a national war . It would create a diversion . It would silence the voice of faction . It would suspend schemes of regicide and schemes of reform , and unite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a truth , which may seem paradoxical in view of the destructive recklessness of the iNihilists , but which will be confirmed by all who have any acquaintance with the Russians , that they are as a people intensely , almost morbidly , patri otic . There is little real loyalty , except among the peasants , in whom it resembles a species of fetichism . There is little of that higher kind of patriotism , which can discriminate as well as approve , can criticise while obeying , and can resist when obedience to authority becomes treason to the country . But the Russian patriotism , though neither supported by loyalty nor guided by discretion , is singularly prompt , passionate , and vigorous , and in the hands of an absolute prince is only the more effective because it does not reason . It was Kossuth , I believe , who said that bayonets think . The remark is true of some of the armies of Europe : in a large degree of that of Germany , in a smaller degree of that of which the countrymen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies where a fierce religious zeal takes the place of intelligent valor . But the Russian host , which exceeds the Turkish in numbers , exceeds the German or Austrian in the strength which comes from fanaticism . It acts , but it does not think . No paltry dissensions at home , no desire to torture Jews or murder kings , can arrest such a force when the cry of danger rings through the country , and village priests , the cross in their hands , are pointing the way to the frontier . This feeling of patriotism , instead of being peculiar to Russia , is , however , one which she shares with other nations in other parts of the world . But in her case it is reinforced by an auxiliary passion , which , though broader in scope , is scarcely less intense in energy , and which , leaping over national boundaries , connects Russia with a whole family of peoples , dispersed throughout Eastern Europe ; aliens all in political allegiance , some also in religion , yet kindred in race , language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing is easy to define , but hard to describe . It embodies what is known , alike to enthusiasts and to philosophers , // as the principle of nationalities , and yet is something considerably more than that . When Moritz Arndt undertook , in his immortal hymn , to find the true limits of the Fatherland , he drew them wherever he could find the German tongue , German habits , German spirit , and German traditions . The generous conception could thus be made to include peoples and districts which for centuries had been politically severed from the empire . But the test was still German , for not even the poet ventured to claim the entire Teutonic group of tongues and peoples , - England , America , Holland , Denmark , Sweden , - and the statesmanship of the age was far less audacious than its poetry . Panslavism is therefore a more ambitious idea than Arndt 's Fatherland . Instead of being only the dream of a poet , it is the aim of serious practical statesmen , or at least an impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of halting at the frontiers of the Russian language , it reaches out into Prussia and Austria , and Turkey , and embraces all men , whatever their political relations , whose idiom identifies them with the great Slavonic race . The Servians , the Bulgarians , the Bosnians , the Montenegrins , the Dalmatians , the Croats , the Poles of Warsaw , of Posen , of Galicia , the Czechs of Bohemia , - these all form part of the future Slav commonwealth . All are brothers , and owe one another the kindly offices of the fraternal relation . In this novel domestic scheme the Czar hirhself has the part of Great , or rather , as the Slays say , Little Father . Yet Panslavism stops apparently short of the idea of a close political union under a single sceptre , or even of a confederation , as Germans , or Swiss , or Americans understand the term , and aims only at a species of alliance , with Russia as patron and protector , - a plan not unlike that which Mr. Blame probably had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in this qualified form the idea has a powerful hold on the imagination of the Russian peoples . Russians may be INihilists or loyalists , radicals , liberals , or conservatives , editors or lawyers , plebeians or aristocrats , may have any opinion in politics or any status in society ; if they can only read and think and dream , they are nearly certain to be Panslavists , and to defend the cause with ingenuous fervor to every patient listener . At the clubs noisy patriots will declaim on the subject by the hour . In the salons fair ladies insinuate it upon you , with all the art of the sex , as they hand you your glass of tea . The stranger whom one meets in the train , or at the table d'h√¥te , or at the picture-gallery , is likely not only to be a champion of Panslavism , but to discuss its virtues with an enthusiasm and a na*vet6 which take no account of one 's foreign birth and possible lack of interest in the cause . General Skobeleff was therefore perfectly justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , that he had only announced sentiments which in Russia every one holds and avows . No one can , indeed , be more surprised than the gallant general himself at the political importance into which he has suddenly sprung . Like every educated man or woman in Russia , he is something of a politician . His opinions are well known , and he has often expressed them with a frankness which , even in this country , public opinion and the etiquette of their profession forbid to high officers of the army . But there was no special reason why General Skobeleff , in spite of his grave indiscretion , should be singled out for the malignant attacks of German Slavophobists , unless , indeed , a pretext was desired for humiliating Russia , or provoking a rupture . The career of Skobeleff is a striking refutation of the common theory that the Russian public service is ruled by favoritism , and that no man can succeed // on his merits alone against unfavorable or hostile influences . His father was also a soldier , and to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after that initial stage young Skobeleff fought his own way upwards , and fought it too against obstacles of singular strength and persistence , - the jealousy of rivals in his own class , the pedantry of martinets whose theories he ridiculed , the intrigues of enemies at court , the indifference and suspicions of the Czar . He was accused of peculation in Turkestan , and , although fully acquitted , was made to suffer , in petty indignities , most of the consequences of conviction . At the outset of the Bulgarian campaign , he could find employment only as volunteer aid on the staff of a parade general , whom the hard realities of the struggle soon left in the rear , while Skobeleff rose to high command . With his opportunities grew also the scale of his achievements . No other officer came out of the war with a more brilliant reputation than his , - a reputation won by hard fighting , skillful generalship , and passionate devotion to the real issues of the conflict . It was an easy matter for Skobeleff to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than was announced by diplomatists , that its ends were not accomplished by the recovery of Bessarabia and the cession of Batoum , and that the Treaty of Berlin was a cruel blow to the victors . Since the peace he has therefore chafed under the disappointment of an ardent patriot and the indignation of a betrayed 8oldier . Against Count Schouvaloff he was outspoken and bitter from the very day that the Congress of Berlin adjourned ; for he felt not only that the ambassador had sacrificed unnecessarily the just interests of Russia , but that his whole policy was one of fatal , not to say criminal , subservience to Bismarck . Schouvaloff was indeed a man of more political experience and more political sagacity than his critic . In the crisis which the Treaty of San Stefano had prepared for Russia , his caution and compliance were more useful than Ignatieff 's astuteness or Skobeleff 's impetuosity , and gave the country , if not a permanent peace , at least a brief respite from war . But the compromise proved , nevertheless , ruinous to its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions , in the organization of the province of Rumelia , the failure of Schouvaloff 's scheme of a mixed occupation forced him to resign his embassy , and retire to private life . As the execution of the treaty proceeded , and new frictions from time to time arose , Skobeleff continued to find yindications of his own prescience . The duplicity of Turkey and the indiffer* ence of the other powers toward Greece , the betrayal of Montenegro , the arrogance of Austria toward her Danubian neighbors , the Bosnian occupation , and the more ambitious projects of which it was clearly the forerunner , - such incidents , coupled with the stern execution of the very letter of the treaty , where it pressed most severely upon Russia , worked up a formidable resentment , of which Skobeleff 's talents and courage made him the leading representative . As a politician he has foreseen , and as a soldier has not feared , the early renewal of the struggle . It can not be indiscreet for the writer to recall those hot September days in 1879 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was riding over the manoeuvre fields of two German corps d'arm6e , and enjoying now his military comments , rapid , penetrating , and just , now his political views , glowing with the peculiar fire of Russian Panslavism . Skobeleff was the most famous of the many officers who followed that mock campaign on the Baltic coast . The Emperor William lent the scene the dignity of his venerable but infirm presence . England had sent Sir Henry Hardinge , a frail little man in personal appearance , but the // hero of a noble episode , which the pen of Thackeray has described , in the Sepoy war . And there were scores of other brave warriors , French , Austrian , Italian , Russian , German , veterans in service , scarred perhaps from battle , liberally decorated for valor , and now gathered for an exhibition of the most perfect military machine in the world . But from that varied and showy group the curiosity and admiration of the public invariably singled out the man who had triumphed over all the obstacles of Russian military routine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps ; and who was fresh from fields of battle , where he had distinguished himself above all his comrades . And in his deportment during the marwnuvres could be found one secret of his remarkable career . To some of the foreign officers the occasion seemed little more than a holiday entertainment , which they languidly enjoyed rather than utilized . But Skobeleff , who , until the Bulgarian campaign , had passed most of his life fighting the nomadic tribes of Central Asia , and had seen little of the standing armies of Western Europe , took a higher conception both of the nature of his mission and of his duty to himself ; followed all the movements with the most scrupulous fidelity ; studied little details of organization and equipment , which escaped his more thoughtless colleagues ; and scratched his ready note-book full of data , which in the evening were expanded into reports for the Russian war office . Such industry , instead of being wasted , will , or at least may , prove doubly useful to the future of the general . it taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , which will be knowledge of value in case of war ; and it gave him the key to many improvements in his own corps , which will be useful even in peace . When , at parting , he asked me to visit him at his headquarters at Minsk , he added , with a soldier 's pride , that he would show me as fin* an army corps as could be found in Russia ; and of this I was sure there could be not a particle of doubt . But Skobeleff holds , as does Moltke , and as every professional soldier on the Continent practically shows , that so long as the Powers keep up their appalling armaments a state of nominal peace is really only one of preparation for eventual war . The armies are there to be used . It is folly to suppose that there will not be in the future , as there have been in the past , eager generals , ambitious statesmen , and princes as willing to use the one as the other . And even if princes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals always pacific , they would be overruled at times by the quick voice of national honor , by the rivalry of imperative interests , and by the aggressive force of popular movements . It is these subtle and active agents which are leading Europe into war . When General Skobeleff teaches Panslavism to Servian students at Paris , he is thinking mainly of germany . When the Czar reprimands Skobeleff , he too has the dragon of Berlin , the man of blood and iron , before his eyes . But although Bismarck is the chief obstacle to Panslavist projects , although it is his diplomacy which speaks in grave tones of warning on the Neva , although it is even his policy which the generals of Francis Joseph are so cruelly carrying out in the mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the real rival of Russia is still Austria , not Germany ; and with Austria must be fought the great battle for dominion , prestige , and power in Eastern Europe . And if the German war should be first in point of time , it would nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material value of its results . It might postpone , but could not take the place of , the other and the greater struggle . The Austro - Hungarian monarchy // seems as ill adapted for successful war on a large scale as any system which the art of caricature could invent . It was correctly described by Prince Gortschakoff , who said it was not a state , but a government . Yet even as a government it wants unity both of form and of action : for if there is only a single monarch , there are two capitals , Vienna and Pesth ; two leading and rival races , the Germans and the Magyars , and under these a variety of subject peoples , all of them disaffected , and most of them groaning beneath a fate to which the recollection of past grandeur lends a peculiar bitterness . There were busy cities and thriving industries in Dalmatia while the site of Pesth was a howling wilderness . The lords of Bohemia were electors of the German Empire before the first Hapsburg acquired the purple . A king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the Hungarians , who , like the others , once felt the stern pressure of Austrian tyranny , finally obtained their release , the hardships of the remaining victims have been , if anything , aggravated since the partition of 1867 . That arrangement , as is well known , a*signed Dalmatia to Austria , and Slavonia and Croatia to Hungary , - a concession by the pride of Vienna to the persistence of Pesth . The experiment has now been tried several years ; and it is enough to say that any enthusiastic friend of Hungarian independence - and that , thirty years ago , meant every adult American - who should now travel through Croatia or Slavonia would suffer a bitter disenchantment . Austrian tyranny is cruel , but it is not always systematically cruel , and sometimes has intervals of weakness . But the Magyars show a*t once the brutal severity of newly emancipated slaves and the haughty insolence of feudal barons . In the Slays , whom events have brought under their sway , they see an inferior race reduced to political servitude ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expected . The Croats , once the most ferocious warriors in Europe , the prized and favored servants of many a Ilapsburg prince , have fallen to a position as low as that of the Poles in Russia . Relentless war is waged upon everything which makes them a people , - upon their speech , their habits , their songs , their literature . In Slavonia the same cruel policy is pursued . In either province to be a Slav is to wear the badge of social and political degradation . To be a patriot as well as a Slav , and to utter with tongue or pen the indignant complaints of patriotism , is the simple and infallible way to reach a dungeon . And the Dalizuatians under Austria fare but little better . Is it strange that this unfortunate people feel no love for the power or the system that crushes them , and that their eyes are turned with affection and longing toward the one great kindred nation which can afford relief ? Of this tendency I have an illustration from my own experience . lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berlin , to pass a few days at the frontier town of Brod , in Slavonia ; and the hotels being full I found lodging in the house of a young school-master , a Slav . He was timid about politics , for the Magyar police have many eyes . Even after my host had become convinced that his secrets were safe in my keeping , he would utter them only in a light whisper , first carefully closing doors and windows , and stuffing keyholes ; but after all this , the most striking communication was entrusted to my eyes and not my ears . At a propitious moment my friend beckoned me into his bedroom , led the way to a dark corner , pulled back a curtain , took down a species of shrine hanging on the wall , and , opening it , revealed a portrait , which he fervently kissed , and then passed to me . I expected to see his wife , or his mother , or at least his sister . The portrait was that of Alexander II. , Czar of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picturesqueness , the pathos - was in the school-master 's manner , and is lost in the telling . But its general significance will be clear . In this dull little village on the Save , which was full of Austrian soldiers and Hungarian spies , an humble pedagogue , isolated from the great world , unread in the literature of diplomacy , had brushed away all the sophistry of cabinets , and led me to the very heart of the Eastern Question . But the Austrian court was not satisfied with three South Slavonic provinces to rule , or misrule , and the Treaty of Berlin put two others into its power . The history of that discreditable negotiation can not here be rehearsed . Even that part of it which relates to the disposition of Bosnia and the Herzegovina would exceed the proper limits of this article ; and the task , however agreeable and useful , must therefore be omitted . But the reader may be reminded , in a few words , that Bosnia and the Herzegovina were two provinces peopled mainly by Slays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servian , which is also that of Croatia , Slavonia , Montenegro , and Dalmatia . If the Jews , of whom there are a few in the towns , be ignored , the rest of the population may be divided , according to religious belief , into three classes : the orthodox or Greek Christians , commonly called " Serbs , " the Roman Catholics , and the Mohammedans . The latter comprised , under the old regime , the ruling order . They were the great proprietors , the officials , the favorites of Constantinople ; and aided by Turkish troops they systematically robbed the Christian peasants , and sometimes , as a pleasant diversion , massacred them for their religion . The hardy mountaineers of the Herzegovina resented this cruelty , and broke out often in revolt . Under great provocation the Bosnians sometimes followed this example , but being less warlike , and less favored with natural strongholds , were more easily subdued . The heroic prince of Montenegro lent his kinsmen secret , and at times open , support ; and in 1876 the Servians made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote , until the great Slav power of the north , roused by the harrowing stories which came up from the plains of Bulgaria , smarting under the defeat administered to its brethren the Servians , and unable longer calmly to witness the desperate struggle of the Herzegovinians , threw the Weight of its great armies into the scale against the Turks . The issue is well known . In due time the Turk was crushed ; the Slays and Christianity had fought out their liberation . At the very gates of Constantinople , in sight of the historic dome of St. Sophia , the Russians dictated a peace , which not only secured them ample compensation both material and political , for their own sacrifices ; but which also took account of the lesser peoples , whose hardships had hastened as their valor had helped to win the war , and made it certain that they should not again fall under the mild dominion of the kaimakan and the pacha . There arose , however , between the signing and the ratification of the Treaty of San Stefano obstacles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sea of Marmora . The Austro-Hungarian delegations voted a special credit for putting the army on a war footing to meet contingencies which might arise . And even Prince Bismarck revealed , under a thin disguise of friendship , sentiments not a little dangerous to Russia . In this condition of affairs , no alternative was left to the Czar . With an anguish of heart which can be easily imagined , he submitted to the cruel humiliation , accepted the plan of an European Congress at Berlin , and saw the Treaty of San Stefano torn into a thousand pieces . The work of reconstruction then began . // But it soon appeared that the order of priority and the order of importance would not be conceded to the populations whose grievances had been the cause of the war , or to the power which , not perhaps without some selfishness , yet nobly and effectively , had come to their relief . England was not ashamed to rob her own client in the secret treaty for the cession of Cyprus . And Austria , whose attitude during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardice , which could bully Servia and Roumania while cowering before Russia , and which , touching the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina , had never lifted a hand or a voice to stay the course of Turkish outrage , - Austria accepted the " mandate " to occupy and administer , that is to appropriate and annex , the two fairest regions which the war had wrested from the Sultan . A more flagrant outrage was never offered to the conscience of Europe . Even the partitions of Poland were honorable in comparison , for they were open acts of spoliation , which made no pretense of justification by subtleties of public law , and hid their true character behind no " European mandates . " Any one of three other courses could have found some show of defense : the two provinces might have been made independent , like Servia and Montenegro ; they might have been placed under the protection of Russia , their liberator ; or they might even have been restored to the Turk with adequate security for reform . But Austro-Hungary , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , historical , or military ; nothing except a title wrested from Russia on one side , and Turkey on the other , by two of the most cynical statesmen , Prince Bismarck and Lord Beaconsfield , whom the nineteenth century has known . It is true that the misgovernment of the provinces by the Turk was a source of danger to the peace of Europe . But to introduce the Austrians anywhere in the name and cause of good administration was a touch of satire which would have seemed more enjoyable if less serious interests had been involved . Order will now , it was said , be established . But order was not established , even on the entry of the Austrians , whom it was supposed that the Christians would welcome as at least an improvement on the Turks ; and already , after three years of so-called pacification , a new insurrection has broken out , as fierce and formidable as those which repeatedly chased the pachas out of the mountains . While thus executing the European Mandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Austrian government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lower Adriatic . This policy clashes , or is made to clash , with the rights of several small states ; and , as Mr. Freeman remarks , the Austrian government , though it succeeds badly against its equals , is singularly fortunate when fighting those not of its own size . It steals a harbor from Montenegro . it compels Servia to build her railways on lines which will enrich Austro-Hungarian commerce . It reconstructs the mixed Danubian commission in a way for which no treaty provides , and browbeats Roumania when she mildly attempts to assert her own rights in the matter . An evil counselor at Berlin has convinced Austria that she has a mission in the East , and in obeying that voice she is perhaps rather a dupe than an intelligent actor ; but the method of fulfilling that mission , in co.ntempt of justice , of humanity , even of the simplest standards of fair play , is peculiarly and exclusively her own . It is this policy which is reviving and reshaping the Eastern Question . It is not recent in its inception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opportunity to the Treaty of Beilin , and when that opportunity shall have been superseded by less favorable combinations , the in- // ophil to see that this goes far beyond the letter of the Berlin Treaty .

It is true that Article 25 provides only for the occupation and administration of the two provinces , not for their permanent annexation . But this was a mere diversion of diplomatic humor . Prince Bismarck had already shown in the case of Schleswig how much value he placed upon such restrictions . His example was fresh before the Congress .

The court of Vienna accepted the mission , therefore , with full knowledr , e that sooner or later it would have to be justified by the sword . The Turks were likely , perhaps , to acquiesce , though sullenly , for their hold upon the provinces had long been merely nominal . But very little familiarity with human nature would have shown that the people themselves were sure to resent the flippant scheme to transfer them like so many cattle .

I have described the acute disappointment which the Treaty of Berlin , and the Bosnian article caused to all intelligent Russian patriots .

Even if the present Panslavist movement is correct in principle , the Czar may still oppose it as inopportune . But if he be forced into war with Austria , he may plead in defense that the movement , whether correct or incorrect , was irresistible , and that , like his father in 1877 , he yielded only to the imperative voice of public opinion . For Austria 's part in the complication there is , however , no such excuse .
