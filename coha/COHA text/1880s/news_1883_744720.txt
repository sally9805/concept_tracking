txt Our enormous surplus revenue was one of the most powerful arguments by which the proposition to reduce taxation was supported before the people and in the Fortyseventh Congress . There were two kinds of taxes to which the knife could be applied  --  the internal taxes , which yielded $146,500,000 in the fiscal year 1882 , and the Customs taxes , which yielded $220 , - 500,000. - The representatives of heavily protected industries and the advocates of a system of high : protection were unwilling that the Customs taxes should be reduced , and ' at first they proposed that all , or ndarly all , of the internal taxes should be abolished , knowing that their abolition would necessarily preserve the existing high rates of taxes on imports . The result of the discussion was , a reduction of internal taxes amounting , it was said , to about $45,000,000 , and a so-called revision of tariff rates , which , it was said , would cut off about $25,000,000 of'the taxes received from that- source ; , although it is now admitted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1882 was ? $145,500,000 , and the actual surplus for the year just ended , as shown by Treasury figures , was about $133,000,000 . There will be a surplus in the current year ; but no one can tell how large 41 will be . If the pension payments shall not exceed those of last year , and ' if. , the reduction of internal and . Customs taxes shall amount to $70,000,000 , the surplus may not exceed $70,000,000 , of which about $40,000,000 . will be required for the sinking fund . It may reach $100,000,000 . The surplus continues , however , to be an argument in support of a reduction of taxes , because it:is regarded by many sensible per : - sons at proof that the taxes are still too heavy . Why , they ask , should the Government raise more by taxation than is needed for its current expenses and the gradual extinguishment of the public debt which is provided by the requirements of the sinking fund ? Once more the advocates ' of high protection find the surplus a stumblingblock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of lower taxes . ? They know that the next reduction will not be made in the taxes upon liquor and tobacco , but must be made in ' the rates of import duties , if made at all . What shall be done with this troublesome surplus ? , This is the question that Mr. WHARTON BARKER and . Prof. THOBIPSON , of Pennsylvania , have undertaken to answer , avowedly for the purpose of maintaining high protective dutie ? , by suggesting a distribution of the surplus among the States . Anything to get it out of the field of vision , and thereby to remove one of the greatest . arguments against the system that they uphold . Is this proposition fair " to the American people who pay the taxes and create the surplus ? Is it not true that by means of such a distribution those persons who have already received very substantial benefit from tariff taxation would be paid a second time ? If the money yielded by taxation were collected fairly and evenly from every person in proportion to his means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no injustice , but the absurdity of such a proceeding would be plain to the dullest intellect . " I paid my tax , " a citizen might say , " and it has come back lfzi me , but why was it necessary to collect it at all and to pay for the cost of collecting it ? The money was not needed , and the cost of collecting and returning comes out of my pocket . Why not reduce taxation and avoid such a foolish and exqravagant proceeding ? " If the money is not collected fairly and evenly , but is yielded by taxes which are laid not only to pay Government expenses but also to protect the business enterprises of a comparatively small number of citizens , and make those enterprises profitable , another citizen receiving money in the distribution may say : . " This is a part of the money taken from me by the tax , but not all of it , for I have paid additional tax in buying goods , the cost of which to me has been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich- under the protection of a Government tax , now receives in the distribution an additional premium in proportion to the amount of property which taxation has enabled him to accumulate . " The surplus is a great fact , and so far as it exceeds the requirements of the sinking fund it will be regarded by a great many persons as absolute proof that taxes are too high . Can any method of distribution be devised by which each tax-payer shall receive a fair return for his contribution ? A distribution among the States in proportion to ' population does not seem to meet the demands of fairness . An equitable reduction of tax rates is the fairest , easiest , and cheapest method of reducing the surplus .
