txt THE TIMES of Feb. 10 contained a summary of the Points upon the trial before Judge Lewis of the action of The People ex rel . Hubbell , Storrs , and Fergason against McCollum and Balcom , to oust defendants from the office of Commissioners of Excise of the city of Lockport . The relators had been legally elected by a clear majority at the city election in April , 1882 . They were pledged against the granting of any license whatever . The defendants with William S. Wright were the board then in office , and conniving with the powerful liquor interest of the city and standing upon the most frivolous technicalities they refused to surrender the office , continued to act , and granted all the licenses asked for under which liquor and beer has since been sold in Lockport . Mr. Wright refused to countenance or take part in these proceedings and withdrew from the usurping hoard . The decision of Judge Lewis was filed to-day , by which the right of the relators to the office is established and the defendants are fined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion are very severe as to the conduct of the defendants . The Judge says : " The people of the city of Lockport by their ballots determined that they would confide in the relators the important duties of Excise Commissioners for 1882 . They wished them and not the defendants to determine whether any or what licenses should he granted for that year to sell strong and spirituous liquors and beer in their city . * * * I have no evidence before me as to the views of the relators upon the question of granting licenses . It is enough to know that a majority of the electors of the city had by their ballots decided that they wished the relators to take charge of that inanortant branch of the City Government , and that they have been defrauded of their rights by the cautions and unlawful acts of the defendants . The defendants during one night heard and passed upon some 73 applications for licenses , and that after they had been notified that the relators were entitled to exercise the funetioxs of the office . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one conclusion . They feared that if the relators were permitted to discharge the duties of Exelso Commissioners they would not grant all , or perhaps any , of the licenses for which applications had been made . They were guilty of a great wrong , not only to the people at large , but to the persons to whom they assumed to grant licenses . They received from them money for licenses they had no right to grant . " The opinion then directs judgment for the plaintiffs with costs and a fine of $250 upon the defendants . This decision is the most important point yet scored by the temperance people in the warfare over the liquor question in this city . It confirms Commissioners Storrs and Hubbell. a majority of the board , in their title to the office of Commissioners of Excise , the one for two years to come , the other for one year . Commissioner Furgason 's term expires next month , and his successor will be elected at the city election April 9 ; but whoever may take his place the Prohibitionists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after next May there will not be a person licensed to sell liquor or beer in Lockport , either at hotels or saloons . The results of this uractical prohibition in a city like Lockport , which at this moment has probably more drinking places than any town of its size in the State , will be awaited with curiosity and interest . The Prohibitionists are aware that the battle is but just begun , but of eourse are highly elated by this decision .
