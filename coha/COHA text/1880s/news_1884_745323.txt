txt The evils of easy divorce laws attract a ; Teat deal of attention , and very justly ; put the evils of easy marriage are seldom nentioned by our moralists . In. most of our States marriage can be contracted as readily as chills and fever . All ministers , and nearly every magistrate  --  including Justices of the Peace  --  are legally competent to perform the marriage ceremony . There are many ministers who never hesitate to marry any couple that may apply to them , whether the unfortunate persons are minors , bigamists , or persons of sane mind and sound morals . Boys and girls who run away from home can always find a minister who , though a total stranger to them , will inflict lifelong misery upon them for a small fee . Were it not for our easy marriage laws , our easy divorce laws would find few supporters . Divorce is in most cases sought as the only means of escape from the miseries of easy marriage . Extremists there are , of course , who are in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding any person , whether minister or magistrate , to perform a marriage ceremony except on a prescription signed by a regular Bishop . This , of course , is impracticable , even if it were desirable . A license law would also have its objectionable features , however strict it might be . The present law is virtually a. license law , although ministers and magistrates do not have to procure a special license authorizing them to marry on the premises . Were only those ministers empowered to perform the marriage ceremony who should pay , say , $500 for a license , there is no doubt that the evil of cheap clerical marryers on every block of a village or town would be materially decreased . What we might call the corner marriage shop would be to a great extent closed , and the business would be concentrated in the hands of comparatively few men . On the other hand , these men would find it necessary to perform as many marriages as possible in order to pay for their licenses and make a fair living . Hence they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It is true that the offense of marrying minors might be punished by a revocation of license , but the licensed marryer would always find some way to prove that he had been deceived and had violated the law unintentionally . The plan of local option is probably the one which promises the best results . This plan provides that in every township the voters ' shall decide whether or not marriage shall be permitted within the boundaries of . the township , and in case the question is decided in the affirmative they shall provide for the appointment of one respectable citizen with power to perform marriages . In most of our small and intelligent communities marriage would , of course , be prohibited ; but in all the larger towns : a State marriage agent would be appointed . If the business were thus at once legalized and restricted the evils of easy marriage would to a great extent disappear , though it is idle to hope that an ideal state of things in regard to marriage can ever be brought about in this world either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
