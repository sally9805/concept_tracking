txt The " Doc " Wilson affair is not to die as Quickly as Congressman William W. Rice , of Worcester , would have it appear , judging from what M. L. Wilson said this afternoon . The explanation , as Mr. Rice terms it , of the relations which existed between Philip L. Moen and Mr. Wilson does not agree with that offered by Mr. Wilson , far from it , and the manner and vehemence with which Wilson takes up the gauntlet thrown down by Mr. Rico indicates that whatever there is in the case for Moen to stand up to the rank for ho will be called upon to do so . Mr.Wilson was called upon this afternoon by your correspondent . At first he was not disposed to talk , maintaining that silence which has all along boon a part of the mystery attached to his affairs with Mr. Moen , but after a while he gave expression to his thoughts , and for the first time since he was brought into pub . lie notoriety in 1882 talked on the subject which created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown Mr. Rico 's statement as telegraphed from Worcester last night , and asked what he thought of it . " I have read that presentation of the case , and have been amused as well as amazed at some of the statements . " " What do you first take exception to ? " " Mr. Rice says : I was advised of all the factS in the case by Mr. Moen , and on the same day met Mr. Wilson with Mr. Moon , and all Mr. Moen 's statements to mo were confirmed by Wilson . ' This is not true . I never met Mr. Rico in Mr. Moen 's presence to talk over our business , ann what he says is false . " " What next strikes you as being incorrect 7 " " Mr. Rice says that the documentary evidence of any claim referred to in Tuesday 's Providence Journal is all fiction and moonshine ; that I have no notes , contracts , or authorities from Mr. Moon . Mr. Rice is talking about something which ho knows nothing of . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am satisfied ' with , and shall present when the proper time comes . I have no documentary evidence I What do you call this ? " Here Mr. Wilson placed before your correspondent a large envelope filled with letters , telegrams  --  business memoranda , &c.,; some of which the correspondent was allowed to read and copy , tut Mr. Wilson defied Mr. Moen to swear that the signatures attached to the letters were not in his own handwriting , or that the body of the letters were not in his handwriting . The letters were placed before your correspondent without regard to the order of their mail . ing . They road as follows : I. MAY 31 , 1880 . Mr. L.

DEAR SIR : I have thought much of our mat. tens since I saw you last . I am willing to do everything in my power to close un this affair , but the most I can do is 550.000 , and this I can not furnish before April 15 , and to do this will re ? quire a great effort on my part . You had better not go near the parties for at least 10 days or more , so that when you do see them they may think you have taken time to make every effort in your power . As I understand , you will raise 22 or 25 . When they are convinced you have made them the best offer you coin the last two words are underscored make , they will be glad enough to accept it , even if it was less than I have named above . What they want is to get all they can , as they look upon this as their last chance . Give them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they ref use this they will get nothing , and then leave thorn , and , my word for it , within a week they will be coming to you to accept your offer . Do n't go near them after you have made your offer . The middle of April is as soon as you can get around out West . Up to that time , and ( ) Item later , the mud is so deep there is no getting around . 1 wish you would send mo such a paper as you know the parties will sign . Yours , truly , ( This letter is also unsigned , but , like the other , is in what purports to be Mr. Moon 's handwriting , and is written on the same kind of note paper as the bulk of the correspondence is. a ? Mr. Wilson , " said the correspondent , " I WO that Mr. Rico says your counsel has filed no declaration . By the way , who is Mr. Rice ? " " He is Mr. Moen 's brother-in-law , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he need have no fear but that it will be filed on time . Bo will find it in the court before the 15th of May , sure . " " Mr. Rice says the case will never come to trial . How is that ? " " Let me tell you that it will be tried and that I will fight the case In court and fight it hard . He has begun to try it in the newspapers . Now , if that is his method of doing business I will meet him in the public press . " " Are you prepared to substantiate your claims in that way if he takes up the press as a means of deciding the merits of the case ? " " Yes . All he or Mr. Moen will have to do is to say they will give me permission to show up everything connected with our affairs , and will hold the papers blameless . I will then give a complete history from first to lust , and then will fight them In the courts . If Mr. Rice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ca n't wait until the declaration is filed , I can refer him to Me . Moen 's son Ph ilip , who will no doubt onlignten him . 1 want Mr. Rico to un . derstand that he can not have his say and attack me and I say nothing in reply . I tell you that I shall do nothing that can not be done through the law and the courts , and if Mr. Rice and Mr , Moen think that 1 have not a just claim I will see what a jury will say . Mr. Rice can not at this Into day say that my business with Mr. Moen has been of a questionable character , so far as I am concerned , for did not Mr. Meer in a card over his own signature , proclaim that his business with me was square nod upright that there was no blackmailing , and that it was no business of the press what transactions we were engaged in ? " " Will you say now what you received all that money for ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it best to disclose that part of my business at present . Of course it will all come out in the trial ; then the mystery , as you call it , will be un . yelled . Later I may be able to tell you more , but this Is sufficient to prove to you that Mr. Moen and I did have business relations , and that the documentary evidence is not all moonshine. '
