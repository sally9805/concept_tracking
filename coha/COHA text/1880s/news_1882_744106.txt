txt An important decision has just been filed by Judge Bennet Van Syckel , of the Supreme Court . relating to the term of imprisonment of ' convicts in the State prison . Heretofore when a convict effected an escape and was recaptured the time during which he was at large was supposed to be included in the period for which he was sentenced , the idea being that it was the duty of the keeper of the State prison to keep the prisoner , and the privilege of a convict to escape if he was smart enough to do so . George W. Edwards , one of the most expert bank robbers in the country , was arrested in the Fall of 1871 while breaking into the Jamesburg Bank . He was tried and convicted of tho crime of burglary , and on Dec. 27 , 1871 , was convicted and sentenced to be confined in the State prison at hard labor for the term of 10 years . His character being known to the Sheriff of Middlesex County , in which the offense was committed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State prison under an extra guard on the same day , and on Sept. 4 , 1872 , made his escape by the aid of confederates , who had a horse and carriage waiting near the prison to convey him away . He was at large for over seven years . and was recaptured and returned to prison on Jan. 9 , 1880 . The term of 10 years exnired on Dec. 27 last , and under the prevailing rule and custom Edwards demanded to be set at liberty . Keeper Leverty refused to discharge him from custody , and sought and obtained the opinion of Attorney-General Stockton. in which his action was sustained . A writ of habeas corpus was obtained from Justice Van Syckel , and the case was argued by the Hon. Leon Abbett. of Hudson County , for the prisoner , and Attorney-General Stockton for the State . On Saturday Justice Van Syckel filed his opinion , and as it revolutionizes the practice which the defendant 's counsel claimed existed from time immemorial , it is a very important one . Justice Van Syckel , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no escape the defendant would have been in actual confinement for the full term of 10 years on Dec. 27. 1881 . The defendant insists that notwithstanding the tact that he was at large for more than seven years he is entitled to his discharge , as if he had served the full term of his sentence at hard labor * * * In the consideration of this question , which is a new one in this State , I have been greatly aided by the able discussion of counsel . The case must be settled upon common law principles , no statutory provision applicable to it existing in this State . " The judgment of the law was that the prisoner should be committed to the State prison at hard labor for the term of 10 years . That judgment has not been executed ; it N in full force , mareversed , and impending over the prisoner unless it has spent its force by mere lapse of time . Having been at large for over seven years , the prisoner has not been imprisoned at bard labor for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time from the rendition of sentence . He will not have borne the prescribed punishment until ho has remained in custody after the expiration of that time , for a period equal to that during which he has been at liberty . The essential part of the sentence is the punishment , which is graduated according to the character of the crime , and is measured , not with reference to the time at which It is to be borne , but by the extent and kind of punishment imposed . The terms of the judgment can not be satisfied except by the service of the prisoner for the specified time at hard labor . The judgment of the law has hitherto been successfully resisted , and the punishment denounced'azainst his offense evaded by the commission of a further crime by the prisoner , and unless the common law is impotent to command obedience to its sentence , the prisoner must be restrained of his liberty until the full term of the penalty for his crime has been submitted to . The right to impose sentence necessarily implies the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instance there is an inherent defect in the common law . the burden rests upon the prisoner to establish it . " It is not a sufficient answer to say that the prison breach is punishable , for that is a distinct offense for which an appropriate punishment is provided . * * * The single question is whether he has been incarcerated for the term adjudged , whether he has served at hard labor for the requisite period . There can be no more difficulty in establishing this question of fact in the habeas corpus proceeding than there would be in establishing the identity of the prisoner . where , after the escape . he Is recaptured before the time had run . * * * The English courts have found no obstacle in the way of executing a prisoner where he had escaped after sentence and remained at large beyond the time fixed for execution . " After citing numerous cases and the recent act of 1881 , the opinion concludes- as follows : " I agree with the view of the other courts in cases cited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is merely declaratory of the common law . That such has been the understanding of the framers of our statute law may be inferred from the fact that the longest term of imprisonment that can , under our statutes. , be imposed for breaking prison is three years . The crime by which the prisoner evaded seven years of service at hard labor is punishable by only three years of such service . Thus , if his contention is right , he becomes by the commission of a secomd crime favored of the law , and is by reason thereof subject to four years less of penal servitude than be would have been if guilty of the first offense only . No such stable support can be found , in reasoning upon general principles , for a rule attended by such consequences , and-I have been unable to find authority for it in the adjudged cases . The facts set oat in the return show that the prisoner is lawfully held in custody . The demurrer is overruled , with leave to the prisoner to contest the truth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is backed up by considerable capital and influence , and it is probable that the case will be carried to the Court of Errors and Appeals , the highest tribunal in the State of New-Jersey.
