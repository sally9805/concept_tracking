txt It is somewhat noticeable that the two chief cities of the country have at last simultaneously taken up in earnest the use of electricity as a motor in street railway transportation . The experiment in Philadelphia is to be made on Ridgeavenue , over a distance of something less than a mile , and the plant of the railway is now under construction , with a view to its operation at the beginning of the coming month . In New-York the present experiments are well known and need not be rehearsed . The first electric street railroad put in operation in this country for the conveyance of city passengers was the one undertaken in Cleveland a year ago . During the November previous the Daft motor had been tried on the track of the Saratoga , Mount and Lake George Railway . As will be remembered , it was tested under disadvantages , and at the start met with an accident , but its possibilities for railway car propulsion were at that time sufficiently revealed to careful observers , even though the apparatus came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of electricity as a motor in the Old World , both on land and water . On the Thames a launch holding twentyone persons was propelled by a screw driven by a . Siemens motor and SellonVolckmar accumulators , and a speed of seven miles an hour attained . On the measured mile a speed of eight miles had previously been secured , and the boat was capable of running for six hours continu- ously , or about forty-43 ? e miles . On the Danube River this electric boat was used two years ago , and took thirty passengers six miles an hour against the powerful current and more than twice as many miles with the current . An electrical omnibus was used with facility in the Cour du Carrousel during the busiest hours of the day , and without interference with other travel At Portrush an electric railway was established with energy supplied from a neighboring waterfall , and a French invention for transmitting electrical force to great distances with little waste when applied ' to a waterfall near Grenoble worked several machines in the town .

Six years ago at Berlin an electrical railway was exhibited , and two years later one was opened for-the regular conveyance of passengers . Both the , Vienna and the Paris Exhibition had their ' electrical railways , and the former conveyed scores of thousands of passengers over its short distances . In some other= countries , notably , we believe , in Belgium , electrical railways have been constructed , and in certain coal mines in Saxony elec- , Welty is said to be used for moving coal ; trains . These and similar instances of what ' ' has already been accomplished can not to inspire the belief that this force , which has only begun to be developed for practical purposes of late years , will , sooneror later , be successfully used as a motor , as it already has been for lighting . One or another experiment may fail , but the conclusion is irresistible that the desired result will finally be reached . Even as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not one of possibility , but of economy , safety , and convenience .
