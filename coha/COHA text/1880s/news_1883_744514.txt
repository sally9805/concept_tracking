txt Now that work upon the tariff has been transferred from committee to the Senate at one end of the Capitol and will soon be taken out of committee at the other end , the representatives of powerful protected industries are here in great numbers . It is believed that Washington never saw a greater or a stronger lobby than that which is here in behalf of the iron and steel interests . They seem to have forced the Senate Finance Committee again to turn their attention to the schedules which interest them , for it is announced that the ? 1 committee have sent to Pittsburg for Mr. Oliver , the member of the Tariff Commission to whom was intrusted the schedule on metals . The committee want to confer with him . The result will be , probably , that the committee will offer in the Senate to amend their own bill by raising the rates on pig-iron , in accordance with the requests of the iron and steel men . When it became apparent that nothing was to be expected from the Ways and Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the revenue reformers turned with some hope to the Senate committee and the Senate bill . The events of the last few days indicate that they can expect very little more at one end of the Capitol than at the other . The pressure exerted by the representatives of manufacturing industries now here is enormous , and it is becoming effective . The professed willingness of some members to allow a reduction of rates seems to disappear before it , especially when the influence comes from an industry in the member 's district or the Senator 's State . This pressure is strengthening some Republicans in the opinion that the party will gain by a postponement of a revision of the tariff . They reason that if the Democrats in the next Congress make reductions , they will arouse the powerful hostility of these great manufacturing interests and drive them all into the service of the Republican Party . The presence of these representatives here is showing these Republicans that they have underestimated the power of these industries , and they think they see in the future the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican side in the campaign of 1884 . As usual , these men forget the people , who know more about the tariff than they did three years ago . The effect of the presence of this great lobby is seen in the work of the Senate and in the recent changes made by the Ways and Means Committee . It has been plain from the beginning of the session that it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to revise the tariff before March 4 , but at one time , not long ago , revenue reformers had hope that a slight reduction would be made . They are willing to take that as better than nothing . Now , however , since the recent manifestation of the power of the protected industries , gentlemen whose positions have required them to be acquainted with the course of the work day by day seem to have abandoned hope of the enactment of any law . A glance at the action taken by the Senate to-day shows how the work is going on . The effect of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to vote in Ignorance . This unwillingness is not confined to the Democratic side . In several instances today the Senate voted to raise the rates recommended by the committee , and it was not difficult to get the impression that much of the relief proposed by the committee would not be granted owing to the votes of Republicans who have local . interests in the nature of " infants , " to be protected and fostered . One of the warmest debates of the day arose upon a proposition by Mr. Hale to increase the duty on dextrine . The Tariff Commission recommended that the duty of 10 per cent . ad valorem be retained , and the Finance Committee so reported . In support of his proposition to make the duty 2 cents a pound , equal to 40 per cent . ad valorem , Mr. Hale was assisted by Mr. Frye , who made a seemingly unprovoked and savage assault upon Mr. Slater , for referring to the profits of common manufacturers as large . Mr. Aldrich , on behalf of the cotton goods men , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be imposed upon those manufacturers which they are not prepared to bear . It was to little purpose that Senators on the Democratic side protested that the proposed increase was uncalled for . On Mr. Morrill 's motion the duty was fixed at 1 cent per pound , equal to 20 per cent . ad valorem , or an increase of 10 per cent . upon the commission bill and the present duty , the Republicans carrying this point by 1 majority in a vote of 24 to 25 . It was only for form 's sake  --  to keep up the consistency of the bill , as Mr. Morrill sugguested  --  that the Senate refused to accept Mr. Vance 's motion to reduce the duty on refined camphor from 5 to 3 cents a pound . Of refined camphor there were imported during the last year 11 pounds . valued at $5 , and yielding 55 cents revenue . It was Mr. Vance 's idea that a reduction of the tariff to 3 cents a pound would increase the revenue , but all the Republicans voted against his motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic ranks was made when the Senate reached bi-chromate of potash . Then Senator Gorman found that the solitary manufacturer of this article in this country is established in Maryland , and should be protected , and he and his colleague , Mr. Groome , suddenly ceased to be tariff reformers and contended for protection , their utterances leading Mr. Beck to send to the desk an appropriate quotation from THE NEW-YORK TIMES , which he had read as part of his argument against the increase from 3 cents a pound , as proposed by the Commissioners , to 3R ; cents a pound . On this proposition , unfinished , the Senate rested until to-morrow , The Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee will not report a bill to the House , but will oppose the committee 's bill on the floor , and will offer complete substitutes for the metal , woolen , cotton , silk , and sugar schedules . Mr. Hardy is the New-York member mentioned a few days ago who will introduce a complete tariff bill in the House as a substitute for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Inaustrial League , and is said to be even more protective than the committee 's bill . It will probably be referred to the committee and find its last resting-place in the committee-room.
