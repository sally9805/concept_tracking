txt The new law of this State relative to publication here of the home figures of foreign fire insurance companies is wholly causeless and foolish . It prescribes that hereafter all foreign fire companies , in reporting to the State , " shall only report and be credited with " the business done , and assets held , here , and prohibits their making any statement or publication of anything else , on penalty of having their licenses revoked by the Superintendent , who is directed to so revoke them . He also is prohibited from including in his report these tabooed figures , and this information is to be for ever aliunde as to the people of this State . The foreign companies at home may wax large or wane small , may flourish in profits or do the other thing , may be honest or the contrary . Nothing of them or their happenings abroad is to be known here , if the law can prevent ; but as the law can not prevent , this portion of it is puerile . Mr. FAIRMAN holds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in this instance , and the question then arises , how arc existing laws affected by this ? The old law of June 25 , 1853 , repeated in that of June 9 , 1875 , requires of foreign companies a deposit of $200,000 with the Superintendent . Hence there is no doubt that this requirement remains , and the manager of the Sun was ready to comply with it . The law of May 27 , 18S0 , provides that foreign companies " may be admitted to transact business in this State ou presenting to the Superintendent of the Insurance Department legal and satisfactory evidence of the possession of " a paid-up capital of at least $500,000 . Mr. FAIRSIAN is now understood to hold that inasmuch as he is now forbidden to take official cognizance of anything outside of this country , he can not be satisfied that this $500,000 exists until it is placed in his hands to hold . But this is nonsensical , for the new law merely says that he shall make to the Legislature no " publication or statement in his annual report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , and that the companies , in making their statements , " shall only report and be credited with " assets held in the United States . This neither defines nor narrows the " legal and satisfactory evidence " which is to he presented to him . And what is such evidence ? If a man can not believe that the city of London exists until he has visited it , or that a corporation has property until he has locked it up in his safe , then this position that only seeing and handling is believing is rational . This same law of 1880 has been two years in existence , and companies have been admitted under it  --  the latest only a few months ago  --  not one of which put their capital into the Superintendent 's hands in order to present to him " legal and satisfactory evidence " that they possessed it ; and to rule that this new law requires him to he blind and deaf to any evidence short of the sense of touch is a piece of arbitrariness . But Mr. FAIRMAN goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have the $500,000 , and the $200,000 especially required , besides ; that is , he demands the $200,000 because the law so prescribes , and the $500,000 so that he shall have " satisfactory " knowledge that it exists . If he has the $500,000 , why require the other ? Surely this is the cap of absurdity , for the greater includes the less , and when a company has deposited $500,000 , to satisfy Mr. FAIRMAN , it has surely deposited $200,000 and satisfied the law . But the law is more easily satisfied than he . The law does not define the kind and amount of evidence which the Superintendent shall deem " satisfactory ; " it does not even , in terms , require him to admit a company , after he is satisfied , but only says that it " may " be admitted . If it is urged ? as the courts would probably hold  --  that this language confers the right of entry , there is still an indefinite margin of discretion conferred by the same section ; and even this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back whenever he desires to make his own law as he goes along . For the act of May 22 , 1873 , contains the following : SEC. 2 . The said Superintendent shall have power to refuse admission to any company , corporation , or association applying , to be permitted to transact the business of insurance in this State from any other State or country , whenever , upon examination , the capital stock of such company , corporation , or association shall be impaired , and also whenever , in his judgment , such refusal to admit shall best promote the interests of the people of this State . We quote this provision in full because we doubt whether the people of this State are aware of the existence of an act conferring such monstrous and despotic powers upon a single official . The discretion granted is literally without limit . The Superintendent can require a deposit of $200,000 , $500,000 , or $5,000,000 , or can name his own terms to applicants . Falling back upon either law , he can say that lie has not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not best to grant a certificate . To all argument he has the power to say : Do as I tell you , or I am not satisfied . Is anybody to say that he is unreasonable ? The law gives him permission to be so , or , at least , does not say when he is so . His " judgment " being expressly made the rule as to the interests of the people , no room is left for any other authority to usurp this function and narrow his discretion by defining it . That he might have a mandamus issued against him is true , but this would be a going behind the letter of the law to say that it meant only a limited discretion when it conferred an unlimited one . That such a discretion may become valuable in some instances we admit , and it has been used with effect in keeping out sundry cooperative societies ; yet the department was not long ago rescued from a man , and the Supreme Court of the State is still dishonored by another , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discretion is a dangerous one , and its existence suggests further inquiry as to the utility and propriety of State supervision .
