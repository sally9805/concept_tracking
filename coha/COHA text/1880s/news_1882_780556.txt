News was received today of five special trains loaded with wheat on the way here from Omaha and 40 car-loads coming from Cairo , all to be delivered on September contracts . When wheat for October and November delivery Is selling at 92% cents the holders of cash grain are naturally anxious to get the 102% which was offered previous to to-day for all delivered here this month . The only wonder is where the profit will come in to the parties who have bought and shipped wheat so much above the Eastern basis .
