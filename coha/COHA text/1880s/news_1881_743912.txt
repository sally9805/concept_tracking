txt Probably nobody so much prizes statistical facts as he who finds them by dint of hard search , unless it is he who expends the search in vain and then has to choose between guessing at them and doing without them . Every publicist and every writer who tries to carry statistical comparisons back more than thirty years discovers this by having his trail disappear . It was not until the census of 1820 that the census volume exceeded 100 pages , and even the wellequipped Astor Library does not possess the earliest volumes ; this loss , however , is not very serious , for the early censuses were literally no more than enumerations of population . Probably it hardly occurred to anybody that any curiosity on . the subject would ever be felt which would go beyond a languid desire to know how many people there were in the country , and the object of the count was only to obtain the basis for Congressional representation . If one goes back more than twenty years , statistical volumes issued by States and from private corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less so . Prior to 1850 commercial and special journals were comparatively few and incomplete , and if we look back through the daily newspapers we find that there has been an . astonishing growth in the quantity , variety , promptness , order , and completeness of the news presented in the main statistically . The census of 1870 was an immense advance over its predecessors , and that of 1880 is presenting with such admirable clearness and method the facts over such a wide range of inquiry that it will challenge comparison with any statistical operations in the world . In Europe , of course , statistics attained its due rank earlier than here . There are several well-known compact annuals in England , and a comprehensive review of the world has lately been issued in London in the form of a huge octavo of 1,000 pages , translated from the German ; the translator is a woman , who tells us that her author 's comparative statistics has been the subject of her earnest study for many years . The author in question , G. FR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sciences . " Some call it demog , raphy , or demology , and most of them elevate it to a special science of itself . " Die statistik " is defined by one of the German writers , Dr. GEORG MAYER , in his work on " Conformity to Law in Social Life , " in the following characteristically ponderous way : " While the statistical or numerical method holds sway , wherever there occurs a quantitative determination and co-ordination of facts , based on observation of aggregates , the field of the science of statistics is restricted to the quantitative investigation of the social life of man , which is attainable only by means of the observation of aggregates . Accordingly , I define the statistical science as the systematic statement and explanation of actual facts and of the laws of man 's social life that may be deduced from these on the basis of the quantitative observation of aggregates . " There is a simple meaning hidden under this polysyllabic concealment . The German writers maintain generally that statistics is a method so far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a science itself so far as it deals with sociology , or the phenomena of human society ; in the latter employment they call it " statistics in the narrow sense , " and in the former " statistics in the wide sense . " But to most people this will seem a distinction too fine-drawn to be worth making , and if statistics did not serve useful ends it would be abandoned to pundits who have no better use for time than to wrangle over such definitions . The definition has in this matter no consequence except that to elevate statistics into the dignity of a science is to put a means for an end . Figures have intrinsically neither substance , facts , nor philosophy ; until they stand for something they are as dead as the little child 's first scrawls with a pen . They are to the sciences or the inquirers who use them what the letters of the alphabet are to the sciences  --  simply a means of expression . To say that the alphabet is a method when in general use and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational as to say that figures are a method ordinarily but a science when applied to sociology . Sociology itself may be a science , as astronomy anechemistry are , but figures are not ; statistics is concrete , not abstract . It can be nothing more than the orderly expression and arrangement of observed facts , in any department of inquiry , by means of figures . the figures themselves taking life and existence only by this arrangement of them . To mistake the tool for the end would only do harm by depriving statistics of its rightful estimation . Undoubtedly , there is both room and necessity for a logical method in employing it , and in this limited sense it may be called a science , if anybody cares to insist upon decking it in borrowed honors . Nothing is simpler , of course , than to pick out figures from a , mass and combine them ; but it is like playing the lute , which Hamlet said will discourse most excellent music for one who can govern its vents rightly . To distinguish what is significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to exhibit that , requires a logical mind and practiced skill ; the statue is in the block , and the living reality is in the mass of figures , but to see it shining through , and then to get it out is the task . Most encouraging progress has been made in statistical matters during the last ten years . The Bureau of Statistics , originally started as an adjunct to the very minute taxation of the war times , has improved its methods until the chaff which used to expand its issues has largely blown away , and some of them , particularly its compends , are worthy of ranking with the best of the British " blue books . " We are just beginning to appreciate the value of statistical researches . The more we have of them ? so long as they are of a significant sort and are kept apart from guesswork  --  the less we shall have to depend upon conjecture for the basis of legislation and commercial movements .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
