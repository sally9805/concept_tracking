txt Of the projects for dealing with the liquor question which have been brought before the Legislature of this State the " free-rum bill " ? for such it virtually is  --  alone has any prospect of success . Nothing can be looked for from the prohibitory amendment now before the Senate , and Mr. ROOSEVELT 'S effort in behalf of a high license law was suppressed with a promptness that showed where the sympathies of the Democratic majority lie . It is possible , however , that by this time the Assembly is a little ashamed of the way in which Mr. ROOSEVELT 'S bill was treated , and it may be possible to obtain at least a discussion of the high license plan in one or the other house . Of course , the uncompromising advocates of a prohibitory law will consent to no method of treating the liquor traffic which does not propose its complete extinction . It can not be denied , however , that even were the State to vote for prohibition it could not be enforced in the large cities . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , which Mr. " BILLY " has so long openly defied . It is not the part of wisdom to incumber the statutebook with laws which it is impossible to enforce , whether these laws refer to Sunday observance , the liquor traffic , or to any other matter . There can be no division of opinion among good men as to the evils of the liquor traffic , but that very fact should insure the adoption of the best attainable method of restricting the retail trade in liquor . To abandon a feasible plan of lessening the evils of rum-selling ; in order to grasp at a prohibition which will be inoperative , except in small country towns , is to drop the substance in reaching after the shadow . The high license system certainly seems to be the most promising method yet devised of dealing with the liquor question . It has been tried in Nebraska , and the result has so far been eminently satisfactory . In that State a license costs $1,000 in a large town and $500 in a small town . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of $5,000 , and no liquor-seller is permitted to be the bondsman of another liquor-seller . According to Senator MA.N DERSON , the effect of the high license system in the town of Omaha has been to totally abolish the low groggeries and to reduce the number of places where liquor is sold from 160 to 00 . The men who now conduct the liquor business in Omaha are men of better character than the majority of those who were formerly in the business , and the revenue derived from them for the school fund is now $90,000 , instead of the $10,000 which the business formerly yielded . 1Yere a high license law to be adopted in this State we would expect that it would close at least one-half of the saloons in this City . Even the most ardent prohibitionist could hardly refuse to admit that this would be a substantial gain . Not only would the number of saloons be reduced , but the liquor-sellers under the high license law would use their utmost efforts to prevent any spread of the liquor traffic , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit would depend partly on their freedom from competition . No liquor-seller would be willing to risk the revocation of his license , and hence the liquor-sellers would as a class be much more careful to observe the provisions of the law than are the present irresponsible keepers of low grog shops . It would thus be a comparatively easy matter for the authorities to prevent the sale of liquor to minors and to intoxicated men , and to prevent the liquor saloons from becoming the resort of thieves and disorderly persons . In fact the liquor-dealer would be virtually under bonds to observe the law , for the loss of a license costing $1,000 or $1,500 would be too heavy to be lightly risked . Of course , there are men who would be unwilling to regard an increase of revenue from the liquor trade as any argument in. favor of a system leading to such increase ; but in view of the fact that a very large proportion of the crimes which till our prisons are clue to intemperance , it may seem to people of hard common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defray the cost of the crime and disorder for which it is responsible . An increase of revenue from liquor saloons in this State at all proportionate to that which has taken place in Omaha would yield an amount which would appreciably lighten the taxes that rum has indirectly imposed upon the people . The high license system is as yet confessedly an experiment . It may prove to be a disappointment to its advocates , for it is a peculiarity of liquor legislation that it usually disappoints every one except the rum-sellers . Still , it has so far apparently succeeded in Nebraska , and its simplicity and ease of enforcement are certainly elements of success . In this State it deserves a trial , and it ought to rally to its support intelligent men who are equally opposed to prohibition and to free rum . There is little to be hoped in the regulation of the liquor traffic from a Democratic Legislature , but we may at least hope that room for the discussion of the high license system will be afforded .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
