txt deleted 17 lines This is a very , moving tale of distress , and . if it were told in fiction or represented upon ftte stage it would draw tears from the eyes even of cynical worldlings who now see in it only matter for unfeeling mirth . It is probably true that one stage makes more noise than one carriage , although this defect might be remedied by modifying the construction of the vehicles . But it is not Likely that all the stages make more noise than all the carriages , or that the riparian resident along the stream of Sunday travel in Fifth-avenue can detect , . when he is piously meditating in his dining room , whether it is the illegal , immoral , and . irreligious stage " that carries the vulgar herd , or the sober and inoffensive carriage which conveys his neighbors about their occasions by which his meditations ' are disturbed . He can tell of course by looking out of the window , and . in that case if ho be a supersensitive soul like Mr. SHEPARD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform brazenly collecting five-cent fares , while he will contemplate with complacency a coachman in livery driving his employer . Still he might avoid this pain by the simple expedient of not looking out of the window . It is the conscientious objection against being a.partaker of the sin of the company by holding its stock that seems chiefly to weigh upon Mr. SHEPARD 'S spirit . Upon this point we regret to observe that the Judge not only denies him the redress he seeks but fails to treat his application with the tender sympathy to which it is entitled . It is true that - the refusal is based . upon technical grounds . The running of Sunday stages , he remarks , if it be an offense at all , is a misdemeanor under the Penal Cone , and it is no part of the business of a court of equity to enjoin people against committing crime , except upon the application of somebody whose rights of person or property are invaded . He holds that the injury to Mr. SHEPARD 'S feelings does not constitute such an invasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservator of the morals of the community or protect the feelings of a member of it when there is no law authorizing it to do so . " If this be the law , there is nothing to ' Lie complained of in the decision of the Judge , except his omission to accompany it with a decent expressiorfof his deep personal regret that this should be the law , and that he should be unable to protect Mr. SHEPARD 'S feelings from outrage . Instead of doing this he deals with the whole matter as if , instead of involving momentous moral issues , it - were trifling , and . with the plaintiff lie seems to deal even " playfully , " as THACKERAY dealt with the snob . We trust that this impression does not do justice to the state of the judicial mind , but it is one which most readers would undoubtedly derive from a perusal of the decision . After denying Mr. SHEPARD any relief whatever he actually suggests that he could relieve himself from being " compelled - to be identified " with the " illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the simple process of selling out his stock . Under the circumstances such a suggestion from the judicial bench is very little short of ribald . To be sure , most practical men find it difficult - to enter into the tribulations of a delicate and ethereal nature . They will simply take the ground that public conveyances in a city like New-York for people who do not possess private conveyances are as much a " necessity , " within the meaning of the Sunday law , as eating and drinking , and that if a man is so sensitive that he can not bear the sight of them , he had better move into a side street , where that sight will be spared him . The lack of sympathy shown by the Judge:who dismissed Mr. SHEPARD 'S application for an injunction will be shared by most of that wronged man 's fellow-citizens . Evidently the rude machinery of courts of justice is not fit to relieve , the woes or to gratify the aspirations of Mr. SHEPARD . - He has " taken on " a newspaper , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations breathed , and the public ought to be glad of it .
