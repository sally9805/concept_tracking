txt Twenty-nine Senators , all but two of whom  --  Messrs . Sewell and Cameron , of Pennsylvania  --  are Democrats , were this afternoon recorded in such a way as to show that they are in favor of hon-oring Fitz John Porter by wining out his record as a disgraced officer and soldier , and restoring him to the rank he held when dis . missed from the Army in 1883 , for disobedib ence of orders . The Democratic vote wed solid , North and South joining hands to over . turn the work of the original court-tnartiaL ; Tho only arguments on the Democratic side were that a Republican President had authorized the reviewing Board of Inquiry and that Gen. Grant had expressed an opinion that the finding of the court-martial , was IIII to Porter . Mr. Logan , almost prostrated by ill-health and the exhaustion caused by tWt1 days of vigorous speaking , finished his spaech. against the bill with great difficulty , but not without strong and rugged eloquence . Mr. Sewell , who made a response , read portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not audi . ble in the gallery , and , as Senators stated , were not heard on the floor The speech of Mr. McPherson was not an argth ment , but rather an appeal to a feeling of sew timentality . When Mr. Hole moved for 64 indefinite postponement of the bill 28 Senator ) voted in the negative and 20 in the affirmative , About one-third of the Senators were paired or absent , and Messrs ! Cameron and Sewell voted with the Democrats . Mr. Sherman ; whose absence a few days ago without a pan allowed the bill to be taken up , was one of tha number , and was not paired . The strength of the advocates of the bill who were in the Sen. ate was more fully shown upon Mr. Allison 's motion to go into executive session , which was defeated by a vote of 24 to 29 . After the bill had been reported to the Senate from the Committee of the Whole , Mr .. Hoar moved to postpone further discussion for a week , and thus secured an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Grant 's opinion and the suggestions of the Board of Inquiry , and to declare that such examina ? tion of the facts as he had been able to make had convinced him that lilt , original belief in Porter 's guilt was right , and that he should be compelled , with the knowledge he possessed , to vote against restoration . The Democrats were against postponement , and Mr. Brown was led to give his reasons , very like those of Lis associates , : and based principally upon Gen. Grant 's opinion , for supporting the bill . Mr. Logan and Mr. Conger spoke very warmly against the demoralizing proposition to restore Porter , and Mr. Conger so successfully resorted to the , filibustering practices of which he is an acknowledged master as to compel an adjourn- ' ment before a vote had been taken upon the passage of the bill . It is altogether probable that the bill will pass the Senate , but Mr. Conger 's declaration that it will be beaten in the House if it should reach the lower branch Is regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitz John Porter was again a listener in the gallery .
