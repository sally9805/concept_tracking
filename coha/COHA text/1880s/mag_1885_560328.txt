PART I. MR . LINcoLN was nearly eight years my senior , and settled in Illinois ten years before I did . We first find him in the State splitting rails with Thomas ilanks , in Macon County , in 1830 . Not long afterward he made his way to New Salem , an unimportant and insignificant village on the Sangamon River , in the Northern part of Sangamon County , fourteen miles from Springfield . In 1839 a new county was laid off , named " M6nard , " in honor of the first lieutenant-governor of the State , a French Canadian , an early settler of the State , and a man whose memory is held in reverence by the people of Illinois for his enterprise , benevolence , and the admirable personal traits which adorned his character . A distinguished and wealthy citizen of St. Louis , allied to him by marriage , Mr. Charles Pierre Choutean , is now erecting a monu* ment to him , to be placed in the State-house grounds at Springfield . The settlement of New Salem , now immortalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new county of " M*nard . " Remaining there " as a sort of clerk in a store , " to use his own langange , he then went into the Black Hawk war , and was elected a captain of a company of mounted volunteers . In one of the great debates between Lincoln and Douglas , at Ottawa , in 1858 , in a somewhat patronizing manner and in a spirit of badinage , spoke of having known Lincoln for " twenty-four years , " and when a " flourishing grocery-keeper " at New Salem . The occasion was too good a one not to furnish a repartee , and the people insisted that while Lincoln denied that he had been a flourishing " grocerykeeper , " as stated , but said that if he had been he was " certain // that his friend , Judge Douglas , would have been his best customer . " The Black Hawk war over , Mr. Lincoln returned to New Salem to eke out a scanty existence by doing small jobs of surveying and by drawing up deeds and legal instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Salem , he was one of nine members elected from Sangamon County to the lower house of the Legislature . I landed at Galena by a Mississippi River steamboat , on the first day of April , 1840 , ten years after ilanks and Lincoln were splitting rails in Macon County . The country was then fairly entered on that marvelous Presidential campaign between Van Buren and Harrison , by far the most exciting election the country has ever seen , and which , in my judgment , will never have a parallel , should the country have an existence for a thousand years . Illinois was one of the seven States that voted for Van Buren , but the Whigs contested the election with great zeal and most desperate energy . Galena , theretofore better known as the Fevre River Lead Mines , still held its importance as the center of the lead-mining region , and was regarded as one of the principal towns in the State in point of population , wealth , and enterprise . But the bulk of population of the State at that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Springfield . Mr. Lincoln was first elected to the lower branch of the Legislature ( then sitting at Vandalia ) from Sangamon County , in 1834 , and that was his first appearance in public life . He was re-elected in 1836 , 1838 , and 1840 , having served in all four terms-eight years . He then peremptorily declined a further election . Before his election to the Legislature , Mr. Lincoln had read law in a fugitive way at New Salem ; but arriving at Vandalia as a member of the Legislature , a new field was open to him in the State law library as well as in the miscellaneous library at the capital . He then devoted himself most diligently not only to the study of law , but to miscellaneous reading . He always read understandingly , and there was no principle of law but what he mastered ; and such was the way in which he always impressed his miscellaneous readings on his mind , that in his later life people were amazed at his wonderful familiarity with books-even those so little known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of Illinois having been removed from // Vandalia to Springfield in 1839 , the latter place then became the center of political influence in the State . Mr. Lincoln was not particularly distinguished in his legislative service . He participated in the discussion of the ordinary subjects of legislation , and was regarded as a man of good sense and a wise and practical legislator . His uniform fairness was proverbial ; but he never gave any special evidence of that masterly ability for which he was afterward distinguished , and which stamped him , as by common consent , the foremost man of all the century . He was a prominent Whig in politics , and took a leading part in all political discussions . There were many men of both political parties in the lower house of the Legislature , during the service of Mr. Lincoln , who became afterward distinguished in the political history of the State , and among them might be mentioned Orlando B. Ficklin , John T. Stuart , William A. Richardson , John A. MeClernand , Edward D. Baker , Lewis W. Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bissel , and John J. Hardin , all subsequently members of Congress ; and James Semple , James Shields , and Lyman Trumbull , United States Senators . There were also many men of talent and local reputation who held an honorable place in the public estimation and made their mark in the history of the State . Springfield was the political center for the Whigs of Illinois in 1840 . Lincoln had already acquired a high reputation as a popular speaker , and he was put on the Harrison electoral ticket with the understanding he should canvass the State . Edward D. Baker was also entered as a campaign orator , and wherever he spoke he carried his audience captive by the power of his eloquence and the strength of his arguments . He was one of the most effective stump speakers I ever listened to . It was his wonderful eloquence and his power as a stump speaker that elected him to Congress from Illinois in a district to which he did not belong , and made him a United States Senator from Oregon when he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his successful canvass with Douglas , in 1838 , as an able speaker and a popular man ; and John J. Hardin , of Jacksonville ( killed at Buena Vista ) , was widely known as a popular and successful orator . These Springfield Whigs led off in canvassing the State for Harrison in 1840 . Lincoln and Baker were assigned to the " Wabash Country , " // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . where , as Baker once told me , they would make speeches one day and shake with the ague the next . It is hard to realize at this day what it was to make a political canvass in Illinois half a century gone by . There were no railroads and but few stage lines . The speakers were obliged to travel on horseback , carrying their saddlebags filled with " hickory " shirts and woolen socks . They were frequently obliged to travel long distances , through swamps and over prairies , to meet their appointments . The accommodations were invariably wretched , and no matter how tired , jaded , and worn the speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call of the waiting and eager audiences . In 1840 , Stephen T. Logan , then a resident of Springfield , was one of the best known and most prominent men in the State . Though a Whig , he was not so much a politician as a lawyer . In 1841 , he and Mr. Lincoln formed a law partnership which continued until 1843 , and there was never a stronger law firm in the State . Like Lincoln , Logan was a Kentuckian , and a self-made man . Though a natural-born lawyer , he had yet studied profoundly the principles of the common law . He was elected a circuit judge in 1835 , and held the office until 183g . He displayed extraordinary qualities as a fli8t prius judge . In 1842 , he consented to serve in the lower branch of the Legislature from Sangamon County . He had even more simplicity of character , and was more careless in his dress , than Mr. Lincoln . I shall never forget the first time I ever saw him . It was in the hall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he was a member of that body . He had a reputation at that time as a man of ability and a lawyer second to no man in the State . I was curious to see the man of whom I had heard so much , and I shall never forget the impression he made on me . He was a small , thin man , with a little wrinkled and wizened face , set off by an immense head of hair , which might be called " frowzy . " He was dressed in linseywoolsey , and wore very heavy shoes . his shirt was of unbleached cotton , and unstarched , and he never encumbered himself with a cravat or other neck-wear . His voice was shrill , sharp , and unpleasant , and he had not a single grace of oratory ; but yet , when he spoke , he always had interested and attentive listeners . Underneath this curious and grotesque exterior there was a gigantic intellect . When he addressed himself to a jury or to a question of law before the courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hustings , people looked upon him and listened with amazement . His last appearance in any public position was as a delegate to the " Peace Convention " at Washington , in the spring of 1861 . In his later years he lived the life of a retired gentleman in his beautiful home in the environs of Springfield . His memory has been honored by placing his portrait , one of the most admirable ever painted by Healy , in the magnificent room of the Supreme Court at Spriugfield . I never met Mr. Lincoln till the first time I attended the Supreme Court at Springfield , in the winter of 1843 and 1844 . He had already achieved a certain reputation as a public speaker , and was rapidly gaining distinction as a lawyer . He had already become widely known as a Whig politician , and his advice and counsel were much sought for by members of the party all over the State . One of the great features in Illinois nearly half a century gone by was the meeting of the Supreme Court of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was held first at Yandalia and then at Springfield . The lawyers from every part of the State had to follow their cases there for final adjudication , and they gathered there from all the principal towns of the State . The occasion served as a reunion of a large number of the ablest men in the State . Many of them had been dragged for hundreds of miles over horrible roads in stage-coaches or by private conveyance . For many years I traveled from Galena , one of the most remote parts of the State , to Springfield in a stage-coach , occupying usually three days and four nights , traveling incessantly , and arriving at the end of the journey more dead than alive . The Supreme Court Library was in the court-room , and there the lawyers would gather to look up their authorities and prepare their cases . In the evening it was a sort of rendezvous for general conversation , and I hardly ever knew of an evening to pass without Mr. Lincoln putting in his appearance . He was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when surrounded by congenial friends . His penchant for story-telling is well known , and he was more happy in that line than any man I ever knew . But many stories have been invented and attributed to him that he never heard of . Never shall I forget him as he appeared almost every evening in the court-room , sitting in a cane-bottom chair leaning up against the partition , his feet on a round of the chair , and surrounded by // 312 many listeners . But there was one thing-he never pressed his stories on unwilling ears , nor endeavored to absorb all attention to himself . But his anecdotes were all so droll , so original , so appropriate , and so illustrative of passing incidents , that one never wearied . He never repeated a story or an anecdote , nor vexed the dull ears of a drowsy man by thrice-told tales , and he enjoyed a good story from another as much as any person . There were many good story-tellers in that group of lawyers that assembled evenings in that Supreme Court-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State under Gov . Ford from 1843 to 1846 . Mr. Campbell was a brilliant man and a celebrated wit . Though differing in politics , until the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , he and Mr. Lincoln were strong personal friends , and many of his stories , like those of Mr. Lincolu , have gone into the traditions of the State . They were never so happy as when together and listening to the stories of each other . Mr. Campbell was elected to Congress from the Galena district in 1850 , and served one term . In 1853 , President Pierce appointed him a Judge of the United States Land Court of California . Mr. Lincoln was universally popular with his associates . Of an even temper , he had a simplicity and charm of manner which took hold at once on all persons with whom he came in contact . He was of the most amiable disposition , and not given to speak unkindly of any person , but quick to discover any weak points that person might have . He was always the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all felt there was a great void when for any reason he was kept away . The associates of Mr. Lincoln at the bar at this time were , most of them , men of ability , who gave promise of future distinction both at the bar and in the field of politics . The lawyers of that day were brought much closer together than they ever had been since , and the esprit de corps was much more marked . Coming from long distances , and suffering great privations in their journeys , they usually remained a considerable time in attendance upon the court . Among the noted lawyers at this time , the friends and associates of Mr. Lincoln , who subsequently reached high political distinction , were John J. Hardin , falling bravely at the head of his regiment at Buena Vista ; Lyman Trumbull , for eighteen years U. S. Senator from Illinois ; James A. McDougall , Attorney-General of Illinois , and subsequently member of Congress and United States // Senator from California ; Stephen A. Douglas , Edward ID . Baker , Thompson Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , James Shields , Isaac N. Arnold ( who was to become Mr. Lincoln 's biographer ) , Norman H. Purple , 0 . H. Browning , subsequently United States Senator and Secretary of the Interior , Judge Thomas Drummond , of the United States Circuit Court , and many others , all the contemporaries of Mr. Lincoln , and always holding with him the most cordial and friendly relations . In the Presidential campaign of 1844 , Mr. Lincoln canvassed the State very thoroughly for Mr. Clay , and added much to his already well-established reputation as a stump speaker . His reputation also as a lawyer had steadily increased . In August , 1846 , he was elected to Congress as a Whig from the Springfield District . Ceasing to attend the courts at Springfield , I saw but little of Mr. Lincoln for a few years . We met at the celebrated River and Harbor Convention at Chicago , held July 5 , 6 , and 7 , 1847 . He was simply a looker-on , and took no leading part in the convention . His dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then for the first time I heard him called Old Abe . Old Abe as applied to him seemed strange enough , as he was then a young man only thirty-six years of age . One afternoon several of us sat on the sidewalk under the balcony in front of the Sherman House , and among the number the accomplished scholar and unrivaled orator , Lisle Smith . He suddenly interrupted the conversation by exclaiming , " There is Lincoln on the other side of the street ! Just look at Old Abe ! ' " and from that time we all called him " Old Abe . " No one who saw him can forget his personal appearance at that time . Tall , angular , and awkward , he had on a short-waisted thin swallow-tail coat , a short vest of same material , thin pantaloons , scarcely coming down to his ankles , a straw hat , and a pair of brogans of the bar . It was a popularity not run after , but which followed . He never used the arts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungainly exterior he wore a golden heart . He was ever ready to do an act of kindness whenever in his power , particularly to the poor and lowly . Mr. Lincoln took his seat in Congress on the first Monday in December , 1847 . I was in attendance on the Supreme Court of // the United States at Washington that winter , and as he was the only member of Congress from the State who was in harmony with my own political sentiments , I saw much of him and passed a good deal of time in his room . He belonged to a mess that boarded at Mrs. Spriggs ' in " Duff Green 's Row " on Capitol Hill . At the first session the mess was composed of John Blanchard , John Dickey , A. R. Mellvaine , James Pollock , John Strohm , of Pennsylvania ; Elisha Embree , of Indiana ; Joshua R. Giddings , of Ohio ; A. Lincoln , of Illinois ; and P. W. Tompkins , of Mississippi . The same members composed the mess at Mrs. Spriggs ' the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tompkins . Without exception , these gentlemen are all dead . He sat in the old hall of the House of Representatives , and for the long session was so unfortunate as to draw one of the most undesirable seats in the hail . He participated but little in the active business of the House , and made the personal acquaintance of but few members . He was attentive and conscientious in the discharge of his duties , and followed the course of legislation closely . When he took his seat in the House , the campaign of 1848 for President was just opening . Out of the small namber of Whig members of Congress who were favorable to the nomination of General Taylor by the Whig Convention , he was one of the most ardent and outspoken . The following letter addressed to me on the subject will indicate the warmth of his support of General Taylor 's nomina-tion : " WASHINGTON , April 30 , 1848 . " DEAR WAsnBuaxi* : I have this moment received your very short note asking me if old Taylor is to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of Taylor 's nomination is as high  --  a little higher than when you left . Still the case is by no means out of doubt . Mr. Clay 's letter has not advanced his interests any here . Several who were against Taylor , but not for anybody particularly before , are since taking ground , some for Scott and some for McLean . Who will be nominated , neither I nor any one else can tell . Now , let me pray to you in turn . My prayer is , that you let nothing discourage or baffle you , but that in spite of every difficulty you send us a good Taylor delegate from your circuit . Make Baker , who is now with you I suppose , help about it . He is a good hand to raise a breeze . General Ashley , in the Senate from Arkansas , died yesterday . Nothing else new beyond what you see in the papers . Yours truly , " A. LINcOLN . " I was again in Washington part of the winter of 1849 ( after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln . A small number of mutual friends-including Mr. Lincoln-made up // a party to attend the inauguration ball together . It was by far the most brilliant inauguration ball ever given . Of course Mr. Lincoln had never seen anything of the kind before . One of the most modest and unpretending persons present , he could not have dreamed that like honors were to come to him almost within a little more than a decade . He was greatly interested in all that was to be seen , and we did not take our departure until three or four o'clock in the morning . When we went to the cloak and hat room , Mr. Lincoln had no trouble in finding his short cloak , which little more than covered his shoulders , but after a long search was unable to find his hat . After an hour he gave up all idea of finding it . Taking his cloak on his arm he walked out into Judiciary Square , deliberately adjusting it on his shoulders , and started off bareheaded for his lodgings . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with his short cloak thrown over his shoulders , without any hat on , starting for his long walk on Capitol Hill at four o'clock in the morning . And this incident is akin to one related to me by the librarian of the Supreme Court of the United States . Mr. Lincoln came to the library one day for the purpose of procuring some law books which he wanted to take to his room for examination . Getting together all the books he wanted , he placed them in a pile on a table . Taking a large bandana handkerchief from his pocket , he tied them up ; and putting a stick which he had brought with him through a knot he had made in the handkerchief , adjusting the package of books to his stick , he shouldered it , and marched off from the library to his room . In a few days he returned the books in the same way . Mr. Lincoln declined to run for Congress for a second term , 1848 . His old partner and friend , Judge Stephen T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amazement of every one , was defeated by a Democrat , Colonel Thomas L. Harris , of " M6nard " County . From 1849 , on returning from Congress , until 1854 , he practiced law more assiduously than ever before . In respect to that period of his life he once wrote to a friend " I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again . " There was a great upturning in the political situation in Illinoig , brought about by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in // which was to elect a successor to General Shields , who had committed what was to the people of Illinois the unpardonable sin of voting for the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . There was something in that legislation which was particularly revolting to Mr. Lincoln , as it outraged all his ideas of political honesty and fair dealing . There was an exciting canvass in the State , and Mr. Lincoln entered into it with great spirit , and accomplished great results by his powerful speeches . From his standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the campaign , it was agreed that if the Republicans and anti-Nebraska men should carry the Legislature , Mr. Lincoln would succeed General Shields . I know that he himself expected it . There is a long and painful history of that Senatorial contest yet to be written , and when the whole truth is disclosed it will throw a flood of new light on the character of Mr. Lincoln , and will add new luster to his greatness , his generosity , his magnanimity , and his patriotism . There is no event in Mr. Lincoln 's entire political career that brought to him so much disappointment and chagrin as his defeat for United States Senator in 1855 , but he accepted the situation uncomplainingly , and never indulged in reproaches or criticism upon any one ; but , on the other hand , he always formed excuses for those who had been charged in not acting in good faith towards him and to those with whom he was associated . He never forgot the obligations he was under to those who had faithfully stood by him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by the strongest ties of personal and political friendship , I did all in my power to secure for him , which I did , the support of the members of the Legislature from my Congressional District . The day after the election for Senator he addressed to me a long letter , several pages of letter-paper , giving a detailed account of the contest and the reasons of his action in persuading his friends to vote for and elect Judge Trumbull , and expressing the opinion that I would have acted in the same way if I had been in his place . He then says : " I regret my defeat moderately , but am not nervous about it . . Perhaps it is as well for our grand cause that Trumbull is elected . " He then closes his letter as follows : " With my grateful acknowledgments for the kind , active , and continual interest you have taken for me in this matter allow me to subscribe myself , " Yours forever , " A. LINcoLN . " // On the last day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nebraska Democrat would be elected United States Senator . Judge Trumbull had the votes of five anti-Nebraska Democrats . And of this crisis Mr. Lincoln writes to me " So I determined to strike at once , and accordingly advising my friends to go for him , which they did , and elected him on that , the 10th ballot . " Though the failure to elect Mr. Lincoln brought grief to many hearts , yet the election of Judge Trumbull was well received by the entire anti-Nebraska party in the State . He proved himself an able , true , and loyal Senator , rendered great services to the Union cause , and proved himself a worthy representative of a great , loyal , and patriotic State . Notwithstanding the great satisfaction with which Judge Trumbull 's election had been received , there was a deep and profound feeling among the old Whigs , the Republicans , and many antiNebraska Democrats , that Mr. Lincoln should have had the position , and that he had not been fairly treated . But never a complaint or a suggestion of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravely and contentedly he went back to his law office , and business poured in upon him more than ever . In steping one side and securing the election of Judge Trumbull he " builded better than he knew . " Had Mr. Lincoln been elected Senator at that time he would never have had the canvass with Judge Douglas in 1858-never have been elected President in 1860 to leave a name that will never die . From 1855 to 1858 Mr. Lincoln was absorbed in the practice of his profession , though he took an active part in the canvass of 1856 , when the gallant Colonel Bissell was elected Governor . But what was somewhat remarkable , in all this time , without the least personal effort , and without any resort to the usual devices of politicians , Mr. Lincoln 's popularity continued to increase in every portion of the State . In the fall of 1858 there was to be an election of a Legislature which would choose a successor to Judge Douglas , whose term of service was to expire March 3 , 1859 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidified , and in Illinois the Republican and Democratic parties squarely confronted each other . Everywhere , by common consent , no Republican candidate for Senator was spoken of except Mr. Lincoln . In the Republican State Convention , in the summer of 1858 , a resolution was unanimously VOL. cxLI. - No. 347. // passed designating Mr. Lincoln as the unanimous choice of the Republicans of the State , as the candidate for U. S. Senator , to succeed Judge Douglas . That action is without precedent in thc State , and shows the deep hold Mr. Lincoln had on his party . Without being designated by any authorized body of Democrats , yet by common consent of the party , Judge Douglas became the candidate of the Democratic party . No other candidates were mentioned on either side , either directly or indirectly . The seven joint discussions which the candidates had in different parts of the State have become a part of the political history of the country . It was the battle of the giants . The parties were rallied as one man to the enthusiastic support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one not in the State at the time to measure the exciternent which everywhere prevailed . There was little talk about Republicanism and Democracy , but it was all " Lincoln and Douglas , " or " Douglas and Lincoln . " I attended every one of these joint discussions . It was at Freeport , in my Congressional District , which was the bulwark of Republicanism in the State . Two years later it gave Mr. Lincoln a majority for President of nearly fourteen thousand , and my own majority for member of Congress was about the same . The Freeport discussion was held in August . The day was bright , but the wind sweeping down the prairies gave us a chilly afternoon for an out-of-door gathering . In company with a large number of Galena people , we reached Freeport by train about ten o'clock in the morning . Mr. Lincoln had come in from the south the same morning , and we found him at the Brewster House , which was a sort of rallying-point for the Republicans . He had stood his campaign well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forenoon by sturdy Republicans , who had come long distances , not only to hear him speak but to see him , and it was esteemed the greatest privilege to shake hands with " Honest old Abe . " He had a kind word or some droll remark for every one , and it is safe to say that no one who spoke to him that day will ever have the interview effaced from memory . The meeting was held on a vacant piece of ground , not far from the center of the town . The crowd was immense and the enthusiasm great . Each party tried to outdo each other in the applause for its own candidate . The speaking commenced , but the chilly air dampened the ardor of the audience . Mr. Lincoln spoke deliberately , and apparently under a deep sense of the responsibility which rested // upon him . The que5tionB he propounded to Mr. Doug1a* he had put in writing ( and the answers to which sounded the political death-knell of Mr. Douglas ) ; he read slowly , and with great distinctness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual standard . He was evidently embarrassed by the questions , and floundered in his replies . The crowd was large , the wind was chilly , and there was necessarily much " noise and confusion , " and the audience did not take in the vast importance of the debate . On the whole , it may be said that neither party was fully satisfied with the speeches , and the meeting broke up without any display of enthusiasm . it is not the purpose of this paper to follow the incidents of the Presidential campaign of 1860 . The great event in Illinois was the monster Republican mass-meeting held at Springfield during the canvass . It was a meeting for the whole State , and more in the nature of a personal ovation to Mr. Lincoln than merely a political gathering . It was one of the most enormous and impressive gatherings I had ever witnessed . Mr. Lincoln , surrounded by some intimate friends , sat on the balcony of his humble home . It took hours for all the delegations to file before him , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by the manifestations of personal and political friendships , and returned all his salutations in that off-hand and kindly manner which belonged to him . I know of no demonstration of a similar character that can compare with it except the review by Napoleon of his army for the invasion of Russia , about the same season of the year in 1812 . Up to that time it was the grandest army the world had ever seen . A magnificent stand had been erected on the banks of the Ni*men , where sat Napoleon surrounded by his marshals . For hours the earth shook under the tread of his unrivaled soldiers . The Emperor sat cold , silent , and impassible . It was not before one of his most splendid divisions of cavalry defiled before him that he broke his silence by saying to the old marshal , Gouvion St. Cyr , " The French are a great people . " " Yes , Sire , " responded the old republican , " and they deserve more liberty . " E. B. WASHBURXE . ( To be concluded. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
