txt William P. Rosenblatt was in the wholesale and retail business here with George R. Brown , , formerly of San Francisco , A few days ago the firm was forced to make an assignment to Clifford A. S. Coe . of E. C. Hazard &; Co. , New-York . Rosenblatt has disappeared , and , it is believed , has gone for good . It is now ascertained that ho arrested Rosenblatt at the instigation of the Third National Bank , through his counsel , the Hon. L. L. Lewis . The trouble with the bank was settlea by Rosenblatt giving a bill of Bale which led to the seizure of the firm 's stock . From Batavia comes a story that some one in this pity has been using the name , at one of the banks , of Mr. Warner . on a forged check . It is said WO was realized . Mr. Warner got no satisfaction from the bank which paid out his money . and has thus far failed to find out who forged his . name , if that crime has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned the firm money , and done much business with it . Mr. Warner is going to investigate the matter . Many persons believe that Rosenblatt has fled with at least $20,000 in his pockets , but there is no confirmation of this at present . It is a fact that Brown suffers a loss of $6,000 , and his sister several thousand more . Rosenblatt 's mother put $6,000 into the business , which is also swept away . It represented the savings of many years . She will lose her home , it is said , and is nearly brokenhearted . The failure of the concern is due partially to the lavish and indiscreet manner in which the business of the establishment was conducted . There were several familie , s to be taken care of from the revenues of the business , to say nothing of drafts made on Mr. Rosenblatt 's resources by the requirements of the Bay View House , of which he was the lessee .                    @
