IN the March number of this REVIEW , the Hon. George S. Boutwell , in an article entitled " Common-Sense and Copyrights , " undertakes to show , first , that an international copyright will work to the disadvantage of the American public , and , secondly , that it is not required by any considerations of justice or equity . He mentions that the adoption of such a system " will necessitate the paying of increased prices for books , which will constitute a legalized system of taxation , the benefits of which will inure chiefly , if not exclusively , to persons who are not citizens of the United States . " He believes that there would be more than three times as many American readers of English books as English readers of American books , and says " Can we afford to pay three dollars to English authors , in order that American authors may receive one dollar from the reading public of Great Britain ? " Mr. Boutwell further contends that an international copyright is not required for the interests of American authors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their monopoly of the American market , " while the works of the others , comprising the majority , " could , in any case , not find sale in Great Britain. ** The many American authors who have attained an honorable position in literature , and who are , nevertheless , unable to secure from the sale of their books the annual equivalent of a book-keeper 's salary , may be inclined to question Mr. Boutwell 's estimate of what constitutes " ample compensation . " He does not admit that American authors have any ground for consideration under the principles of the protective system , because this " monopoly of their home market is all that any producers can demand . " Mr. Boutwell fails to find any considerations of international justice or of international expediency adequate to offset the above // specified material objections to the proposed measure . He puts the inquiry , " When the author has sold his work and has received payment therefor , is it a crime in the purchaser to reproduce that book ? " and replies : " Of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; for there can be no crime in such an act per se . " There is at present , he explains , no law to prevent such reproduction of English books in the United States , and the proceeding can not , therefore , be characterized as a crime . He compares it to the carrying of goods from one country to another country between which there are no customs regulations . " Such an act , " he says , " has no moral quality in it . " Let us first give consideration to his conclusions on the ethical point . Thirty years ago an American travelling in Europe found himself troubled , and hi* national pride mortified , by continually meeting expressions of opinion concerning the barbarism of the American institution of slavery . With this serious blot on their civilization , the United States were spoken of as having a staudard of National conduct below that of the other nations of the civilized world , with which such an institution had long been a matter of ancient history . It was useless for any individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York or to Massachusetts , where slavery was no longer tolerated . He could not escape his share of the responsibility of the National sin , and was obliged to hear his beloved " Land of the Free " classed with Turkey or the Barbary States . Whatever progress we had made or whatever enlightenment we had secured in other directions , in this matter of holding on to a relic of barbarism which the rest of the civilized world had discarded , we had placed ourselves , or had left ourselves , outside the pale of civilization . In what consisted our crime ? We were breaking no law , national or international , for we had no international conventions or comities with Africa . The fact , however , that we were appropriating , without payment , the results of African labor , and that our American law rendered possible , and even legalized , such injustice , gave just cause for the condemnation of Europe . To-day the American in Europe has fresh cause for mortification in continuing to hear the United States stigmatized as still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and in being asked to explain why our National standard of morality should lag half a century behind that of the other literature-producing nations . // rfhe ground for this present charge is that we are appropriating , without payment , the results of English labor , and that we maintain a system of law which legalizes such appropriation . In one respect , the present method of appropriation is even less defensible than that practised under the slavery system . The slaves received at least a living for their labor , if only because it was for the interest of their masters that they should continue to live . But Mr. Boutwell , and those who agree with him , contend that any payment whatever to these English laborers , whose work we are enjoying , would be an injustice to the American people . Mr. Boutwell should remember that , as mankind progresses , its standard of ethics grows higher , and in no respect has the development been more marked than in the furthering of wholesome international relations , and in the recognition of the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . The old-time feeling of home patriotism-as expressed by " Who 's that , Bill ? " " A stranger . " " Then cave a brick at im " - doubtless still exists in remote villages , but is assuredly far less bitter between nations than it was a century ago . Such an expression would , however , apparently still hold good for the United States , if the stranger happened to be an author , only , before " eaving the brick , " we should , under the existing system , pick his pockets . Mr. Boutwell may say that it is possible to pay too much attention to the opinions and criticisms of Europe , and that America is as competent to fix its own standard of international ethics as to make seventy-four cents of silver equal to a gold dollar ; and if the statement were so framed , it might even be possible to agree with it . But , after all , the attempt with the " buzzard " dollar is a matter of purely domestic significance , as we do not undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Questions of international relations , however , can not be decided in any such off-hand domestic manner , but require , for a fair and trustworthy consideration , the opinion of some party not directly concerned in the question at issue . When , therefore , we Americans find that in this matter ( mainly , as said , between ourselves and England ) the consensus of European opinion is entirely against us , while we may not be bound to accept at once this verdict as final , it is certainly sufficient to cause us to examine carefully whether there be any // satisfactory defence for the peculiar position held by the United States . Mr. Boutwell quotes the wording of our present Copyright Act , aud appears to believe that , if Americau citizens fulfil the obligations imposed upon them by American law , all proper requirements have been met . But it is the contention of Europe that , in this matter of the recoguition of literary property , American law is shamefully iuadequate , and is half a century or more behind the present standard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice to be remedied must precede the enactment of law , and is it not time that our National law-makers recognized that our National law was legalizing injustice ? In the early part of the present century , the Barbary States were carrying on their little system of piracy . It was impressed upon them that the rest of the world had outgrown piracy and would no longer tolerate it ; but the Barbarians took the very plausible ground that other nations had practised piracy until quite recent times ; that it was not contrary to the domestic law of Algiers , Tripoli , and Tunis ; that , if they relinquished the plunder brought in by their freebooters and the advantage of the labor of their Christian slaves , their means of education in " the arts of civilization " would suffer ; that for such European wares as they might still continue to use they would have to pay three rupees , where Europe took goods of but one rupee 's value from them ; and , finally , that they did not care for the opinion of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly , bombarded by the vessels of the states whose citizens they had been plundering , until the Barbarians decided that they did care for European opinion , and concluded to abandon piracy . In the work of bringing these backward States up to a proper standard of morality in their international relations , our country , it may be remembered , took a creditable part . The provisions of the International-Copyright Convention framed at Berne , in 1887 , have been approved , with hardly an exception , by the several states of Europe , and the list of signers even includes the representatives of ilayti , Liberia , and Tunis . - In this latest crusade for the suppression of piracy , little Tunis is , therefore , far in advance of the Great Republic . Mr. Boutwell contends that no actual injury is done to the foreign author by the American reprinters , because such author // retains his home market , and the inducements of that market must have been sufficient , or the author would not have written . I answer that , according to justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportioned to the extent of the service he has rendered and to the number of persons upon whom he has conferred benefit or pleasure ; and the fact that he might have been willing to expend his labor , and to produce a given result , for a smaller compensation , does not free from obligation any who have been benefited by this labor and who have failed to make return for the benefit . If the Englishman , Freeman , were giving a lecture in Mr. Boutwell 's home town of Groton , I do not see why , on the principles set forth by the latter , he would not feel justified in securing his own admission to the lecture-room at a lower price than the regular fee , by purchasing a bogus ticket from a curb-stone speculator . Professor Freeman would , on Mr. Boutwell 's contention , have suffered no actual loss , for no property would have been taken from him , and the fact that the sound of his voice reached the ears of Mr. Boutwell as well as of those of the more conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission , could not cause the lecturer any injury . Then , in any case , Freeman is only an Englishman , and our Government is under no obligations to protect an Englishman 's income , even if he is doing a service to American citizens . It has taken some centuries of literary labor to bring the world to a recognition of intellectual productions as property , and of authors as entitled to the same protection for their property as that accorded to other classes of producers . The fact that ideas , expressed in literary form , constitute a product , and that the author whose labor has formulated these ideas has a property-right in the result and is , in equity , entitled to a compensation from each person deriving benefit from such result , has , however , gradually gained general acceptance ; so that , in all the literatureproducing countries , the authcrs have , during the past century and a half , enjoyed the protection of domestic copyrights . The next step was logically inevitable . If such a property-right existed in an intellectual production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or limited by a political boundary . The recognition of this contention has been given in the various international-copyright treaties between the different countries of // Europe ; the earliest being that between Prussia and Wurtemberg in 1837 , and the latest , representing a most substantial triumph for the principle , the great convention of 1887 , already alluded to , which was held at Berne , and which may be said to have formulated an international law of literature for Europe . Mr. Boutwell is a cordial supporter of the protective system , which is , for the present , accepted as our National policy ; but he contends that " protection " has nothing to do with copyright . Why not ? inquires the American author . Is it not one of the avowed objects of protection to save the American producer from being competed with to his disadvantage by the " pauper labor " of Europe ? Can Mr. Boutwell point out , in the list of American producers , for whose interests the protective system assumes to care , a single one whose products are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is concerned , are as directly the work of " paupers " as are the appropriated books of English authors ? However poverty-stricken the labor which has produced Chilian wool or English pig-iron , it must have received some payment for its product ; and even if there were no tarifftax to increase the cost of such imported wool or iron , the Ohio farmer or the Pennsylvania miner would , at the worst , have had a low-priced article , and not a " no-priced " article , to compete with . But an American book of a certain class must find sale in the face of a similar English book , the literary portion of which is a " no-priced " article-that is , an article for which nothing whatever has been paid to the producer . Under the pressure of such competition , the American writer of this class of books must , if he is a first-class man , accept a reduced and often an entirely inadequate return for his labor ; and if he is a less capable man , or a beginner whose capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labor for no return at all . Under the present system , which Mr. Boutwell believes should be retained , the American author , whose home market has thus been cut from under his feet by the " pauper labor " of England , is estopped from obtaining in England the proceeds which honorable English publishers would be glad to pay him , because our Government has thus far refused to take the steps necessary to secure for him the protection of English law . Mr. Boutwell himself points out , in connection with his " threedollars-for-one " argument , that the extent of the literary produc // tion of this country is " not creditable to us as a literary people " ; but it does not seem to have occurred to him to inquire the reason for the difficulty . Mr. Lowell , Mr. Stedman , Mr. Eggleston , and other authors who have given study to the matter , could have explained to him that the most important obstacle in the way of the wholesome development of American literature is the absence of an international copyright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , in which it simply leaned upon or imitated the trans-Atlantic models , is , according to these excellent authorities , largely due to the fact that English books , good , bad , and indifferent , have , under the present system , been practically forced upon American readers . The American writer asks for no bounty , and for no privilege of taxing his competitors . He simply demands a fair field , equal conditions , and no favor . I now come to what Mr. Boutwell would probably call the practical part of the question ,  --  the consideration , namely , of the price that our people would have to pay for the privilege of practising the same standard of international morality as that accepted by the trans-Atlantic world ; not only , it may be remarked , by Liberia and Tunis ( where , as I frankly admit , the copyright question can , at present , possess little more than a theoretical interest ) , but by Belgium and Switzerland and the other bookreading countries of Europe , in most of which the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places first in his discussion of the subject this matter of the probable cost to our country . To me , however , it seems to be properly the second thing to be considered . I feel assured that when the American people , who are believers in fairplay , have once convinced themselves that they are doing an injustice to foreign authors , to American authors , and to their own good repute , they will be ready to remedy that injustice , even though they may have to pay something for so doing . It is very satisfactory , notwithstanding , to be able to assure the opponents of copyright , who are anxious about the question of cost , that in this case we shall not only have nothing to pay for the privilege of being honest , but we shall actually secure a " net profit " from such action . The testimony presented last spring , when hearings on the pending bill were granted by the committees of the Senate and // 471 the House ( testimony which has been in no respect controverted ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-buyers will secure their reading-matter cheaper under an international copyright than under the present " general scramble " system of publishing . The supporters of the copyright measure contend that it will have the effect of lessening the price of all the better classes of books , which are of the most importance for the higher education and cultivation of the people , and of increasing the supplies of these , and that the only publications which will be at all increased in price are the cheapest issues of foreign fiction . In support of these conclusions I submitted to the Judiciary Committee of the House certain considerations , of which I here give the substance : First. - The conditions of literature now in existence can , of course , not be affected by any copyright measure , as no such measure could be made retroactive , and there is , therefore , no foundation for the vague assertion , which has occasionally been made , that " the people are to be asked to pay more for their Macaulay and Tennyson . " , S'econd. - It is to be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign novels at fifteen and twenty cents , after exhausting the books really worth reprinting , and after including in their lists ( under the necessity of a periodical issue ) a large mass of indifferent and undesirable material , by no means deserving the attention of American readers , are now , in great part , being discontinued , partly because of the exhaustion of reprintable material , and partly , also , because they are no longer profitable undertakings . One reason why these " libraries are proving unremunerative is , unquestionably , because of a change in the taste and in the judgment of buyers of books , who are beginning to understand that they secure better value in paying fifty cents , or seventy-five , for a decently-printed volume that can be preserved for the use of a number of readers , than in expending fifteen or twenty cents for a flimsy quarto , fit only to be thrown away after one reading . Third. -A material waste of outlay is in3urred , an outlay from which there is benefit for no one , in the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign work . The type-setting and stereotyping of each of the five cheap editions now on the market of " Robert Elsmere " have cost about $*00 , and the outlay for advertising each edition has probably not been less . There has been also a similar quintupling of expense in the time given by the respective travelling salesmen in drumming for orders among the booksellers . Mr. Boutwell is clear in his mind that any payment made to the English author must come out of the pockets of the American book-buyer . Is it not evident , however , that , if the authorized publishers had been left in control of the sale of a single popular edition of " Robert Elsmere , " there would have been a saving of from $2.500 to $3,500 of these needless outlays incurred on the four competing editions , which sum could have been paid to Mrs. Ilumphry Ward , without bringing upon the American reader a single penny of the " taxation " which Mr. Boutwell considers so objectionable ? The question might be raised whether , if they had such control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular edition at all . I answer , certainly ; not because they are philanthropists , but because , as business men , they would not fail to print their books in the form which was best suited for the American market , and which , as experience has shown , would bring the largest return to themselves . " Barriers Burned Away " and " The Leavenworth case " are // TIlE NORTH AMERICAZV* REVIEW . American copyright books , each controlled by a single firm , but of both of these books , while they were in the full tide of their success , popular editions were issued , retailing at twenty cents a copy . The publishers of " Robert Elsmere " happen also to be the publishers of Bryce 's " American Commonwealth , " and this last they are able thanks to certain chapters by American collaborators , to control for the American market . They have , nevertheless , not failed to provide this market at once with a popular edition selling at one-half the price of that issued in England ; and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -A large number of important English and Continental works , American editions of which would prove of material service to American students and readers , it is not practicable , under the present state of things , for American publishers to undertake to reprint at all , as in case their reprints are favorably received , any prospect of profit from these is promptly destroyed by the competition of rival and unauthorized editions , which secure the advantage of their literary judgment and their advertising . Such American readers as are obliged to purchase this class of works must , as a result , pay the cost of the expensive and often unsuitable foreign editions , while ( as such editions can not be adequately advertised ) a large number of readers to whom such books would be of service are never even made aware of their existence . An immediate result of an international copyright would be the reprinting of inexpensive editions , suited for the wants of a large circle of impecunious buyers , of a number of European works now brought into this country only in expensive " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicable a large number of international undertakings which can not be ventured upon without the assured control of several markets . The volumes for these international series will be secured from the leading writers of the world , American , Jinglish , and Continental , and the compensation paid to these writers , together with the cost of the production of illustrations , maps , tables , etc. , will be divided among the several editions . The lower the proportion of this first outlay to be charged to the American edition , the lower the price at which this can be furnished ; and as the publisher secures the most satisfactory returns from large sales to a wider circle , the lower the price at which it will be furnished . It would , perhaps , not be quite correct to say that these international series would be cheaper than at present , for there are , as yet , but few examples of them , but it is the case that , by means of such series ( only adequately possible under international copyright ) , American readers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices than can ever otherwise be practicable . Mr. Boutwell , and those who think with him , usually speak as if the flow of literature was something produced by nature , and which could be depended upon to give about the same quantity and quality of annual supply , whatever the attending conditions , and irrespective of the extent of the inducement offered to those concerned ( under nature ) in the production . So far , however , is this from being the case , that a very large and increasing proportion of the most important publications of each year are produced only at the instance of the publishers , and would never come into existence at all if it were not for the planning and the outlay of the pubushers . Examples of this class of literary undertaking are afforded by the " American Statesman Series , " the " International Science Series , " the " Story of the Nations Series , " and many others ,  --  works which are practically the joint creation of // publishers and authors . The production of this class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which is , nevertheless , of the first importance for that " higher education of the community " that Mr. Boutwell is anxious about , would be very materially furthered by international copyright . It is as reasonable for the community to expect publishers to risk labor and capital in literary undertakings which they are not to be allowed to control , as it would be to expect builders to place substantial structures on ground to which no title could be given , and in which structures , when completed , the law of the community authorized any who so desired , to live free of rent . Sixth. - The higher prices of current English books are cited as examples of what American readers would , under a copyright , be compelled to pay for American editions of similar works . It is , however , easy to show that the selling price of books depends , not upon the conditions of copyright , but upon the requirements of the market . Books are first issued in England in the high-priced editions because , under the English system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries , which have encouraged the maintenance of prices sufficiently high to hinder the buying of books . There is also the further reason that in England readers and buyers of books belong in much larger proportion to the wealthy classes than is the case in the United States . In France and Germany , on the other hand ,  - -  countries fully under the control of copyright , both domestic and international ,  - -  the first issues of standard and current publications , both copyright and non-copyright , are cheaper than anywhere else in the world . In Paris , for instance , a beautifully-printed and beautifully-illustrated edition of such a book as Daudet 's " Tartarim dams les A*pes " is published at seventy cents , and this is one example of many . In Berlin . we find such series as " Das Wissen der Ge* , enwart , " " The Knowledge of the Present , " issued in handsomely-printed , well-illustrated and neatly-bound volumes , of which sixty-two are now ready , selling at one mark ( twenty-five cents ) each . The works in this series are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the continent , and this series is one of many . It is also the case that , since the establishment of international copyright between the different states of Germany and the several countries of Europe , there has been a steady decrease in the prices in these countries of standard and current literature , copyright as well as non-copyright , and a marked impetus has been given to publishing undertakings of service to the community . As Mr. Brander Matthews has well pointed out , the cheapest books to be bought to-day in the United States are mostly inferior stories by contemporary English novelists , while the cheapest books to be bought to-day in Europe are the best works by the best authors of all times . In America , where the system , or lack of system , of " open publishing 's prevails , the cheapest books are the least important and often the less desirable . In Europe , where international copyright is in force , the best books are the cheapest . The absence of international copyright encourages bad books or poor books , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling price of a book depends , not on the copyright , but on the extent of the market that can be assured for it . Without an international copyright , no assured market is possible , and no low-priced international series can be planned or prepared for American readers . , Seventh. -A reduction can also be looked for in the selling price of certain lines of American fiction and other current literature . Under the present " cut-throat " competition , the publishers of the works of such authors as Howells , James , Aldrich , Bret Harte , and other leading American writers have practically given up the attempt to compete with the unpaid-for reprints of foreign writers . Knowing that they can depend upon certain ( comparatively limited ) circles of readers , they find it to be more profitable to obtain from these readers the highest prices they are willing to pay . When , on the other hand , the foreign works are put on the same footing as those of American writers , the publishers of the latter will find it to their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose will at once issue their books at popular prices . The possibility of exporting stereotype plates or editions of standard American works will also lessen the proportion of first outlay to be charged to the American edition , and will enable this to be sold profitably at lower prices than would otherwise be practicable . An example of the advantage given to the American buyer by such an export arrangement is afforded by the great Latin dictionary lately published by the Harpers . Duplicate plates of this were sold by the publishers for the edition issued by the Clarendon Press , in Oxford , and the saving secured from the proportion of the type-setting and editorial outlay charged to the English edition , has enabled the American publishers to sell the book in this market much more cheaply than would otherwise have been practicable . To summarize : The selling price of books depends , not on the copyright , but on the requirements of the market , and the extent of the market that is controlled by the author and his representative . American buyers are accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the publishers are not likely to throw away their money by making dear books for which they could not find a sale . The wider the market and the greater the number of editions between which the first outlays can be divided , the smaller the cost of each edition and of each copy , and with an assured control to authors and publishers of the result of their literary undertakings , there will be a greater increase in the publication of international series , which will provide for American readers , at the lowest prices , satisfactory editions of the works of the leading writers of the world , American , English , and Continental . The pending Copyright Bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chace , of Rhode Island , a Republican and Protectionist , who has for years done most earnest and effective work in behalf // of the desired reform , and who has been its acknowledged leader in Washington . His resignation from the Senate , just announced , will be a very serious loss to the cause , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be forgotten . The bill was intr ' *duced in the House by W. C. P. Breckinridge , of Kentucky , a Democrat and a Revenue-Reformer , who has been cordially interested in attempting to secure the enactment of the measure for which another Kentucky statesman , Henry Clay , was working fifty years ago . The bill was passed in the Senate by a vote of thirty-five to ten , and fully two-thirds of the House were recorded as in favor of it . A small group of filibustering opponents was , nevertheless , able , under the peculiar rules of the House , to prevent the consideration of the measure during the session which has just closed . The responsibility for its enactment will now rest with the Fifty-first Congress , and it is hoped that , under a wholesome pressure of public opinion , the bill may this year become a law , and , after half a century of effort , our country may at last be freed from this long-standing reproach .
