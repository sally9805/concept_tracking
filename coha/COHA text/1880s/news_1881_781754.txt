txt The adverse report of the Senate Railroad Committee on the bill to create a Board of Railroad Commissioners has been extracted from Mr. WAGNER 'S pocket , and it is such a little one , in every sense of the word , as to excite surprise at the length of time required to produce it . , It was away back in April that this bill was first sent to the committee , after having been thoroughly discussed in the Assembly and passed by a very emphatic vote . Week after week MT . WEBSTER WAGNER and his committee incubated upon this bill in mysterious silence. : They say that they have " listened to many full and exhaustive arguments " for and against the measure , but they have contrived to keep wonder-t fully quiet about it .. There have been no intimalions to ' the public of any , hearings. : ? These arguments . have probably been inflicted upon the members of the corn- ? mittee individually and privately ; otherwise we ought to have " got wind of " them in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , they seem to have furnished the committee with ' wonderfully few and feeble points for their side of the case , judging from their report . The ? committee further says ; that " while some citizens . representing : a few locations ? favored its passage , the manufacturing and business in- : - terests of the rest of the State were overwhelmingly against it . " The " naanufactur-1. ing and business interests " will be surprised to . f learn that they - ? have been ? in any .. way consulted or heard by this committee. , This ' - statement . is an amazing specimen of impudence , not to ; give it any stronger , name . The Senators signing the report ' know : perfectly : well that the committee never gave the business interests of the State any opportunity to express their-sentiments. on the subject . They never invited an ex- , pression of public opinion ' in any form or manner . in regard . to it while it was in their : hands . They know , furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . this bill quietly in their keeping until an ad- : journment . of r , Legislature , or ' until such time that there ' would be no chance for a fair consideration of its provisions , and that nothing . but the prolongation of the session by the ; Senatorial contest brought it to the light again . ' ; ? Knowing that this was their purpose , and that they have given no hearings on the subject , they have the impudence to make an evasive representation that they have listened to a full and fair ex-. pression of opinion on both sides , and have , , found ' ; it overwhelmingly against the bill . Such a report is an ; insult to public intelligence , ? : and would be an insult to any , ' legislative body that could make any claim . to dignity . , % : ; Having set out with this astounding falsification of what its own action and the result of its inquiries has been , the committee proceeds to string ' together ' a few ? of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this State. : At the bottom of this are set the five names of W. WAGNER , E. M. MADDEN , E. : HOGAN , FERDINAND EIDMAN , ? and WILLIAM W. ROCKWELL. - These men say that a Railroad Commission was tried in this State once and , failed , but they neither show why it failed nor that no occasion for a successful ? one : exists . They say that in Illinois the Rail- , road 1 . Commission ' has not " remedied ' the abuses complained of , " but has been used by shippers " to secure secret rates and rebates . " ' In short , it has become an " instru ment ? of oppression . and I fraud . " ? It is something to get an acknowledgment , that railroads do indulge in " " " secret rates and rebates , " and that they are in effect oppressive and fraudulent . - It has been amply shown ? that such " abuses " exist in ' : this State , ? and intelligent men will hardly ac cept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or has had unfaithful Commissioners as a valid argument against ' trying to'find a remedy : or reposing trust in any public official whatever . Senates and . Legislatures ere now have been unfaithful to public trusts , but that has been taken . as a reason for choosing better . ones , and , not as a ground for abolishing them alto- ? gether . The committee carefully : avoids making any reference , to States in which Railroad Commissions have entirely succeeded in the purpose of their existence , but it makes the ridiculous statement that here the State Engineer and Surveyor exercises in " a wholly impartial and satisfactory manner " the powers which a Board of ' Commissioners can not be trusted with , and which there is no need of conferring upon anybody . The only other parody upon serious arg , u , mentwhich the committee.3 ) utsforth is the stale pretense that a commission , exercising the functions which it says the State Engineer and Surveyor exercises not only without harm but in a satisfactory manner , " would become the most monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people that the State has ever known . " It is well known that the State Engineer does not perform the functions which the bill imposes on the Board of Commissioners , but the pretense regarding the political power which they would have and probably use is too absurd to be treated with patience . These members of the committee know it to be a pretense and a sham . If it were not , they would be the most likely of all men to favor a Railroad Commission . Messrs . PITTS and DAVENPORT , of the committee , had the self-respect to dissent from the report , but they did not have sufficient sense of public fluty to expose its flimsiness and say a word in behalf of the bill . The Senate refused , yesterday , by a close vote to take up the measure in Committee of the Whole , but this is understood to be because the report was not yet printed and in the hands of the members . That ' body owes it to itself more than ever after this disgraceful exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it in a serious and becoming manner . To evade it now will be to share in the ignominy of the Wagner committee .
