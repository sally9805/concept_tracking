txt Sept. 1 ends the cotton year and marks the dividing line between two crops . In place of the vague speculation and guesswork with which the gentlemen of the mills and the markets have had hitherto to content themselves , we have now the figures showing the actual production for the year 1881 , and indicating the disposition which the world made of the staple . The Financial Chronicle , in its careful and comprehensive review of the cotton crop and movement for the year ' ending Sept. 1 , makes the total crop reach 5,435,845 bales . The yield of 1880 was 6,589,320 bales , showing a falling oft of 1,153,184 bales . This loss may be charged to the drought and the ravages , in certain localities , of the cotton-worm . The acreage planted to cotton last year would have yielded , with favorable weather and exemption from the worm , a larger crop than that of 1880 ? perhaps fully 7,000,000 bales , so that the weather and the worm together robbed the country of about $75,000,000 . There arc some modifying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bales in 1881 was 485.88 pounds ; for the year just ended it was 475.67 , or ' more than 10 pounds lighter . Measured by last year 's average weight per bale , the crop grown in 1831 would be but 5,321,656 bales . On the other hand , the last crop was much cleaner , containing less sand , dust , and " trash " than that grown in 1880 , so that in its superior spinning qualities and yarn product there is to be found partial , if not complete , compensation for the lightness of the bales . The crop was disposed of as follows : Exported , 3,595,031 bales ; taken by spinners at home , 1,661,206 ; stock on hand Sept. 1 , 120,722 . The exports last year were 4,596,279 bales . The European consumption of cotton , however , has been larger than ever before . Great Britain having increased her average weekly consumption from 08,602 bales in 1881 to 70,500 in 1882 , while the weekly takings of Great Britain and , the Continent together rose from 125,538 bales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 6,760,000 bales , of 400 pounds each , the last two months ' takings being estimated , the actual figures not being yet obtainable . But as our exports fell off 1,001,248 bales , the increase had to be sought in another quarter . India supplied most of it , sending to all Europe 1,760,000 bales in the eight months beginning Jan. 1 of the present year , against 1,085,000 bales in the corresponding period last year . The Financial Chronicle estimates that Europe will want , during the year just begun , 350,000 bales more than she took in the year just closed . From present appearances we shall be abundantly able to supply her needs . In estimating home consumption for the year it is necessary to take into account the 218,043 bales on hand Sept. 1 , 1881 . This makes , with-the crop grown that year , an available supply for export and manufacture of 5,653,888 . Deducting exports , known losses by fire , and the present stock on hand , the total takings of the spinners of the United States for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,661 , - 206 were taken by Northern and 238.000 by Southern mills . The amount taken by Northern spinners fell off 25,598 from the previous year 's figures , while the Southern mills show an increase in their takings of 38,000 bales . This is the natural result of the rapid expansion of the manufacturing interest in the cotton States . In 1879-80 , with 157 mills , these States manufactured 179,000 bales of cotton . They now have 252 mills  --  not all yet in operation  --  with a capital of $41,241,450 , or $2,000,000 greater than two years ago , and have increased their consumption 59,000 bales in these two years . The falling off in Northern consumption has resulted in part from the unfavorable condition of the market for print cloths and sheetings , and in part from the suspension of work at the Harmony Mills , the Pacific Mills , and at Fall River on account of troubles with operatives . The cloth market has been overstocked all the year , and while the staple has risen in price , the manufactured product has fallen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound a year ago . It is now nearly a cent higher . Standard sheetings have , meanwhile , after a slight rise during the Winter months , fallen from 81 to 81 , and print cloths , which stood at 4 cents last Fall , are now quoted at 3.85 . The prospect for the future is nevertheless excellent . An increased home consumption will naturally result from the bountiful harvests of the year , and every spindle will be kept busy . As the Chronicle justly points out , we have in this connection to look only to the condition of the home market for our cotton goods , as our tariff " protects us against foreign customers for our manufactures . " Tho effect of this is to shut our mills up to purchasers in the United States , and as the demand naturally falls off in years of short crops and depressed trade , they must suffer periodically from the evils of overproduction , since they can find no , outside market for their goods . The exports of cotton manufactures for the year ending June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding year . Put this insignificant sum in comparison with Great Britain 's export of $395,000,000 for the calendar year 1881 , and it is evident at a glance that something is wrong , for we have in this contest important advantages which would tell decisively in our favor if we were not handicapped in some other direction . We have the raw material 3,000 miles nearer our mills than the Manchester manufacturers ; wages in this branch of manufacture are but slightly , if at all , higher hem than there ; our goods are of better quality , as every one knows who has read the State Department 's report on the cotton goods trade of the world . Yet Great Britain exports thirty times as many dollars ' worth of cotton goods as we do .
