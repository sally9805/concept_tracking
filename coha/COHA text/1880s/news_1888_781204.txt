txt Ever since the fight between the Democrats and Republicans and the Labor Union has been instituted in this county it has been very bitter , especially with the Republicans who joined the Union Labor Party and the straight Labor Party . Not long ago a colored person , Silas Sherman , who is a Democrat and wears a Cleveland hat and carries the campaign flag for all the Democratic rallies , was nottlied through the Post Office by a supposed politician of his own color to leave or he would be hurt . This so exasperated the Democrats that they made diligent search for the writer , declaring vengeance . This had hardly blown over when it was learned that a very influential negro named Harrison Spencer , living on the A. S. Taylor place , one mile from here , was last mein called out from his bed and taken away in bis night clothes and , it is supposed , drowned . No trace of him can he found . His wife , the only witness in the darkness , says her husband heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not broken into his garden . Soon she saw a form pass the door and then another . Then various words were heard sounding like those of over a dozen men , and she saw her husband forced to mount an animal from a stump near by and hurried of . The alarm was given as soon as daylight . The horses were tracked to the river . There is no doubt but Spencer was murdered by men of his own color for political reasons . He bears the best of names , and has been a practical farmer for a number of years . The facts of his declaration on the streets or this place a few days ago of his supposed Democracy is the sole reason for his murder , and it lies at the door of the malcontent office seekers and ignorant negroes . Should the body be found , or any evidence of the guilty Darts , nothing could prevent a lynching , and in turn perhaps much bloodshed , as the murderers of this negro must have many followers , judging from recent demonstrations .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
