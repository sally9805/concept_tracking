txt It is remarkable with what promptness the manufacturers of fire-proof safes take advantage of every fire which occurs in this City . Two days after the fire each manufacturer displays in front of his place of business a battered safe , with its door wrenched off and its sides blistered with heat , and announces , with the help of a large placard , that " This safe preserved the books and papers of Messrs . Smith &; Robinson in the great fire in Two Hundred and Twentythird-street . " This is , of course , an excellent advertisement for the manufacturer , and is by most people accepted as a demonstration of the fire-proof qualities of his safe . The average man is satisfied with accepting the claims made by the safe manufacturers without investigating them . This is the reason why no one has yet called attention to one of the chief mysteries of the safe manufacturing business . A little reflection will show that it is rather odd that so many different safes shou/d'always happen to be in every building that burns down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers , each one of whom insists that his particular safe is the only one which is really fire-proof , and these four manufacturers , together with their agencies and branch agencies , have in the aggregate eleven places of business in this City . Now , after every fire there will be eleven safes exhibited at these places of business and described as the safes that were taken from the ruins made by the fire in question . Similar safes are also put on exhibition in other cities , say in the twelve largest cities of the continent . Of course , the whole number of dilapidated safes thus exhibited within three or four days after a New-York fire varies somewhat , but as a rule we may safely assume that it amounts to one hundred and thirty . We must add to these the safes that are rescued from fires but are not exhibited by the manufacturers , and we shall not be far wrong if we estimate that in any given case a safe manufacturer will claim that the damaged safe exhibited by him is only one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one and the same fire . We must , therefore , multiply one hundred and thirty by seven , which gives us nine hundred and ten safes as the number which are uniformly taken from the embers of every building which is consumed by fire in. this City . It must be confessed that as yet only seven hundred and eighteen large safes have been taken from the ruins of the Potter Building , but there is little doubt that the full number will be made up in the course of a few days . It may seem rather incredible that the enormous quantity of nine hundred and ten heavy fire-proof safes should be contained in any one building in this City , but it will not do to cast doubt upon the truths of mathematics . The fact that this average number is destroyed ? so far as their future usefulness is concerned ? in every fire which occurs in New York City can not be doubted . We have at least three hundred good-sized fires every year , and the aggregate destruction of safes thus caused in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same rate of destruction goes on in other cities in proportion to their size . If we take only the twelve largest cities of the Union , and estimate that the average annual number of fires in each one of them is 250 , we shall find that in these twelve cities no less than 2,730,000 safes are destroyed every year , and we may safely assume that the safes destroyed in the smaller cities and towns will bring the whole number up to at least 3,000,000 . Were these to be put side by side they would form a line of safes stretching three times around the world , and enough would still be left to reach oneeighth of the distance from the earth to the moon . If hammered into 12-inch iron plates they would furnish armor for 731,000 vessels of 4,000 tons each , and if a missionary were placed in each safe and sent to the heathen , the entire pagan population of the globe could be converted to Christianity in thirty-five days  --  allowing twenty converts to each missionary . Now , it is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like large enough to supply this tremendous waste . There is some mistake in the figures put forth by the manufacturers or there is a mystery as yet unsolved in connection with the safe business . Long ago it was demonstrated by a scientific person that the great majority of the alleged iron safes that are constantly hoisted with so much ceremony from the street to the upper windows of downtown offices are in reality made of light pasteboard , and that , being intended solely for advertising purposes , they are carried back to the manufacturers after dark under the arm of some hired porter . It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the greater part of the so-called fire-proof safes exhibited by manufacturers immediately after every great fire are nothing more than pasteboard , cunningly painted and scorched so as to imitate blistered iron . If this be the truth as to the matter , and if we assume that the usual claim made by every manufac- turer to the effect that at least seven of his safes are destroyed in every fire is a profesfessional exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
