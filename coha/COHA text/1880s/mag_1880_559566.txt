IT is perhaps rather late , after the lapse of three months , to reply to the paper of Sir Francis Hincks on " The Relations between Canada and the United States " ; but the great revolution which in the mean time has taken place in England alters the aspect of this among other questions . At all events , I will be brief . My principal object is to remove , if possible , from the minds of American statesmen , and any other Americans who may take an interest in this matter , an impression which the language of Sir Francis Hincks and of writers in Canadian journals hostile to American connection , such as the Toronto " Globe , " a movement of some kind tending to closer relations with the United States is going on , nobody can fail to see ; otherwise , why should Sir Francis Hincks be so uneasy , and why should the Toronto " Globe " be seized about once a week with a paroxysm of calumnious rage ? But the language of Sir Francis Hincks and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what was on foot was a political cabal or conspiracy of some kind got up by the arts of a knot of politicians for the objects which political intriguers usually have in view . This is not the fact . The movement is essentially economical , rather than political , though it brings.political feelings into play , and it is spontaneous if ever a movement was . Those whom Sir Francis Iflineks 's courtesy usually styles " agitators " are no more agitators than he is now , nor half as much agitators as he once was : they are not in politics at all , and consequently can not be actuated by political ambition ; they are either commercial men or journalists , and , if they are journalists , I am not aware that their style is particularly demagogic , or that , while they treat with frankness the subjects of the day , they betray any impatient desire to precipitate events . I can answer for one of them that he is as profoundly convinced as it is possible for any // human being to be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of awaiting the formation of mature and deliberate opinion in both of the communities whose relations to each other are concerned . Sir Francis Hincks is one of a party which , with the best intentions , does its utmost to give the policy of Canada what may be called an anti-continental turn . He must not reproach those who , believing this to be a mistake , take the liberty of expressing their opinion , and of endeavoring to counteract the estrangement which it is his object and that of his friends to produce . They feel that they may do this without placing themselves in any way ir a false position . Sir Francis Hincks evidently thinks that he places himself in no false position by writing about the relations between the two countries in an American journal . He is right . I have spent some years in the United States , not as a mere sojourner , but engaged in educational work with my colleagues ; I think I may say I have had full access to the real sentiments of the people , and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest desire of interfering with the independence of Canada , or in any way doing violence to her inclinations . I believe we may discuss these questions with the freedom of friendship and of natural partnership in the advantages and destinies of the New World . Canada is attracted , economically , to the rest of the continent of which she is a part ; while , as the recent application of the Boston merchants to Congress shows , the rest of the continent is at the same time attracted economically to her . This is the movement which is really going on , and which by its increasing manifestations excites the alarm of Sir Francis Hincks and the " Globe . " It is not the offspring of intrigue , but the behest of Nature . No conspiracy except the mutual interest of the two nations gave it birth : no denunciations will put it down . Let those who think that they can for ever arrest or even reverse this commercial gravitation consult the map . I do not mean the map political , in which the Dominion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map economical . In the map economi* cal the Dominion consists of four distinct territories , separated from each other by great natural barriers . Between the Maritime Provinces and old Canada ( Ontario and Quebec ) lies the wild country through which the Intercolonial Railway runs ; between old Canada and Manitoba lies the desert to the north of Lake Superior ; between Manitoba and British Columbia lies not only a formidable tract of // desert but a series of mountain-ranges still more formidable . Each of the separate territories is by nature connected commercially with an adjacent portion of the Union : Nova Scotia and New Brun*wick with New England ; Quebec and Ontario with the States to the south of them , Ontario drawing her fuel from Pennsylvania ; Manitoba with Minnesota , from which she is divided merely by a diplomatic line ; British Columbia with California . The natural routes between the four territories lie not over Canadian but over American ground , and commerce will follow the natural not the political routes . On the other hand , the action of the Boston merchants shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial severance are felt by the United States as well as by Canada . The people of the United States want Canadian lumber , they want the trade with the Maritime Provinces , they want the free and secure use of the St. Lawrence . The American fishermen want free access to the Canadian fisheries , as much as the people of the Maritime Provinces wan1* admission to the coasting trade of the United States . Herculean efforts have been made , not by the Canadian people , properly speaking , but by Canadian statesmen , acting for political purposes , and in concert with English imperialism , to reverse the order of nature , to sever Canada commercially from her continent , and to bind her economically to England , to the dependencies of England , even those on the other side of the globe , and to every portion of the world except the dreaded republic . An imperial Zollverein has been projected ; negotiations for commercial treaties have been opened with European nations ; an editorial appeared some time ago in the Toronto " Globe " proclaiming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than compensate the loss of these at our own door . At the same time a series of gigantic railway enterprises has been undertaken , for the purpose of connecting the four separate territories by lines running entirely within British territory , so as to avoid any partnership in highways with the American Republic , and beyond the reach of the enemy in that war between Canada and the United States , a belief in which , as an event of the future , is one of our imperial institutions . The result , while it has been injurious to the interests of the United States , has not been satisfactory to the Canadian people . The negotiations for commercial treaties have failed , as it was likely they would , when opened by a dependency without full treaty-making powers . The first of the politico-military railways , the Intercolonial , uniting // the maritime provinces with old Canada , has cost thirty-six millions in its construction , is run at a heavy annual cost to the Government , and is likely to be less useful and more of a burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it soon will be , through the State of Maine . From the immense expenditure involved in the operation of extending the politico-military system of railways westward , under the name of the Canadian Pacific , the less adventurous portion of the community , including apparently Sir Francis Hincks himself , is beginning to recoiL The leader of the opposition in the Dominion Parliament moved , the other day , to postpone the construction of a portion of the railway within the territory of British Columbia . He was defeated by a strict party vote , the Government commanding a large majority . But there is little doubt that in caucus , to keep the representatives of Quebec and the eastern provinces under the standard , the Government had to give assurances of caution and delay . More than this , the Minister of Railways , in his speech , allowed it to be plainly seen , by a significant omission , that the construction of the projected line to the north of Lake Superior , through a country desperately difficult , was was not to be put under contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , which runs to the south of the lake through American territory between Duluth and Sault Ste. Marie . This is a virtual abandonment ( perhaps it would be officially called a postponement ) of the whole project , so far as its military and political objects are concerned , since there can be no military or political continuity if the line , in a part of its course , and that the part nearest to Canada , runs over foreign ground . The nearest link in the projected chain is missing . The territories which it is proposed to weld into a united community are not even made conterminous . The expenditure entailed by that part of the separatist policy which consists in constructing a vast system of political railways , in defiance of the greatest natural obstacles , within Canadian territory , fatally conflicts with the other object , of tightening the commercial bond with England , because it renders necessary an increased taxation and the imposition of higher duties on British goods . For my own part , I am a member of the Cobden Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peace , good-will among nations . " But my belief is in the motto as a whole . My conviction is that , without peace and good-will among nations , the renunciation of aggran // dizement , and the reduction of armaments , there can be no free trade . Canada has a tariff , the United States have a tariff , England has a tariff-every nation has a tariff . Everywhere the tariffs are violations of free trade , and everywhere they will be necessary till ambition takes its departure and leaves the world at peace . I have said that Sir Francis Hincks is of the number of those whom the present aspect of Canadian finance disquiets . If to say agitating things is to be an agitator , he will hardly escape the name . In a recent article in his Montreal " Journal of Commerce , " reviewing the financial position , he described Canada as " piling up annually a gigantic debt , " as " drifting into bankruptcy , " as being hurried " to a day of reckoning " which assuredly could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province of Quebec as equally bad with that of the Dominion . The main cause of all this , he distinctly intimated , was the expenditure on " public works " ; that is to say , on the politico-military railways , the Intercolonial and the Canadian Pacific , as well as on canals , the construction of which is partly dictated by similar views . The cut-throat system , instead of the system of amicable partnership , applied to railways , canals , and commercial relations generally , is in fact the principal source of the evil , and the admission is most significant when it comes from Sir Francis Hincks , who , as a Canadian Tory Minister , has been personally responsible for the course which has been pursued . The Canadian people , apart from any wish for political change , are disquieted , as well they may be , by the financial results of a policy which adds the ruinous expenditure of a chimerical imperialism to the commercial atrophy caused by the severance of Canada from her own continent and her natural markets . In 1878 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the head was Mr. Mackenzie , because it declared its inability to do anything for the improvement of the commercial situation ; and they voted in Sir John Macdonald , who undertook to make an attempt . The " national policy " had been pressed upon them by protectionists as a panacea , and , withotit knowing very clearly what it meant , they determined to give it a trial . This was the real meaning of the election of September , 1878 , 50 far as the popular feeling was concerned . When from the people the " national policy " passed into the hands of the politicians , for practical application in the form of a tariff , they gave it the mold of their own political sentiments , which are imperialist , and produced a plan which they are able to repre // sent to England as anti-American , though it at the same time increases the duties on British goods . But already the people are dissatisfied , in the Eastern provinces at least ; so much so , as to make it highly probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the result of the last would be reversed . A policy framed on the principle of severance , though the work of able hands , has failed , as it will always fail , to touch the real source of the evil . Its failure does not lessen the significance of the vote of September , 1878 . On that occasion people , in a country where political feeling is very strong , deserted by thousands the standard of their party , and broke through the party lines under the cover of the ballot , to vote for that which they hoped would promote their material welfare . Let a similar hope once more present itself , and they will do the same thing again . q On the whole , from the manifestations of dissatisfaction with the present state of things on both sides , it may be safely predicted that Canadian and American statesmen will soon be in conference on the subject of commercial relations ; perhaps the fisheries dispute , which is always recurring in some form , may bring this question also to a head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial reciprocity treaty like the last . The objections to a partial reciprocity treaty are , in the first place , that it would not rid us of the customs line ; in the second place , that it would be extremely difficult to render the scheme fair to all interests ; in the third place , that it could hardly fail to make Canada an entrepot for European contraband , and thus to give rise to disputes which would be fatal to its own existence ; in the fourth place , that as the offspring of a dominant party or a particular national mood , it would be ' always in danger , through a loss of power by the party , or a change of the national mood , of being overthrown as the last was , with all the indu8tries built upon it . A commercial union would be permanent , and would , in addition to its other advantages , give perfectly free circulation to capital and commercial life . No doubt difficulties would attend it , because it would involve an equalization of tariffs ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to be hoped that commercial union will receive the first consideration : if it proves impracticable , we must fall back on a reciprocity treaty , which in itself would be a gain . Revolutions are sometimes necessary , but they are always evils . No revolution could be more necessary than that which released the // New World from bondage to the British aristocracy , and set it at liberty to work out its own destinies . Yet its blessings were dearly purchased . On England it brought loss , shame , and estrangement from a large portion of her race ; on the French monarchy it brought bankruptcy , which , if peace had continued , Turgot 's policy might have averted , and as the consequence of bankruptcy the most frightful catastrophe in history . Nor did the people of the United States , though victorious , come forth unscathed . The usual effects of civil war were produced on their political character . Their republic was launched with a revolutionary bias the opposite of which was to be desired , and a permanent ascendancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time generated the rebellion of the Southern States , whose principle of resistance to a government which they did not like 1*ad been often formulated by Northern lips .. We have another evil legacy of the Revolution in the relations between Canada and the United States . In ordinary cases the vanquished party in a revolution remains in the country , and , when the storm of political passion has subsided , blends again with the victors . In the case of the American Revolution the vanquished party was driven into exile by acts of attainder and confiscation . It colonized British Canada , and there perpetuated , in the form of a separate group of settlements , dividing the northern section of the coutinent from the rest , the antagonism of the civil war . Had the English revolutionists of 1688 confiscated the estates of their opponents , and driven all the Jacobites into Scotland , they would have done their island the same mischief which was done to this continent by the treatment of the defeated Tories after the Revolution . Enthusiastic attachment to the crown for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new abode , was a natural and honorable sentiment on the part of the loyalists settled in Canada . It carried with it a feeling of antagonism to the American Republic , which was increased by the calamitous war of 1812 . Scarcely had the enmity begun to slumber , when it was revived by the events of 1837 , though the party in Canada with which the people of the United States had displayed their sympathy , and which consisted mainly of a later set of immigrants , while it was defeated on the field of battle , triumphed in the political conflict and achieved responsible government . Disputes about boundaries and fisheries added , from time to time , fresh drops to the cup of bitterness ; and a violent access of mutual ill-feeling was brought // on by the events connected with the American civil war , by the harboring of Southern refugees and the St. Alban 's raid on one side , and on the other by the Fenian invasions of Canada , which the people of the United States viewed , perhaps , with not inexcusable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tories , promoted the objects of their policy by further estranging Canada from the United States . The Fenian raids also gave a fresh stimulus to Orangeism , which is an embodiment of exclusively British sentiment . Still , an enmity for which there is no good ground , and which in its consequences is mischievous to both sides , can not be everlasting . The economical forces have asserted their power . Commercial intercourse has softened the sharpness of the border-line . Here , as elsewhere , railways have exerted their unifying influence . The social and business relations of the people of the two countries are everywhere governed by courtesy and good-wilL Canadians mingle with Americans at places of summer resort in the United States , while not a few Americans spend the summer in Canada . In fact , it may be said that a social fusion of the two nations has to no inconsiderable extent been going on . It has been asserted that the annual number of emigrants from Canada into the United States is forty thousand , and that there are now nearly a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . These estimates must be very vague , and probably include a number of cases not really belonging to the category of emigration ; but there can be no doubt that a current is constantly running both from French Canada into the Eastern States , and from British Canada into the West . On the other hand , there are not a few Americans in the commercial cities of Canada . During the civil war , while the Canadian Tories , in sympathy with those of England , were taking part with the South , numbers of Canadians-I have heard on good authority as many as forty thousand-enlisted in the armies of the North . A Canadian youth , if he does not find a career in his own country , goes to seek his fortune at New York or Chicago with as little compunction or hesitation as a young Scotchman goes to seek his fortune at Manchester or London . It is absurd to regard two nations which are rapidly commingling as natural enemies , and to attempt permanently to found their relations and the policy of each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its intensity in old Canada , in Manitoba it does not exist . The population there is very mixed , and likely to // be still more so ; the division is a mere political line ; and there are no trophies or memorials of the war of 1812 . During the last five or six years Canada , like the rest of the empire , has been swept by a wave of Jingoism . All engines , social and political , have been plied to stimulate imperialist , aristocratic , and anti-continental feeling : the governor-generalship has been turned into a viceroyalty ; the forms of a court have been introduced ; and an attempt has been made , though with indifferent success , to introduce etiquette . Ministers at Ottawa have been required to put on Windsor uniforms . A body-guard , in imitation of the English Guards , has been created . There has been talk of raising a Canadian contingent for the British army . Appeals of all kinds have been made to the military spirit ; and the Pacific Railway , the grand enterprise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time seemed to have come for practically withdrawing the concession of self-government , bringing Canada again under aristocratic rule , and completely detaching her , politically and commercially , from the New World . In the last days of the Jingo Government a Canadian High Commissioner was appointed and sent to England to negotiate something in the nature of an imperial Zollverein ; possibly , also , something in the nature of imperial federation . To regard the people of the United States as a hostile or at least an unfriendly nation was the leading principle of the dominant policy in its application to Canada ; and that phrase , used by the High Commissioner in his farewell speech at Montreal , would have been the keynote of his confidential communications with the Jingo Premier . Lord Beaconsfield had evidently promised assistance to the Pacific Railway in case at the general election , which was impending , he should come out victorious with a new lease of power . Had Jingoism continued in the ascendant , a determined effort to create a distinctly anti-democratic empire in the northern part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British aristocracy , would no doubt have been made . But , while the High Commissioner was on the ocean , Jingoism fell ; and it has fallen not to rise again . In a country where wealth is so powerful and social gradations are so strongly marked as in England , conservatism of the ordinary type will always abound , audits accession to power , at no great distance of time , is a perfectly possible event . But for Jingoism there is no resurrection . The conditions under which it was generated , and the chief of which was the fullness of bread caused by ten years of extraordinary com // mercial prosperity , are not likely to be reproduced . The aggressive action of this singular power may be regarded as at an end ; and the Canadian limb of the confederacy will wither with the tree out of the heart of which it grew . It is not to be supposed that the change of Administration in England will be followed by any marked alteration of colonial policy . Probably there will be rather an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Liberals by the Tories , and of which the late Tory Premier tried to make capital in his election manifesto , of turning the cold shoulder to the colonies , and promoting the " decomposition " of the empire . But there will be an end of making Canada the engine of hostility to the American Republic . It is the traditional policy of the Liberals , instead of treating the American experiment in popular government with jealous hatred , heartily to accept the honor of the connection , and to endeavor to efface the consequences of Tory error in the time of George III , by reuniting in the bond of sympathy and associated effort the different portions of the Anglo-Saxon race . With Lord Beaconsfield , who was everywhere a conspirator , conspiracy has passed away . In Mr. Gladstone 's Cabinet there is no member of the Southeru Club . Mr. Gladstone himself has been the object of groundless suspicion in the United States , on account of an unfortunate expression which he let slip at the time of the civil war , though the despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after Chancellorsville , by the most devoted among the English friends of the North . But I speak with the utmost confidence in saying that , neither at that nor at any other time , has his feeling toward the American Republic been otherwise than entirely kind ; nor has he ever shown the slightest sympathy with any scheme for creating political antagonisms on this continent , or in any way interfering with its political development . A man of thoroughly popular fiber and hated above all other public men in England by the Tory aristocracy , he is not likely to make his policy in any quarter subservient to the interests of that order . Irrespectively of his personal position , he knows too well the real conditions of English greatness . With the charge of anti-American feeling against Mr. Gladstone has generally been coupled an assertion that his rival showed sympathy with the Union at the time of the civil war . If he did , the fact was wholly unknown to those Englishmen who were in the thick of the struggle , and anxiously watched tile manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates of the Tory leader , and the men most in his confidence , sympathized ardently with the rebellion , and abetted the Alabama . That he avoided personally committing himself till after the event is very likely ; but it may be safely said that his sympathy with the Union was not betrayed before Appomattox . A passage has been cited from the Mason papers which indicates that in private he , on this as on all other occasions , identified himself with the policy of the French Emperor , who , as we know , sought to draw England into a joint interposition in favor of the South . It would be idle to deny the existence of anti-American feeling in British Canada . I have pointed out its sources  --  the chief of which , United Empire Loyalism , is entirely natural and respectable , but is not likely to be permanent . In French Canada the priests are afraid of republican freedom of thought and of American common schools : the people migrate freely into the United States in quest of employment , and probably have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who try to cultivate the feeling in different interests , chiefly in that of the Imperialist party . There are those who pride themselves on displaying it ; the affectation of peculiarities , even of peculiar antipathies , being a not un- , common indulgence of amour propre . But probably Sir Francis llincks is at the point of view from which the extent and intensity of the antagonism appear greatest . This I will venture to affirm : setting any question of political relations aside , if a proposal with regard to commercial relations , really conducive to the welfare of the Canadian people , is fairly set before them , there is nothing in the hearts of the great mass of them to prevent their giving it their cordial consideration . They are content to be bound to the mothercountry by affection without the sacrifice of their material welfare . Jingo politicians and their organs will of course try to interpose , but the economical forces will in the end prevail . Signs of an impending fiscal war between the two countries are already beginning to appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliatory tax on lobster-cans , to which members of the American Legislature respond by motions to stop the transmission of Canadian goods in bond . That each nation may do a great deal of mischief in this way to the other , and at the same time to itself , may be taken for granted , without incurring the c4st of the experiment . Presently the firebrand of the fishery question will be kindled again , if it can be said ever to have been extin // guished ; and , with the temper of both nations already ruffled by disputes about the tariffs , a serious controversy may arise . There may be a punctilious feeling of unwillingness to take the initiative , especially when a somewhat menacing attitude has been assumed upon both sides . But surely there can be no doubt that , while the smaller and weaker nation may compromise its dignity by advances , such a step on the part of the greater and stronger nation is liable to no misconstruction . It has been proposed that a joint commission shall be appointed by the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain on the side of Canada , for the purpose of considering all questions connected with commercial relations . No motion could be more powerfully seconded by the manifest interest of the parties concerned . We are dealing with the commercial question and with that alone . But surely no American statesman can be blind to the expediency of preventing , if possible , the growth of a sentiment of antagonism to the United States in this large section of the continent . Slavery has been put down , but troubles are not yet over ; elements of disturbance have not ceased to exist , forces adverse to the Union or to republican institutions may be developed within this vast area by diversity of interests or of social tendencies . Canada can not be formidable as a military power to a nation with ten times her population , but she might be formidable as a rallyingpoint of disaffection . GoLDwIN SMITH .
