The new moon , a gleaming scimitar , cleft the gauzy mists above a rugged spur of the Cumberland Mountains . The sky , still crimson and amber , stretched vast and lonely above the vast and lonely landscape . A fox was barking in the laurel . This was an imprudent proceeding on the part of the fox , considering the value of his head-gear . A young mountaineer down the ravine was reminded , by the sharp , abrupt sound , of a premium offered by the State of Tennessee for the scalp and ears of the pestiferous red fox . All unconscious of the legislation of extermination , the animal sped nimbly along the ledge of a cliff , becoming visible from the ravine below , a tawny streak against the gray rock . Swift though he was , a jet of red light flashing out in the dusk was yet swifter . The echoing crags clamored with the report of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys appeared in the depths of the ravine and looked up . " Thar now ! Ye ca n't git him off'n that thar ledge , Birt , " said Tim Griggs . " The contrairy beastis could n't hev fund a more ill- convenient spot ter die of he hed sarched the mounting . " " I ai n't goin ' ter leave him thar , though , " stoutly declared the boy who still held the rifle . " That thar fox 's scalp an ' his two ears air wuth one whole dollar . " Tim remonstrated . " Look-a-hyar , Birt ; ef ye try ter climb up this hyar bluff , ye 'll git yer neck bruk , sure . " Birt Dicey looked up critically . It was a rugged ascent of forty feet or more to the narrow ledge where the red fox lay . Although the face of the cliff was jagged , the rock greatly splintered and fissured , with many ledges , and here and there a tuft of weeds or a stunted bush growing in a niche , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset was fading . The uncertain light would multiply the dangers of the attempt . But to leave a dollar lying there on the fox 's head , that the wolf and the buzzard might dine expensively to-morrow ! " An ' me so tried for money ! " he exclaimed , thinking aloud . Nate Griggs , who had not before spoken , gave a sudden laugh ,  - -  a dry , jeering laugh . " Ef all the foxes on the mounting war ter hold a pertracted meet'n , jes ' ter pleasure you-uns , thar would n't be enough scalps an ' ears ' mongst ' em ter make up the money ye hanker fur ter buy a horse . " To buy a horse was the height of Birt 's ambition . His mother was a widow ; and as an instance of the fact that misfortunes seldom come singly , the horse on which the family depended to till their scanty acres died shortly after his owner . And so , whenever the spring opened and the ploughs all over the countryside were starting , their one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their nearest neighbor , the tanner . Birt was the eldest son , and his mother had only his work to offer in payment . The proposition always took the tanner in what he called a " jubious time . " Spring is the season for stripping the trees of their bark , which is richer in tannin when the sap flows most freely , and the mule was needed to haul up the piles of bark from out the depths of the woods to the tanyard . Then , too , Jubal Perkins had his own crops to put in . As he often remarked in the course of the negotiation , " I do n't eat tan bark --  nor yit raw hides . " Although the mule was a multifarious animal , and ploughed and worked in the bark-mill , and hauled from the woods , and went long journeys in the wagon or under the saddle , he was not ubiquitous , and it was impossible for him to be in the several places in which he was urgently needed at the same time . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to his master . Nevertheless , this bargain was annually struck . The poverty-stricken widow always congratulated herself upon its conclusion , and it never occurred to her that the amount of work that Birt did in the tanyard was a disproportionately large return for the few days that the tanner 's mule ploughed their little fields . Birt , however , was beginning to see that a boy to drive that mule around the bark-mill was as essential as the mule himself . As Providence had failed to furnish the tanner with a son for this purpose -- his family consisting of several small daughters -- Birt supplied a long-felt want . The boy appreciated that his simple mother was over-reached , yet he could not see that she could do otherwise . He sighed for independence , for a larger opportunity . As he drove the mule round the limited circuit , his mind was far away . He anxiously canvassed the future . He cherished fiery , ambitious schemes ,  - -  often scorched , poor fellow , by their futility . With his time thus mortgaged , he thought his help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But until he could have a horse of his own , there was no hope -- no progress . And for this he planned , and dreamed , and saved . Partly these considerations , partly the love of adventure , and partly the jeer in Nate 's laugh determined him not to relinquish the price set upon the fox 's head . He took off his coat and flung it on the ground beside his rifle . Then he began to clamber up the cliff . The two brothers , their hands in the pockets of their brown jeans trousers , stood watching his ascent . Nate had sandy hair , small gray eyes , set much too close together , and a sharp , pale , freckled face . Tim seemed only a mild repetition of him , as if Nature had tried to illustrate what Nate would be with a better temper and less sly intelligence . Birt was climbing slowly . It was a difficult matter . Here was a crevice that would hardly admit his eager fingers , and again a projection so narrow that it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were wider , and occasionally a dwarfed huckleberry bush , nourished in a fissure , lifted him up like a helping hand . He quaked as he heard the roots strain and creak , for he was a pretty heavy fellow for sixteen years of age . They did not give way , however , and up and up he went , every moment increasing the depth below him and the danger . His breath was short ; his strength flagged , he slipped more than once , giving himself a great fright ; and when he reached the ledge where the dead fox lay , he thought , " The varmint do n't wuth it . " Nevertheless he whooped out his triumph to Nate and Tim in a stentorian halloo , for they had already started homeward , and presently their voices died in the distance . Birt faced about and sat down on the ledge to rest , his feet dangling over the depths beneath . It was a lonely spot , walled in by the mountains , and frequented only by the deer that were wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great salt spring far down the ravine . Their hoofs had worn a deep excavation around it in the countless years and generations that they had herded here . The " lick , " as such places are called in Tennessee , was nearly two acres in extent , and in the centre of the depression the brackish water stood to the depth of six feet or more . Birt looked down at it , thinking of the old times when , according to tradition , it was the stamping ground of buffalo as well as deer . The dusk deepened . The shadows were skulking in and out of the wild ravine as the wind rose and fell . They took to his fancy the form of herds of the banished bison , revisiting in this impalpable guise the sylvan shades where they are but a memory now . Presently he began the rugged descent , considerably hampered by the fox , which he carried by the tail . He stopped to rest whenever he found a ledge that would serve as a seat . Looking up , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zenith , he saw the earliest star , glorious in the crimson and amber sky . Below , a point of silver light quivered , reflected in the crimson and amber waters of the " lick . " The fire-flies were flickering among the ferns ; he saw about him their errant gleam . The shadowy herds trooped down the mountain side . Now and then his weight uprooted a bush in his hands , and the clods fell . He missed his footing as he neared the base , and came down with a thump . It was a gravelly spot where he had fallen , and he saw in a moment that it was the summer-dried channel of a mountain rill . As he pulled himself up on one elbow , he suddenly paused with dilated eyes . The evening light fell upon a burnished glimmer ;  - -  a bit of stone -- was it stone ?  - -  shining with a metallic lustre . He looked at it for a moment , his eyes glowing in the contemplation of a splendid possibility . What were those old stories that his father used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the rich earth flung largess from its hidden wealth along the romantic banks of Coca Creek ! Gold had been found in Tennessee -- why not here ? And once -- why not again ? The idea so possessed him that while he was skinning the fox his sharp knife almost sacrificed one of the TWO ears imperatively required by the statute , in order that the wily hunter may not be tempted to present one ear at a time , thus multiplying red foxes and premiums therefor like Falstaff 's " rogues in buckram . " He took his way homeward through the darkening woods , carrying the pelt in his hand . It was not long before he could hear the dogs barking , and as he came suddenly upon a little clearing in the midst of the dense , encompassing wilderness , he saw them all trooping down from the unenclosed passage between the two log-rooms which constituted the house . An old hound had half climbed the fence , but as he laid his fore-paw on the topmost rail , his deep-mouthed bay was hushed ,  - -  he was recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still insisting upon a marauder theory . One of them barked defiance as he thrust his head between the rails of the fence . There was another head thrust through too , about on a level with Towser 's , but it was not a dog 's head . As Birt caught a glimpse of it , he called out hastily , " Stand back thar , Tennessee ! " And then it was lost to view , for at the sound of his voice all the dogs came huddling over the bars , shrilly yelping a tumultuous welcome . When Birt had vaulted over the fence , the little object withdrew its head from between the rails and came trotting along beside him , holding up its hand to clasp his . His mother , standing in the passage , her tall , thin figure distinct in the firelight that came flickering out through the open door , soliloquized querulously : - " Ef that thar child do n't quit that fool way o ' stickin ' her head a- twixt the rails ter watch fur her brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pen , an ' git her neck bruk . " Birt overheard her . " Tennessee air too peart ter git herself hurt , " he said , a trifle ashamed of his ready championship of his little sister , as a big rough boy is apt to be of gentler emotions . If ever infancy can be deemed uncouth , she was an uncouth little atom of humanity . Her blue checked homespun dress , graced with big horn buttons , descended almost to her feet . Her straight , awkwardly cropped hair was of a nondescript shade pleasantly called " tow . " As she came into the light of the fire , she lifted wide black eyes deprecatingly to her mother . " She ai n't pretty , I know , but she air powerful peart , " Birt used to say so often that the phrase became a formula with him . If she were " powerful peart , " it was a fact readily apparent only to him , for she was a silent child , with the single marked characteristic of great affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him about . " I du n no ' bout Tennie 's peartness , " his mother sarcastically rejoined . " ' Pears ter me like the chile hai n't never hed good sense ; afore she could walk she 'd crawl along the floor after ye , an ' holler like a squeech-owEL ef ye went off an ' lef ' her . An ' ye air plumb teched in the head too , Birt , ter set sech store by Tennie . I look ter see her killed , or stunted , some day , in them travels o ' hern . " For when Birt Dicey went " yerrands " on the mule through the woods to the Settlement , Tennessee often rode on the pommel of his saddle . She followed in the furrow when he ploughed . She was as familiar an object at the tanyard as the bark-mill itself . When he wielded the axe , she perched on one end of the woodpile . But so far , she had passed safely through her varied adventures , and gratifying evidences of her growth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee ! " in a loud , boyish halloo , was a command when danger was ahead , which she obeyed with the readiness of a veteran . Sometimes , however , this incongruous companionship became irksome to him . Her trusting , insistent affection made her a clog upon him , and he grew impatient of it . Ah , little Sister ! he learned its value one day . The great wood fire was all aflare in the deep chimney-place . Savory odors came from the gridiron and the skillet and the hoe , on the live coals drawn out on the broad hearth . The tow-headed children grew noisy as they assembled around the bare pine table , and began to clash their knives and forks . Birt , unmindful , crouched by the hearth , silently turning his precious specimens about , that he might examine them by the firelight . Tennessee , her chuffy hand on his shoulder , for she could reach it as he knelt , held her head close to his , and looked at them too with wide black eyes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called to him to come , but he did not hear . She turned and looked down at him , then broke out sharply in indignant surprise . " Air ye bereft o ' reason , Birt Dicey ! Ye set thar nosin ' a handful o ' rocks ez ef they war fitten ter eat ! An ' now look at the boy -- a stuffin ' ' em in his pockets ter sag ' em down and tear ' em out fur me ter sew in ag'in . Waal , waal ! Sol'mon say ef ye spare the rod ye spile the child -- mos ' ennybody could hev fund that out from thar own ' sperience ; but the wisest man that ever lived lef ' no receipt how ter keep a boy 's pockets whole in his breeches . " CHAPTER II . Birt Dicey lay awake deep into the night , pondering and planning . But despite this unwonted vigil the old bark-mill was early astir , and he went alertly about his work . He felt eager , strong , capable . The spirit of progress was upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest so dense that , except at the verge of the clearing , it showed hardly a trace of its gradual despoliation by the industry that nestled in its heart like a worm in the bud . There were many stumps about the margin of the woods , the felled trees , stripped of their bark , often lying among them still , for the supply of timber exceeded the need . In penetrating the wilderness you might mark , too , here and there , a vacant space , where the chestnut-oak , prized for its tannin , had once grown on the slope . A little log house was in the midst of the clearing . It had , properly speaking , only one room , but there was a shed-room attached , for the purpose of storage , and also a large open shed at one side . The rail fence inclosed the space of an acre , perhaps , which was covered with spent bark . Across the pits planks were laid , with heavy stones upon them to hold them in place . A rude roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient mule , with Birt and a whip to make sure that he did not fall into reflective pauses according to his meditative wont . And there , too , was Tennessee , perched on the lower edge of a great pile of bark , and gravely watching Birt . He deprecated the attention she attracted . He was sometimes ashamed to have the persistent little sister seen following at his heels like a midday shadow . He could not know that the men who stopped and spoke to him and to her , and laughed at the infirmities of the infant tongue when she replied unintelligibly , thought better of him for his manifestation of strong fraternal affection . They said to each other that he was a " peart boy an ' powerful good ter the t' other chill'en , an ' holped the fambly along ez well ez a man --  better'n thar dad ever done ; " for Birt 's father had been characterized always as " slack-twisted an ' onlucky . " The shadows dwindled on the tan . The winds had furled their wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue zenith . The querulous cicada complained in the laurel . Birt heard the call of a jay from the woods . And then , as he once more urged the old mule on , the busy bark-mill kept up such a whir that he could hear nothing else . He was not aware of an approach till the new-comer was close upon him ; in fact , the first he knew of Nate Griggs 's proximity was the sight of him . Nate was glancing about with his usual air of questioning disparagement , and cracking a long lash at the spent bark on the ground . " Hello , Nate ! " Birt cried out , eagerly . " I 'm powerful glad ye happened ter kem hyar , fur I hev a word ter say ter ye . " " I du n no ez I 'm minded ter bide , " Nate said cavalierly . " I hates to waste time an ' burn daylight a-jowin ' . " He was still cracking his lash at the ground . There was a sudden , half-articulate remonstrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whirled back in a rising passion . " Did ye hit Tennessee ? " he asked , with a dangerous light in his eyes . " No -- I never ! " Nate protested . " I hai n't seen her till this minute . She war standin ' a-hint ye . " " Waal , ye skeered her , then , " said Birt , hardly appeased . " Quit snappin ' that lash . ' Pears-like ter me as ye makes yerself powerful free round this hyar tanyard . " " Tennie air a-growin ' wonderful fast , " the sly Nathan remarked pleasantly . Birt softened instantly . " She air a haffen inch higher ' n she war las ' March , ' cordin ' ter the mark on the door , " he declared , pridefully . " She ai n't pretty , I know , but she air powerful peart . " " What war the word ez ye war layin ' off ter say ter me ? " Nate asked , curiosity vividly expressed in his face . Birt leaned back against the pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most desirable person to whom he could confide his secret whose aid he could secure . There were many circumstances that made this seem wise . But when the disclosure was imminent , something in those small , bead-like eyes , unpleasantly close together , something in the expression of the thin , pale face , something in Nate 's voice and manner repelled confidence . " Nate , " said Birt , at last , speaking with that subacute conviction , so strong yet so ill-defined , which vividly warns the ill-judged and yet can not stop the tongue constrained by its own folly , " what d'ye s'pose I fund in the woods yestiddy ? " The two small eyes , set close together , seemed merged in one , so concentrated was their gaze . Again their expression struck Birt 's attention . He hesitated once more . " Ef I tell ye , will ye promise never ter tell enny livin ' human critter ? " " I hope I may drap stone dead ef I ever tell ! " Nate exclaimed . " I fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s'pose ' t war ? " Nate shook his head . His breath was quick and he could not control the keen anxiety in his face . A strong flush rose to the roots of his sandy hair , his lips quivered , and his small eyes glittered with greedy expectation . His tongue refused to frame a word . " GOLD ! " cried Birt , triumphantly . " Whar be it ? " exclaimed Nate . He was about to start in full run for the spot . " I ai n't agoin ' ter tell ye , without we-uns kin strike a trade . " " Waal , " said Nate , with difficulty repressing his impatience , " what air you-uns aimin ' ter do ? " " Ye knows ez I hev ter bide hyar with the bark-mill mos'ly , jes ' now , " said Birt , beginning to expound the series of ideas which he had carefully worked out in his midnight vigil , " ' kase they hev got ter hev a heap o ' tan ter fill them thar vats ag'in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , the men on the mounting would find out what I war after , an ' they 'd come a-grabblin ' thar too , an ' mebbe git it all , ' kase I du n no how much or how leetle thar be . I wants ter make sure of enough ter buy a horse , or a mule , or su'thin ' , ef I kin , ' fore I tells ennybody else . An ' I ' lowed ez ye an ' me would go pardners . Ye 'd take my place hyar at the tanyard one day , whilst I dug , an ' I 'd bide in the tanyard nex ' day . An ' we would divide fair an ' even all we fund . " Nate did not reply . He was absorbed in a project that had come into his head as his friend talked , and the two dissimilar trains of thought combined in a mental mosaic that would have amazed Birt Dicey . " Ye see , " Birt presently continued , " I du n no when I kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jube Perkins ' lows ez he air mighty busy ' bout'n them hides an ' sech , an ' he wants me ter holp around ginerally . He say ef I do mo ' work'n I owes him , he 'll make that straight with my mother . An ' he declares fur true ef I do n't holp him at this junctry , when he needs me , he wo n't hire his mule to my mother nex ' spring ; an ' ye know it wo n't do fur we-uns ter resk the corn-crap an ' gyarden truck with sech a pack o ' chill'n ter vittle ez we-uns hev got at our house . " Nate deduced an unexpected conclusion . " Ye oughter gin me more'n haffen the make , " he said . " ' Kase ef ' twar n't fur me , ye could n't git none . An ' ef ye do n't say two thurds , I 'll tell every critter on the mounting an ' they 'll be grabblin ' in yer gold mine d'rec'ly . " " Ye du n no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a sudden jet from the cold mountain torrent , that rioted through the wilderness down the ravine hard by , had been dashed into Nate 's thin , sharp face , he could not have cooled more abruptly . The change almost took his breath away . " I do n't mean THAT , nuther , " he gasped with politic penitence , " kase I hev promised not ter tell . I du n no whether I kin holp nohow . I hev got ter do my sheer o ' work at home ; we ai n't through pullin ' fodder off'n our late corn yit . " Birt looked at him in silent surprise . Nate was older than his friend by several years . He was of an unruly and insubordinate temper , and did as little work as he pleased at home . He often remarked that he would like to see who could make him do what he had no mind to do . " Mebbe old Jube would n't want me round ' bout , " he suggested . " Waal , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ' lowed when I axed him this mornin ' as he 'd be willin ' ef I could trade with another boy ter take my place wunst in a while . " Nate affected to meditate on this view of the question . " But it will be toler'ble fur away fur me ter go prowlin ' in the woods , a- huntin ' fur gold , an ' our fodder jes ' a-sufferin ' ter be pulled . Ef the spot air fur off , I ca n't come an ' I wo n't , not fur haffen the make . " " ' T ai n't fur off at all -- scant haffen mile , " replied unwary Birt , anxious to convince . " It air jes ' yander nigh that thar salt lick down the ravine . I marks the spot by a bowlder -- biggest bowlder I ever see -- on the slope o ' the mounting . " The instant this revelation passed his lips , regret seized him . " But ye ai n't ter go thar ' thout me , ye onderstand , till we begins our work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nate protested . " I ai n't sati'fied in my mind whether I 'll ondertake ter holp or no . That pullin ' fodder ez I hev got ter do sets mighty heavy on my stomach . " " Tim an ' yer dad ALWAYS pulls the fodder an ' sech -- I knows ez that air a true word , " said Birt , bluntly . " An ' I ca n't git away from the tanyard at all ef ye wo n't holp me , ' kase old Jube ' lowed he would n't let me swop with a smaller boy ter work hyar ; an ' all them my size , an ' bigger , air made ter work with thar dads , ' ceptin ' you- uns . " Nate heard , but he hardly looked as if he did , so busily absorbed was he in fitting this fragment of fact into his mental mosaic . It had begun to assume the proportions of a distinct design . He suddenly asked a question of apparent irrelevancy . " This hyar land down the ravine do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't b'long ter nobody , ye weasel ! " Birt retorted , in rising wrath . " D'ye s'pose I 'd be a-stealin ' of gold off'n somebody else 's land ? " Nate 's sly , thin face lighted up wonderfully . He seemed in a fever of haste to terminate the conference and get away . He agreed to his friend 's proposition and promised to be at the bark-mill bright and early in the morning . As he trudged off , Birt Dicey stood watching the receding figure . His eyes were perplexed , his mind full of anxious foreboding . He hardly knew what he feared . He had only a vague sense of mischief in the air , as slight but as unmistakable as the harbinger of storm on a sunshiny summer day . " I wisht I hed n't tole him nuthin ' , " he said , as he wended his way home that night . " Ef my mother hed knowed bout'n it all , I would n't hev been ' lowed ter tell him . She DEspises the very sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she du n no why . " After supper he sat gloomy and taciturn in the uninclosed passage between the two rooms , watching alternately the fire-flies , as they instarred the dark woods with ever-shifting gold sparks , and the broad , pale flashes of heat lightning which from time to time illumined the horizon . There was no motion in the heavy black foliage , but it was filled with the shrill droning of the summer insects , and high in the branches a screech-owl pierced the air with its keen , quavering scream . " Tennessee ! " exclaimed Birt , as the unwelcome sound fell upon his ear --  " Tennessee ! run an ' put the shovel in the fire ! " Whether the shovel , becoming hot among the live coals , burned the owl that was high in the tree-top outside , according to the countryside superstition , or whether by a singular coincidence , he discovered that he had business elsewhere , he was soon gone , and the night was left to the chorusing katydids and tree-toads and to the weird , fitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly and walked away silently into the dense , dark woods . " Stop , Tennessee ! ye ca n't go too ! " exclaimed Mrs. Dicey , appearing in the doorway just in time to intercept the juvenile excursionist . " Ketch her , Rufus ! Ef she would n't hev followed Birt right off in the pitch dark ! She ai n't afeared o ' nothin ' when Birt is thar . Git that pomegranate she hed an ' gin it ter her ter keep her from hollerin ' , Rufe ; I hed a sight ruther hear the squeech-owEL . " Tennessee , overpowered by disappointment , sobbed herself to sleep upon the floor , and then ensued an interval of quiet . Rufe , a towheaded boy of ten , dressed in an unbleached cotton shirt and blue-checked homespun trousers , concluded that this moment was the accepted time to count the balls in his brother 's shot-pouch . This he proceeded to do , with the aid of the sullen glare from the embers within and the fluctuating gleams of the lightning without . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of handling lead could explain it . " Ye hed better mind , " his mother admonished him . " Birt war powerful tried the t' other day ter think what hed gone with his bullets . He 'll nose ye out afore long . " " They hev got sech a fool way o ' slippin ' through the chinks in the floor , " said the boy in exasperation . " I never seen the beat ! An ' thar 's no gittin ' them out , nuther . I snaked under the house yestiddy an ' sarched , an ' sarched ! an ' I never fund but two . An ' Towse , he dragged hisself under thar , too -- jes ' a-growlin ' an ' a- snappin ' . I thought fur sartin every minit he 'd bite my foot off . " He resumed his self-imposed task of counting the rifle balls , and now and then a sharp click told that another was consigned to that limbo guarded by Towse . Mrs. Dicey stood in silence for a time , gazing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the broad , wan flashes at long intervals gleaming through the sky . " It puts me in a mighty tucker ter hev yer brother a-settin ' out through the woods this hyar way , an ' a-leavin ' of we-uns hyar , all by ourselves sech a dark night . I 'm always afeared thar mought be a bar a-prowlin ' round . An ' the cornfield air close ter the house , too . " " Pete Thompson -- him ez war yander ter the tanyard day ' fore yestiddy with his dad , " said the boy , " he tole it ter me as how he seen a bar las ' Wednesday a-climbin ' over the fence ter thar cornfield , with a haffen dozen roastin ' ears under his arm an ' a watermillion on his head . But WAR it a haffen dozen ? I furgits now ef Pete said it war a haffen dozen or nine ears of corn the bar hed ; " and he paused to reflect in the midst of his important occupation . " I 'll be bound Pete never stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pick that chile up an ' come in . I 'm goin ' ter bar up the door . " Birt Dicey plodded away through the deep woods and the dense darkness down the ravine . Although he could not now distinguish one stone from another , he had an uncontrollable impulse to visit again the treasure he had discovered . The murmur of the gently bubbling water warned him of the proximity of the deep salt spring almost at the base of the mountain , and , guiding himself partly by the sound , he made his way along the slope to the great bowlder beneath the cliffs that served to mark the spot . As he laid his hand on the bowlder , he experienced a wonderful exhilaration of spirit . Once more he canvassed his scheme . This was the one great opportunity of his restricted life . Visions of future possibilities were opening wide their fascinating vistas . He might make enough to buy a horse , and this expressed his idea of wealth . " But ef I live ter git a cent out'n it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the very fust money I kin call my own an ' buy Tennessee a chany cup an ' sarcer , an ' a string o ' blue beads an ' a caliky coat -- ef I die fur it . " His pleased reverie was broken by a sudden discovery . He was not standing among stones about the great bowlder ; no -- his foot had sunk deep in the sand ! He stooped down in the darkness and felt about him . The spot was not now as he had left it yesterday afternoon . He was sure of this , even before a fleet , wan flash of the heat lightning showed him at his feet the unmistakable signs of a recent excavation . It was not deep , it was not broad ; but it was fresh and it betrayed a prying hand . Again the heat lightning illumined the wide , vague sky . He saw the solemn dark forests ; he saw the steely glimmer of the lick ; the distant mountains flickered against the pallid horizon ; and once more -- densest gloom . CHAPTER III . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ; Nate , who had promised he would not come . Convinced that his friend was playing a false part , Birt went at once to the bark-mill in the morning , confident that he would not find Nate at work in the tanyard according to their agreement . It was later than usual , and Jubal Perkins swore at Birt for his tardiness . He hardly heard ; and as the old bark-mill ground and ground the bark , and the mule jogged around and around , and the hot sun shone , and the voices of the men handling the hides at the tanpit were loud on the air , all his thoughts were of the cool , dark , sequestered ravine , holding in its cloven heart the secret he had discovered . Rufus happened to come to the tanyard today . Birt seized the opportunity . " Rufe , " he said , " ye see I ca n't git away from the mill , ' kase I 'm ' bleeged ter stay hyar whilst the old mule grinds . But ef ye 'll go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter come over hyar , bein ' ez I want to see him partic'lar , I 'll fix ye a squir'l-trap before long ez the peartest old Bushy-tail on the mounting ai n't got the gumption ter git out'n . An ' let me know ef Nate ai n't thar . " Rufe was disposed to parley . He stood first on one foot , then on the other . He cast calculating eyes at the bark-mill and out upon the deep forest . The exact date on which this promise was to be fulfilled had to be fixed before he announced his willingness to set out . Ten to one , he would have gone without the bribe , had none been suggested , for he loved the woods better than the woodpile , and a five-mile tramp through its tangles wearied his bones not so much as picking up a single basketful of chips . Some boys ' bones are constituted thus , strange as it may seem . So he went his way in his somewhat eccentric gait , compounded of a hop , and a skip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile when the path curved to the mountain 's brink . He paused and parted the glossy leaves of the dense laurel that he might look out over the precipice at the distant heights . How blue -- how softly blue they were !  - -  the endless ranges about the horizon . What a golden haze melted on those nearer at hand , bravely green in the sunshine ! From among the beetling crags , the first red leaf was whirling away against the azure sky . Even a buzzard had its picturesque aspects , circling high above the mountains in its strong , majestic flight . To breathe the balsamic , sunlit air was luxury , happiness ; it was a wonder that Rufe got on as fast as he did . How fragrant and cool and dark was the shadowy valley ! A silver cloud lay deep in the waters of the " lick . " Why Rufe made up his mind to go down there , he could hardly have said -- sheer curiosity , perhaps . He knew he had plenty of time to get to Nate 's house and back before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two hours ' waste in each direction . He had no idea of descending the cliffs as Birt had done . He stolidly retraced his way until he was nearly home ; then scrambling down rocky slopes he came presently upon a deer-path . All at once , he noticed the footprint of a man in a dank , marshy spot . He stopped and looked hard at it , for he had naturally supposed this path was used only by the woodland gentry . " Some deer-hunter , I reckon , " he said . And so he went on . With his characteristic curiosity , he peered all around the " lick " when he was at last there . He even applied his tongue , calf-like , to the briny earth ; it did not taste so salty as he had expected . As he rolled over luxuriously on his back among the fragrant summer weeds , he caught sight of something in the branches of an oak tree . He sat up and stared . It looked like a rude platform . After a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which some early settler of Tennessee had been wont to fire upon the deer or the buffalo at the " lick , " below . Such relics , some of them a century old , are to be seen to this day in sequestered nooks of the Cumberland Mountains . Rufe had heard of these old scaffolds , but he had never known of the existence of this one down by the " lick . " He sprang up , a flush of excitement contending with the dirt on his countenance ; he set his squirrel teeth resolutely together ; he applied his sturdy fingers and his nimble legs to the bark of the tree , and up he went like a cat . He climbed to the lower branches easily enough , but he caused much commotion and swaying among them as he struggled through the foliage . An owl , with great remonstrant eyes , suddenly looked out of a hollow , higher still , with an inarticulate mutter of mingled reproach , and warning , and anxiety . Rufe settled himself on the platform , his bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either thigh to mark the time he sang in a loud , shrill soprano , prone now and then to be flat , and yet , impartially , prone now and then to be sharp : - Thar war two sun-dogs in the red day-dawn , An ' the wind war laid -- 't war prime fur game . I went ter the woods betimes that morn , An ' tuk my flint-lock , " Nancy , " by name ; An ' thar I see , in the crotch of a tree , A great big catamount grinnin ' at me . A-kee ! he ! he ! An ' a-ho ! ho ! he ! A pop-eyed catamount laffin ' at me ! And , as Rufe sang , the anger and remonstrance in the owl 's demeanor increased every moment . For the owl was a vocalist , too ! Bein ' made game of by a brute beastis , War su'thin ' I could in no ways allow . I jes ' spoke up , for my dander hed riz , " Cat -- take in the slack o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gran ' , Then the blamed old gal jes ' flashed in the pan ! A-kee ! he ! he ! An ' a-ho ! ho ! he ! With a outraged catamount rebukin ' of me ! As Rufe finished this with a mighty CRESCENDO , he was obliged to pause for breath . He stared about , gaspily . The afternoon was waning . The mountains close at hand were a darker green . The distant ranges had assumed a rosy amethystine tint , like nothing earthly -- like the mountains of a dream , perhaps . The buzzard had alighted in the top of a tree not far down the slope , a tree long ago lightning-scathed , but still rising , gaunt and scarred , above all the forest , and stretching dead stark arms to heaven . Somehow Rufe did not like the looks of it . He was aware of a revulsion of feeling , of the ebbing away of his merry spirit before he saw more . As he tried to sing : - I war the mightiest hunter that ever ye see Till that thar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the roof of his mouth . He could see something under that tree which no one else could see , not even from the summit of the crags , for the tree was beyond a projecting slope , and out of the range of vision thence . Rufe could not make out distinctly what the object was , but it was evidently foreign to the place . He possessed the universal human weakness of regarding everything with a personal application . It now seemed strange to him that he should have come here at all ; stranger still , that he should have mounted this queer relic of days so long gone by , and thus discovered that peculiar object under the dead tree . He began to think he had been led here for a purpose . Now Rufe was not so good a boy as to be on the continual lookout for rewards of merit . On the contrary , the day of reckoning meant with him the day of punishment . He had heard recounted an unpleasant superstition that when the red sunsets were flaming round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the abysses and gorges gloomed full of witches and weird spirits , Satan himself might be descried , walking the crags , and spitting fire , and deporting himself generally in such a manner as to cause great apprehension to a small person who could remember so many sins as Rufe could . His sins ! they trooped up before his mental vision now , and in a dense convocation crowded the encompassing wilderness . Rufe felt that he must not leave this matter in uncertainty . He must know whether that strange object under the tree could be intended as a warning to him to cease in time his evil ways --  tormenting Towse , pulling Tennessee 's hair , shirking the woodpile , and squandering Birt 's rifle balls . He even feared this might be a notification that the hour of retribution had already come ! He scuttled off the platform , and began to swing himself from bough to bough . He was nervous and less expert than when he had climbed up the tree . He lost his grip once , and crashed from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owl , emboldened by his retreat , flew awkwardly down upon the scaffold , and perched there , its head turned askew , and its great , round eyes fixed solemnly upon him . Suddenly a wild hoot of derision rent the air ; the echoes answered , and all the ravine was filled with the jeering clamor . " The wust luck in the worl ' ! " plained poor Rufe , as the ill-omened cry rose again and again . " ' Tai n't goin ' ter s'prise me none now , ef I gits my neck bruk along o ' this resky foolishness in this cur'ous place whar owELS watch from the lookout ez dead men hev lef ' . " He came down unhurt , however . Then he sidled about a great many times through " the laurel , " for he could not muster courage for a direct approach to the strange object he had descried . The owl still watched him , and bobbed its head and hooted after him . When he drew near the lightning-scathed tree , he paused rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of his tow head , his eyes opened wide , one finger inserted in his mouth in silent deprecation . For there stood a man dressed in black , and with a dark straw hat on his head . He had gray whiskers , and gleaming spectacles of a mildly surprised expression . He smiled kindly when he saw Rufe . Incongruously enough , he had a hammer in his hand . He was going down the ravine , tapping the rocks with it . And Rufe thought he looked for all the world like some over-grown , demented woodpecker . CHAPTER IV . As Rufe still stood staring , the old gentleman held out his hand with a cordial gesture . " Come here , my little man ! " he said in a kind voice . Rufe hesitated . Then he was seized by sudden distrust . Who was this stranger ? and why did he call , " Come here ! " Perhaps the fears already uppermost in Rufe 's mind influenced his hasty conclusion . He cast a horrified glance upon the old gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mountaineer , who had never seen men clad in aught but the brown jeans habitually worn by the hunters of the range . He remembered , too , the words of an old song that chronicled how alluring were the invitations of Satan , and with a frenzied cry he fled frantically through the laurel . Away and away he dashed , up steep ascents , down sharp declivities , falling twice or thrice in his haste , but hurting his clothes more than himself . It was not long before he was in sight of home , and Towse met him at the fence . The feeling between these two was often the reverse of cordial , and as Rufe climbed down from rail to rail , his sullen " Lemme ' lone , now ! " was answered by sundry snaps at his heels and a low growl . Not that Towse would really have harmed him -- fealty to the family forbade that ; but in defense of his ears and tail he thought it best to keep fierce possibilities in Rufe 's contemplation . Rufe sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his legs dangling over the sparse sprouts of chickweed and clumps of mullein that grew just beneath , for there were no steps , and Towse bounded up and sat upright close beside him . And as he sought to lean on Towse , the dog sought to lean on him . They both looked out meditatively at the dense and sombre wilderness , upon which this little clearing and humble log-cabin were but meagre suggestions of that strong , full-pulsed humanity that has elsewhere subdued nature , and achieved progress , and preempted perfection . Towse soon shut his eyes , and presently he was nodding . Presumably he dreamed , for once he roused himself to snap at a fly , when there was no fly . Rufe , however , was wide awake , and busily canvassing how to account to Birt for the lack of a message from Nate Griggs , for he would not confess how untrustworthy he had proved himself . As he reflected upon this perplexity , he leaned his throbbing head on his hand , and his attitude expressed a downcast spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came to the door . She paused and looked keenly at him . " Them hoss apples ag'in ! " she exclaimed , with the voice of accusation . She had no idea of youthful dejection disconnected with the colic . Rufe was roused to defend himself . " Hai n't teched ' em , now ! " he cried , acrimoniously . " Waal , sometimes ye air sorter loose-jointed in yer jaw , an ' ai n't partic'lar what ye say , " rejoined his mother , politely . " I 'll waste a leetle yerb-tea on ye , ennyhow . " She started back into the room , and Rufe rose at once . This cruelty should not be practiced upon him , whatever might betide him at the tanyard . He set out at a brisk pace . He had no mind to be long alone in the woods since his strange adventure down the ravine , or he might have hid in the underbrush , as he had often done , until other matters usurped his mother 's medicinal intentions . When Rufe reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked eagerly at the juvenile ambassador . " Did Nate gin ye a word fur me ? " he called sonorously , above the clamor of the noisy bark-mill . " He say he 'll be hyar ter-morrer by sun-up ! " piped out Rufe , in a blatant treble . A lie seemed less reprehensible when he was obliged to labor so conscientiously to make it heard . And then compunction seized him . He sat down by Tennessee on a pile of bark , and took off his old wool hat to mop the cold perspiration that had started on his head and face . He felt sick , and sad , and extremely wicked ,  - -  a sorry contrast to Birt , who was so honest and reliable and , as his mother always said , " ez stiddy ez the mounting . " Birt was beginning to unharness the mule , for the day 's work was at an end . The dusk had deepened to darkness . The woods were full of gloom . A timorous star palpitated in the sky . In the sudden stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard by lifted a mystic chant . The drone of the katydid vibrated in the laurel , and the shrill-voiced cricket chirped . Two of the men were in the shed examining a green hide by the light of a perforated tin lantern , that seemed to spill the rays in glinting white rills . As they flickered across the pile of bark where Rufe and Tennessee were sitting , he noticed how alert Birt looked , how bright his eyes were . For Birt 's hopes were suddenly renewed . He thought that some mischance had detained Nate to-day , and that he would come to-morrow to work at the bark-mill . The boy 's blood tingled at the prospect of being free to seek for treasure down the ravine . He began to feel that he had been too quick to distrust his friend . Perhaps the stipulation that Nate should not go to the ravine until the work commenced was more than he ought to have asked . And perhaps , too , the trespasser was not Nate ! The traces of shallow delving might have been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule . He stood with the gear in one hand , serious and anxious , in view of the possibility that this discovery was not his alone . Then he strove to cast aside the thought . He said to himself that he had been hasty in concluding that the slight excavation argued human presence in that lonely spot ; a rock dislodged and rolling heavily down the gorge might have thus scraped into the sand and gravel ; or perhaps some burrowing animal , prospecting for winter quarters , had begun to dig a hole under the bowlder . He was perplexed , despite his plausible reasoning , and he continued silent and preoccupied when he lifted Tennessee to his shoulder and trudged off homeward , with Rufe at his heels , and the small boy 's conscience following sturdily in the rear . That sternly accusing conscience ! Rufe was dismayed , when he sat with the other laughing children about the table , to know that his soul was not merry . Sometimes a sombre shadow fell upon his face , and once Birt asked him what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt it was very hard to be gay without the subtle essence of mirth . That lie ! it seemed to grow ; before supper was over it was as big as the warping-bars , and when they all sat in a semicircle in the open passage , Rufe felt that his conscience was the most prominent member of the party . The young moon sank ; the night waxed darker still ; the woods murmured mysteriously . And he was glad enough at last to be sent to bed , where after so long a time sleep found him . The morrow came in a cloud . The light lacked the sunshine . The listless air lacked the wind . Still and sombre , the woods touched the murky , motionless sky . All the universe seemed to hold a sullen pause . Time was afoot -- it always is -- but Birt might not know how it sped ; no shadows on the spent tan this dark day ! Over his shoulder he was forever glancing , hoping that Nate would presently appear from the woods . He saw only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chill presence . He buttoned his coat about him , and the old mule sneezed as he jogged round the bark- mill . Jubal Perkins and a crony stood smoking much of the time to-day in the door of the house , looking idly out upon the brown stretch of spent bark , and the gray , weather-beaten sheds , and the dun sky , and the shadowy , mist-veiled woods . The tanner was a tall , muscular man , clad in brown jeans , and with boots of a fair grade of leather drawn high over his trousers . As he often remarked , " The tanyard owes ME good foot-gear -- ef the rest o ' the mounting hev ter go barefoot . " The expression of his face was somewhat masked by a heavy grizzled beard , but from beneath the wide brim of his hat his eyes peered out with a jocose twinkle . His mouth seemed chiefly useful as a receptacle for his pipe-stem , for he spoke through his nose . His voice was strident on the air , since he included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a two- handled knife a hide spread on a wooden horse . This man , whose name was Andrew Byers , glanced up now and then , elevating a pair of shaggy eyebrows , and settled the affairs of the nation with diligence and despatch , little hindered by his labors or the distance . Birt took no heed of the loud drawling talk . In moody silence he drove the mule around and around the bark-mill . The patient old animal , being in no danger of losing his way , closed his eyes drowsily as he trudged , making the best of it . " I 'll git ez mild-mannered an ' meek-hearted ez this hyar old beastis , some day , ef things keep on as disapp'intin ' as they hev been lately , " thought Birt , miserably . " They do say ez even he used ter be a turrible kicker . " Noon came and went , and still the mists hung in the forest closely engirdling the little clearing . The roofs glistened with moisture , and the eaves dripped . A crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule rest , and the raucous sound caused him to turn his head . His heart gave a bound when he saw that on the other side of the fence the underbrush was astir along the path which wound through the woods to the tanyard . Somebody was coming ; he hoped even yet that it might be Nate . He eagerly watched the rustling boughs . The crow had flown , but he heard as he waited a faint " caw ! caw ! " in the misty distance . Whoever the newcomer might be , he certainly loitered . At last the leaves parted , and revealed- - Rufe . Birt 's first sensation was renewed disappointment . Then he was disposed to investigate the mystery of Nate 's non-appearance . " Hello , Rufe ! " he called out , as soon as the small boy was inside the tanyard , " be you-uns SURE as Nate said he 'd come over by sun- up ? " Rufe halted and gazed about him , endeavoring to conjure an expression of surprise into his freckled face . He even opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a large assortment of jagged squirrel teeth . " Hai n't Nate come yit ? " he ventured . The tanner suddenly put into the conversation . " War it Nate Griggs ez ye war aimin ' ter trade with ter take yer place wunst in a while in the tanyard ? " Birt assented . " An ' he ' lowed he 'd be hyar ter-day by sun-up . Rufe brung that word from him yestiddy . " Rufe 's conscience had given him a recess , during which he had consumed several horse-apples in considerable complacence and a total disregard of " yerb tea . " He had climbed a tree , and sampled a green persimmon , and he endured with fortitude the pucker in his mouth , since it enabled him to make such faces at Towse as caused the dog to snap and growl in a frenzy of surprised indignation . He had fashioned a corn-stalk fiddle -- that instrument so dear to rural children !  - -  and he had been sawing away on it to his own satisfaction and Tennessee 's unbounded admiration for the last half-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him again in the tanyard . " Oh , Birt , " he quavered out , suddenly , " I hai n't laid eyes on Nate . " Birt exclaimed indignantly , and Jubal Perkins laughed . " I seen sech a cur'ous lookin ' man , down in the ravine by the lick , ez it sot me all catawampus ! " continued Rufe . As he told of his defection , and the falsehood with which he had accounted for it , Jubal Perkins came to a sudden decision . " Git on that thar mule , Birt , an ' ride over ter Nate 's , an ' find out what ails him , ef so be ye hanker ter know . I do n't want nobody workin ' in this hyar tanyard as looks ez mournful ez ye do -- like as ef ye hed been buried an ' dug up . But hurry back , ' kase there ai n't enough bark ground yit , an ' I hev got other turns o ' work I want ye ter do besides ' fore dark . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whar ? " exclaimed Birt , startled , and glancing hastily over his shoulder . " Down yander by the lick , " plained Rufe . " Naw ! " said Birt , scornfully , " an ' nuthin ' like Satan , I 'll be bound ! " He was , however , uneasy to hear of any man down the ravine in the neighborhood of his hidden treasure , but he could not now question Rufe , for Jube Perkins , with mock severity , was taking the small boy to account . Byers was looking on , the knife idle in his hands , and his lips distended with a wide grin in the anticipation of getting some fun out of Rufe . " Look-a-hyar , bub , " said Jubal Perkins , with both hands in his pockets and glaring down solemnly at Rufe ; " ef ever I ketches ye goin ' of yerrands no better'n that ag'in , I 'm a-goin ' ter -- TAN that thar hide o ' yourn . " Rufe gazed up deprecatingly , his eyes widening at the prospect . Byers broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' some leetle varmints fur tanning ennyhow , " he said . " Ye 'll feel mighty queer when ye stand out thar on the spent tan , with jes ' yer meat on yer bones , an ' look up an ' see yer skin a-hangin ' alongside o ' the t' other calves , an ' sech -- that ye will ! " " An ' all the mounting folks will be remarkin ' on it , too , " said Perkins . Which no doubt they would have done with a lively interest . " I reckon , " said Byers , looking speculatively at Rufe , " ez't would take a right smart time fur ye ter git tough enough ter go ' bout in respect'ble society ag'in . ' T would hurt ye mightily , I 'm thinkin ' . Ef I war you-uns , I 'd be powerful partic'lar ter keep inside o ' sech an accommodatin ' - lookin ' little hide ez yourn be fur tanning . " Rufe 's countenance was distorted . He seemed about to tune up and whimper . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find su'thin ' better ter do'n ter bait an ' badger a critter the size o ' Rufe ! " exclaimed Birt angrily . " That thar boy 's ' bout right , too ! " said the man who had hitherto been standing silent in the door . " Waal , leave Rufe be , Jubal ! " said Byers , laughing . " YE started the fun . " " Leave him be , yerself , " retorted the tanner . When Birt mounted the mule , and rode out of the yard , he glanced back and saw that Rufe had approached the shed ; judging by his gestures , he was asking a variety of questions touching the art of tanning , to which Byers amicably responded . The mists were shifting as Birt went on and on . He heard the acorns dropping from the chestnut-oaks -- sign that the wind was awake in the woods . Like a glittering , polished blade , at last a slanting sunbeam fell . It split the gloom , and a radiant afternoon seemed to emerge . The moist leaves shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mists , in elusive dryadic suggestions , chased each other into the distance . Although the song-birds were all silent , there was a chirping somewhere -- cheerful sound ! He had almost reached his destination when a sudden rustling in the undergrowth by the roadside caused him to turn and glance back . Two or three shoats lifted their heads and were gazing at him with surprise , and a certain disfavor , as if they did not quite like his looks . A bevy of barefooted , tow-headed children were making mud pies in a marshy dip close by . An ancient hound , that had renounced the chase and assumed in his old age the office of tutor , seemed to preside with dignity and judgment . He , too , had descried the approach of the stranger . He growled , but made no other demonstration . " Whar 's Nate ? " Birt called out , for these were the children of Nate 's eldest brother . For a moment there was no reply . Then the smallest of the small boys shrilly piped out , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare . " Another unexpected development ! " When will he come back ? " " Ai n't goin ' ter come back fur two weeks . " " Whar ' bouts hev he gone ? " asked Birt amazed . " Du n no , " responded the same little fellow . " When did he set out ? " There was a meditative pause . Then ensued a jumbled bickering . The small boys , the shoats , and the hound seemed to consult together in the endeavor to distinguish " day ' fore yestiddy " from " las ' week . " The united intellect of the party was inadequate . " Du n no ! " the mite of a spokesman at last admitted . Birt rode on rapidly once more , leaving this choice syndicate settling down again to the mud pies . The woods gave way presently and revealed , close to a precipice , Nate 's home . The log house with its chimney of clay and sticks , the barn of ruder guise , the fodder-stack , the ash-hopper , and the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west and the purpling ranges in the distance . The little cabin was quite alone in the world . No other house , no field , no clearing , was visible in all the vast expanse of mountains and valleys which it overlooked . The great panorama of nature seemed to be unrolled for it only . The seasons passed in review before it . The moon rose , waxing or waning , as if for its behoof . The sun conserved for it a splendid state . But the skies above it had sterner moods ,  - -  sometimes lightnings veined the familiar clouds ; winds rioted about it ; the thunder spoke close at hand . And then it was that Mrs. Griggs lamented her husband 's course in " raisin ' the house hyar so nigh the bluffs ez ef it war an ' aigle 's nest , " and forgot that she had ever accounted herself " sifflicated " when distant from the airy cliffs . She stood in the doorway now , her arms akimbo -- an attitude that makes a woman of a certain stamp seem more masterful than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton cap with a wide and impressive ruffle , which , swaying and nodding , served to emphasize her remarks . She was conferring in a loud drawl with her husband , who had let down the bars to admit his horse , laden with a newly killed deer . Her manner would seem to imply that she , and not he , had slain the animal . " Toler'ble fat , " she commented with grave self-complacence . " He ' minds me sorter o ' that thar tremenjious buck we hed las ' September . HE war the fattes ' buck I ever see . Take off his hide right straight . " The big cap-ruffle flapped didactically . " Lor ' - a - -  massy , woman ! " vociferated the testy old man ; " ai n't I a- goin ' ter ? Ter hear ye a-jowin ' , a-body would think I had never shot nothin ' likelier'n a yaller-hammer sence I been born . S'pos'n ye jes ' takes ter goin ' a-huntin ' , an ' skinnin ' deer , an ' cuttin ' wood , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye knows mo ' ' bout'n my work'n I does . An ' I 'll bide hyar at the house . " Mrs. Griggs nodded her head capably , in nowise dismayed . " I du n no but that plan would work mighty well , " she said . This conjugal colloquy terminated as she glanced up and saw Birt . " Why , thar 's young Dicey a-hint ye . Howdy Birt ! ' Light an ' hitch ! " " Naw 'm , " rejoined Birt , as he rode into the enclosure and close up to the doorstep . " I hai n't got time ter ' light . " Then precipitately opening the subject of his mission . " I kem over hyar ter see Nate . Whar hev he disappeared ter ? " " Waal , now , that 's jes ' what I 'd like ter know , " she replied , her face eloquent with baffled curiosity . " He jes ' borried his dad 's claybank mare , an ' sot out , an ' never ' lowed whar he war bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she continued , " an ' he ' lows he air a man growed , an ' obligated ter obey nobody but hisself . From the headin ' way that he kerries on hyar , a-body would s'pose he air older ' n the Cumberland Mountings ! But he hev turned twenty- one -- that 's a fac ' an ' he voted at the las ' election . " ( With how much discretion it need not now be inquired . ) " I knows that air true , " said Birt , who had wistfully admired this feat of his senior . " Waal -- Nate do n't set much store by votin ' , " rejoined Mrs. Griggs . " Nate , he say , the greatest privilege his kentry kin confer on him is ter make it capital punishment fur wimmen ter ax him questions !  --  Which I hev done , " she admitted stoutly . And the ruffle on her cap did not deny it . " Nate air twenty-one , " she reiterated . " An ' I s'pose he ' lows ez I hev no call nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no guess whar he be gone ? " asked Birt , dismayed by this strange new complication . " Waal , I hev been studyin ' it out ez Nate mought hev rid ter Parch Corn , whar his great-uncle , Joshua Peters , lives -- him that merried my aunt , Melissy Baker , ez war a widder then , though born a Scruggs . An ' then , ag'in , Nate MOUGHT hev tuk it inter his head ter go ter the Cross-roads , a-courtin ' a gal thar ez he hev been talkin ' about powerful , lately . But they tells me , " Mrs. Griggs expostulated , as it were , " that them gals at the Cross-roads is in no way desirable , - - specially this hyar Elviry Mills , ez mighty nigh all the boys on the mounting hev los ' thar wits about ,  - -  what little wits ez they ever hed ter lose , I mean ter say . But Nate thinks he hev got a right ter a ch'ice , bein ' as he air turned twenty-one . " " Did he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " ' Bout two or three weeks Nate laid off ter be away ; but whar he hev gone , an ' what 's his yerrand , he let no human know , " returned Mrs. Griggs . " I hev been powerful aggervated ' bout this caper o ' Nate 's . I ai n't afeard he 'll git hisself hurt no ways whilst he be gone , for Nate is mighty apt ter take keer o ' Nate . " She nodded her head convincingly , and the great ruffle on her cap shook in corroboration . " But I hai n't never hed the right medjure o ' respec ' out'n Nate , an ' his dad hai n't , nuther . " Birt listened vaguely to this account of his friend 's filial shortcomings , his absent eyes fixed upon the wide landscape , and his mind busy with the anxious problems of Nate 's broken promises . And the big red ball of the setting sun seemed at last to roll off the plane of the horizon , and it disappeared amidst the fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all the world was not so splendid ; midway below the dark purple summits a dun , opaque vapor asserted itself in dreary , aerial suspension . Beneath it he could see a file of cows , homeward bound , along the road that encircled the mountain 's base . He heard them low , and this reminded him that night was near , for all that the zenith was azure , and for all that the west was aglow . And he remembered he had a good many odd jobs to do before dark . And so he turned his face homeward . CHAPTER V. Birt had always been held in high esteem by the men at the tanyard . Suddenly , however , the feeling toward him cooled . He remembered afterward , although at the time he was too absorbed to fully appreciate it , that this change began one day shortly after he had learned of Nate 's departure . As he went mechanically about his work , he was pondering futilely upon his friend 's mysterious journey , and his tantalizing hopes lying untried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation of the men until something was said that touched upon the wish nearest his heart . " I war studyin ' ' bout lettin ' Birt hev a day off , " said the tanner . " An ' ye 'll bide hyar . " " Naw , Jube -- naw ! " Andy Byers replied with stalwart independence to his employer . " I hev laid off ter attend . Ef ye want ennybody ter bide with the tanyard , an ' keer fur this hyar pit , ye kin do it yerse'f , or else Birt kin . I hev laid off ter attend . " Andy Byers was a man of moods . His shaggy eyebrows to-day overshadowed eyes sombre and austere . He seemed , if possible , a little slower than was his wont . He bore himself with a sour solemnity , and he was at once irritable and dejected . " Shucks , Andy ! ye knows ye ai n't no kin sca'cely ter the old woman ; ye could n't count out how ye air kin ter her ter save yer life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happened that the tanner 's great-aunt was distantly related to Andy Byers . Being ill , and an extremely old woman , she was supposed to be lying at the point of death , and her kindred had been summoned to hear her last words . " I hed ' lowed ter gin Birt a day off , ' kase I hev got ter hev the mule in the wagon , an ' he ca n't grind bark . I PROMISED Birt a day off , " the tanner continued . " That thar 's twixt ye an ' Birt . I hai n't got no call ter meddle , " said the obdurate Byers . " Ye kin bide with the tanyard an ' finish this job yerse'f , of so minded . I 'm goin ' ter attend . " " I reckon half the kentry-side will be thar , an ' I wants ter see the folks , " said Jubal Perkins , cheerfully . " Then Birt will hev ter bide with the tanyard , an ' finish this job . It do n't lie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keer ef he never gits a day off , " said Byers . This was an unnecessarily unkind speech , and Birt 's anger flamed out . " Ef we-uns war of a size , Andy Byers , " he said , hotly , " I 'd make ye divide work a leetle more ekal than ye does . " Andy Byers dropped the hide in his hands , and looked steadily across the pit at Birt , as if he were taking the boy 's measure . " Ye mean ter say ef ye hed the bone an ' muscle ye 'd knock me down , do ye ? " he sneered . " Waal , I 'll take the will fur the deed . I 'll hold the grudge agin ye , jes ' the same . " They were all three busied about the pit . The hides had been taken out , and stratified anew , with layers of fresh tan , reversing the original order ,  - -  those that had been at the bottom now being placed at the top . The operation was almost complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precarious condition . He had no doubt that Birt was able to finish it properly , and the boy 's conscientious habit of doing his best served to make the tanner 's mind quite easy . As to the day off , he was glad to have that question settled by a quarrel between his employees , thus relieving him of responsibility . Birt 's wrath was always evanescent , and he was sorry a moment afterward for what he had said . Andy Byers exchanged no more words with him , and skillfully combined a curt and crusty manner toward him with an aspect of contemplative dreariness . Occasionally , as they paused to rest , Byers would sigh deeply . " A mighty good old woman , Mrs. Price war . " He spoke as if she were already dead . " A mighty good old woman , though small-sized . " " A little of her went a long way . She war eighty-four year old , an ' kep ' a sharp tongue in her head ter the las ' , " rejoined the tanner , adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Now and then he cocked up his speculative eyes , and gazed fixedly into the preternaturally solemn face of Byers , who reiterated , " A good old woman , though small- sized . " With this unaccustomed absorption Rufe 's accomplishment of getting under-foot became pronounced . The tanner jostled him more than once , Birt stumbled against his toes , and Byers , suddenly turning , ran quite over him . Rufe had not far to fall , but Byers was a tall man . His arms swayed like the sails of a windmill in the effort to recover his balance . He was in danger of toppling into the pit , and in fact only caught himself on his knees at its verge . " Ye torment ! " he roared angrily , as he struggled to his feet . " G'way from hyar , or I 'll skeer ye out'n yer wits ! " The small boy ruefully gathered his members together , and after the men had started on their journey he sat down on a pile of wood hard by to give Birt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toler'ble mean man , ai n't he , Birt ? " But Birt said he had no mind to talk about Andy Byers . " SKEER ME ! " exclaimed Rufe , doughtily . " It takes a heap ter skeer ME ! " He got up presently , and going into the shed began to examine the tools of the trade which were lying there . He had the two-handled knife , with which he was about to try his skill on a hide that was stretched over the beam of the wooden horse , when Birt glanced up and came hastily to the rescue . Rufe was disposed to further investigate the appliances of the tanyard left defenseless at his mercy , but at last Birt prevailed on him to go home and play with Tennessee , and was glad enough to see his tow-head , with his old hat perched precariously on it , bobbing up and down among the low bushes , as he wended his way along the path through the woods . The hides had all been replaced between layers of fresh tan before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space above with a thicker layer , ten or fifteen inches deep , and put the boards securely across the top of the pit , with heavy stones upon them to weight them down . But this kept him busy all the rest of the afternoon . Rufe was pretty busy too . When he came in sight of home Tennessee was the first object visible in the open passage . The sunshine slanted through it under the dusky roof , and the shadows of the chestnut-oak , hard by , dappled the floor . Lying there was an old Mexican saddle , for which there was no use since the horse had died . Tennessee was mounted upon it , the reins in her hands , the headstall and bit poised on the peaked pommel . She jounced back and forth , and the skirts of the saddle flapped and the stirrups clanked on the floor , and the absorbed eyes of the little mountaineer were fixed on space . Away and away she cantered on some splendid imaginary palfrey , through scenes where conjecture fails to follow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow fair , and sparkling waters run , and jeopardy delights , and fancy 's license prevails -- all very different , you may be sure , from the facts , an old saddle on a puncheon floor , and a little black-eyed mountaineer . How far Tennessee journeyed , and how long she was gone , it is impossible to say . She halted suddenly when her attention was attracted to a phenomenon within one of the rooms . The door was ajar and the solitary Rufe was visible in the dusky vista . He stood before a large wooden chest . He had lifted the lid , and kept it up by resting it upon his head , bent forward for the purpose , while he rummaged the contents with vandal hands . Tennessee stared at him , with indignant surprise gathering in her widening eyes . Now that chest contained , besides a meagre store of quilts and comforts , her own and her mother 's clothes , the fewer garments of the boys of the family being alternately suspended on the clothes- line and their own frames . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turned on the saddle and looked around with an air of appeal . Her mother , however , was down the hill beside the spring , busy boiling soap , and quite out of hearing . Tennessee gazed vaguely for a moment at the great kettle with the red and yellow flames curling around it , and her mother 's figure hovering over it . Then she looked back at Rufe . He continued industriously churning up the contents of the chest , the lid still poised upon that head that served so many other useful purposes -- for the gymnastic exhibition involved in standing on it ; for his extraordinary mental processes ; for a lodgment for his old wool hat , and a field for his crop of flaxen hair . All the instinct of the proprietor was roused within Tennessee . She found her voice , a hoarse , infantile wheeze . " Tum out'n chist ! " she exclaimed , gutturally . " Tum out'n chist ! " Rufe turned his tow-head slowly , that he might not disturb the poise of the lid of the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , and drawing one hand from the depths of the chest , he silently shook his fist . And then he resumed his researches . Tennessee , alarmed by this impressive demonstration , dismounted hastily from the saddle as soon as his threatening gaze was withdrawn . She tangled her feet in the stirrups and her hands in the reins , and lost more time in scrambling off the floor of the passage and down upon the ground ; but at last she was fairly on her way to the spring to convey an account to her mother of the outlaw in the chest . In fact , she was not far from the scene of the soap- boiling when she heard her name shouted in stentorian tones , and pausing to look back , she saw Rufe gleefully capering about in the passage , the headstall on his own head , the bit hanging on his breast , and the reins dangling at his heels . Now this beguilement the little girl could never withstand , and indeed few people ever had the opportunity to drive so frisky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume the bit and bridle . He was rarely so accommodating , as he preferred the role of driver , with what he called " a pop-lashEE ! " at command . She forgot her tell-tale mission . She turned with a gurgle of delight and began to toddle up the hill again . And presently Mrs. Dicey , glancing toward the house , saw them playing together in great amity , and rejoiced that they gave her so little trouble . They were still at it when Birt came home , but then Tennessee was tired of driving , and he let her go with him to the wood-pile and sit on a log while he swung the axe . No one took special notice of Rufe 's movements in the interval before supper . He disappeared for a time , but when the circle gathered around the table he was in his place and by no means a non-combatant in the general onslaught on the corn-dodgers . Afterward he came out in the passage and sat quietly among the others . The freshened air was fragrant , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear the dew was a-glimmer , for a lustrous moon shone from the sky . Somehow , despite the long roads of light that this splendid pioneer blazed out in the wilderness , it seemed only to reveal the loneliness of the forests , and to give new meaning to the solemnity of the shadows . The heart was astir with some responsive thrill that jarred vaguely , and was pain . Yet the night had its melancholy fascination , and they were all awake later than usual . When at last the doors were barred , and the house grew still , and even the vigilant Towse had ceased to bay and had lodged himself under the floor of the passage , the moon still shone in isolated effulgence , for the faint stars faded before it . The knowledge that in all the vast stretch of mountain fastnesses he was the only human creature that beheld it , as it majestically crossed the meridian , gave Andy Byers a forlorn feeling , while tramping along homeward . He had made the journey afoot , some eight miles down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had heeded the summons of the sick woman . For she still lay in the same critical condition , and his mind was full of dismal forebodings as he toiled along the road on the mountain 's brow . The dark woods were veined with shimmering silver . The mists , hovering here and there , showed now a blue and now an amber gleam as the moon 's rays conjured them . On one side of the road an oak tree had been uptorn in a wind-storm ; the roots , carrying a great mass of earth with them , were thrust high in the air , while the bole and leafless branches lay prone along the ground . This served as a break in the density of the forest , and the white moonshine possessed the vacant space . As he glanced in that direction his heart gave a great bound , then seemed suddenly to stand still . There , close to the verge of the road , as if she had stepped aside to let him pass , was the figure of an old woman -- a small-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Price ! As he paused amazed , with starting eyes and failing limbs , the wind fluttered her shawl and her ample sunbonnet . This shielded her face and he could not see her features . Her head seemed to turn toward him . The next instant it nodded at him familiarly . To the superstitions mountaineer this suggested that the old woman had died since he had left her house , and here was her ghost already vagrant in the woods ! The foolish fellow did not wait to put this fancy to the test . With a piercing cry he sprang past , and fled like a frightened deer through the wilderness homeward . In his own house he hardly felt more secure . He could not rest -- he could not sleep . He stirred the embers with a trembling hand , and sat shivering over them . His wife , willing enough to believe in " harnts " * as appearing to other people , was disposed to repudiate them when they presumed to offer their dubious association to members of her own family circle . * Ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say harnt ! Old Mrs. Price , though spry ter the las ' , war so proud o ' her age an ' her ailments that she would n't hev nobody see her walk a step , or stand on her feet , fur nuthin ' . Her darter-in-law tole me as the only way ter find out how nimble she really be war ter box one o ' her gran'chill'n , an ' then she 'd bounce out'n her cheer , an ' jounce round the room after thar daddy or mammy , whichever hed boxed the chill'n . That fursaken couple always hed ter drag thar chill'n out in the woods , out'n earshot of the house , ter whip ' em , an ' then threat ' em ef they dare let thar granny know they hed been struck . But elsewise she hed ter be lifted from her bed ter her cheer by the h'a'th . She would n't hev HER sperit seen a-walkin ' way up hyar a- top o ' the mounting , like enny healthy harnt , fur nuthin ' in this worl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An ' I reckon of the truth war knowed , ' twar n't nuthin ' at all -- forg , mebbe . " This stalwart reasoning served to steady his nerves a little . And when the moon went down and the day was slowly breaking , he took his way , with a vacillating intention and many a chilling doubt , along the winding road to the scene of his fright . It was not yet time by a good hour or more to go to work , and nothing was stirring . A wan light was on the landscape when he came in sight of the great tree prone upon the ground . And there , close to the edge of the road , as if she had stepped aside to let him pass , was the figure of a little , bent old woman -- nay , in the brightening dawn , a bush -- a blackberry bush , clad in a blue-checked apron , a red plaid shawl , and with a neat sunbonnet nodding on its topmost spray . His first emotion was intense relief . Then he stood staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a road led only to his own house , and this image of a small and bent old woman had doubtless been devised , to terrify him , by some one who knew of his mission , and that he could not return except by this route . Only for a moment did he feel uncertain as to the ghost-maker 's identity . There was something singularly familiar to him in the plaid of the shawl -- even in the appearance of the bonnet , although it was now limp and damp . He saw it at " meet'n " whenever the circuit rider preached , and he presently recognized it . This was Mrs. Dicey 's bonnet ! His face hardened . He set his teeth together . An angry flush flared to the roots of his hair . Not that he suspected the widow of having set this trap to frighten him . He was not learned , nor versed in feminine idiosyncrasies , but it does not require much wisdom to know that on no account whatever does a woman 's best bonnet stay out all night in the dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow 's alibi . Like a flash he remembered Birt 's anger the previous day . " Told me he 'd make me divide work mo ' ekal , an ' ez good as said he 'd knock me down ef he could . An ' I told him I 'd hold the grudge agin him jes ' the same -- an ' I will ! " He felt sure that it was Birt who had thus taken revenge , because he was kept at work while his fellow-laborer was free to go . Byers thought the boy would presently come to take the garments home , and conceal his share in the matter , before any one else would be likely to stir abroad . " An ' I 'll hide close by with a good big hickory stick , an ' I 'll gin him a larrupin ' as he wo n't furgit in a month o ' Sundays , " he resolved , angrily . He opened his clasp-knife , and walked slowly into the woods , looking about for a choice hickory sprout . He did not at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnitude of Birt 's wickedness , and he went further perhaps than he realized , and stayed longer . He had a smile of stern satisfaction on his face when he was lopping off the leaves and twigs of a specimen admirably adapted for vengeance . He was stealthy in returning , keeping behind the trees , and slipping softly from bole to bole . At last , as the winding road was once more in view , he crouched down behind the roots of the great fallen oak . " I do n't want him ter git a glimge of me , an ' skeer him off afore I kin lay a-holt on him , " he said . He intended to keep the neighboring bush under close watch , and through the interlacing roots he peered out furtively at it . His eyes distended and he hastily rose from his hiding-place . The blackberry bush was swaying in the wind , clothed only in its own scant and rusty leaves . A wren perched on a spray , chirped cheerful matins . CHAPTER VI . His scheme was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , all unaware of his proximity and the impending punishment so narrowly escaped . But when Andy Byers reached the tanyard and went to work , he said nothing to Birt . He did not even allude to the counterfeit apparition in the woods , although Mrs. Price 's probable recovery was more than once under discussion among the men who came and went ,  --  indeed , she lived many years thereafter , to defend her lucky grandchildren against every device of discipline . Byers had given heed to more crafty counsels . On the whole he was now glad that he had not had the opportunity to make Birt and the hickory sprout acquainted with each other . This would be an acknowledgment that he had been terrified by the manufactured ghost , and he preferred foregoing open revenge to encountering the jocose tanner 's ridicule , and the gibes that would circulate at his expense throughout the country-side . But he cherished the grievance , and he resolved that Birt should rue it . He had expected that Birt would boast of having frightened him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in treating the matter thus lightly he hoped it would seem that the apparition was a failure . However , day by day passed and nothing was said . The ghost vanished as mysteriously as it had come . Only Mrs. Dicey , taking her bonnet and apron and shawl from the chest , was amazed at the extraordinary manner in which they were folded and at their limp condition , and when she found a bunch of cockle-burs in the worsted fringes of the shawl she declared that witches must have had it , for she had not worn it since early in April when there were no cockle-burs . She forthwith nailed a horseshoe on the door to keep the witches out , and she never liked the shawl so well after she had projected a mental picture of a lady wearing it , riding on a broomstick , and sporting also a long peaked nose . Birt hardly noticed the crusty and ungracious conduct of Andy Byers toward him . He worked on doggedly , scheming all the time to get off from the tanyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where , and when he would return . One day -- a gray day it was and threatening rain -- as he came suddenly out of the shed , he saw a boy at the bars . It was Nate Griggs ! No ; only for a moment he thought this was Nate . But this fellow 's eyes were not so close together ; his hair was less sandy ; there were no facial indications of extreme slyness . It was only Nathan 's humble likeness , his younger brother , Timothy . He had Nate 's coat thrown over his arm , and he shouldered his brother 's rifle . Tim came slouching slowly into the tanyard , a good-natured grin on his face . He paused only to knock Rufe 's hat over his eyes , as the small boy stood in front of the low-spirited mule , both hands busy with the animal 's mouth , striving to open his jaws to judge by his teeth how old he might be . " The critter 'll bite ye , Rufe ! " Birt exclaimed , for as Rufe stooped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his turn , and was snuffling at Rufe 's hay-colored hair . Rufe readjusted his head-gear , and ceasing his impolite researches into the mule 's age , came up to the other two boys . Tim had paused by the shed , and leaning upon the rifle , began to talk . " I war a-passin ' by , an ' I thought I 'd drap in on ye . " " Hev you-uns hearn from Nate since he hev been gone away ? " demanded Birt anxiously . " He hev come home , " responded Tim . " When did he git home ? " Birt asked with increasing suspicion . " Las ' week , " said Tim carelessly . Another problem ! Why had Nate not communicated with his partner about their proposed work ? It seemed a special avoidance . " I onderstood ez how he aimed ter bide away longer , " Birt remarked . " He did count on stayin ' longer , " said Tim , " but he rid night an ' day ter git hyar sooner . It ' pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ez ter start ME ter work , and nuthin ' else in this worl ' . I owe Nate a debt , ye see , an ' I hev ter work it out . I hev been so onlucky as I could n't make out ter pay him nohow in the worl ' . Ye see , I traded with Nate fur a shoat , an ' the spiteful beastis sneaked out'n my pen , an ' went rootin ' round the aidge o ' the clearin ' , an ' war toted off bodaciously by a bar ez war a-prowlin ' round thar . An ' I got no good o ' that thar shoat , ' kase the bar hed him , but I hed to pay fur him all the same . An ' dad gin his cornsent ter Nate ter let me work a month an ' better fur him , ter pay out'n debt fur the shoat . " " What work be you-uns goin ' ter do ? " Birt had a strong impression , amounting to a conviction , that there was something behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , " said Tim , in surprise , " hai n't ye hearn bout'n Nate 's new land what he hev jes ' got ' entered ' as he calls it ? He hev got a grant fur it from the land-office down yander in Sparty , whar he hev been . " " New land -- 'ENTERED ! ' " faltered Birt . Tim nodded . " Nate fund a trac ' o ' land a-layin ' ter suit his mind what b'longed ter nobody but the State -- vacant land , ye see -- an ' so he went ter the ' entry-taker , ' they calls him , an ' gits it ' entered , ' an ' the surveyor kem an ' medjured it , an ' then Nate got a grant fur it , an ' now it air his'n . The Gov'nor o ' the State hev sot his name ter that thar grant -- the Gov'nor o ' Tennessee ! " reiterated Tim pridefully . " An ' the great seal o ' the State ! " " Whar be the land ? " gasped Birt , possessed by a dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its altered expression could not for an instant have escaped the notice of Timothy 's brother Nathan . " Why , it lays bout'n haffen mile off -- all down the ravine nigh that thar salt-lick ; but look-a-hyar , Birt -- what ails ye ? " The stunned despair in the white face had at last arrested his careless attention . " Do n't ye be mindin ' of me -- I feel sorter porely an ' sick all of a suddint ; tell on ' bout the land an ' sech , " said Birt . He sat down on the end of the wood-pile , and Tim , still leaning on the rifle , recommenced . He was generally much cowed and kept down by Nate , and was unaccustomed to respect and consideration . Therefore he felt a certain gratification in having so attentive a listener . " Waal , I never hearn o ' this fashion o ' enterin ' land like Nate done in all my life afore ; though dad say that 's the law in Tennessee , ter git a title ter vacant land ez jes ' b'longs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nate l'arned whilst he war a-hangin ' round the Settlemint so constant , an ' forever talkin ' ter the men thar . " Birt 's precocity had never let him feel at a disadvantage with Nate , although his friend was five years older . Now he began to appreciate that Nate was indeed a man grown , and had become sophisticated in the ways of his primitive world by his association with the other men at the Settlement . There was a pause . But the luxury of being allowed to talk without contradiction or rebuke presently induced Tim to proceed . " He war hyar mighty nigh all day long , " he said reflectively . " He eat his dinner along of we-uns . " " Who ? the Gov'nor o ' the State ? " exclaimed Birt , astounded . " Naw , ' twar n't HIM , " Tim admitted somewhat reluctantly , since Birt seemed disposed to credit " we-uns " with a gubernatorial guest . " It 's the surveyor I 'm talkin ' ' bout . Nate hed ter pay him three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tole Nate ez his land war ez steep an ' rocky a spot ez thar war in Tennessee from e-end ter e-end . He axed Nate what ailed him ter hanker ter pay taxes on sech a pack o ' bowlders an ' bresh . He ' lowed the land war n't wuth a cent an acre . " " What did Nate say ? " asked Birt , who hung with feverish interest on every thoughtless word . " Waal , Nate ' lows ez he hev fund a cur'ous metal on his land ; he say it air GOLD ! " Tim opened his eyes very wide , and smacked his lips , as if the word tasted good . " He ' lowed as he need n't hev been in sech a hurry ter enter his land , ' kase the entry-taker told it ter him ez it air the law in Tennessee ez ennybody as finds a mine or val'able min'ral on vacant land hev got six months extry ter enter the land afore ennybody else kin , an ' ef ennybody else wants ter enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine thirty days ' notice . " Tim winked , an impressive demonstration but for the insufficiency of eyelashes : - " The surveyor he misdoubted , an ' ' lowed as gold hed never been fund in these parts . He said they fund gold in them mountings furder east ' bout twenty odd year ago -- in 1831 , I believe he said . He ' lowed them mountings hai n't got no coal like our'n hev , an ' the Cumberland Mountings hai n't got no gold . An ' then in a minit he tuk ter misdoubtin ' on the t' other side o ' his mouth . He ' lowed as Nate 's min'ral MOUGHT be gold , an ' then ag'in it mought n't . " The essential difference between these two extremes has afforded scope for vacillation to more consistent men than the surveyor . " Thar 's the grant right now , in the pocket o ' Nate 's coat , " said Tim , shifting the garment on his arm to show a stiff , white folded paper sticking out of the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tote his gun an ' coat home , he furgot the grant war in his pocket , ' kase he fairly dotes on it , an ' wo n't trest it out'n his sight . " Nate was in the habit of exacting similar services from his acquiescent younger brother , and Tim had his hands full , as he tried to hold the gun , and turn the coat on his arm . He finally hung the garment on a peg in the shed , and shouldered the weapon . Suddenly he whirled around toward Rufe , who was still standing by . " What in the nation air inside o ' that thar boy ? " he exclaimed . " A chicken , ai n't it ? " For a musical treble chirping was heard proceeding apparently from Rufe 's pocket . This chicken differed from others that Rufe had put away , in being alive and hearty . The small boy entered into the conversation with great spirit , to tell that a certain hen which he owned had yesterday come off her nest with fourteen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so won upon Rufe by its beauty and grace of deportment that he was carrying it about with him , feeding it at close intervals , and housing it in the security of his pocket . The deedie hardly made a moan . There was no use in remonstrating with Rufe ,  - -  everything that came within his eccentric orbit seemed to realize that ,  - -  and the deedie was contentedly nestling down in his pocket , apparently resigned to lead the life of a portemonnaie . Rufe narrated with pardonable pride the fact that , some time before , his great-uncle , Rufus Dicey , had sent to him from the " valley kentry " a present of a pair of game chickens , and that this deedie was from the first egg hatched in the game hen 's brood . But Rufe was not selfish . He offered to give Tim one of the chicks . Now poultry was Tim 's weakness . He accepted with more haste than was seemly , and at once asked for the deedie in the small boy 's pocket . Rufe , however , refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently Tim , with the gun on his shoulder , left the tanyard in company with Rufe , to look over the brood of game chicks , and make a selection from among them . Birt hardly noticed what they did or said . Every faculty was absorbed in considering the wily game which his false friend had played so successfully . It was all plain enough now . The fruit of his discovery would be plucked by other hands . There was to be no division of the profits . Nate Griggs had coveted the whole . His craft had secured it for himself alone . He had the legal title to the land , the mine -- all ! There seemed absolutely no vulnerable point in his scheme . With suddenly sharpened perceptions , Birt realized that if he should now claim the discovery and the consequent right of thirty days ' notice of Nate 's intention , by virtue of the priority of entering land accorded by the statute to the finder of a mine or valuable mineral , it would be considered a groundless boast , actuated by envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his discovery -- and would not Nate now deny it ! However , one thing in the future was certain ,  - -  Nathan Griggs should not escape altogether scathless . For a long time Birt sat motionless , revolving vengeful purposes in his mind . Every moment he grew more bitter , as he reflected upon his wrecked scheme , his wonderful fatuity , and the double dealing of his chosen coadjutor . But he would get even with Nate Griggs yet ; he promised himself that ,  - -  he would get even ! At last the falling darkness warned him home . When he rose his limbs trembled , his head was in a whirl , and the familiar scene swayed , strange and distorted , before him . He steadied himself after a moment , finished the odd jobs he had left undone , and presently was trudging homeward . A heavy black cloud overhung the woods ; an expectant stillness brooded upon the sultry world ; an angry storm was in the air . The first vivid flash and simultaneous peal burst from the sky as he reached the passage between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a-steppin ' home jes ' at supper- time , " said his mother advancing to meet him . " Ye lef ' no wood hyar , an ' ye said ye would borry the mule , an ' come home early a- purpose to haul some . An ' me hyar with nuthin ' to cook supper with but sech chips an ' blocks an ' bresh ez I could pick up off'n the groun ' . " Birt 's troubles had crowded out the recollection of this domestic duty . " I clean furgot , " he admitted , penitently . Then he asked suddenly , " An ' whar war Rufe , an ' Pete , an ' Joe , ez YE hed ter go ter pickin ' up of chips an ' sech off'n the groun ' ? " He turned toward the group of small boys . " Air you-uns all disabled somehows , ez ye ca n't pick up chips an ' bresh an ' sech ? " he said . " An ' ef ye air , why n't ye go ter the tanyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , a-lookin ' after Rufe 's trap ez ye sot fur squir'ls , " Mrs. Dicey explained . " It hed one in it , an ' I cooked it fur supper . " Birt said that he could go out early with his axe and cut enough wood for breakfast tomorrow , and then he fell silent . Once or twice his preoccupied demeanor called forth comment . " Why n't ye eat some o ' the squir'l , Birt ? " his mother asked at the supper table . " Pears-like ter me as it air cooked toler'ble tasty . " Birt could not eat . He soon rose from the table and resumed his chair by the window , and for half an hour no word passed between them . The thunder seemed to roll on the very roof of the cabin , and it trembled beneath the heavy fall of the rain . At short intervals a terrible blue light quivered through crevices in the " daubin ' " between the logs of the wall , and about the rude shutter which closed the glassless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of a riven tree . But the storm had no terrors for the inmates of this humble dwelling . Pete and Joe had already gone to bed ; Tennessee had fallen asleep while playing on the floor , and Rufe dozed peacefully in his chair . Even Mrs. Dicey nodded as she knitted , the needles sometimes dropping from her nerveless hand . Birt silently watched the group for a time in the red light of the smouldering fire and the blue flashes from without . At length he softly rose and crept noiselessly to the door ; the fastening was the primitive latch with a string attached ; it opened without a sound in his cautious handling , and he found himself in the pitchy darkness outside , the wild mountain wind whirling about him , and the rain descending in steady torrents . He had stumbled only a few steps from the house when he thought he indistinctly heard the door open again . He dreaded his mother 's questions , but he stopped and looked back . He saw nothing . There was no sound save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the commotion among the branches of the trees . He went on once more , absorbed in his dreary reflections and the fierce anger that burned in his heart . " I 'll git even with Nate Griggs , " he said , over and again . " I 'll git even with him yit . " CHAPTER VII . When Birt reached the fence , he discovered that the bars were down . Rufe had forgotten to replace them that afternoon when he drove in the cow to be milked . Despite his absorption , Birt paused to put them up , remembering the vagrant mountain cattle that might stray in upon the corn . He found the familiar little job difficult enough , for it seemed to him that there was never before so black a night . Even looking upward , he could not see the great wind-tossed boughs of the chestnut-oak above his head . He only knew they were near , because acorns dropped upon the rail in his hands , and rebounded resonantly . But an owl , blown helplessly down the gale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaunted nocturnal vision . As it drifted by , on the currents of the wind , its noiseless , out- stretched wings , vainly flapping , struck Birt suddenly in the face , and frightened by the collision , it gave an odd , peevish squeak . Birt , too , was startled for a moment . Then he exclaimed irritably , " Oh , g'way owEL "  - -  realizing what had struck him . The next moment he paused abruptly . He thought he heard , close at hand , amongst the glooms , a faint chuckle . Something -- was it ?  --  SOMEBODY laughing in the darkness ? He stood intently listening . But now he heard only the down-pour of the rain , the sonorous gusts of the wind , the multitudinous voices of the muttering leaves . He said to himself that it was fancy . " All this trouble ez I hev hed along o ' Nate Griggs hev mighty nigh addled my brains . " The name recalled his resolve . " I 'll git even with him , though . I 'll git even with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the path , his mind once more busy with all the details of his discovery , his misplaced confidence , and the wreck of his hopes . It seemed so hard that he should never before have heard of " entering land , " and of that law of the State according priority to the finder of mineral . The mine was his , but he had hid the discovery from all but Nate , who claimed it himself , and had secured the legal title . " But I 'll git even with him , " he said resolutely between his set teeth . He had thought it a lucky chance to remember , in his reverie before the fire-lit hearth , that peg in the shed at the tanyard on which Tim had hung his brother 's coat . Somehow the episode of the afternoon had left so vivid an impression on Birt 's mind that hours afterward he seemed to see the dull , clouded sky , the sombre , encircling woods , the brown stretch of spent tan , the little gray shed , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , a stiff white paper protruding from its pocket . That grant , he thought , had taken from him his rights . He would destroy it -- he would tear it into bits , and cast it to the turbulent mountain winds . It was not his , to be sure . But was it justly Nate 's ?  - -  he had no right to enter the land down the ravine . And so Birt argued with his conscience . Now wherever Conscience calls a halt , it is no place for Reason to debate the question . The way ahead is no thoroughfare . Birt did not recognize the tearing of the paper as stealing , but he knew that all this was morally wrong , although he would not admit it . He would not forego his revenge -- it was too dear ; he was too deeply injured . In the anger that possessed his every faculty , he did not appreciate its futility . There were other facts which he did NOT know . He was ignorant that the deed which he contemplated was a crime in the estimation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible pitfall he trudged in the darkness , saying over and again to himself , " I 'll git even with Nate Griggs ; he 'll hev no grant , no land , no gold -- no more ' n me . I 'll git even with him . " His progress seemed incredibly slow as he groped along the path . But the rain soon ceased ; the wind began to scatter the clouds ; through a rift he saw a great , glittering planet blazing high above their dark turmoils . How the drops pattered down as the wind tossed the laurel !  - -  once they sounded like footfalls close behind him . He turned and looked back into the obscurities of the forest . Nothing -- a frog had begun to croak far away , and the vibrations of the katydid were strident on the damp air . And here was the tanyard , a denser area of gloom marking where the house and shed stood in the darkness . He did not hesitate . He stepped over the bars , which lay as usual on the ground , and walked across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture . But the coat , still hanging within on the peg , was dry . He had a thrill of repulsion when he touched it . His hand fell . " But look how Nate hev treated me , " he remonstrated with his conscience . The next moment he had drawn the grant half-way out of the pocket , and as he moved he almost stepped upon something close behind him . All at once he knew what it was , even before a flash of the distant lightning revealed a little tow-head down in the darkness , and a pair of black eyes raised to his in perfect confidence . It was the little sister who had followed him to-night , as she always did when she could . " Stand back thar , Tennessee ! " he faltered . He was trembling from head to foot . And yet Tennessee was far too young to tell that she had seen the grant in his hands , to understand , even to question . But had he been seized by the whole Griggs tribe , he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that unknowing little head , the touch of the chubby little hand on his knee . He thrust the grant back into the pocket of Nate 's coat . His resolve was routed by the presence of love and innocence . Not here- - not now could he be vindictive , malicious . With some urgent , inborn impulse strongly constraining him , he caught the little sister in his arms , and fled headlong through the darkness , homeward . As he went he was amazed that he should have contemplated this revenge . " Why , I ca n't afford ter be a scoundrel an ' sech , jes ' ' kase Nate Griggs air a tricky feller an ' hev fooled me . Ef Tennessee hed n't stepped up so powerful peart I mought n't hev come ter my senses in time . I mought hev tore up Nate 's grant by now . But after this I ai n't never goin ' ter set out ter act like a scamp jes ' ' kase somebody else does . " His conscience had prevailed , his better self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door saw his mother still nodding over her knitting , and Rufe asleep in his chair , and the fire smouldering on the hearth , all as he had left it , he might have thought that he had dreamed the temptation and his rescue , but for his dripping garments and Tennessee in his arms all soaking with the rain . The noise of his entrance roused his mother , who stared in drowsy astonishment at the bedraggled apparition on the threshold . " Tennie follered me ter the tanyard ' fore I fund her out , " Birt explained . " It ' pears ter hev rained on her , considerable , " he added deprecatingly . Tennie was looking eagerly over her shoulder to note the effect of this statement . Her streaming hair flirted drops of water on the floor ; her cheeks were ruddy ; her black eyes brightened with apprehension . " Waal , sir ! that thar child beats all . Never mind , Tennie , ye 'll meet up with a wild varmint some day when ye air follerin ' Birt off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none ef it eats ye ! But shucks ! " Mrs. Dicey continued impersonally , " I mought ez well save my breath ; Tennie ai n't feared o ' nuthin ' , ef Birt air by . " The word " varmint " seemed to recall something to Tennessee . She began to chatter unintelligibly about an " owEL , " and to chuckle so , that Birt had sudden light upon that mysterious laugh which he had heard behind him at the bars . In his pride in Tennessee he related how the owl had startled him , and the little girl , invisible in the darkness , had laughed . " Tennessee ai n't pretty , I know , but she air powerful peart , " he said , affectionately , as he placed her upon her feet on the floor . Birt was out early with his axe the next day . The air was delightfully pure after the rain-storm ; the sky , gradually becoming visible , wore the ideal azure ; the freshened foliage seemed tinted anew . And the morning was pierced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the misty eastern mountains . As the day dawned all sylvan fascinations were alert in the woods . The fragrant winds were garrulous with wild legends of piney gorges ; of tumultuous cascades fringed by thyme and mint and ferns . Every humble weed lent odorous suggestions . The airy things all took to wing . And the spider was a-weaving . Birt had felled a slender young ash , and was cutting it into lengths for the fireplace , when he noticed a squirrel , sleek woodland dandy , frisking about a rotten log at some little distance , by the roadside . Suddenly the squirrel paused , then nimbly sped away . There was the sound of approaching hoofs along the road , and presently from around the curve a woman appeared mounted on a sorrel mare , and with a long-legged colt ambling in the rear . It was Mrs. Griggs , setting out on a journey of some ten miles to visit her married daughter who lived on a neighboring spur . She had taken an early start to " git rid o ' the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dicey , who had run out to the rail fence when she reined up beside it . Birt dropped his axe and joined them , expecting to hear more about Nate 's grant and the gold mine . Rufe and Tennessee added their company without any definite intention . Pete and Joe were hurrying out of the house toward the group . All the dogs congregated , some of them climbing over the fence to investigate the colt , which was skittish under the ordeal . Even the turkey-gobbler , strutting on the outskirts of the assemblage , had an attentive aspect , as if he , too , relished the gossip . Mrs. Griggs 's pink calico sunbonnet surmounted the cap with the explanatory ruffle . She carried a fan of turkey feathers , and with appropriate gesticulation , it aided in expounding to Mrs. Dicey the astonishing news that Nate had found a gold mine on vacant land , and had entered the tract . They intended to send specimens to the State Assayer , and they were all getting ready to begin work at once . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the Assayer . But indeed Nate had only learned of the existence of the office and its uses during that memorable trip to Sparta . The prideful Mrs. Griggs from her elevation , literal and metaphorical , supplemented all this by the creditable statements that Nate had turned twenty-one , had cast his vote , and had a right to a choice at the Cross-roads . Then she chirruped to the rawboned sorrel mare , and jogged off down the road , followed by the frisky colt , whose long , slender legs when in motion seemed so fragile that it was startling to witness the temerity with which he kicked up his frolicsome heels . The dogs , with that odd canine affectation of having just perceived the intruders , pursued them with sudden asperity , barking and snapping , and at last came trotting nimbly home , wagging their tails and with a dutiful mien . Mrs. Dicey went back into the house , and sat for a time in envious meditation , fairly silenced , and with her apron flung over her face . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life for nothing , and it would take so little to make the family comfortable , and that her children seemed " disabled somehow in thar heads , an ' though always rootin ' around in the woods , hed never fund no gold mine nor nuthin ' else out o ' the common . " Birt kept silent , but the gloom and trouble in his face suddenly touched her heart . " Thar now , Birt ! " she exclaimed , with a world of consolation in her tones , " I do n't mean ter say that , nuther . Ai n't I a-thinkin ' day an ' night o ' how smart ye be -- stiddy an ' sensible an ' hard-workin ' jes ' like a man -- an ' what a good son ye hev been to me ! An ' the t' other chill'n air good too , an ' holps me powerful , though Rufe air hendered some , by the comical natur o ' the critter . " She broke out with a cheerful laugh , in which Birt could not join . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , kneeling down on the hearth , and uncovering the embers which had been kept all night under the ashes . " Do n't ye fret , sonny . I ai n't goin ' ter grudge Nate his gold mine . I reckon sech a good son ez ye be , an ' a gold mine too , would be too much luck fur one woman . Do n't ye fret , sonny . " Birt 's self-control gave way abruptly . He rose in great agitation , and started toward the door . Then he paused , and broke forth with passionate incoherence , telling amidst sobs and tears the story of the woodland 's munificence to him , and how he had flung the gift away . In recounting the hopes that had deluded him , the fears that had gnawed , and the despair in which they were at last merged , he did not notice , for a time , her look as she still knelt motionless before the embers on the hearth . He faltered , and grew silent ; then stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face had blanched ; its lines were as sharp and distinct as if graven in stone ; only her eyes spoke , an eloquent anguish . Her faculties were numbed for a moment . But presently there was a quiver in her chin , and her voice rang out . And yet did she understand ? did she realize the loss of the mine ? For it was not this that she lamented " Birt Dicey ! " she cried in an appalled tone . " Did ye hide it from yer MOTHER -- an ' tell NATE GRIGGS ? " Birt hung his head . The folly of it ! " What ailed ye , ter hide it from me ? " she asked deprecatingly , holding out her worn , hard-working hands . " Hev I ever done ye harm ? " " Nuthin ' but good . " " Do n't everybody know a boy 's mother air bound ter take his part agin all the worl ' ? " " Everybody but me , " said the penitent Birt . " What ailed ye , ter hide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " I ' lowed ye would n't want me ter go pardners with Nate , " he said drearily . " I reckon I would n't ! " she admitted . " Ye always said he war a snake in the grass . " " He hev proved that air a true word . " " I wisht I hed n't tole him ! " cried Birt vainly . " I wisht I hed n't . " He watched her with moody eyes as she rose at last with a sigh and went mechanically about her preparations for breakfast . There was a division between them . He felt the gulf widening . " I jes ' wanted it fur you-uns , ennyhow , " he said , defending his motives . " I ' lowed as I mought make enough out'n it ter buy a horse . " " I hai n't got time ter sorrow ' bout'n no gold mine , " she said loftily . " I used ter believe ye set a heap o ' store by yer mother , an ' war willin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through mighty hard times together . But ye don't -- I reckon ye never did . I hev los ' mo ' than enny gold mine . " And this sorrow for a vanished faith resolved itself into tears with which she salted her humble bread . CHAPTER VIII . If she had had any relish for triumph , she might have found it in Birt 's astonishment to learn that she understood all the details of entering land , which had been such a mystery to him . " ' Twar the commonest thing in the worl ' , whenst I war young , ter hear ' bout'n folks enterin ' land , " she said . " But nowadays thar ai n't no talk ' bout'n it sca'cely , ' kase the best an ' most o ' the land in the State hev all been tuk up an ' entered -- 'ceptin ' mebbe a trac ' , hyar an ' thar , full o ' rock , an ' so steep ' t ai n't wuth payin ' the taxes on . " Simple as she was , she could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hung about the house later than was his wont , bringing in the store of wood for her work during the day , and " packing " the water from the spring , with the impulse in his attention to these little duties to make what amends he might . When at last he started for the tanyard , he knew by the sun that he was long over-due . He walked briskly along the path through the sassafras and sumach bushes , on which the rain-drops still clung . He was presently brushing them off in showers , for he had begun to run . It occurred to him that this was no time to seem even a trifle remiss in his work at the tanyard . Since he had lost all his hopes down the ravine , the continuance of Jube Perkins 's favor and the dreary routine with the mule and the bark-mill were his best prospects . It would never do to offend the tanner now . " With sech a pack o ' chill'n ter vittle ez we-uns hev got at our house , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view of the tanyard , he noticed instantly that it did not wear its usual simple , industrial aspect . A group of excited men were standing in front of the shed , one of them gesticulating wildly . And running toward the bars came Tim Griggs , panting and white- faced , and exclaiming incoherently at the sight of Birt . " Oh , Birt , " he cried , " I war jes ' startin ' to yer house after you- uns ; they tole me to go an ' fetch ye . Fur massy 's sake , gim me Nate 's grant . I 'm fairly afeared o ' him . He 'll break every bone I own . " He held out his hand . " Gim me the grant ! " " Nate 's grant ! " exclaimed Birt aghast . " I hai n't got it ! I hai n't " - He paused abruptly . He could not say that he had not touched it . Tim 's wits were sharpened by the keen anxiety of the crisis . He noticed the hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly . " Ye know ye hev been foolin ' with it . Ye know ' twar you-uns ! " He changed to sudden appeal . " Do n't put the blame off on me , Birt , " he pleaded . " I 'm fairly afeared o ' Nate . " " Ai n't the grant in the pocket o ' his coat -- whar ye left it hangin ' on a peg in the shed ? " asked Birt , dismayed . " Naw -- naw ! " exclaimed Tim , despairingly . " He missed his coat this mornin ' , bein ' the weather war cooler , an ' then the grant , an ' he sent me after it . An ' I fund the coat a-hangin ' thar on the peg , whar I hed lef ' it , bein ' ez I furgot it when I went off with Rufe ter look at his chickens , an ' the pocket war empty an ' the paper gone ! Nate hev kem ter sarch , too ! " Once more he held out his hand . " Gim me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuk it , bein ' ez I lef ' it hyar . " Birt flushed angrily . " I 'll say a word ter Nate Griggs ! " he declared . And he pushed past the trembling Tim , and took his way briskly into the tanyard . There was a vague murmur in the group as he approached , and Nate Griggs came out from its midst , nodding his head threateningly . His hat , thrust far back on his sandy hair , left in bold relief his long , thin face with its small eyes , which seemed now so close together that his glance had the effect of a squint . He scanned Birt narrowly . This was the first time the two had met since Birt 's ill-starred confidence there by the bark-mill . " What ails ye , ter ' low ez it air ME as hev got yer grant , Nate Griggs ? " Birt asked , steadily meeting the accusation . The excitement had impaired for the moment Nate Griggs 's cunning . " ' Kase , " he blurted out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine fust , an ' hev been a-tellin ' folks ' bout'n it . " " Prove it , " said Birt , in sudden elation . " Who war it I tole , an ' when ? " The sly Nathan caught his breath with a gasp . His craft had returned . Admit that to HIM Birt had divulged the discovery of the mine ! Confess , when ! This would invalidate the entry ! " Ye tole TIM , " Nate said shamelessly , " an ' ez ter when -- 'twar yestiddy evenin ' at the tanyard . Did n't he , Tim ? " And he whirled around to his younger brother for confirmation of this audacious and deliberate falsehood . The abject Tim -- poor tool !  - -  frightened and cowering , nodded to admit it . " Gim me the grant , Birt , " he faltered , helplessly . " I ought n't ter hev furgot it . " " Look-a-hyar , Birt , " said the tanner with a solemnity which the boy did not altogether understand , " gin Nate the grant . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badgered and growing nervous . " Tell him , then , ye never teched it . " Birt 's impulse was to adopt the word . But he had seen enough of falsehood . He had done with concealment . " I did tech it , " he said boldly , " but I hai n't got it . I put it back in the pocket o ' the coat . " Jube Perkins laid a sudden hand upon his collar . " ' Tai n't no use denyin ' it , Birt , " he said with the sharp cadence of dismay . " Gin the grant back ter Nate , an ' mebbe he wo n't go no furder ' bout'n it . Stealin ' a paper like that air a pen'tiary crime ! " Birt reeled under the word . He thought of his mother , the children . He had a bitter foretaste of the suspense , the fear , the humiliation . And he was helpless . For no one would believe him ! His head was in a whirl . He could not stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word here and there of what was said in the crowd . " His mother air a widder-woman , " remarked one of the group . " An ' she air mighty poor . " Andy Byers was laughing cynically . Absorbed though he was , Birt experienced a subacute wonder that any one could feel so bitterly toward him as to laugh at a moment like this . How had he made Andy Byers his enemy ! Nobody noticed it , for Nate was swaggering about in the crowd , enjoying this conspicuous opportunity to display all the sophistications he had acquired in his recent trip to Sparta . He was calling upon them to witness that he did not care for the loss of the grant -- the PAPER was nothing to him !  - -  for it was on record in the land office , and he could get a certified copy from the register in no time at all . But his rights were his RIGHTS !  - -  and ten thousand Diceys should not trample on them . Birt had doubtless thought , being ignorant , that he could destroy the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was law in the State , he should suffer for it . And after this elaborate rodomontade , Nate strode out of the tanyard , with the obsequious Tim following humbly . Birt told his story again and again , to satisfy curious questioners during the days that ensued . And when he had finished they would look significantly at one another , and chuckle incredulously . The tanner seemed to earnestly wish to befriend him , and urged him to confess . " The truth 's the only thing ez kin save ye , Birt . " " I 'm tellin ' the truth , " poor Birt would declare . Then Jube Perkins argued the question : " How kin ye expec ' ennybody ter b'lieve ye when ye say Tennessee purvented ye from takin ' the grant -- ennything the size o ' leetle Tennie , thar . " And he pointed at the little sister , who was perched upon the wood- pile munching an Indian peach . Somehow Birt did not accurately define the moral force which she had wielded , for he was untaught , and clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Jube Perkins was hardly fitted to understand that subtle coercion of affection . When he found that Birt would only reiterate that Tennie " kem along unbeknown an ' purvented " him , Jube Perkins gave up the effort at last , convinced of his guilt . And Andy Byers said that he was not surprised , for he had known for some little time that Birt was a " most MISCHIEVIOUS scamp . " Only his mother believed in him , requiting his lack of confidence in her with a fervor of faith in him that , while it consoled , nevertheless cut him to the heart . It has been many years since then , for all this happened along in the fifties , but Birt has never forgotten how staunchly she upheld him in every thought when all the circumstances belied him . Now that misfortune had touched him , every trace of her caustic moods had disappeared ; she was all gentleness and tenderness toward him . And day by day as he went to his work , meeting everywhere a short word , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne up , save for the knowledge of that loyal heart at home . He was momently in terror of arrest , and he often pondered on Nate 's uncharacteristic forbearance . Perhaps Nate was afraid that Birt 's story , told from the beginning in court , might constrain belief and affect the validity of the entry . Birt vainly speculated , too , upon the strange disappearance of the grant . There it was in the pocket of the coat late that night , and the next morning early -- gone ! Sometimes he suspected that Nate had only made a pretense of losing the grant , in order to accuse him and prejudice public opinion against him , so that he might not be believed should he claim the discovery of the mineral down the ravine . His mother sought to keep him from dwelling upon his troubles . " We wo n't cross the bredge till we git thar , " she said . " Mebbe thar ai n't none ahead . " But her fears for his sake tortured her silent hours when he was away . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a bright fire , a good supper , and cheerful words as well , although these were the most difficult to prepare . The dogs bounded about him , Tennessee clung to his hand , the boys were hilarious and loud . By reason of their mother 's silence on the subject , that Birt might be better able to go , and work , and hold up his head among the men who suspected him , the children for a time knew nothing of what had happened . Now Rufe , although his faults were many and conspicuous , was not lacking in natural affection . Had he understood that a cloud overhung Birt , he could not have been so merry , so facetious , so queerly and quaintly bad as he was on his visits to the tanyard , which were peculiarly frequent just now . If Birt had had the heart for it , he might have enjoyed some of Rufe 's pranks at the expense of Andy Byers . The man had once found a sort of entertainment in making fun of Rufe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . At this time , however , Byers suddenly became the gravest of men . He took little notice of the wiles of his elfish antagonist , and whenever he fell into a snare devised by Rufe , he was irritable for a moment , and had forgotten it the next . He had never a word or glance for Birt , who marveled at his conduct . He seemed perpetually brooding upon some perplexity . Occasionally in the midst of his work he would stand motionless for five minutes , the two-handled knife poised in his grasp , his eyes fixed upon the ground , his shaggy brows heavily knitted , his expression doubting , anxious . The tanner commented upon this inactivity , one day . " Hev ye tuk root thar , Andy ? " he asked . Byers roused himself with a start . " Naw , " he replied reflectively , " but I hev been troubled in my mind some , lately , an ' I gits ter studyin ' powerful wunst in a while . " As he bent to his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched over the wooden horse , he added , " I hev got so ez I ca n't relish my vittles sca'cely , bein ' so tormented in my mind , an ' my sleep air plumb broke up ; ' pears like ter me as I hev got a reg'lar gift fur the nightmare . " " Been skeered by old Mis ' Price 's harnt lately ? " Rufe asked suddenly from his perch upon the wood-pile . Byers whirled round abruptly , fixing an astonished gaze upon Rufe , unmindful that the knife slipped from his grasp , and fell clanking upon the ground . CHAPTER IX . This grave , eager gaze Rufe returned with the gayest audacity . " Been skeered by old Mis ' Price 's harnt lately ? " he once more chirped out gleefully . He was comical enough , as he sat on the top of the wood-pile , hugging his knees with both arms , his old , bent , wool hat perched on the back of his tow head , and all his jagged squirrel teeth showing themselves , unabashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he looked at him . Then , with that indulgence which Rufe always met at the tanyard , and which served to make him so pert and forward , the tanner said , humoring the privileged character , " What be you-uns a-talkin ' ' bout , boy ? Mrs. Price ai n't dead . " " HE hev viewed old Mis ' Price 's harnt , " cried Rufe , pointing at Andy Byers , with a jocosely crooked finger . " HE air so peart an ' forehanded a-viewin ' harnts , he do n't hev to wait till folkses be dead . HE hev seen Mis ' Price 's harnt -- an ' it plumb skeered the wits out'n him . " Perkins did not understand this . His interest was suddenly alert . He took his pipe from his mouth , and glanced over his shoulder at Byers . " What air Rufe aimin ' at , Andy ? " he asked , surprised . Byers did not reply . He still gazed steadfastly at Rufe ; the knife lay unheeded on the ground at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last he said slowly , " Birt tole ye ' bout'n it , eh ? " " Naw , sir ! Naw ! " Rufe rocked himself fantastically to and fro in imminent peril of toppling off the wood-pile . " ' Twar Tom Byers ez tole me . " " TOM ! " exclaimed Byers , with a galvanic start . For Tom was his son , and he had not suspected filial treachery in the matter of the spectral blackberry bush . Rufe stared in his turn , not comprehending Byers 's surprise . " TOM , " he reiterated presently , with mocking explicitness . " Tom Byers -- I reckon ye knows him . That thar freckled-faced , snaggled- toothed , red-headed Tom Byers , ez lives at yer house . I reckon ye MUS ' know him . " " Tom tole ye -- WHAT ? " asked the tanner , puzzled by Byers 's grave , anxious face , and Rufe 's mysterious sneers . Rufe broke into the liveliest cackle . " Tom , he ' lowed ter me as he war tucked up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home from old Mis ' Price 's house , whar he had been ter hear her las ' words . Tom , he ' lowed he war dreamin ' ez his gran'dad hed gin him a calf -- Tom say the calf war spotted red an ' white -- an ' jes ' as he war a-leadin ' it home with him , his dad kem racin ' inter the house with sech a rumpus as woke him up , an ' he never got the calf along no furder than the turn in the road . An ' thar sot his dad in the cheer , declarin ' fur true ez he hed seen old Mis ' Price 's harnt in the woods , an ' b'lieved she mus ' be dead afore now . An ' though thar war a right smart fire on the h'a'th , he war shiverin ' an ' shakin ' over it , jes ' the same as ef he war out at the wood-pile , pickin ' up chips on a frosty mornin ' . " And Rufe crouched over , shivering in every limb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling chip-picker under stress of weather . " My ! " he exclaimed with a fresh burst of laughter ; " whenst Tom tole me ' bout'n it I war so tickled I war feared I 'd fall . I los ' the use o ' my tongue . I could n't stop laffin ' long enough ter tell Tom what I war laffin ' at . An ' as Tom knowed I war snake-bit las ' June , he went home an ' tole his mother ez the p'ison hed done teched me in the head , an ' said he reckoned , ef the truth war knowed , I hed fits ez a constancy . I say -- FITS ! " Once more the bewildered tanner glanced from one to the other . " Why , ye never tole me as ye hed seen su'thin ' strange in the woods , Andy , " he exclaimed , feeling aggrieved , thus balked of a sensation . " An ' the old woman ai n't dead , nohow , " he continued reasonably , " but air strengthenin ' up amazin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hastening to explain this discrepancy in the spectre , " I hearn you-uns a-sayin ' that mornin ' , fore ye set out from the tanyard , ez she war mighty nigh dead an ' would be gone ' fore night . An ' ez he hed tole me he 'd skeer the wits out'n me , I ' lowed as I could show him ez his wits war n't ez tough as mine . Though , " added the roguish Rufe , with a grin of enjoyment , " after I hed dressed up the blackberry bush in mam 's apron an ' shawl , an ' sot her bonnet a-top , it tuk ter noddin ' and bowin ' with the wind , an ' looked so like folks , ez it gin ME a skeer , an ' I jes ' run home ez hard ez I could travel . An Towse , he barked at it ! " Andy Byers spoke suddenly . " Waal , Birt holped ye , then . " " He never ! " cried Rufe , emphatically , unwilling to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Birt du n no nuthin ' ' bout it ter this good day . " Rufe winked slyly . " Birt would tell mam ez I hed been a-foolin ' with her shawl an ' bonnet . " Andy Byers still maintained a most incongruous gravity . " It war n't Birt 's doin ' , at all ? " he said interrogatively , and with a pondering aspect . Jubal Perkins broke into a derisive guffaw . " What ails ye , Andy ? " he cried . " Though ye never seen no harnt , ye ' pear ter be fairly witched by that thar tricked-out blackberry bush . " Rufe shrugged up his shoulders , and began to shiver in imaginary terror over a fancied fire . " Old -- Mis '  -- Price's -- harnt ! " he wheezed . The point of view makes an essential difference . Jube Perkins thought Rufe 's comicality most praiseworthy -- his pipe went out while he laughed . Byers flushed indignantly . " Ye aggervatin ' leetle varmint ! " he cried suddenly , his patience giving way . He seized the crouching mimic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock him off the wood-pile , as Rufe afterward declared , he assisted the small boy through the air with a celerity that caused Rufe to wink very fast and catch his breath , when he was deposited , with a shake , on the soft pile of ground bark some yards away . Rufe was altogether unhurt , but a trifle subdued by this sudden aerial excursion . The fun was over for the present . He gathered himself together , and went demurely and sat down on the lowest log of the wood-pile . After a little he produced a papaw from his pocket , and by the manner in which they went to work upon it , his jagged squirrel teeth showed that they were better than they looked . Towse had followed his master to the tanyard , and was lying asleep beside the woodpile , with his muzzle on his forepaws . He roused himself suddenly at the sound of munching , and came and sat upright , facing Rufe , and eyeing the papaw gloatingly . He wagged his tail in a beguiling fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course he would not have relished the papaw , and only begged as a matter of habit or perhaps on principle ; but he was given no opportunity to sample it , for Rufe hardly noticed him , being absorbed in dubiously watching Andy Byers , who was once more at work , scraping the hide with the two-handled knife . Jubal Perkins had gone into the house for a coal to re-kindle his pipe , for there is always a smouldering fire in the " smoke-room " for the purpose of drying the hides suspended from the rafters . He came out with it freshly glowing , and sat down on the broad , high pile of wood . As the first whiff of smoke wreathed over his head , he said , " What air the differ ter ye , Andy , whether ' t war bub , hyar , or Birt , ez dressed up the blackberry bush ? ye ' pear ter make a differ a-twixt ' em . " Still Byers was evasive . " Whar 's Birt , ennyhow ? " he demanded irrelevantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain constraint , " I hed been promisin ' Birt a day off fur a right smart while , an ' I tole him ez he mought ez well hev the rest o ' ter-day . He ' lowed as he war n't partic'lar ' bout a day off , now . But I tole him ennyhow ter go along . I seen him a while ago passin ' through the woods , with his rifle on his shoulder -- gone huntin ' , I reckon . " " GONE HUNTIN ' ! " ejaculated Rufe in dudgeon , joining unceremoniously in the conversation of his elders . " Now , Birt mought hev let me know ! I 'd hev wanted ter go along too . " " Mebbe that air the reason he never tole ye , bub , " said Perkins dryly . For he could appreciate that Rufe 's society was not always a boon , although he took a lenient view of the little boy . Any indulgence of Birt was more unusual , and Andy Byers experienced some surprise to hear of the unwonted sylvan recreations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off duty too , grazing among the bushes just beyond the fence , and hobbled so that he could not run away . This precaution might have seemed a practical joke on the mule , for the poor old animal was only too glad to stand stock still . Rufe continued his exclamatory indignation . " Jes ' ter go lopin ' off inter the woods huntin ' , ' thout lettin ' ME know ! An ' I never gits ter go huntin ' nohow ! An ' mam wo n't let me tech Birt 's rifle , ' thout it air ez empty ez a gourd ! She say she air feared I 'll shoot my head off , an ' she do n't want no boys , ' thout heads , jouncin ' round her house -- shucks ! Which way did Birt take , Mister Perkins ?  - -  'kase I be goin ' ter ketch up . " " He war headed fur that thar salt lick , whenst I las ' seen him , " replied the tanner ; " ef ye stir yer stumps right lively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitately . Towse , believing his petition for the papaw was about to be rewarded , leaped up too , gamboling with a display of ecstasy that might have befitted a starving creature , and an elasticity to be expected only of a rubber dog . As he uttered a shrill yelp of delight , he sprang up against Rufe , who , reeling under the shock , dropped the remnant of the papaw . Towse darted upon it , sniffed disdainfully , and returned to his capers around Rufe , evidently declining to believe that all that show of gustatory satisfaction had been elicited only by the papaw , and that Rufe had nothing else to eat . Thus the two took their way out of the tanyard ; and even after they had disappeared , their progress through the underbrush was marked by an abnormal commotion among the leaves , as the saltatory skeptic of a dog insisted on more substantial favors than the succulent papaw . The tanner smoked for a time in silence . Then , " Birt ai n't goin ' ter be let ter work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaggy eyebrows in surprise . " Ye see , " said the tanner in a confidential undertone , " sence Birt hev stole that thar grant , I kin argufy ez he mought steal su'thin ' else , an ' I ai n't ekal ter keepin ' up a spry lookout on things , an ' bein ' partic'lar ' bout the count o ' the hides an ' sech . I ca n't feel easy with sech a mischeevious scamp around . " Byers made no rejoinder , and the tanner , puffing his pipe , vaguely watched the wreaths of smoke rise above his head , and whisk buoyantly about in the air , and finally skurry off into invisibility . A gentle breeze was astir in the woods , and it set the leaves to whispering . The treetoads and the locusts were trolling a chorus . So loudly vibrant , it was ! So clamorously gay ! Some subtle intimation they surely had that summer was ephemeral and the season waning , for the burden of their song was , Let us now be merry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead boughs of a chestnut-oak , which , with its clinging lichens of green and gray , was boldly projected against the azure sky . And there , the filmy moon , most dimly visible in the afternoon sunshine , swung like some lunar hallucination among the cirrus clouds . " Ye ' lows ez I ai n't doin ' right by Birt ? " the tanner suggested presently , with more conscience in the matter than one would have given him credit for possessing . " I knows ye air doin ' right , " said Byers unexpectedly . All at once the woodpecker was solemnly tapping -- tapping . Byers glanced up , as if to discern whence the sudden sound came , and once more bent to his work . " Ye b'lieves , then , ez he stole that thar grant from Nate Griggs ? " asked Perkins . " I be SURE he done it , " said Byers , unequivocally . The tanner took his pipe from his lips . " What ails ye ter say that , Andy ? " he exclaimed excitedly . Andy Byers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the blunt , curved blade of the two-handled knife . " Ye 'll keep the secret ? " " In the sole o ' my boot , " said the tanner . " Waal , I KNOWS ez Birt stole the grant . I hev been powerful changeful , though , in my thoughts bout'n it . At fust I war glad when he war suspicioned ' bout'n it , an ' I war minded to go an ' inform on him an ' sech , ter pay him back ; ' kase I held a grudge ag'in him , believin ' as he hed dressed out that thar blackberry bush ez Mrs. Price 's harnt . An ' then I 'd remember ez his mother war a widder-woman , an ' he war nothin ' but a boy , an ' boys air bound ter be gamesome an ' full o ' jokes wunst in a while , an ' I 'd feel like I war bound ter furgive him ' bout the harnt . An ' then ag'in I got toler'ble oneasy fur fear the Law mought hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime of stealin ' the grant an ' yit not tellin ' on him . An ' I 'd take ter hopin ' an ' prayin ' the boy would confess , so ez I would n't hev ter tell on him . I hev been mightily pestered in my mind lately with sech dilly-dallyin ' . " Again the sudden tapping of the woodpecker filled the pause . " Did ye SEE him steal the grant , Andy ? " asked the tanner , with bated breath . " Ez good as seen him . I seen him slyin ' round , an ' I HEV FUND THE PLACE WHAR HE HEV HID IT . " And the woodpecker still was solemnly tapping , high up in the chestnut-oak tree . CHAPTER X. Birt , meanwhile , was trudging along in the woods , hardly seeing where he went , hardly caring . He had not had even a vague premonition when the tanner told him that he might have the rest of the day off . He did not now want the holiday which would once have so rejoiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tanner , making the disclosure by degrees , being truly sorry to part with the boy , intimated that he need come back no more . Birt unharnessed the mule by the sense of touch and the force of habit , for blinding tears intervened between his vision and the rusty old buckles and worn straps of leather . The animal seemed to understand that something was amiss , and now and then turned his head interrogatively . Somehow Birt was glad to feel that he left at least one friend in the tanyard , albeit the humblest , for he had always treated the beast with kindness , and he was sure the mule would miss him . When he reached home he loitered for a time outside the fence , trying to nerve himself to witness his mother 's distress . And at last his tears were dried , and he went in and told her the news . It was hard for him nowadays to understand that simple mother of his . She did nothing that he expected . To be sure her cheek paled , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled so that she carefully put down upon the table a dish which she had been wiping . But she said quite calmly , " Waal , sonny , I du n no but ye hed better take a day off from work , sure enough , an ' go a-huntin ' . Thar 's yer rifle , an ' mebbe ye 'll git a shot at a deer down yander by the lick . The chill'n haint hed no wild meat lately , ' ceptin ' squir'ls out'n Rufe 's trap . " And then he began to cry out bitterly that nobody would give him work , and they would all starve ; that the tanner believed he had stolen the grant , and was afraid to have him about the hides . " ' Tai n't no differ ez long as ' tai n't the truth , " said his mother philosophically . " We-uns will jes ' abide by the truth . " He repeated this phrase over and over as he struggled through the tangled underbrush of the dense forest . It was all like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the truth ! How he blessed the little sister that her love for him and his love for her had come between him and crime at that moment of temptation . " So powerful peart ! " he muttered with glistening eyes , as he thought of her . The grant was gone , to be sure ; but he did not take it . They accused him -- and falsely ! It was something to be free and abroad in the woods . He heard the wind singing in the pines . Their fine , penetrating aroma pervaded the air , and the rusty needles , covering the ground , muffled his tread . Once he paused -- was that the bleat of a fawn , away down on the mountain 's slope ? He heard no more , and he walked on , looking about with his old alert interest . He was refreshed , invigorated , somehow consoled , as he went . O wise mother ! he wondered if she foresaw this when she sent him into the woods . He had not before noted how the season was advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark green foliage , leaves shone so vividly yellow that it seemed as if upon them some fascinated sunbeam had expended all its glamours . In a dusky recess he saw the crimson sumach flaring . And the distant blue mountains , and the furthest reaches of the azure sky , and the sombre depths of the wooded valley , and the sheeny splendors of the afternoon sun , and every incident of crag or chasm -- all appeared through a soft purple haze that possessed the air , and added an ideal embellishment to the scene . Down the ravine the " lick " shone with the lustre of a silver lakelet . He saw the old oak-tree hard by , with the historic scaffold among its thinning leaves , and further along the slope were visible vague bobbing figures , which he recognized as the " Griggs gang , " seeking upon the mountain side the gold which he had discovered . Suddenly he heard a light crackling in the brush ,  - -  a faint footfall . It reminded him of the deer-path close at hand . He crouched down noiselessly amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed on the point where the path disappeared in the bushes , and where he would first catch a glimpse of the approaching animal . He heard the step again . His finger was trembling on the trigger , when down the path leisurely walked an old gentleman attired in black , a hammer in his hand , and a pair of gleaming spectacles poised placidly upon the bridge of an intellectual Roman nose . And this queer game halted in the middle of the deer-path , all unconscious of his deadly danger . It was a wonder that the rifle was not discharged , for the panic- stricken Birt had lost control of his muscles , and his convulsive finger was still quivering on the trigger as he trembled from head to foot . He hardly dared to try to move the gun . For a moment he could not speak . He gazed in open-mouthed amazement at the unsuspecting old gentleman , who was also unaware of the far more formidable open mouth of the rifle . " Now , ai n't ye lackin ' fur head-stuffin ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The startled old man jumped , with the most abrupt alacrity . In fact , despite his age and the lack of habit , he bounded as acrobatically from the ground as the expected deer could have done . He was , it is true , a learned man ; but science has no specific for sudden fright , and he jumped as ignorantly as if he did not know the difficult name of any of the muscles that so alertly exercised themselves on this occasion . Birt rose at last to his feet and looked with a pallid face over the underbrush . " Now , ai n't ye lackin ' fur head-stuffin ' , " he faltered , " a-steppin ' along a deer-path ez nat'ral ez ef ye war a big fat buck ? I kem mighty nigh shootin ' ye . " The old gentleman recovered his equilibrium , mental and physical , with marvelous rapidity . " Ah , my young friend , "  - -  he motioned to Birt to come nearer ,  --  " I want to speak to you . " Birt stared . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman had expected to meet him here , whereas Birt had just had the best evidence of his senses that the encounter was a great surprise . The boy observed his interlocutor more carefully than he had yet been able to do . He remembered all at once Rufe 's queer story of meeting , down the ravine , an eccentric old man whom he was disposed to identify as Satan . As the stranger stood there in the deer-path , he looked precisely as Rufe had described him , even to the baffling glitter of his spectacles , his gray whiskers , and the curiously shaped hammer in his hand . Birt , although bewildered and still tremulous from the shock to his nerves , was not so superstitious as Rufe , and he shouldered his gun , and , pushing out from the tangled underbrush , joined the old man in the path . " I want , " said the gentleman , " to hire a boy for a few days -- weeks , perhaps . " He smiled with two whole rows of teeth that never grew where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger 's eyes , indistinguishable behind the spectacles that glimmered in the light . " What do you say to fifty cents a day ? " he continued briskly . Birt 's heart sank suddenly . He had heard that Satan traded in souls by working on the avarice of the victim . The price suggested seemed a great deal to Birt , for in this region there is little cash in circulation , barter serving all the ordinary purposes of commerce . As he hesitated , the old man eyed him quizzically . " Afraid of work , eh ? " " Naw , sir ! " said Birt , sturdily . Ah , if the bark-mill , and the old mule , and the tan-pit , and the wood-pile , and the cornfield might testify ! " Fifty cents a day -- eh ? " said the stranger . At the repetition of the sum , it occurred to Birt , growing more familiar with the eccentricity of his companion , that he ought not in sheer silliness to throw away a chance for employment . " Kin I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all means ask your mother , " replied the stranger heartily . Birt 's last fantastic doubt vanished . Oh no ! this was not Satan in disguise . When did the enemy ever counsel a boy to ask his mother ! Birt still stared gravely at him . All the details of his garb , manner , speech , even the hammer in his hand , were foreign to the boy 's experience . Presently he ventured a question . " Do you-uns hail from hyar- abouts ? " The stranger was frank and communicative . He told Birt that he was a professor of Natural Science in a college in one of the " valley towns , " and that he was sojourning , for his health 's sake , at a little watering-place some twelve miles distant on the bench of the mountain . Occasionally he made an excursion into the range , which was peculiarly interesting geologically . " But what I wish you to do is to dig for -- bones . " " BONES ? " faltered Birt . " Bones , " reiterated the professor solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely wondering what his mother would think of " bones . " Presently the professor , seeing that the boy was not likely to ask amusing questions , explained . He informed Birt that in the neighborhood of salt licks --  " saline quagmires " he called them -- were often found the remains of animals of an extinct species , which are of great value to science . He gave Birt the extremely long name of these animals , and descanted upon such conditions of their existence as is known , much of which Birt did not understand . Although this fact was very apparent , it did not in the least affect the professor 's ardor in the theme . He was in the habit of talking of these things to boys who did not understand , and alack ! to boys who did not want to understand . One point , however , he made very clear . With the hope of some such " find , " he was anxious to investigate this particular lick ,  - -  about which indeed he had heard a vague tradition of a " big bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this region ,  --  and for this purpose he proposed to furnish the science and the fifty cents per diem , and earnestly desired that some one else should furnish the muscle . He was accustomed to think much more rapidly than the men with whom Birt was associated , and his briskness in arranging the matter had an incongruous suggestion of the giddiness of youth . He said that he would go home with Birt to fetch the spade , and while there he could settle the terms with the boy 's mother , and then they could get to work . He started off at a dapper gait up the deer-path , while Birt , with his rifle on his shoulder , followed . A sudden thought struck Birt . He stopped short . " Now I du n no which side o ' that thar lick Nate Griggs 's line runs on , " he remarked . " Never mind , " said the professor , waving away objections with airy efficiency ; " I shall first secure the consent of the owner of the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't goin ' ter gin his cornsent ter nobody ter dig ennywhar down the ravine , ef it air inside o ' his lines , " he said confidently , " ' kase I -- 'kase he --  leastwise , ' kase gold hev been fund hyar lately , an ' he hev entered the land . " The professor stopped short in the path . " Gold ! " he ejaculated . " Gold ! " Was there a vibration of incredulity in his voice ? Birt remembered all at once the specimens which he had picked up that memorable evening , down the ravine , when he shot the red fox . Here they still were in his pocket . They showed lustrous , metallic , yellow gleams as he placed them carefully in the old man 's outstretched hand , telling how he came by them , of his mistaken confidence , the betrayed trust , and ending by pointing at the group of gold-seekers , microscopic in the distance on the opposite slope . " I hev hearn tell , " he added , " ez Nate air countin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hev got money , to work the gold mine . " Now and then , as he talked , he glanced up at his companion 's face , vaguely expecting to discover his opinion by its expression , but the light still played in a baffling glitter upon his spectacles . Birt could only follow when the professor suddenly handed back the specimens with a peremptory " Come -- come ! We must go for the spade . But when we reach your mother 's house I will test this mineral , and you shall see for yourself what you have lost . " Mrs. Dicey 's first impression upon meeting the stranger and learning of his mission was not altogether surprise as Birt had expected . Her chief absorption was a deep thankfulness that the floors all preserved their freshly scoured appearance . " Fur ef Rufe hed been playin ' round hyar ter-day , same ez common , the rubbish would have been a scandal ter the kentry , " she reflected . In fact , all was so neat , albeit so poor , that the stranger felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about employing Birt in his researches . Birt , however , had little disposition to listen to this . He was excited by the prospect of testing the mineral , and he busied himself with great alacrity in preparing for it under the professor 's directions . He suffered a qualm , it is true , as he pounded the shining fragments into a coarse powder , and then he drew out with the shovel a great glowing mass of live coals on the hearth . The dogs peered eagerly in at the door , having followed the stranger with the liveliest curiosity . Towse , bolder than the rest , entered intrepidly with a nonchalant air and a wagging tail , for he and Rufe , having failed to find Birt , had just returned home . The small boy paused on the threshold in amazed recognition of the old gentleman who had occasioned him such a fright that day down the ravine . The professor gesticulated a great deal as he bent over the fire and gave Birt directions , and , with his waving hands and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some fantastic sorcerer . Somehow Rufe was glad to see the familiar countenances of Pete and Joe , and was still more reassured to note that his mother was quietly standing beside the table , as she stirred the batter for bread in a wooden bowl . Tennessee had pressed close to Birt , her chubby hand clutching his collar as he knelt on the hearth . He held above the glowing coals a long fire shovel , on which the pulverized mineral had been placed , and his eyes were very bright as he earnestly watched it . " If it is gold , " said the old man , " a moderate heat will not affect it . " The shovel was growing hot . The live coals glowed beneath it . The breath of the fire stirred Tennessee 's flaxen hair . And Birt 's dilated eyes saw the yellow particles still glistening unchanged in the centre of the shovel , which was beginning to redden . CHAPTER XI . Suddenly -- was the glistening yellow mineral taking fire ? It began to give off sulphurous fumes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nate 's ill-gotten wealth -- ending in smoke ! The sulphurous odor grew stronger . Even Towse stopped short , and gazed at the shovel with a reprehensive sniff . " Ker-shoo ! " he sneezed . And commenting thus , he turned abruptly and went hastily out , with a startled look and a downcast tail . His sneeze seemed to break the spell of silence that had fallen on the little group . " It be mighty nigh bodaciously changed ter cinders ! " exclaimed Birt , staring in amaze at the lustreless contents of the shovel from which every suggestion of golden glimmer had faded . " What do it be , ef ' tai n't gold ? " " Iron pyrites , " said the professor . " ' Fools ' gold , ' it is often called . " He explained to Birt that in certain formations , however , gold is associated with iron pyrites , and when the mineral is properly roasted , this process serving to expel the sulphur , the fine particles of gold are found held in the resulting oxide of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravine he said was valueless , unless occurring in vast quantities , when it is sometimes utilized in the production of sulphur . " I wonder , " Birt broke out suddenly , " if the assayer wo n't find no gold in them samples ez Nate sent him . " The professor laughed . " The assayer will need the ' philosopher 's stone ' to find gold in any samples from this locality . " " Ye knowed then , all the time , ez this stuff war n't gold ? " asked Birt . " All the time , " rejoined the elder . " An ' Nate hev got the steepest , rockiest spot in the kentry ter pay taxes on , " resumed Birt , reflectively . " An ' he hev shelled out a power o ' money ter the surveyor , an ' sech , a'ready . I reckon he 'll be mightily outed when he finds out ez the min'ral ai n't gold . " Birt stopped short in renewed anxiety . That missing grant ! Somehow he felt sure that Nate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wreak his disappointment wherever he might ; and since the land was of so little value , he would not continue to deny himself his revenge for fear that an investigation into the priority of the mineral 's discovery might invalidate the entry . Once more Birt was tortured by the terror of arrest -- he might yet suffer a prosecution from malignity , which had hitherto been withheld from policy . If only the mystery of the lost grant could be solved ! The conversation of the elders had returned to the subject of the investigations around the " lick " and the terms for Birt 's services . As so much time had been consumed with the pyrites , the professor concluded with some vexation that they could hardly arrange all the preliminaries and get to work this afternoon . " I dare say we had best begin to-morrow morning , " he said at last . " Birt ca n't go a-diggin ' no-ways , this evenin ' , " put in the officious Rufe , who stood , according to his wont , listening with his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home by the tanyard Jube Perkins hollered ter me ter tell Birt ter come thar right quick . I furgot it till this minit , " he added , with a shade of embarrassment that might pass for apology . Birt felt a prophetic thrill . This summons promised developments of importance . Only a few hours ago he was discharged under suspicion of dishonesty ; why this sudden recall ? He did not know whether hope or fear was paramount . He trembled with eager expectancy . He seized his hat , and strode out of the house without waiting to hear more of the professor 's plans or the details of the wages . He had reached the fence before he discovered Tennessee close at his heels . He cast his troubled eyes down upon her , and met her pleading , upturned gaze . He was about to charge her to go back . But then he remembered how she had followed him with blessings -- how mercy had kept pace with her steps . He would not deny her the simple boon she craved , and if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient with her , since she loved him so ! He lifted her over the fence , and then started briskly down the path , the sturdy , light-footed little mountain girl delightedly trudging along in the rear . When he entered the tanyard no one was there except Jube Perkins and Andy Byers the tanner , lounging as usual on the wood-pile , and the workman , with scarcely less the aspect of idleness , dawdlingly scraping a hide on the wooden horse . Birt discerned a portent in the unwonted solemnity of their faces , and his heart sank . " Waal , Birt , we-uns hev been a-waitin ' fur ye , " said the tanner in a subdued , grave tone that somehow reminded Birt of the bated voices in a house of death . " Set down hyar on the wood-pile , fur Andy an ' me hev got a word ter say ter ye . " Birt 's dilated black eyes turned in dumb appeal from one to the other as he sank down on the wood-pile . His suspense gnawed him like an actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely at Andy Byers for a suggestion , being uncertain how to begin . " Waal , Birt , " he drawled at last , " ez yer dad is dead an ' ye hev got nobody ter see after ye an ' advise ye , Andy an ' me , we-uns agreed ez how we 'd talk ter ye right plain , an ' try ter git ye ter jedge o ' this hyar matter like we-uns do . Andy an ' me know more ' bout the law , an ' ' bout folks too , than ye does . These hyar Griggs folks hev always been misdoubted ez a fractious an ' contrary-wise fambly . Ef enny Griggs ai n't aggervatin ' an ' captious , it air through bein ' plumb terrified by the t'others . They air powerful hard folks -- an ' they 'll land ye in the State Prison yet , I 'm thinkin ' . I wonder they hai n't started at ye a'ready . But thar 's no countin ' on ' em , ' ceptin ' that they 'll do all they kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That air a true word , Birt , " said Andy Byers , speaking to the boy for the first time in many days . " Ef they hev thar reason fur it , they mought hold thar hand fur a time , but fust or las ' they 'll hev all out'n ye ez the law will allow ' em . " Birt listened in desperation . All this was sharpened by the certainty that the mineral was only valueless pyrites , and the prescience of Nate 's anger when this fact should come to his knowledge , and prudence no longer restrain him . His rage would vent itself on his luckless victim for every cent , every mill , that the discovery of the " fools ' gold " had cost him . " They 'll be takin ' ye away from the mountings ter jail ye an ' try ye , an ' mebbe ye 'll go ter the pen'tiary after that . An ' how will yer mother , an ' brothers , an ' sister , git thar vittles , an ' firewood , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the oldest child , after you-uns ? " demanded the tanner . " An ' even when ye git back -- I hate ter tell ye this word -- nobody will want ye round . They 'll be feared ye 'd be forever pickin ' an ' stealin ' . " " But we-uns will stand up fur ye , bein ' ez ye air the widder 's son , " said Byers eagerly . " We-uns will gin the Griggs tribe ter onderstand that . " " An ' mebbe the Griggses wo n't want ter do nuthin ' , ef they hai n't got no furder cause fur holdin ' a grudge , " put in the tanner . " What be ye a-layin ' off fur me ter do ? " asked Birt wonderingly . " Ter gin Nate 's grant back ter him , " they both replied in a breath . " I hev not got it ! " cried poor Birt tumultuously . " I never stole it ! I du n no whar it be ! " The tanner 's expression changed from paternal kindliness to contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bein ' a liar , Birt , ez well ez a thief ? " he said sternly . " I du n no whar it be , " reiterated Birt desperately . " I know whar it be , " said Byers . Birt gazed at him astounded . " Whar ? " he cried eagerly . " Whar ye hid it , " returned Byers coolly . Birt 's lips moved with difficulty as he huskily ejaculated " I never hid it -- I never ! " " Ye need n't deny it . I ez good as seen ye hide it . " Birt looked dazed for a moment . Then the blood rushed to his face and as suddenly receded , leaving it pale and rigid . He was cold and trembling . He could not speak . The tanner scrutinized him narrowly . Then he said , " Tell him ' bout it , Andy . Tell him jes ' ez ye tole me . An ' mebbe he 'll hev sense enough ter gin it up when he sees he air fairly caught . " " Waal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke- house , and holding the knife idly poised in his hand , " I kem down ter the tanyard betimes that mornin ' after the storm . Both ye an ' Birt war late . I noticed Nate Griggs 's coat hangin ' thar in the shed , with a paper stickin ' out'n the pocket , ez I started inter the smoke-house ter tend ter the fire . I reckon I mus ' hev made consider'ble racket in thar , ' kase I never hearn nuthin ' till I sot down afore the fire on a log o ' wood , an ' lit my pipe . All of a suddenty thar kem a step outside , toler'ble light on the tan . I jes ' ' lowed ' t war ye or Birt . But I happened ter look up , an ' thar I see a couple o ' big black eyes peepin ' through that thar crack in the wall . " He turned and pointed out a crevice where the " daubin ' " had fallen from the " chinkin ' " between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ez this hyar crack air jes ' the height o ' Birt . Waal , them eyes lookin ' in so onexpected did n't ' sturb me none . I hev knowed the Dicey eye fur thirty year , an ' thar ai n't none like ' em nowhar round the mountings . But I ' lowed ' t war toler'ble sassy in Birt ter stand thar peerin ' at me through the chinkin ' . I never let on , though , ez I viewed him . An ' then , them eyes jes ' set up sech a outdacious winkin ' an ' wallin ' , an ' squinchin ' , ez I knowed he war makin ' faces at me . So I jes ' riz up -- an ' the eyes slipped away from thar in a hurry . I war aimin ' ter larrup Birt fur his sass , but I stopped ter hang up a skin ez I hed knocked down . It never tuk me long , much , but when I went out , thar war n't nobody ter be seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden horse , and he leaned forward with a reflective expression , his elbow on his knee , and his hand holding his bearded chin . The afternoon was waning . The scarlet sun in magnified splendor was ablaze low down in the saffron west . The world seemed languorously afloat in the deep , serene flood of light . Shadows were lengthening slowly . The clangor of a cow-bell vibrated in the distance . The drone of Andy Byers 's voice overbore it as he recommenced . " Waal , I was sorter conflusticated , an ' I looked round powerful sharp ter see whar Birt hed disappeared to . I happened ter cut my eye round at that thar pit ez he hed finished layin ' the tan in , an ' kivered with boards , an ' weighted with rocks that day ez ye an ' me hed ter go an ' attend on old Mrs. Price . Ye know we counted ez that thar pit would n't be opened ag'in fur a right smart time ? " The tanner nodded assent . " Waal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards war sot sorter catawampus , an ' I ' lowed as ' t war the wind ez hed ' sturbed it . Ez I stooped down ter move it back in its place , I seen su'thin ' white under it . So I lifted the board , an ' thar I see , lyin ' on the tan a-top o ' the pit , a stiff white paper . I looked round toward the shed , an ' thar hung the coat yit -- with nuthin ' in the pocket . I did n't know edzactly what ter make of it , an ' I jes ' shunted the plank back over the paper in the pit like I fund it , an ' waited ter see what mought happen . An ' all the time ez that thar racket war goin ' on bout'n the grant , I knowed powerful well whar ' t war , an ' who stole it . " Birt looked from one to the other of the two men . Both evidently believed every syllable of this story . It was so natural , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward it , too . Had he indeed , in some aberration , taken the grant ? Was it some tricksy spirit in his likeness that had peered through the chinking at Andy Byers ? He could find no words to contend further . He sat silent , numb , dumfounded . " Birt , " said the tanner coaxingly , " thar ai n't no use in denyin ' it enny mo ' . Let 's go an ' git that grant , an ' take it ter Nate an ' tell the truth . " The words roused Birt . He clutched at the idea of getting possession of the paper that had so mysteriously disappeared and baffled and eluded him . He could at least return it . And even if this should fail to secure him lenient treatment , he would feel that he had done right . He rose suddenly in feverish anxiety . Andy Byers and Perkins , exchanging a wink of congratulation , followed him to the pit . " It air under this hyar board , " said Byers , moving one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins pressed forward with eager curiosity , never having seen this famous grant . The ground bark on the surface was pretty dry , the layer being ten or fifteen inches thick , and the tanning infusion had not yet risen through it . Byers stared with a frown at the tan , and lifted another board . Nothing appeared beneath it on the smooth surface of the bark . In sudden alarm they took away the boards , one after another , till all were removed , and the whole surface of the pit was exposed . Then they looked at each other , bewildered . For once more the grant was gone . CHAPTER XII . Jubal Perkins broke the silence . " Andy Byers , " he exclaimed wrathfully , " what sort ' n tale is this ez ye air tryin ' ter fool me with ? " Byers , perturbed and indignant , was instantly ready to accuse Birt . " Ye hev been hyar an ' got the grant an ' sneaked it off agin , hev ye ! " he cried , scowling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope I may drap dead , Jube , " he said earnestly , " ef that grant war n't right hyar "  - -  he pointed at the spot --  " las ' night whenst I lef ' the tanyard . I always looked late every evenin ' ter be sure it hed n't been teched , thinkin ' I 'd make up my mind in the night whether I 'd tell on Birt , or no . But I never could git plumb sati'fied what to do . " His tone carried conviction . The tanner looked at Birt with disappointment in every line of his face . There was severity , too , in his expression . He was beginning to admit the fitness of harsh punishment in this case . " Ye do n't wuth all this gabblin ' an ' jawin ' over ye , ye miser'ble leetle critter , " he said . " An ' I ai n't goin ' ter waste another breath on ye . " Birt stood vacantly staring at the tan . All the energy of the truth was nullified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vague comment upon his silence , and then they too looked idly down at the pit . Tennessee abruptly caught Birt 's listless hand as it hung at his side , for Towse had suddenly entered the tanyard , and prancing up to her in joyous recognition , was trying to lick her face . " G'way , Towse , " she drawled gutturally . She struck vaguely at him with her chubby little fist , which he waggishly took between his teeth in a gingerly gentle grip . " Stand back thar , Tennessee , " Birt murmured mechanically . As usual , Towse was the precursor of Rufe , who presently dawdled out from the underbrush . He quickened his steps upon observing the intent attitude of the party , and as he came up he demanded vivaciously , " What ails that thar pit o ' yourn , Mister Perkins ?  --  thought ye said ' t war n't goin ' ter be opened ag'in fore-shortly . " For a moment the tanner made no reply . Then he drawled absently , " Nuthin ' ails the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of it , and gazed speculatively at it . Presently he began anew , unabashed by the silence of the grave and contemplative group . " This hyar tan hev got sorter moist atop now ; I wonder ef that thar grant o ' Nate 's got spi'led ennywise with the damp . " Birt winced . It had been a certain mitigation of his trouble that , thanks to his mother 's caution , the children at home knew nothing of the disgrace that had fallen upon him , and that there , at least , the atmosphere was untainted with suspicion . The next moment he was impressed by the singularity of Rufe 's mention of the missing grant and its place of concealment . " Look-a-hyar , Rufe , " he exclaimed , excitedly ; " how d'ye know ennything ' bout Nate 's grant an ' whar ' t war hid ? " Rufe glanced up scornfully , insulted in some occult manner by the question . " How did I know , Birt Dicey ? How d'ye know yerse'f ? " he retorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching the drift of Birt 's intention , came to the rescue . " Say , bub , how d'ye know the grant war ever put hyar ? " " Kase , " responded Rufe , more amicably , " I seen it put hyar -- right yander . " He indicated the spot where the paper lay , according to Byers , when it was discovered . Birt could hardly breathe . His anxieties , his hopes , his fears , seemed a pursuing pack before which he was almost spent . He panted like a hunted creature . Tennessee was swinging herself to and fro , holding by his hand . Sometimes she caught at Towse 's unlovely ear , as he sat close by with his tongue lolled out and an attentive air , as if he were assisting at the discussion . " Who put it thar , bub ? " demanded Perkins . It would not have surprised Birt , so perverse had been the course of events , if Rufe had accused him on the spot . " Pig-wigs Griggs , " replied Rufe , unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell ' bout it , Rufe , " said the tanner , suppressing all appearance of excitement . " Ye ai n't goin ' ter do nuthin ' ter Pig-wigs fur foolin ' with yer pit , ef I tell ye ? " asked Rufe , quickly . " Naw , bub , naw . Which Griggs do ye call ' Pig-wigs ? ' " " Why -- PIG-WIGS , " Rufe reiterated obviously . Then he explained . " He air Nate 's nevy . He air Nate 's oldest brother 's biggest boy ,  - -  though he ai n't sizable much . He air ' bout haffen ez big as me -- ef that , " he added reflectively , thinking that even thus divided he had represented Pig-wigs as more massive than the facts justified . " Ye see , " he continued , " one day when his uncle Tim war over hyar ter the tanyard , I gin him one o ' my game deedies ; an ' ez soon ez he got home he showed ' em all that thar deedie -- powerful , spryest poultry ye ever see ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An ' Pig-wigs war plumb DE-stracted fur a deedie too . An ' he run all the way over hyar ter git me ter gin him one . But the deedies hed all gone ter bed , an ' the old hen war hoverin ' of ' em , an ' I did n't want ter ' sturb ' em , " said Rufe considerately . " So I tole Pig-wigs ter meet me at the tanyard early , an ' I 'd fetch him one . An ' ez his granny war goin ' visitin ' her merried daughter , she let him ride behind her on thar sorrel mare ez fur ez the tanyard . So he got hyar ' fore I did . An ' I kem an ' gin him the deedie . " Rufe paused abruptly , as if , having narrated this important transaction , he had exhausted the interest of the subject . Byers was about to speak , but the tanner with a gesture repressed him . " Ye hai n't tole ' bout the pit an ' the grant yit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's display of impatience was not lost upon Rufe , and it added to the general acrimony of their relations . " Waal , " the small boy began alertly , " we-uns hed the deedie behind the smoke-house thar , an ' I seen HIM "  - -  Rufe pointed at Byers with disfavor --  " a-comin ' powerful slow inter the tanyard , an ' I whispered ter Pig-wigs Griggs ter be quiet , an ' not let HIM know ez we-uns war thar , ' kase he war always a-jawin ' at me , ' thout the tanner war by ter keep him off'n me . So we-uns bided thar till HE went inter the smoke-house . An ' then ez we-uns kem by the shed , Pig-wigs seen his uncle Nate 's coat hangin ' on a peg thar , ' kase that thar triflin ' Tim hed furgot , an ' lef ' it thar when he went ter see the deedies . An ' Pig-wigs Griggs , he ' lowed he knowed the coat war his uncle Nate 's by the favior of it , an ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant he hed hearn Nate talkin ' ' bout . An ' I whispered ter him ez he hed better ondertake ter tote it home ter Nate . An ' Pig-wigs said he could n't tote the coat , bein ' so lumbered up with the deedie . But he would tote the grant in one hand an ' the deedie in t' other . He could n't put the deedie in one o ' his pockets , ' kase his mother sews ' em all up , bein ' as he WOULD kerry sech a passel o ' heavy truck in ' em ,  - -  rocks an ' sech , reg'lar bowlders , " added Rufe , with a casual remembrance of the museum in his own pockets . " So Pig-wigs 's mother sewed ' em all up , ' kase she said they war tore out all the time , an ' she seen no sense in a boy hevin ' a lot o ' slits in his clothes ter let in the air slanchwise on him . An ' Pig-wigs ' lowed he 'd tote the grant ef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " How did you-uns reach up ter that thar peg ? " demanded Byers , pointing to the peg on which the coat had hung , far beyond Rufe 's reach . " Clumb up on the wooden horse , " said Rufe promptly . " I peeked through the chinkin ' an ' seen ye thar a-smokin ' yer pipe over the fire . " Rufe winked audaciously , suddenly convincing Byers as to the possessor of the big black eyes , which he had recognized as characteristic of the Dicey family , when they had peered through the chinking . " Waal , how did the grant git inter the pit , Rufe , an ' what hev become of it ? " asked Byers , overlooking these personalities , for he felt a certain anxiety in the matter , being the last person known to have seen the grant , which , by reason of his delay and indecision , had again been spirited away . " Pig-wigs put it thar , I tell ye , " reiterated Rufe . " Ye see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pig-wigs war a good ways behind , walkin ' toler'ble slow , bein ' as he hed ter kerry the grant in one hand an ' the deedie in t' other . An ' thar I see a-cropin ' along on the ground a young rabbit -- reg'lar baby rabbit . An ' I motioned ter Pig-wigs ter come quick -- I hed fund suthin ' . An ' as Pig-wigs could n't put the deedie down , he laid the grant on top o ' the boards ez kivered the pit . But the wind war brief , an ' kem mighty nigh blowin ' that grant away . So Pig-wigs jes ' stuck it down ' twixt two planks , an ' kem ter holp me ketch the rabbit . But Pig-wigs war n't no ' count ter holp . An ' the rabbit got away . An ' whilst Pig-wigs war foolin ' round , he drapped his deedie , an ' stepped on it -- tromped the life out'n it . " Rufe 's expression was of funereal gravity . " An ' then he follered me every foot o ' the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin him another . But I would n't . I wo n't gin no more o ' my deedies ter be tromped on , all round the mounting . " Rufe evidently felt that the line must be drawn somewhere . " An ' what hev gone with that thar grant ? ' T war hyar yestiddy . " " I du n no , " responded Rufe , carelessly . " Mebbe Pig-wigs reminded hisself ' bout'n it after awhile , an ' kem an ' got it . " This proved to be the case . For Andy Byers concerned himself enough in the matter to ride the old mule over to Nate 's home , to push the inquiries . Nate was just emerging from the door . The claybank mare , saddled and bridled , stood in front of the cabin . He was evidently about to mount . " Look-a-hyar , ye scamp ! " Byers saluted him gruffly , " why n't ye let we-uns know ez ye hed got back that thar grant o ' yourn , ez hev sot the whole mounting catawampus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ las ' , and tole ye ez he hed it , I s'pose ? " Nate affected to examine the saddle-girth . He looked furtively over the mare 's shoulder at Andy Byers . He could not guess how much of the facts had been developed . In sheer perversity he was tempted to deny that he had the grant . But Byers was a heavy man of scant patience , and he wore a surly air that boded ill to a trifler . Nate nodded admission . " Pig-wigs fotched it home , eh ? " demanded Byers , leaning downward . Once more Nate lifted his long , thin questioning face . His craft had no encouragement . " Ef ye be minded to call him ' Pig-wigs ' his right name air Benjymen -- 't war him as fotched it home . " " Now ye air a mighty cantankerous , quar'lsome , aggervatin ' critter ! " Byers broke out irritably . " Ai n't ye ' shamed o ' this hyar hurrah ye hev kicked up fur nuthin ' ? accusin ' o ' Birt wrongful , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shamed o ' nuthin ' ! " said Nate hardily , springing into the saddle . " I 'm a-ridin ' ter the SettleMINT ter git word from the assayer ' bout'n the gold ez I hev fund . An ' when I rides back I 'll be wuth more'n enny man in the mountings or Sparty either ! " And he gave the mare the whip , and left Andy Byers , with his mouth full of rebukes , sitting motionless on the dozing old mule . The mare came back from the Settlement late that night under lash and spur , at a speed she had never before made . Day was hardly astir when Nate Griggs , wild-eyed and haggard , appeared at the tanyard in search of Birt . He was loud with reproaches , for the assayer had pronounced the " gold " only worthless iron pyrites . He had received , too , a jeering letter from his proposed partner in Sparta , who had found sport in playing on his consequential ignorance and fancied sharpness . And now Nate declared that Birt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had from the first befooled him . In some way he would compel Birt to refund all the money that had been expended . How piteous was Nate as he stood and checked off , on his trembling fingers , the surveyor 's fee , the entry-taker 's fee , the register 's fee , the secretary of State 's fee , the assayer 's fee -- Oh , ruin , ruin ! And what had he to show for it ! a tract of crags and chasms and precipitous gravelly slopes and gullies worth not a mill an acre ! And this was all -- for the office of laughing-stock has no emoluments . Where was Birt ? He would hold Birt to account . Andy Byers , listening , thought how well it was for Birt that Nate no longer had the loss of the grant as a grievance . Perkins mysteriously beckoned Nate aside . " Nate , " he said in a low voice , " Birt air powerful mad ' bout that thar accusin ' him o ' stealin ' the grant , when ' t war some o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hed it all the time . I seen him goin ' ' long towards yer house a leetle while ago . I reckon he air lookin ' fur you . He hed that big cowhide , ez I gin him t' other day , in one hand . Ye jes ' take the road home , an ' ye 'll ketch up with him sure . " Nate 's wits were in disastrous eclipse . Could he deduce nothing from the tanner 's grin ? He spent the day at the Settlement without ostensible reason , and only at nightfall did he return home , and by a devious route , very different from that indicated by Jubal Perkins . Inquiry developed the fact that the boundaries of Nate 's land did not include the salt lick , and his talents as an obstructer were not called into play . The professor was free to dig as he chose for the antique bones he sought , and many a long day did he and Birt spend in this sequestered spot , with the great crags towering above and the darkling vistas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long stretch of sunny weather , and somehow that shifting purple haze accented all its languorous lustres . It seemed a vague sort of poetry a-loose in the air , and color had license . The law which decreed that a leaf should be green was a dead letter . How gallantly red and yellow they flared ; and others , how tenderly pink , and gray , and purplish of hue ! What poly-tinted fancies underfoot in the moss ! Strange visitants came from the north . Flocks of birds , southward bound , skimmed these alien skies . Sometimes they alighted on the tree-tops or along the banks of the torrent , chattering in great excitement , commenting mightily on the country . Birt had never been so light-hearted as during these days . The cessation of anxiety was itself a sort of happiness . The long , hard ordeal to which the truth had subjected him had ended triumphantly . " Mighty onexpected things happen in this worl ' , " he said , reflectively . " It ' pears powerful cur'ous to me , after all ez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no loser by that thar gold mine down the ravine . " He himself was surprised that he did not rejoice in Nate 's mortification and defeat . But somehow he had struck a moral equilibrium ; in mastering his anger and thirst for revenge , he had gained a stronger control of all the more unworthy impulses of his nature . Meantime there was woe at the tanyard . Jube Perkins had been anxious to have Birt resume his old place on the old terms . The professor , however , would not release the boy from his engagement . It seemed that this man of science could deduce subtle distinctions of character in the mere wielding of a spade . He had never seen , he said , any one dig so conscientiously and so intelligently as Birt . The tanner suddenly found that conscience might prove a factor even in so simple a matter as driving the old mule around the bark-mill . The boy who had taken Birt 's place was a sullen , intractable fellow , and brutal . When he yelled and swore and plied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . The climax came one day when the rash boy kicked the animal . Now this reminded the mild-mannered old mule of his own youthful prowess as a kicker . He revived his reputation . He seemed to stand on his fore-legs and his muzzle , while his hind-legs played havoc behind him . The terrified boy dared not come near him . The bark-mill itself was endangered . Jube Perkins had not done so much work for a twelvemonth as in his efforts to keep the boy , the mule , and the bark-mill going together . There were no " finds " down by the lick to rejoice the professor , and he went away at last boneless , except in so far as nature had provided him . He left Birt amply rewarded for his labor . So independent did Mrs. Dicey feel with this sum of money in reserve , that she would not agree that Birt should work on the old terms with the tanner . Birt was dismayed by this temerity . Once more , however , he recognized her acumen , for Jubal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came back again and promised good wages . Ignorant and simple as she was , her keen instinct for her son 's best interest , his true welfare , endowed her words with wisdom . Thenceforth he esteemed no friend , no ally , equal to his mother . It delighted him to witness her triumph in the proof of his innocence , and indeed she did not in this matter bear herself with meekness . It made him feel so prosperous to note her relapse into her old caustic habit of speech . Ah , if he were hurt or sore beset , every word would be tenderness . Birt shortly compassed a much desired object . The mule 's revival of his ancient glories as a " turrible kicker " had injured his market value , and Birt 's earnings enabled him to purchase the animal at a low price . The mule lived to a great age , always with his master as " mild-mannered " as a lamb . For some time Birt saw nothing of Nate , but one day the quondam friends met face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain side . Abject fear was expressed in Nate 's sharp features , for escape was impossible . There was no need of either fear or flight . " How air ye , I'on Pyrite ! " cried Birt cheerfully . The martyr 's countenance changed . " Ye never done me right ' bout that thar mine , Birt Dicey , " Nate said reproachfully . " Ye mus ' hev knowed from the fust ez them thar rocks war good fur nuthin ' . " " Ye air the deceivinest sandy-headed Pyrite that ever war on the top o ' this mounting , an ' ye knows it , " Birt retorted in high good humor ; " an ' ef it war wuth my while I 'd gin ye a old-fashion larrupin ' jes ' ter pay ye fur the trick ez ye played on me . But I ai n't keerin ' fur that , now . Stan ' back thar , Tennessee ! " Since then , Tennessee , always preserving the influence she wielded that memorable night , has grown to be a woman -- never pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " powerful peart. " ***
