I AM to try to give , in a dozen pages of THE NORTH AMERICAK REVIEW , an answer to the question above written . Be it understood by the reader , in the first place , that the editor , and not I , is responsible for the form of the question , and that to him , and not to me , must be imputed the " arrogant exclusiveness " which employs the word " Churchman " to describe an " Episcopalian . " But while desiring to avoid the suspicion of bigotry , which might damage the plea II would make for my position , let me add that , turning to Mr. Webster 's Dictionary , I learn that the editor uses language which should be " understanded of the people ; " for the definition of the word " Churchman " there given , is : " 1 . An ecclesiastic or clergyman ; one who ministers in sacred things . 2 . An Episcopalian , as distinguished from a Presbyterian or Congregationalist , etc . " And Worcester , if any prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 . A clergyman , an ecclesiastic . 2 . An adherent of the Church of England , an Episcopalian . " So then , as manifestly the inquiry is not desigued to elicit the reasons why I have elected to serve God and my generation in the work of the Ministry , the question is properly framed to ask on what grounds I have preferred to remain in that Protestant Episcopal Church in which , by the good providence of God , I was born . I answer , first , that I am a Churchman from principles of expediency , because I believe that the system of the Protestant Episcopal Church is best adapted to accomplish the result for whose attainment the Christian society was established among men ; because I believe that , by the agency of the doctrine , the discipline , and the worship to which her Ministers are engaged to conform , there is a priori largest prospect that the victory shall be gained for which the battle has been set in array . Assuming as I do , by agreement , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may not doubt that the Son of God organized some instrumentality whose purpose is the witnessing to the fact of His resurrection , the discipling of all the nations , and the edifying of this gathered flock . Nor may I doubt that this spiritual service shall continue until " we all attain unto the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a fullgrown man , unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . " This the purpose , what characteristics of the agency doth our own reason suggest as necessary for its accomplishment ? Mark that , for the present , I pass by all consideration of the question whether any particular form of organization has been authoritatively prescribed . I further pass by all consideration of Christian history , and strive to shut my eyes to the lessons there so plainly written in the stories of success and of failure . But looking out to-day upon the work before us , in our country and age , amid the peculiar conditions of our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resurrection , of making disciples of the Crucified , and of uphuilding the temple which shall be the very Body of Christ because composed of " living stones , ** living with His life , what machinery of organization would our wisdom devise ? Recognizing fully that the Holy Ghost , Whom the Risen Lord did promise to send , alone can enable any man to " call Jesus Lord ; " that He alone can make a man a member of Christ ; that He alone can " order the unruly wills and affections of sinful men ; " yet , what shall be the human agent of His divine operation , what the system of the organization and what its movement , through which and by which He shall most quickly and most readily finish His work ? I answer , first , we must have a living witness who can testify to the reality of that great central fact whereon doth rest the whole superstructure of our hope , even that , on the third day of His appointment , the crucified Jesus rose again from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make this plain to the unbelieving intellect of to-day . Everywhere we hear the triumphant shout of a multitude proclaiming that in the light of their new science they have discovered its boasted antiquity to he a fraud , and that many of our sacred *cro1ls are but palimpsests containing new versions of older legends . The sound of their noisy assertion of their own achievement " is gone out into all lands , " and the ignorant and the unlearned , and still more , the half-learned , are despoiled of their hope . Tell them the argument // ments by which the authenticity and the genuineness of our books are secured , and they can not or will not understand . Their faith is not stayed , for the old veneration for the Book is dead , killed by the blows of the Critic and of the Reviser . Tell them of spiritual experience stronger than " proof of Holy Writ , " and they mock at the unreality , the pitifnl delusion . Is there not , must there not be , a living witness , older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therein recorded , who rolled the great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and who did thereafter eat and drink with the Risen One Whom his hands had laid in the tomb ? Beyond a question the need of to-day is a Church whose life began where the cloud chariot waited that the King of Glory might call it into being ; a Church which heard His words of authority , " Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature . " The transmission of authority from generation to generation , the delivery of the deposit of faith from hand to hand , the succession of the officers of Christ 's kingdom , regular , continuous , unbroken , is a necessary evidence of the fact of His resurrection demanded for the conversion of the world of to-day . I say nothing now as to any particular form of church government in which this succession must be maintained . I can understand that in any one of a half-dozen forms the maintenance might be equally secure . But somehow there must have been regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afforded . The one living witness must be at hand , that he may answer the myriads of to-day who , like Thomas , declare , " Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into His side , I Will not believe . " ( S. John , xx . 25 . ) Yes , for such doubters to-day , honest , it may be , brave , and truth-loving as Thomas was , we need the answer , " Reach hither thy linger and behold my hands , and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side , and be not faithless but believing . " ( S. John , xx . 27 . ) The Church , the Body of Christ , must point to wound-prints in hands and side , even the marks of the continued life of Christ , benefiting and blessing mankind by the sacrifice of self . Succession of the Ministry in some shape is a necessity , for only thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But ( 2 ) granting a Ministry in succession from the beginning , I can , I think , see that , for fullest efficiency and largest success , // that Ministry should be constituted in orders of differing rank and privilege , demanding different degrees of ability and acquirement , imposing burdens and cares of unequal weight , and all moving together in the harmony of due subordination . Nature seems to teach me this by the busy loyalty of the beehive , and the wellordered procession of the birds in their flight . And man , learning from nature , or by an instinct divinely given , follows ever the same plan . The camp of the soldier , the court of the magistrate , the academy of the scholar , the mill , the factory , the countinghouse , are all alike organized that unity of purpose may control the operations , and largest results be secured by the devotion of every hand and of every brain to that for which it is best fitted . Must it not be so in the army of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the school of the wisest Teacher , in the great storehouse of God ? Do not the different degrees of intellectual endowment , of opportunity for cultivation , of general ability , as well as the needs of the service , all alike demand this differentiation ? But let me suggest the limitation I am taught by my observation . Every hive will have its own queen , and each flock of birds its own leader , each camp its commander , each school its master , while all are alike responsible to the king and ruler , it may be , far away . An overgrown business may be , and in time must be , unwieldy , and beyond the capacity of its head to direct , and so we may look for limitation of the process of unifying the servants of Jesus Christ , for here nor pride nor greed may interfere with the controlling purpose that what is best be done . But ( 3 ) I note that for fullest success in evangelizing our country , we need that the messengers shall speak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that every addition made by their inference , even though its design and its tendency be to make and to maintain more devoted loyalty to the King , will hinder the progress of their work , and delay the consummation the Master has in view . I note that the priceless treasure which God has given us in His written word is not a theological treatise , nor a formal , systematic statement of religious truth , but is a collection of writings of different characters , evoked by different occasions , and confessedly giving account of the progress and of the difficulties of the beginnings of the Church 's life , and not direction bow that life shall be begun . And , remembering this , I am not surprised that pious opinions thence obtained , perfectly legiti // mate as opinions , to teacher or to pupil , are yet but too often made to be parts of the divine message , and their acceptance condition of admission into the one Body ; and that inability or unwillingness to receive them has sent away sorrowful many a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a need that for all alike there shall be one prescribed formula of belief , containing that and only that which has been believed " always everywhere , and by all , " and that this confession shall be the sufficient shibboleth at the door of the kingdom , this confession of belief with mind and heart of Jesus and His resurrection , which St. Paul declares bringeth salvation . Yes , despite the fact that the Ministry be ordered with due subordination of the weak and the unlearned to the stronger and the more cultivated , and that all in the one great school are placed under the control of the head master , whose sufficiency has been tried and proven , yet will there be ever danger that ignorance and pride will combine to bring in novelties of opinion and of practice to disturb the peace . And , therefore , I can see the necessity for written law , and can rejoice with thanksgiving that the great Master did teach by His Spirit the holy men of old to write His unchanging word ; and though it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and unstable souls , yet without it no church can conquer . ( 4 . ) I notice that this country of ours is denominated a Christian country . Certainly , Christian rites sanctify its official ceremonies ; its President kisses the book of the Gospel in token of his sincere devotion to the organic law , and Christian prayer is offered daily in its legislative halls . But more real than all this , a vast multitude of our citizens do worship Jesus Christ in spirit and in truth . Now , therefore , a chief , if not the chief , duty of the Church of Christ here , is to build up these Christians in their holy faith , to guide them to bring up their children in like precious hope , and to help them and their little ones to grow daily in the knowledge of the Son of God . How may this best be done ? It seems to me , in the first place , looking at the subject as far as I can apart from revelation or history , that we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , that they may share its spirit , and so grow up into Christ . We can not with safety suffer our little ones to go away into a far country , and hope by and by to bring them back as penitent prodigals : we must keep // them where we are . Whether or not infant discipleship was ever known before , it must be begun now . We need it for the Church 's work in our land . For the system that shall succeed in winning this people for Christ must have as its largest element the idea and practice of training . Old and young , the graybeard and the infant , alike are they babes in Christ , almost alike ignorant of the truth that shall make them free . They alike need to be taught , to be trained ; they need words to be put into their mouths , which shall be the suggestion and the vehicle of the new thoughts of the heart , and speak cheer to their own souls and praise to their Father . Not the passionate pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , not the portrayal of the bliss of His home , and of the flames which shall burn up His enemies ; not this the food they need , that they may grow thereby , but exhortation to obedience , and exposition of the details of commandment , of the wiles of the destroyer , and of the noble duty of sworn allegiance . They are already the pledged servants of the Master , the members of His Body ; we must train them that as such they learn to live . ( 5 . ) But exhortation is a passing sound , and sermons are soon forgotten . Can there not be devised some method by which child and adult alike may become each his own mentor ? Can we not place words in the memory which shall enforce the truth that is life , and whose often utterance shall drive home to the heart the consciousness of sin and the hope of salvation , the duty to be done and the inability to do , the sufficiency of Christ and the offered gift of grace ? Can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears that are dull and heavy , and set before men 's eyes mysteries full of blessing which words can not declare ? As I look around me on the conditions of our people , as I call to mind that my own eyes have seen of Christianized paganism , of conscience seared as with a hot iron by the fiery rhetoric of controversial preaching , of religion being made a profession of miraculous experience , and worship the listening to a florid speech , I look for , as the conquering Church of America , the one that will teach rather than excite ; which shall train , and not merely alarm and arouse ; which shall preach the simplest gospel in simplest words , and repeat it so often that it must be learned ; that will hold up an ideal of character as the only test of faith , and teach prayer // and worship , self-denial and alms-deeds , as the means of attaining that character . ( 6 . ) Lastly , when I look upon the raging fury of sectarian strife , and upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a half-dozen houses of worship equally eloquent , in their dilapidation , of the evils of division , and find , upon inquiry , the natural effect in the mocking unbelief of the people , then I look for and pray for some society to be a center upon which all may rally . I search for some Christian body which has never let go the chain which binds to the beginning of organic Christianity ; whose Ministers have authority duly given by those who received it in reguar succession from the Apostles , and which has yet made no change in the faith once for all delivered ; which recites the ancient Creeds in the very words the martyrs spoke , and ministers the blessed Sacrament in form of words and act identical with that of the persecuted confessors who died for their Lord ; and which yet loves the open Bible , which scatters it far and wide , and fills its service of worship with thoughts and words from that book ; which , rejoicing to hear from God 's appointed ambassador the proclamation with authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for an instant , to any mediator between God and man , save the man Christ Jesus ; which , standing upon the old foundation of Evangelic truth and Apostolic order , may call in loving tones to all the churches that they come and stand together where all once stood , and , standing , conquered . Can such a Church be foundCatholic , Protestant , Evangelical , Scriptural-no matter how small or feeble , it may be the nucleus around which shall gather , from the muddy solution of our modern Christianity , the pure white crystal unity for which the Master prayed in the night of His betrayal , that all might be one as He was in His Father and His Father in Him , organically one , that the world might believe that God did send Him . Such the characteristics which my sober thought requires in the body which shall best witness to the resurrection of Jesus , disciple the nations , edify the body of Christ : and I am a Churchman because I believe that in the Protestant Episcopal Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Anglican communion , now planted and flourishing in every land where the English language is spoken , I find them in fullest development . Let us look hurriedly at the principles of this Church as set forth in her formularies. // 1 . The Anglican Church speaks with no uncertain voice as to the necessity for an authorized , an Apostolic , ministry . In the preface to her ordinal she says : " It is evident unto all men diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient authors , that from the Apostles ' time there have been these orders of ministers in Christ 's church-bishops , priests , and deacons . Which offices were evermore had in such reverend estimation that no man might presume to execute any of them , except he were first called , tried , examined , and known to have such qualities as are requisite for the same ; and also by public prayer , with imposition of hands , were approved and admitted thereto by lawful authority . And , therefore , to the intent that these orders may be continued , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be accounted , or taken to be , a lawful bishop , priest , or deacon in this Church , or suffered to execute any of the said functions , except he be called , tried , examined , and admitted thereunto , according to the form hereafter following , or hath had Episcopal consecration or ordination . " Here is written her doctrine of Apostolical succession ; even that authority must be conveyed from one ambassador to his successor , that the herald must receive from duly empowered officers , and not learn by hearsay , the message of amnesty and pardon he comes to deliver ; that the sentinel at the door of the kingdom must be taught by his commanding officer the pass-word he must demand for entrance ; that the minister must learn from them that went before how to bear the authoritative witness handed down in unbroken succession from them that " were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word 's ( S. Luke , i. 2 . ) Here is uci theory of " channel of grace , " provoking the cheap jest of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to impart miraculous power ; but here , as in the form of ordination to which reference is herein made , is declared that from man to man , from bishop to bishop , and from bishop to each lower order of the Ministry , is given authority to read the Gospel , or to dispense the word of God and His holy sacraments , in all and by all his life and doctrine , to witness unto Jesus and the resurrection , to disciple the unbelieving , to edify the Body of Christ . And mark that of the candidates for the second or the third order is demanded the promise of obedience to the bishop or other chief ministers , who , according to the Canons of the Church , may have the charge and government over them , that so order may charac // terize the movement of the great army , and the result be obtained , which is consequent upon the due subordination of every part . But note also that here is no vast aggregation of innumerable subordinates under one chief , such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born and which they speak , much less have personal knowledge of them and their capacity , of their faults and their failures , their necessities and their trials . The territory they occupy is not given to many nations , but ; to one , and is even but a part of that one nation 's home . The commanding officer may easily and frequently visit every part of it ; he may be well known not only to all the ministers , but to all to whom they minister . His eye and brain and heart may take in all the work and all the workers , and so there may be unity of action , that unity which is the chief value of the subordination of parts , and the means of producing the resultant success . But do these Ministers , thus regularly appointed , and in such harmonious order ranged , speak with one voice the one message ? Can we dare sing , marching in mimic onset upon unseen foes , " We are not divided , all one body we " ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sneer , as he is setting the divisions of Christianity over against the more perfect unity of the disciples of Buddha . Is his sneer with warrant ? Certainly , so long as Ministers are men , so long as their manhood shall not have been sunk in their office , so long as they shall exercise liberty of thought , which is part of the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free , the teachers of His religion , even the authorized Ministers of His Apostolic Church , will legitimately differ in religious opinion . Just as certainly it will doubtless be true that pride of opinion will often intrude itself into the domain of faith , and a very " abomination of desolations ' stand where it ought not . In the years to come , as in the years that are past , the zealous Evangelical will demand from the neophyte just timidly entering upon his preparation for the study of theology , and even from the Catechumen desiring Confirmation , the acceptance of his whole body of divinity , the very terms of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) will still scatter his catechisms of emasculated , illogical Romanism , one of which seems to have raised the Irish gorge of a recent contributor to this series of articles , and almost ; to have given color and shape to his paper . Some very Broad-Churchmen will still " sneer at Scripture , read // Greek poetry , and be liberal in their views . " But notwithstanding all these wide differences of opinion , which are lawful , and notwithstanding the occasional proffer of individual opinion as a test of communion , which is unlawful , still we a-re not divided in any real sense ; still are we one Body holding the one faith , and administering the one baptism upon the confession of that one faith . Though the preacher philosophize and though the priest materialize , though the prophet speak the smooth things of a modern rationalism or the priest ape the pretty things of a Romanism not much older , yet the Church 's words , which they must repeat , and which the people may read , will testify to the simplicity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be confessed by all , and to the liberty of opinion , as to all else . Whatever be the opinions of the individual minister , preach he Romanism or Calvinism , when he stands by the font he can say only this : " Dost thou believe all the articles of the Christian faith as contained in the Apostles ' Creed ? " These , then , I find to be the characteristics of the Protestant Episcopal Church as to her teaching : On the one side authority and definiteness ; on the other side liberty and silence . In essentials there is , for there must be , unity ; in non-essentials there is , as there should be , liberty ; and so there is best hope that in all things there will be charity . Again , I affirm that the Anglican Church gives true honor to the Holy Scripture . Be it remembered that her sons did roll away the stone from the sepulchre of unknown tongues in which the Bible lay buried ; and be it remembered as well that the sons of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people . Search her Prayer Book , and see how saturated with Scripture are her prayers and her offices . Note how , by her appointment , nearly the whole of the Old Testament must be read to her children during the year , and the whole New Testament twice ; and that more Scripture is read , at each regular service of this Church , than in the worship of any other company of Christians . Above all , note that she has declared , in her Articles of Religion , " The Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation ; so that whatsoever is not read therein , nor may be proved thereby , is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of the faith , or be thought requisite or nec* essary to salvation . " More than this , she declares that even the ancient Creeds , the symbols of her faith , " ought thoroughly to be // received and believed , for they may be proved by most certain warrant of Holy Scripture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his ordination to the lowest office , sign a declaration in these words : " I do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God . " Note all these marks , and answer : Is not this Church , which is catholic in her reverence for antiquity , in her preservation of an Apostolic Ministry , in her rule of faith , " Quod semper , quod ubique , quod ab omnibus creditum ; " which is Protestant in her repudiation of the additions to that faith from Rome or Geneva ; of the diminutions of it by rationalist compromise with the enemies of Christ ; is she not also scriptural in her uplifting of the standard of Holy Writ to be the impregnable defense of what she was given to guard ? True , that she does not make claims for the Bible which it makes not for itself . She does not declare the Bible , and the Bible only , to be the religion of Protestants . She is mindful of the fact that the Church existed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament was written . She is herself the only witness to declare unto men what are the books of the Bible , and she bears equal witness to facts of Church life to which often but partial and passing reference is made in the sacred records . The Creeds of Christendom , she tells us plainly , " are to be thoroughly received and believed , for they may be proven by most certain warrant of Holy Scripture , " and for the rest she leaves her children untrammeled in their exploring search of these mines of truth . But as to many things for which there is no " certain warrant " of Holy Scripture , things " concerning the kingdom of God , " its life , its ordering , its customs and usages , she teaches her children that which she has received as handed down from the beginning . So she says " that the baptism of young children is in anywise to be retained in the Church as most agreeable with the institution of Christ . " She teaches us , and she only , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy . She teaches us , and she only , that women may partake of the Lord 's Supper . For these , and many other things , we rest upon the testimony not of Writ , " enthrones the Book of God amid her assembled councilors , and declares that , having " power to decree rites and ceremonies , and authority in controversies of faith , " she yet may not " ordain anything that is // WHY AM I A fJHU7 ? CR3fAN ? 497 contrary to God 's Word written , neither so expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to another ; " nor may she " besides the Scripture , " " enforce anything to be believed for necessity of salvation . " So does she honor the Bible . What , now , is her system for performing the duty assigned by the Lord to His Church , of evangelizing the nations and building up His people into likeness to Him ? I answer that her system is all wrapt up in the one word training . The fathers and mothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things spoken by His Ministers , are straightway exhorted that they delay not to bring their little ones with them into the ark of safety ; and those who by reason of their tender age can not perform the promises which are demanded in baptism , are permitted to have others promise for them , even , as is done every day in matters of mere temporal concern .. The child is declared regenerate , born anew into a life of covenant blessing , born by the Holy Ghost , Whose gift the Father has promised by the Son to all who ask in His name . And then we hear , " Take this child and bring it up for me . " " Ye are to take care that this child be virtuously brought up to lead a godly and a Christian life , for baptism representeth unto us our profession , which is to follow the example of our Saviour , Christ , and to be made like unto Him . " " Take care that this child be brought to the Bishop to be confirmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lord 's Prayer , and the Ten Commandments , and is sufficiently instructed in the other parts of the Church Catechism. ** T.
