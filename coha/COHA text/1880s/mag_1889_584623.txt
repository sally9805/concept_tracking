By W. A.

When they found out that by uniting their surplus earnings they could provide themselves with homes of their own , instead of remaining subject to the demands of landlords , they put co-operation to one of its most beneficent uses . This kind of co-operation is most popularly known under the name of Building and Loan Associations ; but the official title differs in different places . In England the common designation is " Building Societies . " Those formed under the New York statute of 1887 must be called " Co-operative Savings and Loan Associations . " In Massachusetts they were first styled " Co-operative Saving Fund and Loan Associations , " a title which was changed by a later act to " Co-operative Banks . " But , whatever their title , the object and general plan of operation are the same . Exactly how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if we discard as unverified the statement that the essential principle of our modern Building and Loan Association system was known and employed during the Greek republic and among the Anglo-Saxons in England , we can still find for it a verified origin ancient enough to prove that it is no novel scheme of a speculative age . H. F. A. Davis , a very intelligent writer on the subject , gives Birmingham , England , as the place , and the year 1781 as the date , of the first known association formed for the object of assisting its members to build or purchase houses . In the earliest association described , each member paid in lOs . 6d. , on each share of stock he held , every month . A subscriber for three shares was entitled to have " one or more houses built for him of the value of 200 guineas ; " a subscriber for two shares , one or more houses of the value of ? 140 ; and a subscriber for one share , " a single house , value ? 70 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Birmingham . The rules or by-laws of the " Greenwich Union Building Society " have come down to us from those early days ; and it is curious to note how closely they resemble the bylaws of the best-planned associations in this country to-day . A notable difference is , however , that the membership was limited to fifty . The legality of such organizations under the common law seems first to have been called in question in some proceedings in which this last-named society was a party . And , the suit having terminated in its f avor , we are told that " similar societies were formed in other parts of the country , Scotland , Lancashire , and South Wales being the districts where they were most popular . " The Earl of Selkirk , a philanthropic man of wealth , was instrumental in establishing a society at Kirkcudbright , Scotland , in 1815 . The system must have proved a steady success , for the number of societies or associations has kept on increasing throughout Great Britain , reaching 2,050 by the year 1851 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament show that , in July , 1888 , the societies numbered 2,404 , with assets of ? 54,200,620 and a membership of over six hundred thousand . Edmund Wrigley , a leading American writer on the subject , fixes the date of the introduction of the Building and Loan Association system in this country at about the year 1840 . Philadelphia seems to have seized most readily on the idea ; but associations were also formed not only in other Northern cities , but in Charleston , Savannah , and other cities in the South and West . At first they // were organized without the assistance of special statutes regarding them ; their managers , for instance , being trustees appointed by deed . But as experience gave wisdom , the aid of the Legislatures was sought ; and now in almost , if not quite , every State where interest in the matter has been excited , there are laws governing the organization and management of such corporations . As this legislation generally has not yet reached a state of perfection which requires exact statistical returns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these organizations in this country , their membership , and their assets , can not be given precisely . The following figures are , however , taken from the latest attainable sources . In New England the number of associations is between 90 and 100 . Of these there are 66 in Massachusetts , 15 in Maine , 4 in New Hampshire , 3 in Rhode Island , and 6 or 7 in Counecticut . The assets of the " Co-operative Banks " of Massachusetts on October 1 , 1888 , were $5,505,072.19 , a gain of $1,293 ,  - -  123.33 during the year . The open accounts numbered 983,202 . The assets of the Maine associations at the close of the last fiscal year were $187,967.77 , a gain in one year of $92,556.58 . The shareholders numbered 972 . The New York statistics are very inadequate , as only 24 associations filed reports with the State Banking Department in 1888 . Judge Seymour Dexter estimated the number last September at 275 , and many have been organized since . The report of the New Jersey Labor Bureau for 1886 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 170 . The complete returns sent in by 156 of these showed 37,730 shareholders , holding an average of 5j shares each , with net assets of $9,349,517.46 . The number of associations in Pennsylvania is estimated at 900 , one-half of which are in Philadelphia . Their shares are estimated to number 1,000,000 , with a cash value of $60,000,000 . Mr. F. B. Sanborn , in his report to the Social Science Association last September , estimated the number of associations in the old slaveStates , outside of Delaware and Maryland , which support a good many , at 250 . The first association in Ohio was organized in 1867 , and now their number in that State is estimated at over 600 . In illinois , where the first association was organized in 1849 , there are more than 450 , which lend some $36,000,000 a year to their members . In Miunesota  --  and especially in St. Paul , where the system dates back to 1869  --  the associations have proved wonderfully successful . They now number about 125 , with an estimated investment of $18,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes in St. Paul have been in whole or in part secured to their ' owners with money advanced by the building societies . " Michigan supports about 50 associations ; California in 1887 had 11 , with assets of $2,595,488 , and they have found a lodgement as far ' west as Oregon . Taking Mr. Sanborn 's calculation , there are now from 3,000 to 5,000 of ' these co-operative organizations in the United States , with a constant investment of $300,000,000 ; while the accumulation under this plan of saving during the last forty years has amounted to from $500,000,000 to $750,000,000 . It is not surprising that the savings banks look on this system as a formidable rival to their own . Mr. Sanborn , estimating the investment in the Minnesota associations at $18,000,000 , says : " The deposits in Minnesota savings banks hardly exceed $2,000,000 ; and the rapid growth of these associations has certainly checked the growth of savings banks there , as it has in Rochester , N. Y. , in Buffalo , in Pittsburg , and in every State west of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New York City savings banks in 1888 as compared with 1887 , and of $346,322 in those of Brooklyn , is attributed to the recent increase in the number of associations in those cities . What , now , is this system of co-operation which has stood so long a trial , has won its way so steadily and generally into popular favor , and has produced so wonderful financial results ? Why does it commend itself to so many persons of small incomes , and why have failures under it been so rare ? A Building and Loan Association is a corporation , regularly formed in ac // cordance with the law of its locality ; generally , as I have explained , a statute especially adapted to this form of business . Its officers consist of a president , vice-president , secretary , treasurer , board of directors , and a counseL There may be slight variations from this list . For instance , in some associations auditors and appraisers are included in the number of officers annually elected while in others the auditors are chosen just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the secretary 's accounts , and appraisers are appointed from time to time as loans are made . In small towns the secretary is the only salaried officer ; in other places a salary is paid both to him and to the treasurer , and in some large associations in New York City and in the West the president receives compensation . Aside from the salaries , the expenses consist of the rent of a room for holding the meetings and receiving the dues , the cost of the necessary printing , and incidentals . Small associations pay rent for a room only one or two evenings in a week . Larger ones require more permanent accommodations . I can cite an association in a suburb of New York City which , in the first two years of its existence , issued 1,869 shares of stock and accumulated assets of $33,061 , and whose total expenses for those years were about five hundred dollars . In cities like Philadelphia , where associations are very numerous , and the accounts of many series have to be kept in each , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by several , his duties becoming those of a professional accountant . To show the responsibility of such a position , an instance may be mentioned in which the secretary of six associations handled $4,939 ,  - -  728 from 1879 to 1886 , inclusive . The persons composing a Building and Loan Association agree to pay into their treasury a certain sum , at fixed periods , on each share that they own , until their shares through such payments and the accumulated profits reach their par value , or , as it is technically termed , " mature . " The stated payments ( called " dues " ) , their frequency , and the par value of the stock vary . The general rule is that $1 shall be paid on every share once a month until a par of $200 is reached . When the shares " mature * the assets in the treasury are divided among the shareholders . Just as fast as the money is paid in it is offered in the shape of loans to the members  --  and to the members onlythe security taken being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association of the borrower 's stock . The amount which a member is entitled to borrow equals the par value of his or her shares . Thus , in an association where the par value is $200 , a member who wants $1,000 must own five shares . As every member has an equal right to become a borrower , the disposition of the loans is made by putting the money up at auction , from time to time , and awarding the loan to that member who will give the highest premium above the regular interest rate . The Building and Loan Association laws provide that the acceptance of these premiums shall not constitute usury . In order that the dues and interest shall be paid regularly , the by-laws provide that they shall be received only by the secretary , and by him only at the stated meetings ; and there is a small fine for a non-payment , which is increased from meeting to mee ? ing , a delinquency for a certain period causing the forfeiture of the stock , or giving ground for the foreclosure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest money , with the dues and any other receipts , goes into the treasury , to be loaned at once . It is apparent , therefore , that a Building and Loan Association whose money is in demand not only receives interest constantly on the dues paid in by all the members , but that it compounds this interest monthly . Herein lies the chief secret of the profitableness of this system of investment . To explain more in detail the operations of one of these associations : The regular meeting night finds the secretary seated at his desk , with one or two of the directors at his side as tellers . The members , who are provided with pass-books , as in the case of savings bank depositors , hand in their dues ( and interest , if borrowers ) to the secretary , who enters the amount , receipts for it with his initials , and announces the name and // deposit to the tellers , each of whom enters the same in a separate blotter . At the close of the evening each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary 's hands ; if there is any error it is looked for at once . Thus a perfect check is placed upon the secretary . When the money is counted , the secretary pays it over immediately to the treasurer , who is required by the by-laws to deposit it in a designated bank within twenty-four hours . As the treasurer is under bonds , the money is safe while it is in his hands . For greater security it is customary , with some associations , to require the signatures of two directors to the association 's checks , in addition to those of the president , secretary , and treasurer . During the course of the evening , when there is money on hand , some officer , usually the president , announces that a loan , or loans , will be made to the highest bidder or bidders . A member who thus becomes entitled to a lean , at once gives to the counsel a description of the property , with a plan of the house , if he intends to build a new one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the association 's appraisers . When the directors receive the appraisers ' report they decide whether the loan is a safe one or not . In reaching this de .. cision each application is considered on its own merits . A private lender would simply inquire if there was a good margin of value above the amount of the loan ; but in the case of an association borrower the directors inquire into the applicant 's personal character , and find out his employment and his salary or wages . If this results satisfactorily , and the premises proposed to be bought are not beyond the applicant 's means , then the directors can take into further consideration the facts that the borrower will begin , to pay off his debt at the very next meeting of the association , and that experience has proved that a person who is securing a home in this easy way will make , in most cases , almost any sacrifice rather than see the property pass out of his hands . I have never seen a happier man than a German laborer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , which his Building and Loan Association had put up for him . And the pleasure expressed in his countenance seemed to me a better assurance that he would clear the debt from that house , than the bond of many a richer man would be that the latter would meet his payments . Dr. Keck , the pioneer organizer of these associations in Cincinnati , had to complain a few years ago that the desire for membership there was so great that " many people suffer by it  --  the butcher , the baker , the doctor , the tenant , the landlord . " While this is an admission that the business may be overdone , it also shows how strong is the desire " to own a home " when once the way to do this is opened up to a man to whom it has seemed an impossibility . Loans are made to members either to purchase houses already erected , to build houses , or to remove existing encumbrances . If a member borrows to build a new house , the money is not paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the contractor , on the audit of the owner and the association 's building committee , as the work proceeds . One of the great advantages of these associations as assistants of persons of small means is , that they can safely lend very close to the appraised values . Seventy per cent . to a man of good habits is considered an excellent risk , and Mr. Paine , the Superintendent of the Banking Department of New York State , in a work recently published , says : " It is seldom that a loan of more than eighty per cent . of the appraised value of mortgaged property is absolutely secure . " The earliest Building and Loan Associations contemplated the issue of stock all of the same value , members joining at any time after the date of organization paying back-dues sufficient to effect this ; and all the members were to continue the payment of their dues until maturity was reached , when the mortgages of the borrowers were to be cancelled , the non-borrowers would receive the par value of their shares in cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a perfectly feasible scheme , but there were reasons why it did not work with entire satisfaction . As an association grew older , the cash payment required of new members steadily increased , and the growth of // membership ceased . In the course of time the list of would-be borrowers was exhausted , the funds remained inactive , and at best a large sum had to be accumulated to pay the shares of the nonborrowers . So the life of the association was prolonged beyond the original calculation . To obviate this difficulty it has been found best to issue shares in successive " series , " the present value of the shares of each series being kept equal , the funds of all being loaned together , and the profits being apportioned among the different series according to their age and assets . Such an association is called a " permanent " or " serial " one , the first mentioned a " terminating " one . The frequency of the issue of new series is regulated by the demand-as quarterly , semi-annually , or annually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage : A member of an older series who has not borrowed on his shares may withdraw the amount to his credit when it equals the price of a lot , buy his land , enter a younger series , and in it borrow the money to erect his house . Thus a " serial " association is constantly creating for itself a body of borrowers , and borrowers , it must ever be kept in mind , are the life of the system . The " terminating " plan still finds favor in some places , associations of this kind in Philadelphia being , it is said , for some unexplained reason , most popular among the Germans and Irish . In Reading , Pa. , where there are a number , a reason given for not discarding the older plan is that members like to know that " an association can wind up and pay all its members , " and that the fixing of a date for termination is a check on the concealment of mismanagement . To obviate the disadvantages above referred to , a new association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with practically the same officers , one secretary , for instance , acting for a dozen associations . But with honest management and intelligent book-keeping the serial plan is much less cumbersome . In some States the total number of shares which an association may issue is limited by law . There are two statutes governing these corporations in New York . The older one ( that of 1851 ) contains no limitation of this kind . By the statute of 1887 the outstanding shares of the value of $200 each can not exceed 10,000 . In Pennsylvania the limit is 2,500 shares of $200 each , and in Massachusetts 5,000 of the same value . In New Jersey , by an amendment passed in 1888 , all limitation as to the number of shares to be issued by an association working under the serial plan is removed . Careful writers on the subject point out danger to an association whose shares become too numerous ; but this danger , I would say , would be realized only in a large city where the number of associations did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If 2,500 shares seem a small limit , it must be remembered that in a " serial " association there are constant transfers from one series to another , as well as voluntary withdrawals from membership and compulsory retirements . A word of explanation about the latter . The essence of success in a Building and Loan Association is to keep all the funds in active operation  --  to have no money lying idle in the bank . But even in a " serial " association , if , as a series approaches maturity , any considerable number of non-borrowing shareholders remain , the officers will have to accumulate a cash fund to meet the matured value of their shares . The number of such investors is in practice found to be smaller than might be supposed , owing to the voluntary withdrawal of shares . But , to provide for an emergency , directors are  --  or should be-given authority to retire the shares of non-borrowing members from time to time , as their series grow older and the condition of the treasury warrants . The Massachusetts statute requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cited as an illustration : " The directors may , at their discretion , under rules made by them , retire the unpledged shares of any series at any time after four years from the date of their issue , by enforcing the withdrawal of the same ; but whenever there shall remain in any series , at the expiration of five years after the date of its issue , an excess above one hundred unpledged shares , then it shall be the duty of the directors to retire annually // 705 twenty-five per centum of suich excess existing at said expiration of five years after the date of its issue , so that not more than one hundred unpledged shares shall remain in such series at the expiration of nine years from the date of its issue ; and thereafter the directors may in their discretion retire such other unpledged shares as they consider the best interests of the bank to require ; provided , that whenever under the provisions of this section the withdrawal of shares is to be enforced , the shares to be retired shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the full value of their shares , less all lines and a proportionate part of any unadjusted loss ; provided also that shares pledged for share loans shall be treated as unpledged shares . " To show how , in actual practice , the number of existing shares in older series decreases , I have compiled the following table of the existing number of shares , in six New Jersey associations , from the report of the State Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries for 1886 : Number of Shares . Oldest series 63 12 48 71 99 5 Next oldest 57 17 21 67 76 5 Next oldest 62 17 10 55 97 1 Next oldest 59 22 10 40 101 8 Next oldest 1641 18 7 31 161 5 Next oldest 207 45 II 97 252 12 Next oldest 185 64 31 100 274 29 Next oldest 336 44 29 189 197 52 Next oldest 385 85 38 411 283 27 Next oldest 425 183 55 753 580 96 Next oldest 543 257 86 924 608 150 Next oldest ... 682 274 189 Members are allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total demand of this kind does not exceed a fixed limit at arty one time ; as , for instance , one-half of the dues of a month . This provides against a possible " run on the association . Withdrawing members receive back their dues paid in , less fines and their share of any losses , and such proportion of accumulated profits as the by-laws of their association may provide . As it is not customary to pay young members who withdraw their full share of profits earned , there is a profit to the remaining members from such voluntary withdrawals . The earlier associations made no provision for the cancellation of mortgages before the maturity of the borrowers shares , or none except where other members stood ready to borrow the money paid in . But experience showed that many persons were deterred from borrowing of an association without the privilege of removing the encumbrance at their convenience ; as , for instance , if an opportunity occurred to make an advantageous sale of the property to some one who wanted to pay cash in full . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit a borrower to pay off his mortgage at any time on a given notice , the money being either loaned again or used in retiring shares . The most perplexing problem that presents itself to a person whose attention is first directed to the Building and Loan Association system of borrowing is this : How can a member be benefited by a loan on which he pays a premium , in addition to the regular rate of interest ? It is well , therefore , that this feature of the system be perfectly understood . At the start it must be remembered , first , that this premium is in reality only a payment made by a borrower for the privilege of having the immediate use of the par value of his shares , for which the non-borrower is obliged to wait a term of years ; and , second , that the money in the treasury is put up at auction , in quest of a premium , only in order to give all the members an equal chance to secure it. * In England , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigning loans have been tried . Sometimes they have been assigned by lot ; but , under this scheme , the money would often go to members who did not care to use it , and they would dispose of it to other members at a premium whi*ih went into their own pockets . In other associations a list of applicants for loans has been made out , and the money paid over to them in turn ; but this did not prove satisfactory . Again , in considering the premium feature it miist be remembered that , as the premiums all go into the common treasury , each payer of a premium shares * Associations in which a minimum premium is Sxed are , I think , very exceptional . // the premiums paid by all the other borrowers , and that the larger the average premiums , the greater are the profits of the association , and the sooner is the stock matured and the borrower 's mortgage cancelled . I have heard the statement made , " I would rather belong as a borrower to an association whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gets only three or five , because my debt would be so much the sooner discharged . " Practically , this only means that such a person is able to make larger payments in order to shorten the time . By the majority of members of such organizations easy payments are most desired . Courts have held that the fixing of a minimum premium is illegal , but they have held that usury can not be pleaded when the premium is determined by open competition . Thus the Supreme Court of New York ( 25 Barb. , 263 ) held : " The statute of usury is repealed as to the taking of premiums , and also to interest on premiums although previously deducted . The greater the premiums and the greater the amount drawing legal interest , the sooner will the association have the necessary funds to pay off all the shares , the shorter will be the life of the association , the number of payments by the borrower will be less , and the mutuality of the whole scheme removes the ordinary objections to the unusual interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbott 's Appeal Decisions , 347 ) has sustained this reasoning . But let us look further into the profits of these associations , which premiumpaying borrowers share . If each member of a Building and Loan Association , the par value of whose stock is $200 , contributed $1 a month to its treasury , and there were no expenses and no profits , the shares would mature in two hundred months , or sixteen years and eight months . But in a prosperous association , while the expenses are very small , every dollar that comes into the treasury is kept earning other dollars , the interest , as I have explained , being compounded monthly . The profitableness of this system of lending may be seen from the statement that while $1,000 at six per cent. , simple interest , will earn only $300 in five years , it will , if the interest is compounded annually , earn $338.22*w* and , if the interest is compounded monthly , will earn $348.83*4 ; and the gain goes on increasing with every successive year . From this cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting sixteen years and eight months for their shares to become worth $200 each , find the par value attained in a much shorter period . And just as soon as this is attained a borrower 's mortgage disappears . Exactly how long a series of shares must run to reach maturity can not be calculated precisely in advance , because it is impossible to foresee the rate of premiums offered , the expenses , the number of withdrawals , etc . An association-to use Wrigley 's illustrationsthat ( 1 ) makes a profit of ten per cent . per annum on the average time will mature its stock in ten years and ten months ; ( 2 ) making thirteen and a quarter per cent. , will mature in ten years ; ( 3 ) making twenty-seven per cent. , will mature in eight years . In calculating the withdrawal value of shares in associations using the " gross or " net " system of paying premiums ( to be explained hereafter ) , it is customary in this country to estimate the life of a series at ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ph.D. , in his papers on " Co-operation in a Western City , " published by the American Economic Association , says of the Mechanics ' and Workingmen 's Loan and Building Association of Minneapolis , which began business in 1874 with a membership of forty-five , and whose receipts are now from $80,000 to $90,000 a year : " The average premium bid for loans has been forty-two and one-eighth per cent. , and the final cost to the borrower is about eight per cent. , while the free holders ( those whose shares remain unpledged to the close of the series ) gain about twelve per cent annual compound interest on their savings . " These statements are sufficient to show that the premium need not be a cause of alarm to borrowers in these associations . But I may illustrate this fact very clearly by simple figures . Suppose that A and B each borrows $3,000 at the same time , A of a Building // and Loan Association on fifteen shares at five per cent . premium and six per cent . interest , and B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without any premium , B to pay his principal at the same time that A 's shares mature . Supposing that maturity is reached ( 1 ) in ten years and ( 2 ) in thirteen years , the two accounts will stand as follows : 1 . A , Paid in monthly dues $1,800 Paid in interest 1,800 Paid in premium 150 Total payments $3,750 B , Principal $3,000 Interest 1,800 Total payments $4,800 2 . A , Paid in monthly dues $2,340 Paid in interest 2,340 Paid in premium 150 Total payments $4,830 B , Principal $3,000 Interest 2,340 Total payments $5,340 Under the first example A pays $1,050 less than B , and under the second $510 . If the person of whom B borrows permits him to pay the interest and $180 ( the amount of A 's annual dues ) of the principal annually , under the system of partial payments , it will require between thirteen and fourteen years to liquidate the debt . A further analysis of these figures , that is sometimes made in Building and Loan Association prospectuses , is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the principal actually borrowed on being $3,000 , the total amount he has to charge to interest is $750 for the ten years , or $75 a year , which is at the rate of two and one-half per cent . per annum ; or , if his series runs thirteen years , his interest charge is $1,830 , or $140.77 a year , which is at the rate of four and seventenths per cent . per annum . Expert accountants , who have been employed by savings institutions to find flaws in the Building and Loan Association sys tem , have made haste to point out that a member of an association continues to pay interest on the whole amount borrowed , while his dues are constantly decreasing that amount , and hence that this is only an apparent interest rate. * But the vital question with a person who borrows a few hundred or thousand dollars with which to secure a home , and which is to be paid back in small instalments , is , " How large a sum out of my income for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my payments ? " If anyone will lend him the required amount , with the understanding that he is to pay the principal at the end of ten or twelve years and only annual interest meanwhile , can he find any way in which to invest his accumulating principal ( if he does accumulate it ) which will so rapidly increase it to the required amount as the Building and Loan Association increases it for him ? If he is * . in the above examples , he will be a good way ahead of his neighbor B financially when their respective debts are paid . A 's payments are small , systematic , and at the same time imperative . When he goes home from every meeting of the directors he says , " My house is so much nearerbeing my own . " And when he attends a quarterly or annual meeting of his association at which the profits are reported , and he finds a sum to his credit beyond any that he has paid in , he learns , perhaps for the first time , the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as easy to show by figures the economy of buying one 's house with the assistance of a Building and Loan Association as compared with paying rent . The following statement is only given as a form of comparison ; every prospective borrower can change the figures to suit his own locality . C and ID occupy houses worth $3,000 each ( lot , $600 , and building , $2,400 ) . C is a tenant , paying $25 per month . D , with $600 in cash , has borrowed $2,400 on twelve shares of a Building and Loan Association , and built his house . Supposing that D 's shares mature in twelve * In what has been called the " Ohio system " the dues paid in are deducted at stated periods from the principal , and interest is charged only on the remainder . As this necessarily prolongs the life of a series , the benefit to the borrower is more figurative than actual . // years , their accounts at the end of that period will stand thus : C has paid out $3,600 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D has paid out : Monthly dues .... ... . $1,728 Interest 1,728 Premium , five per cent 120 Search 50 Taxes 260 Insurance 100 Interest on value of lot . 432 Total $4,418 The neighborhood must be a very inactive one where the increased value of the property will not more than offset the cost of repairs . We hind , then , that D owns his premises by paying out only $818 more than C , who , at the end of the period named , has nothing to show for his money . One or two things remain to be said in explanation of the premium system . There is constant discussion among writers on the subject about the advantages and disadvantages of very large premiums . As I have pointed out , average high premiums mean larger payments for a shorter time . An element of trouble comes in when high premiums in the early years of an association are followed by low ones later on . Then , evidently , the earlier borrowers pay a higher rate of interest than those who follow them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount bid will be regulated by the law of supply and demand . Start a pioneer association in a place of considerable size , where , for the first time , an opportunity is afforded to secure homes under this easy system of payments , and competition will probably ran the premiums offered to a high figure ; and this rate may be kept up for a good many years in places like St. Paul and Minneapolis , whose growth is rapid and whose accession of wage-earners is constant . But with the demand for loans will certainly come new associations , an enlargement of the loan fund , and a diminution of premiums . Take , for example , the cities of New York and Philadelphia ; the former has been very slow to take advantage of this kind of co-operation , most of its existing organizations being only a few years old . Premiums of sixty per cent. , and perhaps more , have been paid for loans in New York within the last year . In Philadelphia , Mr. M. J. Brown , editor of Building Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations are obtaining any premium on loans . Good borrowers can obtain all the money needed without a premium . The premium is no longer a factor here . " There are about thirty-five associations in New York City , and some four hundred and fifty in Philadelphia . Hence the difference . High premiums were once as eagerly offered in the latter place as they now are in the former . There are different ways of paying the premium . Under what is known as the " gross plan 's the premium is deducted in advance from the sum that is loaned , while interest is charged on the whole amount . Under the " net plan " the premium is deducted as before , but interest is charged only on the sum which the borrower receives . Under a third system , known as the " instalment plan , " the premium is paid in monthly instalments . This last plan avoids many difficulties encountered . under the others , as in calculating the value of shares at any time , and I think it would be well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes practised , is to issue to a borrower additional stock whose par value shall equal the premium paid ; this makes his payments of dues on the additional stock instalment payments . Still another plan which has been tried is to have the rate of interest determined by competition . This is again the instalment plan . A premium of five per cent . on the gross plan is equal to about eight cents per month on the instalment plan . At first glance it might seem as if there was unfairness in the positions occupied in an association by the two classes of members , the borrowers and the non-borrowers , the former sharing the premiums and interest paid by the latter . But this is a superficial view . I doubt if any association is ever organized in these days in which those members who wish to borrow at one time // supply the requisite sum in dues ; so that immediate borrowers require the non-borrowers ' assistance . Besides , a large class of borrowers is supplied from among those who may be mere investors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage , requiring a borrower to own a fee in the land , many persons purchase shares who own no land and have no money to buy any , and very likely never would have any without the aid of some systematic plan of saving . But after they have been non-borrowing members for a certain time , they find that their savings are large enough to enable them to buy the coveted piece of land . So they withdraw their accumulations , secure their lots , take shares in a new series , and become borrowers in turn . The non-borrowers , too , are , or should be , liable to peremptory retirement whenever their assistance is no longer necessary . Considered abstractly as a beneficial feature in a community , an association of this kind would be commendable if it only induced a number of persons to lay aside small sums every month , without paying them any profits . And it is the cultivation of the habit of saving which is one of the best arguments in favor of the Building and Loan Association system , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savings bank would be impracticable . If complete statistics of these associations in this country and in Great Britain were available they would prove the safety of the system by showing the very small number of failures under it . But this plan of investment has not , in every case , worked satisfactorily , and it is well to consider the disappointments in order to warn investors and managers that it is possible to go astray . I am informed that in the Western States and in Massachusetts , where so many associations have been for years in operation , no instance of a failure is on record . In the early history of the associations in Pennsylvania some of them did not work out satisfactorily ; but this was because of ignorance in their Board of Directors . The premiums were paid on the " gross plan , " and early retiring members were allowed so large a share of the apparent immediate profits that those who remained " came short , " and the date of maturity was unduly prolonged . The largest list of failures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York State . Before the year 1851 several associations were organized in this city without the assistance of a legislative enactment . The popularity of the idea became so great that an " act for the incorporation of building , mutual loan , and accumulating fund associations " was passed by the Legislature in 1851 , and it is stated that by 1856 one hundred and twenty-four of them were doing business in this State , while already it appears that more than thirty had gone out of existence . A reaction set in , and complaints by members were so frequent that the Legislature in 1855 appointed a special committee to investigate the subject and ascertain the cause of the trouble . Their report is numbered 46 in volume iii . of Assembly Documents . This report specifies two causes " which have had much to do with the creation and embarrassment of these associations . " The one " was the commercial activity which followed the discoveries on the Pacific , " and the other , " the commercial crisis consequent upon an extended trade which those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation almost everybody felt able to assume the responsibility of the payment of dues and interest , as well as a liberal premium . When hard times came members could not meet their payments , and when they found that their investments were likely to be lost through foreclosure , they appealed to the courts and the Legislature for relief . This cause of trouble might have affected only the defaulting members , and not the associations as a whole , but many of the early associations accepted second mortgages as security , and this , the report says , was one fruitful source of complaint . Mismanagement by the officers was also charged . The rush of withdrawals was so great that in some associations the receipts were put up at auction , and the person who would take the smallest sum for his // shares was paid off first . The evils of the system seemed so great to this committee that they recommended a repeal of the act . Judge Seymour Dexter , in a paper read last autumn before the Social Science Association , cited some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized in Rochester , in 1852 , was wound up , having failed to realize the expectations of its members , probably from the causes just named . The next effort in that city was made nineteen years later , and in the ensuing years a number of associations were organized there ; but some " Building Lot Associations , " which had in view a realestate speculation , were also founded there at the same time . The latter came to grief , and having been confounded in the public understanding with Building and Loan Associations , these received much injury . Two or three associations in existence in Albany in 1871 lost heavily through bad management , some of their loans having been made on second mortgages . One association organized in Elmira and another in Waverly , in 1871 , were closed before maturity , with consent of the stockholders . An association started in Elmira , in 1875 , began with by-laws accepting no premium of less than $40 a share ( twenty per cent . ) . There was great demand for the stock at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borrowing slackened , the minimum rate of premium was reduced one-half without obviating the trouble . Eight years ago the minimum premium was abolished entirely , and , we are told , " from that time the association began to grow in popularity . Its money was readily loaned , and , while it received only $62 on $40,750 borrowed in 1887 , and $232 on $60,000 borrowed in 1868 , it is maturing a series of shares every year to the satisfaction of its shareholders , ninety-five per cent . of whom are wage-earners . " The age of each series is about eleven years . This Elmira example is worthy of study by anyone who thinks that large premiums are necessary to an association 's prosperity . Of the unsuccessful early New York associations , all , I believe , were organized on the " terminating and gross premium " plan . The Legislature of Connecticut caused an investigation of the associations in that State to be made some thirty years ago , and in 1860 they were forbidden to receive deposits after January 1 , 1862 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shareholders by July 1 , 1886 . The system is , however , becoming popular again in that State . Mr. C. F. Southard , of New York , who is assisting in the organization of many associations in this State , read a paper on " The Dangerous Side of Building Associations " before the American Social Science Association last September . In this he pointed out , as " the three leading dangers which menace this plan of banking in all the States to-day , " the following : ( 1 ) Permitting a single member to hold a large number of shares of stock and borrow on them ; ( 2 ) the plan in general use of deducting the bonus bid from the sum borrowed ; ( 3 ) the almost utter lack of knowledge by directors of the simple principles governing finance , and a criminal carelessness in the matter of informing themselves in reference to the same . But , when well managed , Mr. Southard calls this system " the grandest , simplest , and most successful plan of co-operation ever made practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of this system of investment is increased directly in proportion as its original purpose is adhered to or departed from . As a means of speculation it should take no part . Well-managed associations limit the amount of stock which one member may hold , and , consequently , the amount of money which he can borrow . In some States this limit is fixed by law , as in Massachusetts , where the maximum is twenty-five shares ; the New York act of 1875 limits the number of shares which a person may hold in one series to ten unpledged and twenty pledged . Some localities are much better adapted to this form of co-operation than others . It would have a poor field in a Newport or a Lenox , where there is no considerable body of wage-earners . The more expensive land is in any place , the larger are the loans required by each member and the greater is the risk to the lender . The limited area of New York City makes it a less available // field than Philadelphia , Chicago , and St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called a city of tenements , while the others boast that they are cities of homes . Where the membership is made up principally of persons who are not strictly wage-earners the officers are likely to be men on whose time there are many demands , and who are not , therefore , regular in their attendance on the meetings . Complaints on this ground are made in regard to some New York City associations , and they are serious . Another warning ought not to be overlooked . Attracted by the success of the honestly co-operative associations , corporations have been formed in several States to carry on the business on a " national " plan , as it is styled ; that is , to conduct a money-loaning scheme under the guise of a Building . and Loan Association , but to lend money in all parts of the country , and to secure profits to persons who are not contributors of dues . These " national " associations are attracting much attention in the West , and the genuine Building and Loan Associations , realizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are moving against them . In fllinois an act is now before the Legislature , and will doubtless be passed , prohibiting associations organized outside of the State from doing business in it , and the State associations from doing business outside of the State 's limits . The Savings Bank Commissioners of Massachusetts have rifled that loans can be made by the co-operative banks only on real estate within the State . Building and Loan Associations have a value to any community aside from their pecuniary aspect , which is always recognized wherever they have been established . Albert Shaw , Ph.D. , in voL i. , No. 4 , Publications of the American Economic Association , says : " The success of the Building Societies in St. Paul is quite as complete , all things considered , as in the Pennsylvania cities . They have become an accepted local institution , destined to play a growingly important part in the building up of the city , and in the development of thrift and providence among wage-earners . . . . But even more important than their mere material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been their social and mQral value , in counteracting the tendency of a city population to wider divergence between rich and poor , and to the development of a prol- ' etariat class . The typical American citizen is a free-holder , and has a home which is his castle . His independence and his virtue depend not a little upon his worldly condition . The Building Society is above all things to be commended as a conservator of the home and family institutions that underlie all our national greatness and power . " F. A. Richards , Bank Examiner in Maine , in a report of this year on the associations of that State , says : " The key to the almost uniform success of Building and Loan Associations is to be found in the intimate relations which they hold to shareholders , and especially to borrowers . Not only do they make it possible for persons having but small incomes to build homes for themselves by loaning money on unfinished property , as the money is needed to advance the work , repayable in small instalments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the borrower . The condition and situation of his property , the plans of the architect , the estimates , the character of the contractor , the building material , the work of the builder-all are carefully inspected by competent judges , and subject to their approvaL The Building and Loan Association thus forms a supervisory board , whose assistance to the borrower is invaluable . . . . The educational character of these institutions is far from being one of their least important features . " Willis S. Paine , LL.D. , Superintendent of the Banking Department of New York State , in the introduction to his recently published work on the New York laws relating to Building Associations , says : " These associations serve as a barrier against the dangerous paternalism urged on the State by men of questionable statesmanship , and they become likewise the foes of communism , creating habits of accumulation and assuring the privacy of homes . Such organizations become // indirectly valuable moral agencies as a partial solution of the tenement-house problem , and hence are worthy of careful attention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic life , and full sway for the influence of wise training and good example . Whatever helps to remove the youth of the nation from the terrible and ever-present temptations of many of the crowded tenementdens , from the accustomed debaucheries of drunken wretches in neighboring rooms , * , nd from the shamelessness of those who oftentimes exist in them , works blessings for the peace and prosperity of the State . They are not a cureall , however , but may , if loosely managed , prove a serious injury to the frugal and industrious wage-earners who invest in them . " The Chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Statistics of Labor and Industries said , in his Report for 1886 : " From the reports which have been forwarded to the Bureau these New Jersey associations are generally in a very prosperous condition , and a great benefit , not only to the individual members , but to the community at large ; for they are increasing the number of tax-paying , property-owning citizens , and making it comparatively easy for an industrious working-man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
