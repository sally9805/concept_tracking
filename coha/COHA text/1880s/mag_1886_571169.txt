ARTiCLE IV . - GOVERNMENT BY PARTY . IL THE PARTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION . ( Continued from the November Number , 1885 . ) THE natural conditions upon which our material civilization depends have been completed by a purely artificial expedient of our own , the adaption of money and the substitutes for money as the universal medium of exchanges . Society gets beyond the simple companionships of the primitive family or tribe when men begin to satisfy novel wants by trading off their superfluities for those of their neighbors . But it does not get very far , partly because the commodities themselves will not go very far , partly because they will not last very long , and partly because it is not easy to find in one of them a fair equivalent for any of the others . The superfluous sheep of one tribe may be exchanged for the superfluous bullocks or camels of the adjoining one , but not for property of any kind beyond the range to which the sheep can be driven , or beyond the period to which sheep may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and space the exchange can hardly be effected without loss to one side or the other , because the value of sheep can not be exactly rendered in camels or cows or other commodities of the kind . Crude wealth , property in the products of the soil and in the flocks and herds supported by them , has a relatively small exchangeable value , it is so perishable , so hard to carry away , and so indeterminable in value . In general its characteristic is immobility , its insusceptibility to minute and wide distribution . Its tendency is to stay where it is , to multiply and accumulate on the hands which already possess it . The result is the concentration of the wealth of the community among the chief men in it , and the isolation of the community itself , which , having nothing to give to or take from its remoter neighbors , is left to work out its own civilization apart , according to its own unaided lights and resources . A medium of exchanges is simply a commodity with an intrinsic value like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 bining certain properties in which they are wanting . Gold for example , which is likely to become the sole medium , carries a great and a nearly indestructible , value in a small bulk ; it has a persistent uniformity of substance , so that one unit of it is the exact equivalent of every other anywhere and always ; and it admits of minute and exact subdivisions , so that it can be distributed among many owners as the . representative of small values or fractions of value . In a word it will go anywhere , and wherever it goes all men are glad to take it in exchange for any kind or quantity of property . The moment a common standard and medium like this is agreed upon , and so far as agreed upon , wealth of all sorts begins to decentralize and redistribute itself . The exceeding mobility of the medium sets up a universal movement . The great cattle owner can now sell his superfluous sheep for an article which will purchase a thousand useful things which sheep would not purchase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold things which would not purchase sheep . Thus men who before were rich by having a great deal of one commodity are now rich by having a little of many ; wealth accumulated in any form is broken up and set flowing to all quarters in ever widening circuits , with an increasing tendency to equable diffusion among all the individuals of the community . Moreover the community itself is brought into relations with more and remote ones . It has perhaps no indigenous products which can be transported or sold beyond its own frontiers , but if it has gold it can always coiiimand any transportable thing in the most distant quarter of the globe . The result of all this has been a real federation of very nearly the whole human race , in which the diversified wants and accumulated experiences of each confederate are brought to bear on the producing capaci. ties of all the others ; and a homogeneous civilization is slowly diffusing itself , with the diffusion of varied wealth , through ancient barriers of language , law , religion , and race to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or directly related , to the fact that gold , or whatever is the medium , has , what other commodities have not , a universal purchasing power-it will buy anything in any quantity anywhere . But for this very reason // all men are more eager to get it than they are to get anything else whatsoever . It becomes the prominent object of competition ; and forasmuch as men 's avidities and abilities differ endlessly , some of the competitors will get more than others . While therefore the general tendency is toward the widest diffusion and the most equable distribution of wealth , and while that is the inevitable ultimate effect , the first effect is concentration in the hands of the most acquisitive competitors . We have the old inequality back again , only this time the concentration is not principally in the shape of lands , or cattle , or corn , or other the like crude commodities , but of the one commodity which never fails to command all these things . This concentration is worse than the other in this respect , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium than you can into any single thing the medium will buy , that you can get it there quicker and keep it there longer , and that you can do a great deal more with it . It is vastly better in this , that money has a mobility nothing else has , and that this mobility is ceaselessly played upon by the most multifarious and aggressive kinds of competition . The great and disquieting evil of our times is no longer the inordinate greed and enormous acquisitions of land , upon which so many ancient oppressions were founded , for the simple reason that this is not now the form of property for which men in general have the most pressing need . The great landed estates are evidently doomed to dispersion , even in communities where ancient traditions and sentimenfs , and the careful contrivances of the law , are all at work to protect them . At any rate it is certain that our coming troubles are the portentous accumulations of money and of capital directly convertible into money , that is to say , of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are no assignable limits to the havoc that might be wrought by a dozen consenting capitalists like Vanderbilt and Gould . But on the other hand they are operating with the most unstable and fugitive of forces , in the most uncertain surroundings and the most incalculable conditions . They have to deal with an assemblage of unrelenting rivalries that may be trusted , in the long run , to dissolve the most massive fortunes , and whose tendency is always and irresistibly toward the // wider diffusion of wealth and the more equable participation of all men in it . Now , for obvious reasons , there is no individual , or corporation , or society , so profoundly affected by the change in economic conditions as the State itself , whose prime function is the guardianship of these vast and varied activities . In the age of barter it collected its power in the crude form , as the trader collected the cattle or corn or slaves , owing to him ; that is , it drew directly on the population for the men and the material required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of uniform distribution among the contributors , nor can it be accurately adjusted to the wants of the State ; it is sure to fall with heavier weight upon some than upon the others , and is always accompanied by an amount of profusion and waste profitable to the governing class . The whole community suffers in its political , as in its commercial affairs , by the immobility of the form in which political power must be created . But with the adoption of a medium in which all claims may be satisfied and all payments made , tribute can be apportioned with something like uniformity to all the subjects alike , and when obtained it can be expended , without wastes , for all the elements and instruments of power , of the very kinds , in the very amounts required . There is now the possibility of restricting power to its appropriate uses , and of associating all men on equal terms in the creation and control of it . But while this is perfectly true , while the whole tendency of things in politics as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other , is toward the widest diffusion and the most equable distribution of responsibilities and of rights , it is also true that the government , that is , the men entrusted with the handling of public power , avail of all the properties of the medium in which the power is created . A tax in money may be distributed uniformly among all the subjects , as a requisition for men or material could not ; for that very reason it will reach resources that were untouched before . It will carry to the entire population a burden that was confined to a part of it ; for that very reason the burden may be increased without rousing attention and resistance . Again , it may be accumulated in unsuspected amounts , and // expended for unavowed or secret purposes , as men and material could not be . Now add to this occult and effective force of money , the force of a promise to pay money bye and bye , the credit of the government to its accumulated and available resources , the ability to anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate exigencies upon future generations without consulting them . Is it difficult to understand that the very change in economic conditions which has made possible the great democratic ideals of the sovereignty of the people and the brotherhood of man , has put into the hands of the government , as into the hands of the capitalist , an instrument more potent for evil than government ever had before ? If wealth , disputed by a myriad competitors and on its way to universal redistribution , tends to concentrate in the hands of the strongest competitor , how much more the power purchasable by wealth in the hands of the government . We have only to suppose that the old barbaric motives survive among the appliances of civilization , to explain all the anomalies of modern society . Germany , for example , is still a barbarian power , and her rulers men of the barbaric type , because her armies are filled by direct , compulsory draft upon the people ; and this again , because the enemies she has found or created can not be faced with any armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this armament avail her , had not modern finance furnished her with the means to equip and sustain it ? As all her neighbors on the continent are in like case , the famous diplomacy which has made the German Chancellor the arbiter of European politics is no more than skillful manipulation of the rivalries that immobilize brute forces , without a trace of the characteristic intelligence and temper of the age in it  --  the whole situation a savage anachronism , maintained beyond its time by the agencies of a civilization it disfigures and insults . It is only the other day that we ourselves were taken in the same straits ; that is , we required a power money could not buy and which , therefore , could not be raised in the form of money . In the last agony of a desperate conflict we had to arm by a cruel conscription , whose sacrifice were borne mostly by the men , and the families of the men , upon whom it // fell ; nor would this have availed could we not have drawn upon the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bare perpetuation of these necessities would have sufficed to arrest the normal development of our society by uncontrollable excesses in the creation and employment of public power . With concentration of all the forces of the community in the hands of the government for the one purpose of destruction , what hope or chance was there for those diffusive and equalizing tendencies upon which our civilization depends ? The happy peculiarity of the situation was , that our return to the barbaric agents and methods of the past was but for the moment and for the extinction of a worse barbarism . The victory over the slaveholders ' rebellion at once swept out of the State the last of its unrighteous inequalities , and delivered us , in the plenitude of our power , from all further necessity for exhausting efforts . No irreconcilable interests of different sections , no enduring antipathies of race or class , survived to disturb the internal order ; no formidable foe lay within striking distance of our frontiers . In the instantaneous solution of all our earlier problems , we had acquired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the constituents were equalized , and had brought public power down to dimensions and into a form which admitted of easy and equable distributions of its burden among them . It was a prodigious revolution , in the scope and completeness of it without precedent in political history . For the first time a great State faced the problen of government stripped of all confusing accessories and perilous complications , reduced to the simple terms of a problem in finance ; how to get a perfectly calculable sum of money by uniform taxation of all the wealth within its domains . It is of the last importance that we assure ourselves of these abiding conditions into which public power was brought by the close of the civil war , before we touch the abuses to which it has lent itself during the last twenty years . They are but an incident and an episode of its decentralization , the momentary detention in unguarded and unscruplous hands of fragments of a vast accumulation surviving the emergency which created it , doomed to dispersion under all the permanent forces of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tremendous necessities of the war ; but not the fiscal system which had provided for them . The government had no difficulty in disbanding its victorious armies , discharging superfluous employees , countermanding prospective contracts , and stopping expenditures which had no longer an object ; but it could not at once reduce its monetary establishments to the easy requirements of peace . It was impossible to repeal the vast and complicated legislation which had spread a net-work of taxes over all the capital and industries of the country without putting something in the place of it ; and while the legislation stood , the machinery which gave it effect stood with it . The problem , as I have said , was simply a problem in political finance , but problems in political finance are not themselves simple , and this one in the magnitude and perplexities of it was wholly without precedent in human history . How to collect all the available power of the community for protection against imminent and continuing dangers , is the task that has been set to every other considerable state of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us alone to unarm as prouiptly as we had armed , to stop the inflow of exaggerated and redundant revenue by bringing down the law and the apparatus of law , from the dimensions of war to the dimensions of peace . What revenue does the state require for its diminished liabilities , and how can this amount be apportioned to the wealth of the country ? Nothing sounds simpler than the question put that way . What is that boasted initiative of goverufrient that we have confided to our rulers good for , if it can not solve , off-hand , a little problem like that ? Unhappily for the initiative of government and for the men who held it and for the people who chose them , the question was put another way , without precedents and without warning , in the midst of all the confusion and the dazzling lights of the ended war , by an unforseen and incomprehensible situation . Any actuary could have calculated in his office the probable amount of money required by the government for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to the distribution of the national wealth . I do not believe the statesman ever lived who could have promptly evoked the requisite measures out of the fiscal system actually in force ; and that was the thing to be done . // In these circumstances we need not wonder that the government lost its initiative  --  and its head ; that the readjustment of the lightened bnrden of taxation was not determined by any high political ideals , or by the established and commanding principle of our system . The continuity of our development was interrupted for the moment by the hazards and the clamor of the hour ; taxes were taken off to please the classes who were restive under them , or left on to please the classes who wanted them on . The people , wearied by long strife and preoccupied by its own affairs in the reviving prosperities of the country , was absent from the scene ; the vast and rival interests that had risen round the State in the operations of the war , thronged to the capital and were masters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the government were blown about like a weather-vane in conflicting winds , a turmoil and uproar of insistent interests which at last left to the government but one unmoving foothold and one continuing motive , namely , the interest of the governing body itself . How to negotiate new alliances by profitable surrenders , by illimitable servility to multiply its resources and consolidate its power-this became the problem of the men whose predecessors had solved triumphantly the high problems of the first era of American history . Again 1 say , let us not forget the new conditions in which all this happened ; or the old fact I have spoken of before , that in this way all government grows , through continuous acquisitions of power purchased by continuous cessions of the pffzes and profits of government . The scandals we blush for are but an incident on the way to that final redistribution of all political prerogative , which is the sovereignty of the people . i-As was to have been expected , the more urgent demands upon the government for the remission of taxes did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from those who thought they did ; in other words , according to the familiar experience of all financial legislation , from the classes subjected to direct taxation . The individual who had an annual income of $10,000 , was probably paying a large fraction of it in minute sums , without thinking about it , as increased cost for the necessaries and luxuries of life . What he was distinctly aware of and restless under was the sum taken out of it // en*loc as undisguised income-tax . On the eve of commercial enterprises that required all the means left over by the annual consumption of the country , instant pressure was put on the government to take off all taxes which palpably diminished the available amount of capital or of the credit founded upon it . All these taxes were included in the Internal Revenue Act of 1862 ; and , accordingly , it was mainly by successive amendments to this act that the revenues of the government have been reduced hitherto . In itself this was a reasonable concession to the natural demands of trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than another , and profitable to the government only as it diffused everywhere a feeling of relief from vexatious restrictions . The full effect of it was exhausted in the act itself of repealing the duties , and involved no partizan alliances except so far as one remission was granted sooner than another . The real alliances , and the direct profit to the government , arose with the retention of taxes , in obedience to the urgency of classes interested for any reason in keeping them on ; for they were in a condition , which the others were not , of making their continued support of the government dependent on the continuance of the tax . Such , in some obscure way , was the effect of maintaining the duty on bankcirculation ; more obvious that of the continued duties upon tobacco ; most obvious of all , so far as the Internal Revenue tariff was concerned , that of the duties on alcoholic fluids . Without really offending anybody , since the subjects of the tax themselves*felt the fitness of it , the temperance sentiment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and told in many a hotly contested election down to the diversion of 1884 , when it outran the concessions of the government , and went off after a candidate of its own with fatal effect . But the class of taxes around which gathered the most powerful and active coalition of interests was the duties on imports , the effect of which was to close the market to foreign competition , and to create within it an artificial price for the home product . By the simple fact that in the apparently inexhaustible American market American wares could be sure of selling for more than they were worth , all branches of manufactures were stimulated into sudden development , and the // manufacturers , in the very act of preparing to dispute the market with one another , rallied as one man to extort the maintenance of the duties on which their fortunes were supposed to depend . What in normal conditions of trade is a mere matter of business enterprise became a subject of special legislation and an exciting form of political activity . A new wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discordant materials of all the parties , drawn together by interests and with a doctrine unknown to any of them , save as themes for academic discussion and platform truisms . What it claimed , under the sounding phrase of protection to American Industry , which took in the very men who used it , was the continued power to sell goods up to the margin of values established by the protective tariff ; what it offered was votes , and the various means to get more votes when more were wanted . The alliance was practically concluded on the terms proposed , and for twenty years successive Republican administrations were kept in place by the ever heartier support of the manufacturing class . Let it not be forgotten , however , that there is no need for suggesting corrupt motives or clandestine agreements in any of these measures . Time out of mind , and everywhere , they have been freely used as legitimate devices of party warfare . They have the perfect frankness of all public legislation , and they take effect , upon whole masses of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be direct and conscious parties to corrupt negotiations . But when this qualification has been made it must be said that , upon the whole , it does not appear that the subsiding volume of public revenue could have been manipulated in a manner more profitable to the government . The control of the entire system of taxation , the undefined right of readjusting diminishing burdens to growing wealth , in its own way , was played for all it was worth , from the fall of the rebellion to the fall of the Republican party . All these are the excusable abuses that accompany the creation of power . We have next to consider abuses , of a far graver kind , that go with the employment of power . No system of taxation can be openly profligate in a society like ours . No expenditure of public money for profit of the government can be otherwise in any .
