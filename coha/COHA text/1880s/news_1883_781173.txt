I called him for $1.000 more , which be said he would put up Monday morning . He failed to do so , and when I naked him about it he said ho would fix it this morning . He has fixed it by getting oat this injunction . We have bought of him 10,000 bushels of May wheat and sold him 16,000 bushels of May corn . The situation of the entire deal to-day is about 51800 in our favor . Under the rule , if a call for margin is not answered within an hour the person making the call has a right to bid in the grain and then obtain redress from the board . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

This action would not he so bad in anyone who bad been badly squeezed by corners , but it is contemptible in a man like Lyon , who has been engineering corners and cliques , to resort to such methods .
