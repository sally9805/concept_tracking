Tn* most important elective office in the world to-day is the Presidency of the United States . Judged by the character and ability of the men who have thus far filled the Presidential chair , American democracy has no reason to dread comparison with other and older systems of government . If there have been in our history some conspicuous failures toelect good representatives of American statesmanship to the highestplace in the giftof the people , those failures have been so few and far between tbatthey must be regarded as the exceptions which prove the rule . Yet it can not be denied that there is a rapidly growing spirit which teaches that , in the matter of Presidents , we are to look out for the impossible , and prepare to content ourselves with makeshift mediocrity . This spirit has grown from the belief that , amid the din and strife of party struggle , scandal is too busy withthe namesof those.who have served the state long **25;449;TOOLONG theirfacing the light that beats so fiercely and falsely upon a Presidential candidate . It is true that , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the myihology of scandal , and accept more willingly the teles of good or evil that float from mouth to mouth . And the more conspicuous the subject the more marked is the tendency toidolize or to depreciate . We know that Washington himself was not exempt from the fulsome adulation and the slanderous vituperation that follow in the wake of glory . But in tunes of calm we may look for calmer judgments . We may even look for mercy in its more tempered state . It has seemed , therefore , a good time , at this distance from the date of Presidential nominatious , to offer the readers of the Nonru Axzmc* REVIEW a series of articles on possible Presidential candidates of the great parties . Each zf these articles will be written by a friendly // hand , and each of them will endeavor to set forth the respective merits , or claims , or fitness , of some conspicuous public man , whose talents , services , or popularity , have seemed to designate him as a possible President . Certainly it is not within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but the power of friendly pens in attempting calmly and fairly to present the claims of men of mark to the Chief Magistracy . For the slanders and disparagements of a Presidential campaign will do enough to offset any partial prejudice of the present writers . Standing then , as it were , at the very bar of judgment , the Presidential candidate has little to hope from his enemies . As some one has wittily remarked , " There is one thing to be said In favor of running for the Presidency : the citizen who survives the ordeal has nothing to fear from the day of judgment ; for he knows that all his sins and shortcomings have been published in this world . " ALLE*I THOUtrDIKE RICE . JAMES G. BLAINE . IT has been well said that ideals have more influence upon the world than ideas . It might be better said that ideas chiefly influence the world through ideals . Whether the question be religion or patriotism , the infinite possibilities of material resource or of individual freedom , it is , so to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ineffective , till some leader arises who flashes upon it the light of his personality ,  --  and forthwith the vague idea shapes itself , an army is organized and mobilized , and the world makes a visible and permanent upward movement . The Republican party is rich in men who would serve it well in the Presidency , but Mr. Blame is the leading Presidential candidate of the Republican party , and the only popular Presidential candidate of any party . In his personality centres an interest for which many reasons have been given by friend and foe , while there remains ever something that eludes explanation . It is an interest which strengthens alike under incessant activity and under profound silence ; in the full sunlight of publicity no more than in the seclusion of strictest privacy . Wherever Mr. Blame moves the eyes of his countrymen follow . But a few days ago , in a carefully cherished autograph book , we were shown a carelessly pencilled note from Mr. Garfield long antedating his Presidency , with an explanation that during a session of the Electoral Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded court room . Every square inch seemed pre-empted , but a seat was instantly proffered him . Whereupon a Senator pencilled to Mr. Garfield the simple yet significant question : " Do you sup- // 223 pose there is any assembly in America that Blame could enter , however crowded it was , that somebody would n't instantly find a chair for him ? "  --  a note which Mr. Garfield laughingly indorsed and passed on to the next man . It is significant because of what it signifies . It marks the attention , not merely admiring , but affectionate , which Mr. Blame 's presence invariably attracts , and which , indeed , is far from being limited to his presence . So powerful is his personality , that thousands who have never seen him have yet come under its spell . When he rises to speak in the Senate , the other chamber and the corridors are emptied . If he goes as a private citizen to help in a Pennsylvania election , his compatriots turn it into a triumphal progress . He stands before an Ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his few hearty , practical , merry , and serious words bring out the clerical huzzas and handkerchiefs in as wild a snow-storm as if it were a nominating convention . He is summoned by a legislative committee to testify on a question of plumbing , and forthwith a stream of life rushes through the pipes of every newspaper on the ground . He consents to speak a word for unhappy Ireland to a local assembly in a provincial city , and instantly the electric wires are stretched into the British Parliament , and the Tories of England rage over their morning tea and toast as vigorously as if it were a deliverance from the Opposition Benches . He changes skies , but his observers do not change mind . On the contrary a syndicate seems to have taken out a contract to supply America with Blame items at whatever cost to truth and type . The brain reels but follows . Mr. Blame has gone on a cosmopolitan mission , embracing the pontificate , the German Empire , the Irish autonomy , at the same moment that he is shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ohio State Convention . He is betraying the Irish cause under the fascinations of Tory drawing-rooms , while in the same pyrotechnic paragraph the Tories are sternly rebuking the American Minister for visiting Mr. Blame 's political sins with the punishment of social ostracism . We have hardly had time to force the bidden tear over his internal , unnamed , and mysterious , but complicated and fateful , disorders , before he is whirled from his sick bed and set to steering an endangered boat out of the jaws of death under the Bridge of Earn . Whatever feats of biography the future may have in store // for us , one fact is demonstrated the reporters have a perfect and touching confidence in the interest with which the people regard Mr. Blame . Nothing can be more naive or engaging than their child-like trust that his name on their wares makes their wares a marketable commodity , however grotesque and out of drawing those wares may be . And there is always the stimulus of knowing that it is a fund which can never be overdrawn ; since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsets the comment , it is only to rush into black letter head-lines that " Mr. Blame Changes His Mind . " In the economy of the world this interesting and powerful personality would be ill-placed , would perhaps be impossible if it were not allied with large ability . Mr. Blame is by every endowment of his nature a statesman . His mind moves naturally , freely , with buoyancy and exultation , on broad national and international lines . He divines a danger or a promise to the country by that swift process of reasoning which is called intuition . To minds of more limited scope and slower motion his course seems erratic , " dramatic , " inexplicable , or explicable only on some petty ground . Whereas his course is invariably along a steady , self-impelling principle . His action , therefore , is consistent and becomes presently and openly justified . Using language with singular and scholarly accuracy , he is greatly liable to be misunderstood and misconstrued by men who read and render language with the ordinary careless inaccuracy ; as when , before its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical political history , was widely pre-outlined in the press as " Twenty Years in Congress , " a volume of personal reminiscence ; as when the proffered choice " between the civilization of Christ and the civilization of Confucius " was sharply arraigned and condemned as a choice " between the religion of Christ and the religion of Confucius ; " or as when the entirely practicable demand that the Chinese should not be allowed unrestrictedly to come , was translated into the vulgar and impracticable demand that " the Chinese must go . " Mr. Blame 's course regarding the Chinese question furnishes a good illustration of his superior political insight . When it first became a subject of Congressional debate California was chiefly interested . Not only the whole Atlantic Coast , but the whole interior , was practically indifferent to the question of // Chinese or any other immigration . With California it was a matter of primary and pressing moment . California uttered a cry of distress . Mr. Blame , it may almost be said alone , grasped the situation , used the opportunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effect was as when hot iron is suddenly immersed in cold water . The sizzling hissed over the continent . The sentiment and tradition of the country were up in arms . So far as the question had been considered at all it had been considered in its sentimental aspect . America was the asylum of the world and the asylum of the world it must remain . The fathers had made America the refuge of the oppressed and the refuge of the oppressed it must continue . Religion and politics , for that time at least , laid down their warfare and joined in the stern iteration that God had made of one blood all nations of men ; and both alike forgot to finish the quotation and iterate that the same Supreme Power had determined the bounds of their habitation . Mr. Blame became , therefore , for a while , the object of extreme and almost violent objurgation . He was pandering to the hoodlums and the Sandlots for votes ,  --  though it should have been palpable to the most superficial observer that for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty votes in the East . He was dishonoring the fathers and disgracing our country before the world by making her false to the genius of her institutions , though a very little accurate history shows that the fathers troubled themselves not at all about the genius of their institutions and made short work of turning back the Chinese of their day , or even of turning out the few who squeezed in through the lines . Public men , even of his own party , were against him . Many antagonized his position openly . Many more were disapprovingly silent . Probably no political opposition was ever more universal , more natural , more hearty and conscientious . Much of the hostility which Mr. Blame has encountered has been purely positional , artificial , fabricated under the necessity of preventing him from obtaining office . But this was sincere and spontaneous . Without regard to party or place the country honestly believed that his attitude was anti-Republican , antiDemocratic , anti-American , anti-Christian ,  --  a reversal of the policy of the fathers , a surrender of the principles upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of Christ . // The world has rolled on , and by the logic of events Mr. Blame has been more than justified . The question of immigration , of which the Chinese question is but a single phase , has come to the front as a question of immediate concern to the welfare , to the very existence of the nation . As I write these words , the newspapers , even those which were most strenuous against Mr. Blame 's f un-American policy , " are resounding with protests against unrestricted immigration ; against permitting our shores to be submerged by the tide of foreign ignorance , incapacity , and immorality ; against suffocating the republic with an alien element impossible of assimilation . Nay , since these last words were written , I find religious authority suggesting that " it would be a good thing to prevent all immigration to the United States from every country under the sun for the next twenty-five years , till we can have time to assimilate the something more than eight millions of foreigners which we now have , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous strain upon a government like ours in attempting to blend and weld such a mass into constituent parts of a free and orderly republic , " and that " no considerations of sentiment or tradition should keep us from searching out and applying a remedy for this very serious and menacing evil . " The " one blood " and the " asylum " theory have , under stress , been set aside in favor of self-preservation ; and the objection to anti-Chinese legislation is that it is not broad enough-is an unfair discrimination against one race which is to be remedied by legislating against all ! But to see the situation clearly beforehand , and to take timely action , is what constitutes the difference between the statesman and the " mob of gentlemen who write with ease . " No credit is due to Mr. Blame for discerning the danger years before it became visible to the naked eye of the populace . He could not help it . He was endowed with the statesman*s vision . No credit is due him for maintaining his position against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help it . The necessity made itself so felt that there was nothing else to do . Consequently there was no heroism in doing it ; for just as clearly as he saw the darkening cloud , just so clearly he saw that his country must presently discern it also , and would ultimately second the efforts which were now resisted . Mr. Blame is the most prominent Presidential candidate of the // people , because a great mass of sensitive , acute , proud , and patriotic Americans believe that when a man sees more quickly and clearly than others the dangers to which the nation is exposed , and shows himself prompt , fertile , and fearless in resources against them , the interests of the country require that this man should be put in command . There are many thousands of personally unambitious , straight-forward , and clear-sighted men , who would like once more to try the experiment , not unknown among us , of putting a statesman at the head of the State . But the statesman is not only quick to discern and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages . Garfield 's short administration was shorter even than the calendar shows . During its two closing months , a whole people dwelt hushed and stricken , in the valley of the Shadow of Death . The utmost actual work of the Administration was confined within four months , yet during that short period two statesmen , men of ideas , moved by one lofty patriotism , sent new life coursing through the nation 's veins . Previous to this time it might almost be said that we had no foreign relations . After the young republic had cut loose from the mother country and shown her independence in certain apparently inevitable wars she seemed to think her place in the world permanently assured if not assigned , and gave herself strictly to minding her own business . Reared in the principle of Washington to friendshzp with all , entangling alliance8 with none , confident in the power of her isolation behind her barriers of the sea , strong in the infinite resources of her continental domain , the Republic was content to work on with a giant 's force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world . It was like Hawthorne 's rowing and forging ahead , with never a protest that the second oarsman was all the while rowing against him . America was getting over the course with unexampled rapidity , but with a wholly unnecessary tug and sweat , and slowness even , because the crack oarsman of the world was in the same boat , and steadfastly pulling the other way . In their one swift moment of place and power , President Garfield and Mr. Blame changed all this . They recognized that a time may come when one will best mind his own business by paying a little attention to the business of other people . While an infant nation may well use its isolation for the development of its own practically // incxhaustible internal resources , and while prosperity , on such , a basis , may become not only stable but phenomenal , they recognized also that steam and electricity have changed the conditions of the world , have annihilated time and space ; that almost without knowing it we had perforce entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimate and practical part , of the brotherhood of nations . We had become a standing , if silent , menace to the outworn , a living encouragement to the new spirit . Old nations , less confident than we in their inward vitality , more eager than we to strengthen themselves at every assailable point , because we did not feel ourselves assailable , were securing every vantage ground , while we maintained an indifference seemingly altogether stolid , yet , perhaps , a little sublime . Certainly , if it was not a noble it was a not wholly ignoble indifference , begotten as it was of a too tranquil faith in our institutions . President Garfield sent Mr. Blame to the fore , and it ceased to be indifference at all . Our foreign relations , before invisible , came out under his warm breath in legible not only , but in glowing characters . Men saw that the great republic had reached the hour when she should be no longer supinely content in her prosperity , but should lead the continent forward . Though she loitered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade and commerct* were struggling for greater scope . If America refused to take her true place , she would lose it , for the vigilant nations were ready , were even then on the noiseless advance . The great Republic stirred . Not a single member of the sisterhood of republics , however weak , or far , or torn with internal dissensions , but felt the thrill of this new contact . England , strong , alert , clever , eternally aggressive , with long experience , and without a rival , felt herself unceremoniously jostled at the gates where she had been wont to enter supreme . In tropical seas , on the Pacific coast , wherever she had been steadily , not to say stealthily , penetrating , suddenly the bells struck , the banners flew , the gates slammed , and , in diplomatic but determined language , that enterprising and persistent island sovereignty was " given notice . " It was but for a moment . Death came and the status quo was restored . But the silence will never again be quite the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationality had been aroused . Pride of country , the consciousness // of power had awakened . It had been perceived that the republic owes a duty to her own citizens commensurate with her resources ; that it is not enough to be doing well ; noblesse oblige ; the occasion demands that we do our best ; it is shameful for a great nation to fall below the opportunity and abandon to other nations the place , the advantages , the trade and commerce , the influence and the prestige that of right belong to her . All this , lying undefined in the heart of American manhood , especially of young American manhood , was stimulated into efficient activity , took form and direction under a guiding hand , and will never be forgotten . Mr. Blame is the leading Presidential candidate of the country because he recognized her honorable ambition , sought to open new channels for her restless energies , and showed in his short sole term of office that American citizenship would not degenerate in his hands , but would advance to greater opportunity at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the points on which he has thrown light , the questions which he has seized and held up before his countrymen , showed in their various phases and has set in their true position , would be to write his biography . Wherever there has been a policy to be defined , a pledge to be redeemed , a liberty to be secured , a debt to be paid , a right to be defended , a wrong to be prevented , a danger to be avoided or defied , there his voice has given unmistakable utterance . He has never evaded a real issue ; he has never been forced into a false issue . No pressure of political necessity has ever imposed upon his allegiance or his advocacy a platitude for a principle , an administrative detail for a national policy , a disputed experiment for a universal solvent , speech for silence , or silence for speech . He is a man of genius in the sphere of state-craft . In that sphere his resources seem to be inexhaustible . It has been foolishly said that the politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next age . The man who confines himself to the next age may be a dreamer , a philosopher , a scientist , a useful man in his way , but he is not a statesman . The statesman is just as mindful of the next election as the man who thinks of nothing but the next election . The statesman uses the next election for the furtherance of the next age and of this as well . The statesman comprehends all things in the sweep of his vision and his action . He sees the eternal principles , he follows the eternal // order , and he strives to bring the popular mind into harmony with that order , into conformity with those principles . It is not strange that a thousand devices should be sought to explain away Mr. Blame 's unrivaled influence with the people . The influence is not denied , nor the fact that such influence is power . What he touches answers . Another essays a similar touch and there is no response . Since this is undeniable there only remains to opposition the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition attempts this by argument and eloquence , honorable rivalry by greater services , unprincipled incapacity by unprincipled vituperation . But the resource of unprincipled incapacity has ever been to maintain that devils are cast out through Beelzebub the prince of the devils . He against whom the charge was originally made refuted it with prompt and vigorous reasoning , but it is not recorded that his accusers ever withdrew the charge or acknowledged its refutation . Logic is against the theory and history is against it , but stern necessity compels it , and *against an argument of the will an argument of the reason has no power . Criticism is always on the level of the critic . It may hit or miss its object , but it is ever true to its source . His revilers did not succeed in persuading the world to accept their characterization of the Christ , but the world has accepted their own self-revelation with entire unanimity . It is not unnatural that men who are incapable of broad views should misunderstand the broad view . Every gret*t man is followed by interpreters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ; it is not their will , but their doom . Their real contribution to his greatness is that they follow him . There are other men who are large in their own province , but not quite wise enough to keep within it . When Mr. Tyndall considers heat as a mode of motion he secures our consideration also , but when he pronounces Mr. Gladstone " a desperate gamester " we simply regret that the shoemaker has gone beyond his last . We do not change our opinion of Mr. Gladstone . The storms of political calumny sweep almost as low in this country as they do in England , and as little affect the atmosphere which a man creates around himself . In Mr. Blame 's vicinage the air has never grown murky . All the outpour has been but the pelting of a theatre-thunder-shower on a natural ledge of rock . // In spite of intense political antagonism he has steadily increased in political stature , because character , ability , education , and achievement have combined to endow him with marvelous political vitality . Privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obs2urity , because his influence flows from himself and not from his position . His bow abides in strength because it is of hard wood , without a flaw , well seasoned , and well strung . He touches the heart because his own heart is touched . He commands because he understands . What seems dramatic is dramatic , for it is direct nature , and nature is always dramatic . We are stiff and ineffective because we dare not or can not be natural . Men call him magnetic simply because they do not know what else to call it . He has not the inexhaustible flow of rhetoric , or of wit , or of drollery , which characterizes one and another of our orators , but he has a neverfailing fund of brilliant common sense and of quick human sympathy . He has the rare power of seeing and of setting forth a subject in its real relations . His logic is so luminous that it often has the effect of wit . His sympathy is so ready and so efficient that to minds of a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas it is not iugenuity at all , but spontaneity . Long and labored explanations of him come to grief , because by the time a fine-spun theory is well woven around him he is liable to rise and walk out of it , quite unconscious of the broken threads . That his personality can never be ignored is partly because he himself is so unaware . He is the more interesting to others in that he completely forgets himself . He is absorbed in the theme under discussion or under thought . He will sit in his chair in Congress , the cynosure of all eyes , unconscious of any gaze , head well sunk in his shoulders , every feature heavily drooping in a face from which the soul seems absolutely to have gone out  --  or gone in . I have seen him riding through the streets of Washington , the bridle-rein hanging loose in his hand , gazing groups on each side of the street , his blank uuseeing eyes fixed on the sunset sky which illumined his face as round and fine and about as expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vehemence that glows like passion . The soul of him rushes in like a flood , charges feature and figure with vital force ; he is erect , alight , alive . And the occasion is very apt to be occasional . With a simple interlocutor , // in a chance turn of table-talk , or after-table chat , a suggestion will elicit from him a statement , a presentation , terse , vivid , forceful , convincing , as if it were a speech prepared in the closet and delivered under the inspiration of a listening Congress . So furnished and trained is his mind that on whatever he is moved to speak , and in whatever circumstances ,  --  in the Senate , on the stump , before a benevolent society , at a party of pleasure , or walking with a friend on the street ,  --  he hoards no illustration , he is aware of no bystander , he sees only his theme , and all his resources are at command . Mr. Blame is a politician in the true and noble sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demagogue . Baffled and uncomprehending Balaks , tired of hearing him repeatedly and altogether blessed on the very altars which they have built for his cursing , sardonically declare that this is the very way he does it ; that demagogism is all there is of it . Too ardent adherents have sometimes been ready to wish that it were . If it had been possible for him to pose a little on Civil Service Reform , he could have had all the Mugwumps at his feet . Mr. George William Curtis has publicly notified the President that he may " spoils ' as much as he likes if he will only keep the pose . Mr. Blame through his whole public life has been a consistent and unvarying civil service reformer , but he could never catch the pose . His reform has always been by the way , never by buncombe . Formal complaint was lodged against his letter of acceptance that he sought to turn the campaign away from personal to political issues , a complaint which was a eulogy . Mr. Blame brought out in 1884 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading candidate for the Presidency because the intelligent ambition of the American people desires to see at the head of the nation a man who represents at once its aspiration and its achievement . Mr. Blame is not a candidate because he wishes it himself . Whether he wishes it or not is a matter of absolutely no moment . That the office should seek the man , and not the man the office , is one of those silly saws that pass for wisdom with the unthinking , but whose only practical effect is to nurture hypocrisy . If a man wants an office , and is fit for it , seeking the office is no disqualification . Coyness is not a sign of virtue any more than of vice . But the Presidency of the United States is too great to be a ques // tion of personal desire . A man 's wish does not enter as a factor into the problem . When a man has shown pre-eminent fitness for the place , the only question is whether the elements that enter into a popular election can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question for the country . It is not a question for the man . This strong , great , drifting country needs a captain none the less because she does not founder in the command of a deck-hand . We jan never be sure whether Mr. Blame desires or dreads the Presiclency ; perhaps he does not know himself ; but he has demonstrated that his usefulness and his happiness are independent of it . If the Presidential bee is in his bonnet , it is subject to a profound quadriennial hibernation . Frank in this as in all matters , his position before hi* nomination was as outspoken as succinct : " Once I was eager and once I was willing . Now I am neither . " But even when he was " eager , ** he was not too intent for badinage . Entering the Chamber of Representatives with a telegram from Oregon in his hand in the earliest opening of the campaign for his nomination in 1876 , he blithely waved it , exclaiming : " Maine has declared for me and Oregon has declared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill up the little gap between ! " Defeated in his first nomination he started anew in the Senate , as alert as if that had been his goal . Defeated a second time in the nominating convention , he leaped into the new field of diplomacy with the nerve and the gayety of youth . Thrust back from the full tide of work by the same murderous hand that laid low his chief and friend , he turned into the quiet ways of literature and achieved the most brilliant success of his success ful life . For not only is his book an addition to the historical literature of the world , not only is it a signal example of personal moral greatness , but it is a service rendered to the America of the future greater probably than could have been gathered into any adminis*tration of the Government . Defeated finally in his election , he returned to his library and resumed his literary work with the same mental composure , without a trace of bitterness , without a suspicion of resentment , giving thus an exemplification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen to say whether he shall ever be called from that library to serve them as President . It is for them to // say whether they will have for President the man they want or a man they do not want . It is for them to say whether they will be represented in their highest position and led in their noblest ambition by their most widely known , their most fitly endowed , their best beloved fellow citizen .
