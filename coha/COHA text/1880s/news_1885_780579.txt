He turned up in Whitewater about two weeks ago , and by his glib talk and immense self-assurance obtained the confidence of W. F. Bundy , Professor of Sciences at the Whitewater Normal School . His leaving Whitewater and the disappearance of a lot of valuable scientific books were so closely allied that it was concluded that the man and the books had departed together .
