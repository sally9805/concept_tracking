txt The Weekly News publishes a letter from Mr. A. M. Sullivan , who was one of Patrick O'Donnell 's counsel , entitled : " Susan Gallagher , the Irish Jeannie Deans  --  an Episode of the O'Donnell Trial . " Mr. Sullivan describes the connection of Susan Gallagher with the killing of James Carey , and argues that the facts redound to the credit of the Irish peasantry . In this case , he says , a simple Donegal girl outrivaled the Midlothian heroine in her anguish , sacrifice , devotion and truth . Mr. Russell 's masterly and irresistible argument proved a hundred circumstances and considerations in favor of Carey having handled a pistol during the tragedy . Years ago O'Donnell separated from his Rife in America . While revisiting Donegal , O'Donnell met Susan , who consented , under the representation that she was his sister , to accompany him to the Cape , where they intended to marry . When after her return to_the England she was questioned by Messrs . Pryor and Sullivan , Susan stated that after leaving Cape Town she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon on a bench : and when Mr. Sullivan approached the critical point concerning Carey 's pistol , Susan , realizing the tremendous importance of the question , suffered intense mental anguish and trembled like an aspen-leaf . Sobbing , she replied : " My back was turned toward them , Sir . Oh , if I had only turned round before ! Oh , Sir , I was not looking the right way . I heard some noise on the floor . It might have been the shuttling of feet . It was a small matter . " Mr. Sullivan adds : " Who could contradict her if she testified that she beheld Carey With pistol in hand ? Or what could be easier than for her to declare that she heard the pistol fall . " In conclusion , he says : " The people of Tyrconnell may claim with pride the humble heroine of religion and truth , Suscin Gallagher , the Irish Jeannie Deans. "
