DEDICATED to MISS INA D. COOLBRITH . The heart of woman is like the heart of our Sierras ; some find gold there and some do not : much depends on the prospector . Joaquin Miller . " There were giants in the earth in those days . ... the same became mighty men which were of old ; men of renown . " BIBLE . PREFACE . Virgil , I think it was , in his youth and obscurity , fell in with a loud pretender in letters who got hold of one of his poems , altered it and gradually Came to claim it as his own : bitterly abusing the real author , as often happens , whom he felt must sooner or later accuse him of the theft . The quiet and crushing answer of the grand old Pagan teaches a Christian lesson that I cry in vain to rise equal to . For he made no accusation or complaint , but merely took his poem , in his own good time , divested it of all rubbish , and finally completed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made it so much purer and better that there never have been two opinions as to who conceived and fashioned it . JOAQUIN MILLER . New York , Dec. 30 , 1881 . CAST OF CHARACTERS , FORTY-NINE.  --  A relic of bygone days . " I 've been here since ' 49 , and I reckon I ought to know .

A girl  --  a child of one of the old families  --  a lost girl that our Sam had charge of , one of the orphans of the Mountain Meadow Massacre , is now an heiress  --  a great estate waiting for her . And  --  and  --  you just yesterday found out that she is in the mountains of Southern California . GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  ( Aside . ) An heiress  --  an heiress ? If I can only get those papers , the girl and her fortune are mine . ( Takes out note-book and makes notes . ) DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  I am to go and find her .

SNOWE.  --  You really believe you would know that child still ? SAM . BLACK SAM .  --  Shuah , Massa Snowe ? Shuah ! I would , know dat chile , why I would know dat chile in Jerusalem . Why , Massa Snowe , she 'd know dis ole black face for sure . She 'd come right up to dis old cripple now . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  Ah ! But you must remember , Sam , it is now more than twelve years since the Mormons and Indians murdered her parents , and took her from your arms on the plains , and she was hardly four years old at the time . SAM . BLACK SAM .  --  But I 'd know her , shuah . And she  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't many of my kind , Massa Snowe , up in dem white mountains , and den , O , Massa Snowe , she 'd know my songs . She 'd fly to me like a bird , she would . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  Your songs ? Did you sing to her much , Sam ? SAM . BLACK SAM .  --  Allers , allers . On dem ole plains , Massa Snowe . Why , she knowed my songs , every one . She 'd sing a vus , and I 'd sing a vus , and you see , if she 'd hear me sing now , she 'd come a runnin ' right to me . ' Fore God she would , Massa Snowe . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  Capital idea ! Capital idea ! Charley , you must be off , and at once . ( Takes out papers . ) These papers will give you directions where you may find the girl , and give you full authority to act when she is found . There is a false claimant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , Sam , you can go ; and remember , if this girl is found , your fortune is made . SAM . BLACK SAM .  --  I do n't want no fortune , Massa Snowe . I want to see dat chile once more before I dies  --  poor , poor baby in de mountains . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  I say , Sam ! Do you think there are any marks by which she can be identified ? SAM . BLACK SAM .  --  Marks ? Marks ? Massa Snowe , marks dat she will take wid her to her coffin , yes ! Why , dar come de Mormons , painted red , and howlin ' , and a choppin ' , and a shootin ' , and stabbin ' . O , Massa Snowe , it makes me sorry ; it makes me sick , to think of it .

Know dat chile ? I 'd know dat in Jerusalem , I would . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Why , my poor old Sam , do n't break up that way . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  That , Charley , is the child you are to find . A large tract of land in Santa Clara , on which a city has since been built , was the property of the family , who were on their way to take possession at the time of the massacre , and she is now sole heiress to the entire estate , which is of enormous value . Of course there are many pretenders to this fortune , but this I know is the real heiress . GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  ( Aside . ) It 's the biggest thing out  --  a mine of gold . A regular Bonanza mine to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COL . SNOWE.  --  ( Glasses on and examining papers . ) She is a woman now , I suppose . You see , in the great Mountain Meadow Massacre , the Indians , led by the Danites , killed all except the children of three and four years of age . The little orphans , forty or fifty in number , were taken up by the Mormons and Indians , and in a few years were almost forgotten . I have sent agents searching everywhere , but have always been disappointed . But now , I have a new hope and with care it shall become a reality . ( Rises and crosses stage . To Devine ) It is a beautiful and strange superstition of the Indians that they will not kill a negro . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  An Indian will not kill a negro ? SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  No . An Indian of the Plains will not kill a negro . In this case they spared poor old Sam only because he was black . The Indians took her from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For , if the child can remember anything at all , she will remember old black Sam . Charley , it shall be your task to find her . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  A delightful task ! I shall so like to get out and up into the mountain , and heart of the Sierras ; such scenery ! such air ! The smell of the fir and tamarack ! Ah ! I shall reform there . SNOWE . COL . SNOWE.  --  ( Handling papers to Charley . ) You are to take these papers , go directly to the Sierras , and sit down there quiely in the heart of the mountains , get acquainted with her there ; get her confidence ; find out what she remembers of her old negro and all . Then make your application to the courts in behalf of this orphan child , and present your papers and authority . And if really necessary , I will come with black Sam , to satisfy the laws and the State . ( Retires up stage . ) GULLY . LUCKY TOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope and legal papers like those in my pocket . I was sued the other day . He is still half drunk . If I could only exchange them . ( To Devine . ) She is very rich , you say ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  The richest girl , perhaps , in California . A city has been built on her lands , fortunately , and there is no computing her wealth . GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  Charley , you go at once ! Go ! I see a fortune in it  --  a fortune  --  do you hear ? And I 'm in with you , you know . Go , find this girl . Find her , woo her , win her , marry her . And do n't let her know she is an heiress until its all over . The biggest thing in America . Woo her , win her , marry her , before she knows anything about her good fortune . Charley , my boy , I congratulate you ! I say that is the biggest thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good clothes , and take plenty of perfumery along with you , and you can win that mountain girl in less than a month . And when you have got the girl , send for old black Sam ; prove her identity yourself , and let old Snowe go to the devil . And we 're pards . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  But this is unworthy of  --  GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  There you go again , with your heart . All heart , and no head . Go , do as I tell you ; but be sure you take plenty of perfumery with you , women like perfumery . Few women can reason , but all women can smell . Take plenty of perfumery . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  You are a scoundrel , sir ! GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  I am called Lucky Tom Gully . I was born a gentleman . A gentleman without money . ( Aside . ) Of such men are scoundrels made . ( Aloud . ) I am a gentlemen by birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I say marry the girl , and we divide . You decline ? Very well ; good-bye . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  ( Refusing hand . ) You scoundrel ! But you are at least candid . GULLY . LUCKY TOM GULLY .  --  The most candid man you ever knew in your life , sir , and  --  a scoundrel . ( Enter Mrs. Devine , R. Devine throws papers on table , receives her . Sam exits . L. Snowe greets Mrs. D. Gully takes papers from his pocket and exchanges them with those on table . ) GULLY .

There is no escaping ; I must , and must go to-night  --  now . And why have you such a horror of California ? MRS . D. MRS . DEVINE.  --  My son , hear me , hear me . Your father is buried there . This you know . I never speak of it , for it breaks my heart . No , no , not to California . That cost your father his life . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Then mother , I am going to find my father 's grave . MRS . D. MRS . DEVINE.  --  Charley , you will find a grave there if you go . You will find only a grave here when you return .

When we came away out here , and left the world , our fathers forgot us , our sweethearts married and left us , but our mothers waited for us , and waited and waited , and then they died and went to heaven to wait for us there . CARROTS . CARROTS Then I wish I 'd a had a mother . But I reckon I never had . No , I guess I never had a mother , Forty-Nine. ' 49. ' 49 Never had a mother , to love . CARROTS . CARROTS No ; guess that 's why I love Charley , ai n't it ? Did n't you ever never have anything to love , besides your mother ? ' 49. ' 49 My child , do n't ask me that , do n't . CARROTS .

CARROTS And she did n't love you back ? ' 49. ' 49 She did ! God bless her ! CARROTS . CARROTS ( Leaves flowers and crosses to Forty-Nine . ) And why did n't you marry her , then ? ' 49. ' 49 I did  --  I did ! Now , Carrots , you 're liftin ' up the water gates , and you 'll flood the whole mine . CARROTS . CARROTS Well , I 'm so sorry , Forty-Nine . I 'm so sorry . But I want to know . I 've got no mother to talk to , Forty-Nine , and I  --  I want to know how these things come out . ' 49. ' 49 I 'll tell you , my honest child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARROTS . CARROTS Well , sit down on this rock here . Tell me , now , wo n't you ? ' 49. ' 49 ( As not heeding her . ) And you like those lowly , little Winter flowers you have gathered from the rocks for Charley and me ? CARROTS . CARROTS Yes ; yes , they are lowly ; and they ai n't big . But they 're so sweet , Forty-Nine. ' 49. ' 49 My child , in this cold , hard world , the sweetest flowers are lowly . The sweetest flowers grow closest to the ground . CARROTS . CARROTS And you did love her ? Tell me , Forty-Nine , tell me. ' 49. ' 49 ( Still evasive . ) And Charley 's got a sweetheart . CARROTS . CARROTS Yes , he 's got a sweetheart , and I 've got a sweetheart . Now , did n't you never have a sweetheart , Forty-Nine ? ' 99 .

But I 'll tell you , and tell you now , and never , never do you mention it any more , for I ca n't bear to think about it . CARROTS . CARROTS Why , poor , dear Forty-Nine . Why I did n't know you ever could cry . There , there . ' 49. ' 49 Well , you see when it took half a year to come here , and half of us died getting here , why , the cowardly did n't start , and the weak died on the way ; and so it was that a race of giants came here in ' 49 : men that could die , but not weep . CARROTS . CARROTS Yes , I know , Forty-Nine . The old boys were the best ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' 49. ' 49 Not many now . They 're up there on the hill : up above the trouble of the world , nearer the pure white snow ; nearer the great white throne . CARROTS . CARROTS O , Forty-Nine . But her . And do n't , please , do n't cry . ' 49. ' 49 Well , you see , that little baby that I left in the cradle , with its sweet , young mother bendin ' over it  --  it comes before me all the time when I turn back to think , and it makes me cry . CARROTS . CARROTS But she ; she was good and true ? ' 49. ' 49 Good and true ? Good and true , and pure as the gold I 'm to find in the tunnel , and make you and Charley rich with , my girl . CARROTS . CARROTS And you will never see her any more ? ' 49. ' 49 Yes , yes , when I strike it in the tunnel . But then you see , it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tunnel I was certain I 'd strike it in a month ; then I said in a year . And all the time the little boy baby , crowin ' in its cradle , and its sweet mother bendin ' over it , waitin ' , waitin ' , waitin ' . CARROTS . CARROTS Dear , dear , old Forty-Nine . But the little boy baby is not in the cradle now . ' 49. ' 49 Carrots ! Carrots ! It ai n't kind in you to say so . It ai n't dead ! It 's there ! I can see it now ! And her , her sweet , pretty face bendin ' over it . You see we forty-niners never knew much of books , or were much for writin ' letters . And then , you know , we wanted to surprise ' em at home . And so we did n't write , but kept waitin ' to strike it , and go back and surprise ' em . A year slipped through my fingers and another , and another , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifted like an eternal wall of snow , and the mighty plains , bald and bleak , and vast , rolled like a sea between . But I 'll strike it yet . I 'll strike it yet . And I 'll see that little boy baby there crowin ' in its cradle , and its sweet young mother bendin ' over it . Only do n't speak of ' em , do n't speak of ' em , or you will break my old heart . CARROTS . CARROTS O , I 'm so sorry for you . It just busts me all up . I wonder if Charley  --  ( Rising and aside . ) Well , I 'd never let Charley go off like that , no sir'ee. ' 49. ' 49 But there , there ; never mind . I 'll see that baby yet . Yes , I will . I 'll heap its cradle full of gold . Full , full of gold . And you are going to be rich , too , some day . I will strike it yet . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't . But we must get dinner now . ( Picks up coon . ) It is going to be a glorious good dinner , too . CARROTS . CARROTS What are you going to have ? ' 49. ' 49 This  --  coon ! CARROTS . CARROTS What 's Charley going to have ? He 's been working in the tunnel all day . ' 49. ' 49 He 's goin ' to have coon , too . CARROTS . CARROTS He wo n't like coon . ' 49. ' 49 Why not ? Coon is better than horse , or mule , or dog . I 've tried ' em all . I have been here since ' 49 , and I reckon I ought to know ; coon is the best thing , for this season of the year , in the world . I have just been yearnin ' for coon , just been pinin ' for coon . Set the table , Carrots . ( Aside . ) Lord , how I do hate coon ! ( Going , holding up and talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path ? Why was n't you a deer , or a grouse , or a rabbit , or a squirrel , or anything in this world , but a horrible , greasy , long-tailed coon ? ( Exits into cabin L. 2 . E. ) CARROTS . CARROTS Poor old Forty Nine , and he loves her , and he left her , too . If Charley should leave me like that , I 'd  --  ( Enter Devine , R. , unobserved . ) DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  You 'd what , my pretty pet ? ( Kisses her . ) CARROTS . CARROTS O , Charley ! Did n't think you was in a thousand miles of here ; or I would n't have been thinkin ' about you at all . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  And , really , you ought not to think about me . I 'm not worth thinking about : so much trouble ; so much trouble . CARROTS . CARROTS Why , what trouble can there be , Charley , if you love me , and  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to love in ? But I must set the table now . ( Devine kisses his hand to her ; sits on rocks , R. , reading letter ; Carrots sets table and sings . ) O , Charley , did you hear the news ? Belle and  --  stop a minute ! Will you take the news a little at a time , or all in a heap ? Well , then , here goes , all at once ! They are to be married to-night ! DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  ( Aside . ) Belle to be married  --  to that man ! And what will Snowe think of me ? He must have heard it some how , and that is why he comes , post-haste . CARROTS . CARROTS And you used to like her , did n't you ? You used to try to get close to her , and say things , did n't you ? You liked her , and she liked the other feller . That 's just always the way . Nobody never likes anybody that anybody likes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . I never loved Belle . CARROTS . CARROTS You never loved her ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  I did , and I did not . Listen : a man with a heart must love something . Love  --  the love of woman  --  is as necessary to the existence of a real man as the sunlight to the life and perfection of a flower . But until a man meets his destiny , reaches his ideal , he must of needs reach out to that which is nearest ; as the vine climbing feebly up to the sun lays hold with its tendril on whatever it can , be it foul or fair , the heart of man takes hold of the highest nature that comes near his , and then waits its destiny . Jealousy is borne of an instinctive knowledge of this truth . CARROTS . CARROTS ( Starts , comes back . ) Hey ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  You do n't understand ? CARROTS . CARROTS No ; that 's all Modoc to me . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , now I am sad , and must sit and think . CARROTS . CARROTS All right ! Just so you do n't think of Belle . ( Enter Forty-Nine. ) ' 49. ' 49 Hello , Charley ! ( To Carrots . ) Them your flowers smells so ? CARROTS . CARROTS I do n't smell nothin ' ; except Lucky Tom . ' 49. ' 49 I do ! Whew ! Coon , without ingons , without crackers . I ai n't seen such times , Carrots , since ' 49 . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  I am as hungry as a wolf , Forty-Nine . What have you to-day , for dinner ? CARROTS . CARROTS ( Catches up and hands flowers . ) I brung ' em  --  I brunged  --  I bringed  --  I  --  brought ' em  --  from the mountains  --  away up against God 's white snow . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  And you are His angel , sent down from the golden gates . California flowers . Silent eloquence of the voiceless world . How beautiful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is that I smell ? CARROTS . CARROTS Flowers ! ' 49. ' 49 No ! That 's the coon  --  we will have coon for dinner . It is a dinner fit for a king  --  coon straight ! DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  ( Laughing . ) If it tastes as it smells , I do n't want any coon straight . CARROTS . CARROTS Yes , guess it is the coon . Thought at first it was the flowers . It smells strong enough to climb a tree now . Smells stronger than Lucky Tom . ' 49. ' 49 Now , look here , both of you . Just listen to me . There 's a certain time in the year , in this peculiar glorious climate , when you require a change of diet . When you require coon . I have been here since ' 49 . I reckon I 'd ought to know . CARROTS . CARROTS Of course he knows . He 's right . He 's always right . I know that coon is  --  well , coon is coon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Why , you could n't have such a dinner as coon straight in New York for love or money . No , not even in London . ( Carrots sets table and sings . Forty-Nine exits into cabin . ) CARROTS . CARROTS There 's the salt and the mustard , and where 's the pepper ? Forty Nine , where 's the black pepper ? Oh here 's the black pepper . And here 's the red pepper . And here 's the grey pepper . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Anything else ? CARROTS . CARROTS Yes . There 's the tooth-picks . What magnificent tooth-picks for this time of the year . ' 49. ' 49 ( From within . ) Did you set on the pepper there ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  ( Sneezing . ) She set on the pepper ; and that 's about all she did set . CARROTS . CARROTS Dong , dong , ding dong . First bell . ' 49. ' 49 ( Enters with coon . ) Yes , little Sunshine , let 's make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Will you allow me ? ( Conducts her to table , and all sit. ) ' 49. ' 49 ( Carving coon . ) It 's a grand thing to live in a country where you can get coon whenever your health requires it . CARROTS . CARROTS It 's a delicious coon , Charley. ' 49. ' 49 ( Eating eagerly . ) It 's a grand dinner . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Some bread , please . ' 49. ' 49 Eh ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  You forgot the bread . ' 49. ' 49 I did n't forget the bread . You never eat bread with coon . Coon and bread do n't go together . Indians never eat bread with their coon . I 've been here since ' 49 , and I ought to know . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  But I 'm not an Indian , and I ca n't eat without bread . CARROTS . CARROTS You do n't expect to get everything  --  bread and coon  --  and  --  everything at once , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat this without bread . ' 49. ' 49 Look here ; be a good boy , and eat your coon . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Hungry as I am , I can not eat this . ' 49. ' 49 ( Rising slowly and sadly . ) Well , then , listen to me . I have done the best I could . I tried to hide it all from you , but I ca n't any more . A good many times , lately , I have said I was sick , and I did n't eat . It was because there was not enough for both of us . I wanted you to eat and be strong , so that you could strike it in the old tunnel . Now , there is nothing more to eat . Nothing more for any one . Charley , more than twenty years I worked on in that old tunnel there  --  all alone , till you came . I believed every day that I would strike it . All my companions are dead , or have made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely road of my hard life , I see , as I look back , little grassy mounds  --  they are the brave miners ' graves . I am the last man left . The grass every year steals closer and closer down about my cabin door . In a few years more the grass will grow over that door-sill ; and long , strong , and untrodden it will grow in my trail there ; the squirrels will chatter in these boughs , and none will frighten them away  --  for Forty-Nine will be no more ! And yet , for all that , I have never complained . I did believe , and I do still believe , we will strike it yet . But , now  --  but now ! If you love me , eat your coon ! DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  My dear , old partner , forgive me . Why did n't you tell me of this before ? ' 49. ' 49 If you love me , eat your coon  --  CARROTS . CARROTS Take a tooth-pick , then . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without bread . Here ! ( Takes loaf from basket under table . ) DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Why , where did you get this ? CARROTS . CARROTS Up there , of her  --  old Mississip . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  Then it 's her bread , and I wo n't eat it . CARROTS . CARROTS It ai n't her bread . It was her bread , but I stole it , and it ai n't her bread any more . ' 49. ' 49 My poor child , what have you done ! CARROTS . CARROTS Nothin ' . I knowed , Forty-Nine , you had no bread . They 've got lots of bread , and I do n't care that  --  ( snaps fingers )  --  for the whole lot . ( Devine looks troubled . ) Why , it was n't nothin ' , was it , Charley ? If it was , I wo n't never , never steal any more . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  It was very wicked , a crime . Yet , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wrong , are guilty , for taking bread , how much more guilty am I ? Forty-Nine , hear me . ( Starting up . ) That man , Gully , came to me to-day , taunting me with his good fortune and my misery . He came in that tunnel to ask me to his wedding . And there , deep in the dark earth , face to face , man to man , I fought him , overthrew him , weak as I was , and took from him a package of papers . I gave it to her to keep . I am a robber ! ' 49. ' 49 Why , my boy ; what ? what do you say , Charley ? DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  I knocked him down and took those papers from him . CARROTS . CARROTS Yes , and I 'll keep ' em , too . ' 49.

They wo n't , you know  --  they wo n't dare to hurt me , Why , I 've been here since ' 49 . They wo n't hurt me , boy . I 'm old Forty-Nine . Oh , they wo n't hurt me . ( Is greatly troubled , but affects cheerfulness . ) DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  You take a great load off my shoulders . I was robbed of those very papers , which made my mission here worse than useless . I wrote back to the hard old lawyer , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to the business himself . He may be here at any moment . He will find me a robber when he comes . ' 49. ' 49 There , there , my poor pard . It 's all right , it 's all right . Now , Carrots , this is Christmas eve . CARROTS . CARROTS And at ten o'clock to-night I am to sing you your song . ' 49. ' 49 To sing my dear old song for me . Now , do n't you forget . CARROTS . CARROTS O , I wo n't . Why , I 've sung that song for you every Christmas eve , hav n't I ? ' 49. ' 49 Yes , yes , my pretty . ( To Devine . ) You see , when I was in the  --  in the  --  States , my  --  my  --  we always sang this little song on Christmas eve together . For , you see , it was on Christmas eve that she  --  well , we were married on Christmas 49 , we promised each other , that wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would each , at ten o'clock , precisely , sing this song , and think of each other . I ca n't sing now , but I have taught . Carrots , and she sings it for me . DEVINE . MRS . DEVINE.  --  ( Aside . ) How strange ! My mother taught me the same fancy . ( To Forty-Nine . ) A beautiful thought . ( Crosses R. , looks at sunset ; dark stage . ) It 's sunset here , and so it is ten o'clock where mother is , now . And I must sing the song she taught me to sing at this moment , wherever I may be . ( Sings . ) O , sing the song we loved , love , When all life seemed one song , For life is none too long , love , Ah , love is none too long . So sing the song we loved , love , When all life seemed one song . Note . Song barely audible above the music ; Carrots and Forty-Nine attracted rather by the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens. ' 49.
