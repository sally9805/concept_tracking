txt Senator Riddleberger loses no opportunity nowadays to make himself conspicuous , and it is a pity that a public man who has so much persistency in that direction should be without a great motive for frequent speaking . Ho made the gentlemen who serve as private secretaries to Senators , and whose names are kept from the public very carefully , decidedly uncomfortable to-day , and later on he betrayed undignified anger for having , as he intimated , been " sat down upon " by older Senators than himself . During the morning hour he secured the attention of everybody in the chamber by asking the Senate to adopt a resolution instructing each Senator to report to the Senate on Monday next the name of his private secretary . He bad reasons for offering this resolution , he said , and he was about to state them when Senator Platt interrupted to say that some Senators had no private secretaries , and so could not obey the resolution . Mr. Riddleberger said that the last Congress had voted to pay the private secretaries of Senators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission to the floor of the Senate were issued to persons as private secretaries who would not be admitted to the parlors of gentlemen acquainted with them as he was . There ' were some men on the floor as private secretaries , Mr. Riddleberger continued in tones of rising indignation , under pay by the Government , and some Senators had secretaries who were there only to blackmail Senators and libel them in the newspapers they represented . Mr. Riddleberger wanted to know if such men were to be admitted to the floor . " We read , " be said , " of Capt . Eads having been on the floor of the House of Representatives , " and he wanted to say that Rads had three representatives in the Senate , two being connected with Republican papers and one with a Democratic journal . They were in the Senate as private secretaries of Senators , receiving no pay and getting tickets of admission from a Senator who had his own son drawing pay as a Private secretary . Mr. Riddieberger followed this charge with the announcement that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known " where this thing was evolved . " Then the resolution was put to vote and it was adopted with only one or two negative votes . A few minutes later , when the V iginia Senator was out of his seat , Mr. Hoar moved a reconsideration of the vote , but at Mr. 's suggestion be allowed the motion to stand until Mr. Riddleberger returned . This occurred soon afterward , but the Senator again left the floor , and then in his absence the reso-lution was reconsidered and amended by Mr. Hoar so as to provide that the names of private secretaries should be handed to Secretary McCook and be printed in the Record . In this shape the resolution was finally agreed to . Later in the afternoon the Virginia Senator aeam made himself conspicuous . He is not pleased at the treatment he has received from some of the Republicans , who regard him as a very troublesome and intractable member of their party , and he took occasion to  --  say so . The Blair Educational bill was ' , ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mr. Riddleberger called for the yeas and nays . Mr. Sherman told him it was too bite , decision having been given . Then the Virginian indignantly declared that there was a manifest disposition to sit down upon him m everything he tried to do . He thought the Blair bill was being talked to death by its friends , and he wanted to have it voted on soon to iusure its passage . He insisted on his right to call for a roll call , and when he had quieted down for a moment Mr. Sherman remarked that the Chair had never discriminated against the Virginia Senator , but had rather leaned the other way . He hoped , ? he added , that the Senator would withdraw his imputation against the Chair . Mr. Riddieberger seemed to be in doubt whit to say next , but was reminded by a fellow-Sc/eater that it was in order to grant Mr. Sherman 's request . He finally stated that it was not his purpcse to impute anything against the Chair , but what he did mean to say was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary body . The whole Senate burst into a laugh at this remark , and Mr. Sherman 's face grew very red . With a wave of the hand Mr. Riddleberger went on to claim his right to demand a roll call . It was evident that the Senator was on the rampage , and to prevent any further explosions Mr. Plumb broke in upon him with a motion to adjourn . Some of the Senators wanted to go on with the Blair bill , and others wanted an executive session . The latter prevailed , and if Mr. Riddleberger had anything further to say it was heard behind the closed doors . It is undoubted that the immediate cause of Mr. Riddleberger 's assault upon the system of admitting private secretaries to the chamber was the recent publication in a local Paper of a hitter attack upon the Senator writteniy a newspaper man who is admitted to the floor as the secretary of one of the North Carolina Senators . Mr. Riddleberger has taken no pains to conceal his intention of " getting even " with the newspaper man referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House on Thursday of last week Mr. Henderson , of Iowa , with many assurances of fraternal feeling for the South , made a severe attack upon Southern members for not voting for the increase of the pension to widows and orphans . The Republicans regarded his attack as unanswerable . To-day , however , when the debate on the bill was resumed Mr. Norwood , of Georgia , gave Mr. Henderson an answer which is pronounced by all who heard it to be one of the best speeches of its rind delivered for many years in the House . With the keenest wit he leveled shot after shot at Henderson and provoked roars of laughter by his ridicule of the Iowa Representative , whom he compared to several mock heroic personages . The members from the Republican side all crowded over to the Democratic side of the House to , listen , and Mr. Henderson , after a number of feeble interruptions , dropped into his seat as if lie had been sandbagged . Mr. Norwood provoked screams of laughter when lie declared that Henderson was afflicted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability of the patient to say or do the things he desired to do , so that when Mr. Henderson said he approached a subject with delicacy be did precisely the reverse . Mr. Norwood is slightly gray , has the air of a physician , which he was , and is a horn humorist . Mr. Breckinridge , of Kentucky , who followed him , and who made his first speech in the House , is one of the most conspicuous men in the body . He is of average height , strong of build , and his florid face is garnished with a vigorous white beard and mustache . His hair , which has an inclination to fall upon his forehead , is of a shining silver white . He is only 49 , but the brilliant whiteness of his hair makes him look older , lie proved to be a tine orator , and for half an hour chained the attention of floor and galleries . Besides having a fine command of language he did not lack wisdom , for be very plainly told the House that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every dollar appropriated for public purposes was taken from the people . by the tax gatherer ; that every dollar was coined in the sweat of labor ; that there could not be any such thing as the surplus that was so much talked about wnen finances were discussed so long as every city and town in the country was burdened with debt , and that in adding 60 per cent . to the pensions of widows just so much must be talsen from all the widows and orphans who did not benefit by the bill . Mr. Breckinridge 's invocation to the spirit of loyalty was extremely eloquent and his peroration was very pathetic . *** Brig. - Gen . Alfred H.

Nobody knew anything about it here . A half dozen Democratic Senators of prominence declared that they have not been informed of any proposed conference or consultation . A gentleman who talked with the President on the subject said that Mr. Cleveland knew nothing about it , and that he was surprised that such a conference should bo thought necessary . There is nothing to prevent such a conference if Gen. B. F.

He secured the adoption of a resolution in the Senate to-day calling upon the company to inform the Senate what its capital stock is , how Its money is invested , what its assets are , and how many and how large its dividends have been and whether paid in stock , scrip , or cash .

Senator Miller was in his seat when the executive session was ordered to-day , and so the nomination of Mr. Redden to be Collector of Customs et the port of New-York , which was reached and passed over when Mr. Miller was absent on Monday , was taken up . As there was no opposition to his confirmation on the part of the two New-York Senators no one else felt called upon to object , and the appointment was formally agreed to without any waste of time . It is understood that the calendar of uncontested nominations was cleared by the confirmation of Mr. Hedden , and that before adjoutning the Senators took up the nomination of a Postmaster to succeed a suspended officer in a small Iowa town , but reached no conclusion . *5* Democratic Senators are disposed to find little fault with the attack made by Mr. Ingalls yesterday upon the Assistant Attorney-General:for the Interior Department , although they suggest that it should have been made only in the privacy of an executive session .
