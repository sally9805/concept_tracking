Time , Beginning of the reign of George II . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in London . Enter Sir William Travers and Lord Guy Ruffler . Travers . Sir William Travers Guy , I will not ! This dodging petticoats . Round the street-corners  --  peeping into shops  --  Leering , with shameless meaning , under hoods  --  Staring hot blushes into modest cheeks  --  And fancying a favor if you catch A wandering glance  --  is sheer against my manhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this procedure . Ruffler . Lord Guy Ruffler ( Looking off . ) Do I ?  --  Pah ! look there : Into the goldsmith 's shop ! Can they not see That I am looking at them ? Travers , come , We 'll enter , too : I want a ring  --  a chain .  --  ' blood ! are the women fools ? Trav . Sir William Travers There seem to be Two fools among them . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Speak you for yourself ? Stand here a while . Trav . Sir William Travers For what ? To be the butt Of my sharp self-contempt ? Ruffler ! Shaking him . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler ( Still looking off . ) Hey ! Trav . Sir William Travers Nay ; I 'm talking to you . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler As my grandmother . Trav . Sir William Travers You need it . Look you , listen to me , Guy ; Do you hold woman of no higher use  --  Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Pish ! let me go : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray . Struggles to get away . Trav . Sir William Travers No , sir , you shall not go . I can not see an insult thrust upon A modest woman ; and the man who can , Without his nature flaming into wrath , And his arm lifting with instinctive might , Deserves to have his sisters , mother , wife , Tossed in together at a city 's sack , While he looks on in powerless agony . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler You could not please them better . What a stir , Among the velvets and the damasked silks , There was when the invading French were feared ! What rubbing up of jewels , what a dust Among old finery ! How some delicate maid Would squeak , in her high treble , " Dear mamma , They say those monsters do not spare the weak : Let us be caught as ladies ! " Then the dame Would smooth her powder , with a gentle sigh Of patient resignation . On my life , I never saw the women in such feather ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for invasion . All the time , we men Stood trembling , like huge jellies , for our throats ; While our brave women  --  now , you see , I praise them  --  Made nothing of their honors ! Trav . Sir William Travers Monstrous stuff ! I would not share your notions of the sex , To win a tribe of Helens . I can see , Within the simple innocence and truth Of uncorrupted woman , a fair spirit , Ranked , by all-seeing Heaven , not far beneath Its sinless denizens . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler ( Laughing . ) Now Heaven forgive His wicked blasphemy ! I 'll draw you woman , According to her earthly character , Not as your poets make her . Woman , Will , Is animated vanity . A toy Made up each morning , by a forward whim , That scarcely lasts the day through . The same sigh Over a broken fan , or a broken heart , Measures her depth of feeling . A long stare At the last fashion , on a rival 's back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or theatre , where she may be The conscious centre of a thousand eyes , Shows her religion , or her taste . The power To bear hot sentiment , and frigid love , Her soul 's endurance proves . Ask her to give Her hero 's character , and when you have The color of his eyes , and hair , and cloak , You 'll praise her nice perception . See her weed Her eyebrows of gray hairs , or paint her cheeks , And there 's her industry , and love of art . Come to her death-bed  --  Trav . Sir William Travers Nay . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Well , end her there : The thing is soulless , and can go no further . Yet , for all this , a very pretty doll For man to dandle . Trav . Sir William Travers If the heavens be just , You 'll pay this one day . Guy , I reverence woman . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler For what ? Here 's a discovery , indeed ! For what ? Trav . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing I never fully understood ,  --  Love , love . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Why , that 's the simplest thing on earth . Trav . Sir William Travers The very simplest ! Were you e'er in love ? Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Always . Trav . Sir William Travers With whom ? Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler With everything that wears More than a yard of velvet in its skirts . You are a world too wise for happiness . Trav . Sir William Travers The man who looks for it beyond himself Is a mere fool . But , Ruffler , I intend To marry shortly . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Heaven preserve your victim ! What , you 'll set traps , ha ? Scheme her to your bed ? Play on her weakness ? and declare , the while , How much you reverence her ; as travellers say Some pagans do , who flog unmercifully Their painted gods , and worship them , by turns . You talk of taking a poor maid , as though She were an oyster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . Trav . Sir William Travers In decency retire . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Not I , by Jove ! Trav . Sir William Travers To please me , Guy . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Poh ! poh ! You are too much humored . Trav . Sir William Travers For a moment , then , Until I can escape . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Well , well ; come on . A woman , more or less , is little gained , And nothing lost . Sneak , dodge ;  --  I am with you . They walk up the stage . ( Enter Lady Goldstraw and Madge . ) Lady Goldstraw . Lady Goldstraw La ! they are there again . It is too bad : I can not walk abroad , to feel the sun , Without these shadows following . Every day A pack of courtiers dog me to my door ; Or walk before me , dropping billet-doux ; And one , but Thursday last  --  I tell you , Madge  --  Cast a French plume , that must have cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return it . Madge . Madge And did you not ? Lady G. Lady Goldstraw Not I , you silly child ! I set my little foot upon it , thus , And ground it in the mire ; to show my pride , And brave , contemptuous spirit . Mark those men : See how the tall one eyes me . Ha ! ha ! ha ! Laughing . A proper fellow , too , and bravely trimmed : A courtier , doubtless . I do wonder , now , If't was that villain twitched my dress and sighed , As we came through the church-door !  --  Mercy ! Madge , Do n't stare so at them . Fie ! you naughty child , I 'm blushing for you . Marry ! when you 've seen As many men as I , you 'll know a way To cut your eyes at them , that stirs them more Than all your rustic glares . Madge . Madge Come , mother , come . Yon jackanapes is grinning like death 's head , With much the same expression ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fear The coxcomb will be saucy . Lady G. Lady Goldstraw Will he , rogue ?  --  Let him : I 'll give him better than he sends . Why , things have reached a pass , when pretty women Are at the beck of every handsome dog That strolls the streets ! My husband , the Lord Mayor  --  Madge . Madge Tell me the story as we pass along . Yon bear will slip his keeper , if we stay . Lady G. Lady Goldstraw So , then ,  --  but how you hurry me away ! Exit with Madge . ( As they go off , enter Darkly . ) Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler ( Advancing . ) Darkly ! Darkly . Darkly Forsooth . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler " Forsooth ! " Geneva-cloak ! You end of texts , and stupid homilies , You all that 's bad in every Christian sect , Do you " forsooth " me , sirrah , ha ? Dark . Darkly Amen ! Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler A fool ! you sin-begoten tag-rag ! What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood ? Come , saint , lay by your amaranthine crown , And track those women . Dark . Darkly Ah ! Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler You sigh ! you 'll groan When you have gotten to the martyrdom , I am preparing for your sainthood . Dark . Darkly O ! Trav . Sir William Travers Guy , if hard knocks can break a road to heaven , You 're on the way . The man has honest scruples ; Do not outface his conscience . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Have you scruples ?  --  Have you a conscience ?  --  Have you anything That hints at honesty within your dirt ? I 'll put him to the question . ( Seizes Darkly . ) Answer me ! Dark . Darkly The Lord forbid ! Trav . Sir William Travers Indeed ! Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Of course , Go , knave ! Dark . Darkly Why should I follow the profane of earth , The painted instruments of thy desire ? Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Because I order . Dark . Darkly Bear me witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last account , I sin by man 's compulsion . Trav . Sir William Travers Truly ! Dark . Darkly Ah ! Exit . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler A wretch like that would ornament the Shades , And put the little devils to the blush , Make Satan pine with envy , and upset Chaos itself . I never saw his twin . The club of Hercules could hardly drive One hand to pen a love-song , while the other Pilfered his lion-skin , with ohs and ahs Enough to raise a whirlwind . ( Enter Harry Goldstraw . ) Trav . Sir William Travers Who is this ? What , Harry Goldstraw ? Happily met again . We were in Rome together  --  mind you , sir ?  --  That day the miracle would hardly work  --  You know the virgin that did roll its eyes ?  --  Because the rain had rusted something , ha ! Much to the Church 's scandal . Goldstraw . Harry Goldstraw Ay ; and you To Fra Anselmo , a most bitter papist , Did seriously offer to anoint The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ungreased . " Che , che ? " he cried . " Because , Fra , " you replied , " the Pope 's eyes roll without it ! " Trav . Sir William Travers My friend , Lord Ruffler , Mr. Goldstraw . ( They bow . ) Boys . Let 's shake up London with a revel . How , Goldstraw , you flinch ? Gold . Harry Goldstraw I have a reason , sir . You saw two ladies pass  --  Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler I told you so : Here is another hound upon the scent . Look you , Will Travers , men are all the same ; You are the only Joseph upon earth . So you were trailing them ? O ! never mind ; We will not quarrel ; we 'll divide them justly . Take the old woman ; give me the young thing : I have a taste for unripe fruit .  --  Gold . Harry Goldstraw My lord  --  Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Well . you may wince , but so fate orders it . A fairer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd have laughed to see The little creature stare at me . Trav . Sir William Travers A look Full of pure modesty , and more designed For me than you . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler A most immodest leer . Hear , the vain puppy , how he claims her glance ! Gold . Harry Goldstraw I pray you , listen  --  Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler As for your share ,  --  phew ! Think what a bundle of fine clothes you 'll have  --  What pots of paint  --  how many different wigs  --  What an array of teeth , all movable , And warranted to baffle time 's decay ! And then her cotton ;  --  why , an Indiaman Carries no greater cargo ! Whalebone too ! A very female Jonah , all encased In the sea-monster 's ribs ! And mark  --  Gold . Harry Goldstraw My lord , Know you of whom you speak ? Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Not I , in faith : Some lady of the suburbs , I suppose , Who 'd bargain for her girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women , then ? Gold . Harry Goldstraw My aunt . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler The devil ! Trav . Sir William Travers Shame on you , Guy ! You 've given a sorry wound To the best nature ever lodged in man . See how a loose tongue , like an archer , blind With the thick dust of battle , shoots its shafts , With undiscerning aim , at foe or friend . Down on your knees ! Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Your pardon . Here 's my hand ; Or , if you like it better , here 's my sword ; Both at your service . Gold . Harry Goldstraw By your leave , my lord , I 'll take the hand ; it seems an honest one , Though somewhat hasty . Trav . Sir William Travers Spoken like brave men ! The sword should be a backward arbiter . If human weakness can forgive a wrong , Without blood spilled , let it be done ; for so  --  By just such steps of charity and love  --  We climb to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know How to implore your confidence again . You seem to bear a grief about with you , That I , perhaps , might lighten . Trav . Sir William Travers Harry , speak . A truer mind , and a more slippery tongue , A better heart , and a more idle head , Were never bundled up in stranger sort Than in Guy Ruffler . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler When I go to service , My master shall not get my character From you , my boy . Gold . Harry Goldstraw Alas ! the character You gave my aunt fills up my former grief . That you , a stranger , by a casual glance , Should come so near the thing she really is , Gives me a sorrowful conclusion . She  --  But I 'll not talk . Come to her house with me ; Where , if you be true friends , you may behold Things more for tears than laughter . Trav . Sir William Travers Ah ! I see . Gold . Harry Goldstraw No , sir , you can not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vanity With which she stains my uncle 's troubled grave ,  --  The faithful guardian of my orphanage , Whose fragrant memory sheds no balm on her , Amid the train of fops and fashionists That flutter round her gold , in buzzing swarms ; Slaves whose mere presence would disgust the sense Of many a wanton . All these things have sprung , Not from her heart , which , at the root , is good ; But by the culture of such poisoned sprouts As grow upon the surface of our nature ,  --  Self-love and vanity . But come ; I 'll preach More by example , if you feel inclined . Trav . Sir William Travers Nay , Harry , quit these dumps . A woman 's whims Are all too light to bow so strong a soul . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler I 'll find a way to cure her malady . I never saw a woman yet of stuff I could not mould , as wax before a fire . Some merry plot , half serious and half gay , I 'll plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake , I do . Trav . Sir William Travers Go to ! Here is Patting Ruffler . My Vanity , my Ego , my great Me : Match any woman with him , if you can ! Exeunt . SCENE II . A Reception-Room in Lady Goldstraw 's House . Enter Madge . Madge . Madge When will my mother hold her years to be Beyond man 's courtship ? O ! it sickens me To see her deck her ruins with bright flowers ,  --  Through which the ugly seams will peep , withal ,  --  While I , who , in the course of nature , am as fit For flowers as Spring is , shut my roses up , And pine beneath her . Child , forsooth ! A child Of twenty summers , who must know its bounds , Its nursery , its book , its pretty toy ; Rise with the lark , and lie down with the lamb ;  --  Must I , indeed ?  --  while she makes daybreak blush To see her revels , and high noon amazed To catch her sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe , worth loving  --  Not so fast : There 's cousin Hal , worth all the bearded race ; But what cares he ? Would I were not his cousin ! Ah , well ! Hal is so modest too : a fashion That went out with the tilting-spears and shields . Poor chivalry ! they scorn you ; but you died Rather for lack of heroes , to renew Your drooping laurels , than your own misdeeds . If I were Hal  --  How he torments me ! ( Enter Lady Goldstraw . ) Lady Goldstraw . Lady Goldstraw Child , You must be jogging : your embroidery Needs a few stitches , and your French has gone The saints know where ! Madge . Madge The saints know little , madam Of where the French go . If the French go  --  Lady G. Lady Goldstraw Fie ! Your tongue is idler than your hands . Go , go ; Get to your book . I spoil you , silly child , By my indulgence . Madge . Madge Nay ; I think you spoil My mother more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you be pert ? Madge . Madge Not if I could respect . Pray hear me , mother . Lady G. Lady Goldstraw To your room , I say ! I 'll cool your blood upon a water diet ,  --  Impudent nursling ! Madge . Madge Madam ! Lady G. Lady Goldstraw To your room ! Exit Madge . O ! what a fume she put me in ! I fear My poor complexion has not stood the shock Of this emotion . ( Looks at a mirror . ) Yes ; a fair escape ! No crack nor line , and not a hair awry . Prior ! ( Enter Nick Prior . ) Who waits below ? Nick . Nick Prior Why , Master Hopeful , mam . Hope 's first to come , and last to go away . Lady G.

Ah me ! Sinks into a chair . ( Enter Hopeful . Ruffler , Travers , and Goldstraw , enter behind , observing the scene . ) Hopeful . Hopeful Queen of my soul , sweet agony of bliss , Adored deceiver ! daylight is agog To see thy coming ; though bright Phoebus knows Thy light will shame him ! Wherefore , wherefore , wherefore , Cruel eye of beauty , didst thou keep thy slave Sitting upon a hall-stool ? Has thy heart No sympathetic thrill to waste upon Joints stiffened in thy service , rheumatisms Beyond red flannel and mustard ? Lady G.

O ! teach his love-pen how to soothly write Of the not-now-forgotten hour , when I Poured out my love-words to the worthiest wight That wends , heart-bound , beneath ceruleous sky ! O ! dip my ink-dried pen in sunst ; Roll out a white-cloud scroll , without a flaw ; For sand , powder a storm-cloud up ; and get Venus to set her silvern taper , for To light thy Poet ; and one name he 'll set Across the sky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sweet , sweet sonnet ! much in Petrarch 's way .

Forward , then ! Exeunt . ACT II . SCENE I. Travers ' Lodgings . Ruffler , Travers , and Goldstraw , discovered . Travers . Sir William Travers Your plot comes hardly , Ruffler . Ruffler . Lord Guy Ruffler Not at all : But , as you say , if the old lady 's follies Could reach the end they aim at , she would find A keen repentance following her success . She must be married ; that 's the starting-point . Goldstraw . Harry Goldstraw " Married ! " Nay , that 's the ending-point , I fear . For , in a furious outburst of her folly , Or by the coming of some needy fellow , Of handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clap up a match , Either with one who dangles in her train , Or an adventurer who will spend her wealth , Rob my poor cousin of her heritage , And break both hearts together .

Trav . Sir William Travers Brava , wife ! No ; pshaw ! you gull us . What , you will not dare To carry out your artful project , man ? I doubt your courage . Hal , what think you , Hal ? Gold . Harry Goldstraw I would be loath to see her ladyship The victim of a plot . Trav . Sir William Travers Yet , after all , Could it exceed the antics of to-day  --  The lovers , and the sonnet , and the swoon ?

Live on , and suffer by your obstinacy . Gold . Harry Goldstraw What think you , Travers ? Trav . Sir William Travers Soberly , I think The plot a sound one : and , besides , if he Wring the old lady past her sufferance , We can remit ; for then the cure will be , Beyond a doubt , accomplished . Gold . Harry Goldstraw I consent . But deal as a good surgeon ; give no pain Where pain is needless ; cut the cancer out , But spare the patient . Ruf .

His weakness does not hide his nobler parts From my respect . We 'll hit upon some way To cure both patients with one medicine . ( Enter Darkly . ) Ruf .

What if the daylight show the torch 's smoke ? Did it not serve us in the middle night , And light us towards the morning ? Rome , thou fool ! There 's not a church , from Luther to George Fox , That on her broad foundations is not built ! Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler You hurl a thunderbolt against a gnat . Peace , father Will ! Trav .

For , bethink thee , brother , It falls on fast-day , when it is thy use To cram thee grossly , just to scorn the church . Dark . Darkly Yea , verily . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Out , glutton ! Dark .

I questioned ; and she made reply , " Young Madge , A child of twenty summers . " So I rose , And came my way . Ruf . Lord Guy Ruffler Unconscionable liar ! You have been nobbing in stale beer with her , Eating cold pasties ; and , for after cates , You stole a brace of kisses . Come , put on Your sanctimonious garb , and follow me.  --  Are you prepared ? To Travers and Goldstraw . Trav . Sir William Travers Yea , verily ! Gold . Harry Goldstraw In sooth ! Dark .

Are heroes proven by the knocks they take ?  --  Is blood the only livery of renown ? I knew a sickly artisan , a man Whose only tie to life was one pale child , His dead wife 's gift .

The river crossed his path , Sliding beneath the bridge , so lovingly , And murmuring  --  death ! Upon his very hearth The tempter sat , amid the flaming coals , And talked with him of  --  death !
