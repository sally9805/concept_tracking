ARTICLE 11. - MASTER AND SERVANT . IN the natural order of things all men occupy a two-fold relation to society which is most simply and fitly expressed by the two words macter and cervant . Mark , this is not saying that society is divided in'to two classes , the master class and the servant class . That is a wholly false notion when applied to American society . As a people we have never been so divided , and so long as we remain true to our national ideal we shall not be in the future . The truth is that each individual occupies this double position . We can not properly say of one man - " He is a servant , " and of another , " He is a master . " Of any man we must rather say that he is in one case a master and in another a servant . Whoever fails to fulfil the duties of either relation , falls in that degree to fulfil the duties of a true citizen , and society has just cause to protest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man to care for my horse , he is a servant so far as the care of my horse is concerned , and I am the master . If he employs a boy to assist him in any way he becomes a master in his relation to the boy . He may even become my master under certain circumstances . If both of us were connected with the army , he being an officer and myself a subordinate , then in our military relations he would be the master and I the servant . Or if I am a railroad man , I become his servant whenever he rides on the railroad or train with which I am connected . In countless ways I may be his master and his servant at the saiue time without inconsistency or friction . The two relations are everywhere so closely interwoven that we can not separate them by lines of division , although we may clearly distinguish the character and significance of each . The relations of master and servant suggest at once the idea of service rendered and of payment made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two , the work and the wages , there is a natural balance which can not be disregarded without doing violence to // the common principles of right and justice . To adjust this balance correctly is one of the most important elements in the social question of the *present day . A lack of adjustment , either real or fancied , is the chief source of discord between different classes of society . Tn this connection two practical lines of duty present themselves to every man . As a servant , it is his duty to work . As a master , it is his duty to pay for work . Let us look at these points a little more in detail . First , consider the relation of work and wages from our position as servants ; remembering that all of us occupy this position unless we have become social barnacles or parasites . Looking at the subject from this standpoint , service must be the most prominent thought . The first duty of the servant is to serve or to work : and the fulfilment of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always think of this . Quite the contrary . Too often the first and chief thought , yes in many cases the only thought of the servant is with reference to his wages . He cares very little how or when his work is done or whether it is done at all , so long as he receives regular and liberal payment . The ambition of many men is to discover some profession or to obtain some official position where there will be " no work to do and a large salary for doing it . " They look upon society as a huge reservoir from which they are to draw out if possible all that they need or desire for a livelihood , and they never trouble their minds to enquire who shall fill the reservoir . Enough for them to know that it contains all they want and they care not though it be exhausted when they are done with it . It is this narrow and selfish view of life that has thrown the wheels of society out of gear , and nothing but a thorough change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We say that there is need of reform ; but what shall the reform be ? How shall it be brought about ? As in all other matters so in this , each class or relation must accomplish the work of reform within its own limits , if that work is to be effectual and permanent . Instead of looking over the fence to discover some evidences of our neighbor 's thriftless work , let us earnestly try to put everything in good order on our own side . // most and the best work he can for the world . If he can secure an adeqnate return for his labor , well ; but if in any case he does not receive all the payment that he might justly claim , the evil is only increased when he relaxes his diligence . By this means in addition to the loss of wages he commits a positive wrong against himself and the commnnity in which he dwells . Idleness is a greater injury to any man than is oppression , and it is a far more prolific cause of poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression or dishonesty of others , ten men suffer from their own indolence . Yet again , as servants we 8hould work heartily . There is a world-wide difference between diligence and heartiness . An animal or even a machine may work diligently ; only a human being can work heartily . The diligent laborer is simply he who employs all his time and power , and does not loiter . A man may be diligent and exact while he knows nothing of the purpose of his work and cares nothing for the interests of his employer . He may work constantly and carefully from the mere desire to keep his place . The true servant does more than this . He identifies his own interests with the interests of his master , and enters into full sympathy with his purposes in so far as they are right and honorable . He not only gives his hands and his feet , ' his mind and his skill , to the service in which he is engaged , but he gives his heart also . The interests of his employer become for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views and desires of his employer , and instead of doing his work with mere mechanical accuracy and diligence , he does it as though the work were his own , and as though his own success depended upon its result . In a land like ours where conditions are constantly changing and everybody hopes " to rise , " there is a natural tendency among servants to think lightly of their work , and to consider it unworthy of their best effort . The college graduate who accepts some small position in a grammar school or counting house imagines that he is fitted for greater things , and instead of putting his whole heart into the work before him so long as he remains in a given position , he goes on in a half-hearted way , doing his work well enough to satisfy the demands of his employers , but ever casting about for some means of escape // most and the best work he can for the world . If he can secure an adeqnate return for his labor , well ; but if in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly claim , the evil is only increased when he relaxes his diligence . By this means in addition to the loss of wages he commits a positive wrong against himself and the community in which he dwells . Idleness is a greater injury to any man than is oppression , and it is a far more prolific cause of poverty . Where one man suffers want in consequence of the oppression or dishonesty of others , ten men suffer from their own indolence . Yet again , as servants we should work heartily . There is a world-wide difference between diligence and heartiness . An animal or even a machine may work diligently ; only a human being can work heartily . The diligent laborer is simply he who employs all his time and power , and does not loiter . A man may be diligent and exact while he knows nothing of the purpose of his work and cares nothing for the interests of his employer . He may work constantly and carefully from the mere desire to keep his place . The true servant does more than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master , and enters into full sympathy with his purposes in so far as they are right and honorable . He not only gives his hands and his feet , his mind and his skill , to the service in which he is engaged , but he gives his heart also . The interests of his employer become for the time his interests . He endeavors to enter into the views and desires of his employer , and instead of doing his work with mere mechanical accuracy and diligence , he does it as though the work were his own , and as though his own success depended upon its result . In a land like ours where conditions are constantly changing and everybody hopes " to rise , " there is a natural tendency among servants to think lightly of their work , and to consider it unworthy of their best effort . The college graduate who accepts some small position in a grammar school or counting house imagines that he is fitted for greater things , and instead of putting his whole heart into the work before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes on in a half-hearted way , doing his work well enough to satisfy the demands of his employers , but ever casting about for some means of escape // from what he considers drudgery . If another opening comes which offers better remuneration , he takes it at once , con suiting oniy his own interests and leaving those of his employer and of his work to take care of themselves . In very many cases young men and women enlist in some temporary profession in early life as a stepping-stone to their life work . This is well enough when they enter that temporary profession heartily ; but when they make their preparation for some future work the first business and their present calling secondary , it is all wrong . No man can honestly undertake any work for another into which , from its nature or circumstances , he can not enter with true heartiness . The college professor should saw wood with as much heartiness as he studies and teaches metaphysics or he should not saw wood at all . If a doctor of divinity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half a day and does it with less earnestness and hearty zeal than he would display in preaching to an audience of ten thousand people for a fee of five hundred dollars , he falls short of the true standard of service . He should during the time for which he is employed become a farmer , with all the enthusiasm of the farmer , the interests of the farmer , the aims of the farmer , so far as that corn is concerned . Instead of mooning over profound questions of theology , he should study the best methods of raising corn , the most efficient manner of handling the hoe , the comparative merits of hilling and drilling . If he can not do this he has no moral right to engage himself to hoe corn . We can not emphasize too strongly the importance of rendering hearty service . It is the crying need of the age . It is this quality that determines to a great degree the value of human labor . It marks the difference between a good servant and a poor servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a horse or of a machine . When men forget this and render heartless , mechanical service , they should not wonder if machines of iron are preferred , and they find themselves crowded out . The hearty worker need never fear that his place will be usurped by machinery ; for it can not be filled by the most elaborate piece of mechanism ever invented . // Perfect service will be joyful and willing as well as hearty . By many all labor is esteemed a drudge and a curse , an evil from which if possible it were desirable to escape . They look forward to a time when service will be a thing of the past , when they can lay aside work and enjoy life ; and so long as they must toil they do it grumblingly and as an unpleasant necessity . Idleness is not , however , an ideal mode of existence ; nor is grumbling a manly virtue . Work is a blessing , not a curse . Without work life would be intolerable . Doubtless there are some who suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from over idleness , for whose pains and wearinesses and discontents the only and certain cure is hard work and plenty of it . In all our service , therefore , we should be actuated by a spirit of real joy ; it should add zest and value to our labor . Rejoice always , Fellow laborer ! It will make your life happier . It will make your work easier . It will make your service more desirable . It will make the world brighter and better . Here our part as serv ts in the grand work of labor reform ends . We have nothing to do with the matter of wages . Our duty and our responsibility is to work ; and if our work be honest , diligent , hearty , willing , we are hastening the solution of all difficulties in the matter of work and wages by the surest means . We are doing more for the emancipation of our fellow laborers and for the overthrow of oppression than the most noisy agitators or the strongest combinations of men can accomplish . This should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly to exert the power of numbers in compelling reform among employers ; but by education and precept and every other available means to reform labor itself and to perfect service . When this is made the chief end of their existence , such organizations will be a real blessing to every community ; and , which is perhaps more in point , they will be a real blessing to laborers . Now let us look at this matter of work and wages from the opposite side , namely , from our standpoint as masters . No one can say , " This does not concern me ; " for all are masters in some way . None of us live so independently that we do // not require the service of others ; and whenever we receive service of any kind , we are , so far as that service is concerned , masters . As masters we are responsi1*le for waqes . It is the first duty of the master to pay for work ; that is , to pay a fair equivalent in some form for service rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employers is not a question of philanthropy . It does not call for the exercise of grace or disinterested benevolence in its solution . It is rather a question of justice , of common honesty , of a fair return for valuable labor . The only sound basis of social relations is the maintenance of strict justice and fair dealing between every man and his fellow . If all men would put in practice the motto , " Be just before you are generous , " the social problem would be wonderfully simplified . Justice is the great desideratum in this matter . There are numbers of people in every community who are generous in their gifts , ever ready to help the poor , pouring out their money like water to relieve distress , who are at the same time dishonest with their servants , screwing down their wages to the minimum , and too often neglecting to pay them when due . There are families living elegantly and in luxury , contributing liberally to every cause where their gifts will be widely known , while their grocer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask in vain for the small si*ims due them . It is a great evil that in this enlightened age the free-handed man is more admired than the man who is scrupulously honest . Of many a man who has gotten riches through notorious dishonesty society says : " Yes , he is a little tricky , and his business methods will not bear too close scrutiny ; but then he is always ready to help the poor and suffering . " As though that were anything to his credit ! Why should he not be willing to give to those in distress a small part of that which he has stolen from other needy ones by his dishonesty . Poor Jones is sick in the hospital and Smith heads a subscriptiou paper with a goodly sum for his relief , and everybody says , " How kind . " The world at large does not realize that when Jones worked for him last year Smith cheated him out of more than ten times the amount of his generous subscription by paying him smaller // wages than others were paying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Jones himself is inclined to forget the sharp dealing of the past , and when he gets well he will go to work again for Smith because of his liberality rather than to work for Brown who pays honest wages and does not cheat him in trade , but who could not afford to help him when he was sick . It is a very cheap way to buy popularity . A man receives a vast amount of praise for his generosity while he lives . Society forgives his thefts and pronounces a eulogy at his funeral . Besides all this he imagines that he is sure of an entrance into heaven on the ground that " charity shall cover the multitude of sins . " If he were strictly honest he would prevent a great deal more suffering than he relieves by his gifts ; but the chances are that he would be neither so wealthy nor so popular . Justice is rare , but those who would profit most by it are most to blame for its rarity . They are quick to praise unscrupulous liberality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fulfill our obligations as masters is a matter of no slight importance . If service should be hearty and willing , we should repay it with equal interest and willingness . The master should sympathize with the servant and identify himself with the servant 's interests , just as truly as the servant should enter heartily into his interests . To pay honest wages for work well done is not a gracious act . It is but a fair exchange of equal values . Neither party to the transaction can rightly consider himself benevolent . Both are benefited ; and each has conferred a favor upon the other . The workman is no more under obligation to the employer than the employer to the workman . One owes no more gratitude than the other . Very many employers assume an air of complacent benevolence whenever they pay the wages of their servants , as though they were making a free gift . Worse than this many withhold their servants ' wages as long as possible , and grumble when called upon for payment as though they were very badly treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer has been cheated by his servant , being overcharged for his work , or having his work badly done , he may justly // make objection and refuse payment . But if the wages are honestly earned in accordance with previous agreement , payment should be made promptly and heartily . It affords a really honest man as much pleasure to pay his debts as it does to receive payment from others . All grudging and grumbling on the part of masters tends to arouse a feeling of bitterness in the hearts of servants , and to create antagonism between those two elements of society that should live in closest harmony . The inevitable result of this patronizing spirit on the part of masters is to pauperize the employed of every class . Men can not occupy the position of beneficiaries , however unjustly , and at the same time maintain true independence and self-respect . Most surely there will follow a marked depreciation of character . Between poverty and pauperism the distance is heaven-wide . Poverty may be hard to bear , but it does not injure character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . Pauperism is always evil . It implies a loss of moral tone that endangers the welfare of society . A pauper is a person who is willingly dependent on others whether he be rich or poor . Every influence that tends to lessen the feeling of self-respect and personal independence in a corresponding degree tends to pauperize men . The only antidote for pauperism is the cultivation among all classes of that manly independence of character which scorns to eat unearned bread or to enjoy unearned luxury . Nothing can exert a more potent influence in this direction than a proper recognition of the nobility of labor and its value as evinced in the willing and liberal payment of wages honestly earned . If justice in the relation of work and wages requires an equal exchange of material values , it requires no less imperatively an equal willingness and kindliness of spirit in both parties to the exchange . As masters we may do much towards the solution of present social problems , not on the one hand by opposing force to force or any measures of retaliation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the poor ; but by honest liberality of dealing with our servants , by kindness of spirit , by a careful respect for manly dignity . The relation of master and servant is the broadest of all social relations . Other relations there are which affect different // parts of society and vary greatly in breadth and importance . This relation is universal . Whoever does not come within its scope is a social monstrosity . It is therefore of the first importance in social reforms that the responsibilities of this relation should be recognized in their twofold bearing , that a true balance should be carefully preserved , and that we should free ourselves from one-sided views and prejudices . Seeing that each represents in himself both phases of the relation , who requires true service from others must render true service to others , who seeks due reward for his service must himself be a model master .
