txt The Slade-Mitchell prize-fight is not to be fought . This is something upon which we may congratulate ourselves , but at the same time it would have been more satisfactory had the fight been prevented by the arrest of the pugilists rather than by their lack of courage . " Mr. lenity HILL , " however , is reported as asserting that the fight shall take place . Mr. HILL says that he is the stakeholder ; that the money to be fought for is in his hands , and that he shall compel the men to fight . What do the authorities propose to ? do with Mr. HILL ? By his own confession he is aiding and abetting prize-fighting by acting as a stakeholder . This offense is punishable by fine and imprisonment , and it is difficult to see what excuse there can be for any failure in the present instance to punish Mr. HILL for his confessed breach of the law . Last Winter a person calling himself " Mr. RICHARD K. Fox " went about proclaiming that he was engaged in arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of the authorities to his case , " Mr. RICHARD K. Fox " was arrested , the revival of the ring , of which he was the chief promoter , suddenly came to an end . " Mr. HARRY HILL " may have as much " influence " as " Mr. RICHARD K. Fox , " but as the authorities were compelled for very shame to arrest the latter , it is possible that " Mr. HARRY HILL " may be made to understand that to aid and abet prize-fighting is an offense for which even the proprietor of a flourishing " gin-mill. " may sometimes be brought to justice .
