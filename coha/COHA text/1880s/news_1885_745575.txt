txt The Democrats of the city last night had caucuses to elect delegates to the County Convention held at North Elmira to-day . The " harmony of enthusiasm " was lacking in the convention , for , indeed , there was nothing to demonstrate that Mr. Hill , whose henchmen tried to run the county , was a master of the situation , and there was much weeping to-night over the result . For the past few days Gov . Hill 's followers have been quietly at work endeavoring to control the delegates , for the purpose of nominating a man for Sheriff that could put several thousand dollars into the canvass , the object being to help Hill ; but late yesterday afternoon the rank and file of the Democratic Party in the several districts saw the game and blocked it . In the Third Ward , Gov . Hill 's home , the canvass became so troublesome that the so-called successful delegates fled through back windows of the voting place , and to-day by advice of the local management a mixed delegation was admitted to seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor headed the delegation in the interest of Hill , but the ticket headed by Charles Hazzard and supported by the young Tammany Alderman , William Walsh , was elected by three to one , and the man who presented David B. Hill 's name to the Saratoga Convention was crushed . In the convention this afternoon there was the most tumultuous uproar . The greatest efforts were put forth to crowd Mr. Hill 's candidates to the front . The honest members of the party , however , would not allow any flank movement , and after the exhaustion of parliamentary tactics nominated the man for Sheriff that was so strenuously opposed by Mr. Hill 's lieutenants , Allen Cooper . The weakest man that could be nominated , Robert P. Bush . who was defeated last Fall , was again nominated for the Assembly , and the struggle for Coroner was amusing , many of the delegates being outspoken after the convention that the party Would need a Coroner to sit on the party after election . Indeed , the Democrats of Elmira , after the expos ? of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anything but a pleasant mood .
