txt Prof. Sumner , who is passing a few days at the house of his friend Corporation Counsel Whitney , in Park-avenue , was asked yesterday whether it was true that there had been a difference of opinion between himself and the officers of Yale College in regard to the employment of Herbert Spencer 's works as text-books . The Prbfessor was at first reluctant to'speak on the subject , but finally declared that the affair had been very much exaggerated . " In December last , " he said . " President Porter wrote to me , calling my attention to the fact that the students under my instruction were using Herbert Spencer 's Study of Sociology ' as a text-book . The book , he thought , was open to grave objections . It treated of sacred subjects in a tone that , however disguised , seemed . to him sneering and flippant , and liable to give a wrong bias to the thoughts and opinions of the students using it . He , therefore , requested that , if possible , its use should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but called on him personally two or three days later , and discussed the subject . I was treated most courteously , and the controversy , if you choose to call it such , was carried on in the most amicable manner on both sides . President Porter did not specify any particular passages which he considered as being of an infidel or irreligious tendency , but contented himself with a general objection to its tone of dealing with sacred things . There was an understanding between us that if the use of the book was prohibited . I should resign my position , as I did not think that I could properly fill the chair of Political and Social Science if I was hedged about and restricted in such a manner . With Mr. Spencer 's individual opinions on matters of religion I have nothing to do , but his work on sociology is the only book of the kind in the English language , and coming from as great a philosopher and student as Mr. Spencer , and embodying , as it does , the results of years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , it naturally commends itself to those engaged in the study of social science . Indeed , it would be difficult to see how English students could study social science at all , if the works of so high an authority as Spencer were to be debarred them . 1 stated my view of the case to President Porter very frankly , and , while he did not at all change his view of the book , he yielded so far as to permit the book to remain upon the schedule , and even went so far as to announce it as one of the subjects of study at the commencement of the January term . It is only used by the Senior Class , and that during one term  --  from New Year 's to Easter . The work was a popular one with certain of the younger students and tutors , and I have been at some pains to restrain the hot-heads among them from getting up a public controversy over the affair . As it was . the whole question was settled between President Porter and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , of a single one of the Faculty , and it has not been reopened since . I may add that I do not expect it will be reopened . President Porter throughout acted in the most courteous and kindly spirit , and while he still retains his original opinion of the book , he has not gone so far as to exclude it . I sincerely trust that the press will let the matter alone , as its agitation would only call forth useless controversy and be prejudicial to the college 's interests . " Social science is a comparatively now study , and Yale is the only college in the country that has a chair especially devoted to the subject The work which President Porter would have had placed under the ban is a red-bound , medium-sized volume of 400 pages , belonging to Appletons ' International Series . The portion of it which has particularly excited the opposition of the clergy is the chapter on " TheTheological Bias , " in which Protestantism , Roman Catholieisth , and Christianity generally are inferentially classed in the same category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work is so cleverly done that it is difficult to single out any one passage as infidel or irreligious , but the tone of the whole is eminently calculated to weaken the reader 's respect for Christianity and Its cardinal doctrines .
