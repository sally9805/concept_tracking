AND TWENTY-THREE of our State Legislatures began their first annual or biennial sessions during the month of January and listened to messages from newly elected or retiring governors , or from both . No less than fourteen governors treated bribery at popular elections in a serious manner , a few made passing reference to the matter , and the governors of Massachusetts , Nevada , Nebraska , Illinois , Pennsylvania , and North Carolina ignored the subject . Prominence is given to election bribery by the governors of Oregon , West Virginia , Tennessee , Delaware , California , Michigan , Rhode Island , Kansas , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , and Indiana . These States are here divided into three groups . The governors of the first four are democratic ; those of the second four are republican ; while the last group are known as the four doubtful States , of which two have republican and two democratic governors . No // January message contains a refutation or denial of the charges of extensive election bribery . We propose to analyze these twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gov . Sylvester Pennoyer of Oregon says : Thoughtful persons of all political parties can not but view with deep concern the increasing systematic bribery of voters at nearly all of our general elections . It is one of the most dangerous portents of the times and one of the most formidable menaces to the perpetuity of our free government . Our statute laws now hold both the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker as equally guilty . This is wrong . The great crime is the crime of the bribe-giver , and the poor man , who , impelled perhaps by the necessities of his family , accepts the bribe , ought rather to be pitied than punished . It is therefore recommended that section 1844 of the laws of Oregon be repealed , which section provides for the punishment of those who accept bribes , for the reason that with this unjust menace removed , the punishment of the bribe-giver will be rendered more easy and certain . Gov . Pennoyer raises here a close question of political ethics . The degrees of moral turpitude in bribe-giving and bribe-taking are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied . Accuse a man of selling his vote and he resents it as if you had denounced him as a thief . Accuse him of buying a vote ,  --  that is , bribing a man to change his politics ,  --  and the chances are that he will not lose his temper . Certainly thousands of men consider vote-purchasing legitimate electioneering . By the test of an appeal to a man 's conscience , therefore , it seems to be more wicked indeed to sell than to buy a vote . The public always loses respect for a man who accepts a bribe ; but partisans do not always lose caste by paying money for other men 's votes . Gov . Pennoyer quite unconsciously yields to the vogue of a dulled moral sense in political matters , when , assuming that the bribe-taker should be " pitied rather than punished , " he undertakes to make the bribe-giver more odious before the law by expunging the selling of one 's snllrages from the list of punishable crimes . He at least might have graded crime by increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution had been formulated by the convention of 1787 , and was being discussed by the various commonwealths , John Dickinson , the Pennsylvania statesman , said in a pamphlet that if our liberties were ever subverted it // would be " by the licentiousness of the people " as well as by the " turbulent spirit of some of the States . " Noah Webster at that time called attention to the fact that in ancient Rome the king and consuls were elected by the body of the people and that " this circumstance paved the way for such excessive bribery and corruption as are wholly unknown in modern times . " The more familiar passages in " The Federalist " turn upon a deep , serious distrust of democracies . The federal argument was that popular governments die by suicide . The first duty of the American lawmaker is to reduce the purchasable vote . The decay of morals as indicated by a citizenship that may be sold like pelts or a day 's wages is appalling to every lover of his country , and Gov . Pennoyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and the bribery market is born of a false system of ethics . The message of Gov . E. W. Wilson of West Virginia contains 338 lines , of which 149 are devoted to corrupt politics . After declaring that our whole country is exposed to the perils of political debauchery , his Excellency says in particular : Reproach has been cast upon our own State as never before by illegal , fraudulent , and corrupt voting in almost every county within its borders . This is so palpable that he who runs may read . The capitations of 1884 , were 133,522 , and the entire vote , after the most active political campaign ever made in the state , 137.587 . The capitations for 1888 were 147,408 , and the entire vote 159,440 . The difference in the capitations and the vote in 1884 was 4065 ; in 1888 it is 12,032 . This shows an increase of votes in four years of 21,853 , which if legitimate would mdi. cate a population of 900,000 and an increase in four years of much more than 100,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The purity of our elections imperatively demands a revision of the election laws . . . . I recommend that a registration law be enacted and that our election laws be amended so that bribery and fraudulent voting may be prevented and the purity of the ballot-box preserved . No one need dispute Gov . Wilson 's facts after the scenes at Charleston , on the 4th of March , when the republican governor elected upon the face of the returns , the president of the State senate , and Mr. Wilson himself all claimed the executive office ; while a fourth man , the democratic candidate for governor , gave notice of a contested election upon grounds of bribery in November perpetrated by republicans . It concerns us more // especially here to note the completeness of Mr. Wilson 's confession of wide-spread bribery as against the barrenness of his recommendation . Any registration law that the Legislature of West Virginia might pass would be subject to the following provisions of the State constitution : No citizen shall ever be denied or refused the right or privilege of voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been registered or listed as a qualified voter . The Legislature shall never authorize or establish any board or court of registration of voters . What good public purpose could be served by the ordering of a registration if the registration list could not be used as a voters ' check list ? Illegal voters in West Virginia can be challenged now , and nothing more could be accomplished under a registration law with the limits set by the constitution . If Gov . Wilson favored registration , why did he not recommend an amendment to the constitution that will permit it ? Gov . Robert L. Taylor of Tennessee says : While our laws are in most respects adequate , yet it seems that the rapid growth of our cities has made more prevalent an evil that is not sufficiently provided against by the law . Many men vote more than once , and it is impossible to fully prevent it , hard to detect them , and more difficult to punish them . In my opinion a well-devised registration law would meet the case . I recommend also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition , powers , and duties of the board of canvassers of election returns . Much complication has recently grown out of the lack of accuracy with which the existing statutes can be construed . The only observation to be made here is that Gov . Taylor 's recommendations go directly to the source of the trouble in his State , although he elected not to spread the information of gross election irregularities before the public . His suggestions have been adopted , and the Legislature has already passed an Australian ballot act for the larger cities of the State , as well as a general registration law . Here are three passages taken from the message of Gen. Benjamin T. Biggs of Delaware : The use of money at elections is alarmingly on the increase . That use has in this state become so great as to call forth a protest by all who favor the purity of the ballot . The present law upon the statute // books does not seem to meet the present needs , and the enforcement of its provisions is practically a dead letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wholesale bribery which has become a main feature in elections , and urge upon you the necessity of prompt action in the matter . So unblushing has the practice become that the votes of men are openly bartered for and secured . Little by little the evil has grown until to-day the number of those who enter the political auction mart and barter and sell their suifrages to the highest bidder is alarmingly large . The evil has grown to such magnitude that the most strenuous legislation is demanded to check its further increase . There should be a law enacted sufficiently rigorous , weighing heavily upon both the buyer and the seller . Provision equally exacting should be made for the failure in the performance of duty on the part of those entrusted with the execution of the law . . . . Every precaution should be taken to secure the purity of the ballot , and you as the chosen representatives of the people , should enact those laws which tend to elevate rather than by passiveness suffer those practices to continue which degrade the morals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to remark that it seems to have become common of late for the ignorant and misinformed in some other states , from motives unworthy of commendation , to misrepresent the laws and government of this state in respect to the right to a just and equal exercise of the elective franchise by its citizens . Even those who assume the office of enlightening public opinion as editors of the public press in other states have abused the office they have assumed in this respect by grossly misrepresenting the laws of Delaware and her people who make those laws . I feel no hesitation in declaring as the executive of this state that there is no other state in the Union where the proper exercise of the elective franchise is more properly and fully secured without restriction or qualification in respect to race , color , or previous condition of servitude than it is in this state It ill becomes those who are not citizens of this state to carp at laws to which they are not subject and in which they have no interest . Concerning those persons to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will have done good work if they properly attend to the performance of the duties imposed upon them as citizens of their respective states . . . . The only amendment ( to the constitution ) I would suggest to the tax collection laws would be that it should be a misdemeanor , punishable by fine or imprisonment , for a collector of the county tax to refuse to give a tax receipt to an assessed voter when the same shall be applied for by him in person and the amount of tax assessed tendered by said voter . There is a growing desire on the part of a large number of our citizens for a revision of the present constitution of the state . By an act passed at the last session of the General Assembly a special election was held on the day therein specified . At that election the number of votes cast for a convention is by many held under the provisions of the constitution // to be insufficient to authorize you to call the same or make provision for its calling . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only upon mature reflection , and in considering how you shall proceed in this which we all acknowledge to be a grave matter , let me urge upon you to act with that caution which the grave nature of the question demands , etc . These three extracts are not here copied in the order of their position in the governor 's message , but they show more plainly as they stand , the idiosyncrasies of his mind . The admission of bribery as a common practice is complete ; the defense of Delaware as to the security of the elective franchise gnaranteed to all voters is spirited , and the comparison with other states in this regard patriotic ; and , finally , the notice to outside critics to tend to their own affairs is severe and parliamentary at the same time . He then recommends that the constitution be so changed that the refusal of a tax collector to give a receipt for taxes paid be ranked as a misdemeanor , and in the same breath the Legislature is cautioned against haste in changing the organic law . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to fully display the stark inconsistencies of this message . It may not be amiss to remind the reader that Delaware is living under a written law framed by the constitutional convention of 1792 . The most important change made since that date was the amendment of 1831 , which makes it all but impossible to call another constitutional convention . It has been frequently tried but in vain . Among the most glaring anachronisms of this venerable instrument may be mentioned equal county representation regardless of population , an exclusive office-appointing executive , a veto-exciupt Legislature , and , finally and most important of all , a taxed elective franchise . The generally recognized abuses in the matter of tax-receipts is the occasion of the governor 's resentment of outside criticism concerning an ill-guarded elective franchise . The illegal disenfranchisement of Delaware voters by refusing such receipts has long been a public scandal . Why Gov . Biggs would make such a crime a misdemeanor rather than a felony is difficult to explain ; and why he does not urge the abolition of taxed suffrage is also a puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . As the matter now stands , Delaware figures among our thrifty commonwealths // as an ancient character arrayed in 18th century clothes which Gov . Biggs sponges and darns with fatuous deliberation and ceremony . We have considered the utterances of four democratic governors . Let us now examine the republican messages . Gov . R. W. Waterman of California says : The frauds and errors discovered in the recent election have demonstrated beyond question that it is absolutely necessary to throw more safeguards around the mode and manner of conducting our elections . Upon a fair ballot and an honest count rests the perpetuity of our government . . . . This is a matter that reaches above and beyond any party considerations ; it is one in which every citizen who believes in good order and who favors a form of government like ours is deeply interested . The casting of a free and untrammeled ballot is the highest and proudest privilege an American citizen enjoys , and every effort should be made to surround the ballot-box against all possible fraud and combinations to defeat the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ward , township , or precinct . I desire to direct your attention to the fact that the laws should be so changed as to provide speedy and prompt modes for election contests for all state officers The law should be so amended as to provide for a state board of canvassers ; a time should be fixed for the board to meet , open , and canvass the returns for state officers , at which meeting representatives of the political parties should be permitted to be present to witness and examine the returns which are to be sent to the secretary of state and by him kept sealed and unopened until the meeting of the board . . . . The time and manner of registration should be clearly settled and should be as nearly uniform as possible in all the interior counties of the state . In some counties there is a re-registration for every general election ; while in others additions only are made to the great register of new names , and it frequently occurs that the names of dead men or of persons who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the great register for several years . This should not be permitted , as it opens the door to fraud and illegal voting . One of the greatest evils and faults of our system is the manner in which election officers have been appointed , especially in the city of San Francisco . Men totally unfit , either by intelligence , morality or instinct , have been named as officers of election without a redeeming qualification in them . Men have been designated to register in the precincts , receive , count and tally the votes and make up as they please election returns , who would not scruple to resort to all that is vile in human nature , to rob the respectable citizen of his birthright , either for a paltry reward of place or for a consideration to advance the interest of some scheming or debased politician . It may be said that the law now provides for the appointment of good and respectable election officers ; but the fact that the // law has not been carried out in its full letter and spirit is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compel , under heavy penalties , the appointing power to name a class of tax-payers as election officers who can be compelled to discharge so high a trust and will not feel that the task is onerous or burdensome . Places should be selected in light and airy rooms , in as respectable localities as it is possible to secure , and where the ballots can be received and counted in the presence and full view of accredited representatives of all parties ; where the caller of the ticket can be seen and if necessary closely watched as he reads off the names , and where the clerks who tally can be seen doing their work honestly and fairly to all . Most of all , adopt measures for a prompt and speedy canvass of the vote . It should be plain , simple , and correct . No delays should be permitted of waiting from two days to a week to know the result of any election either national , state , or municipal With our present election laws ( which in many respects are excellent ) amended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , representative and intelligent election officers we can carry on elections in this state which will give all the people , whatever may be their political beliefs , confidence in our institutions and inspire them with a more zealous and earnest desire to come forward and participate in the affairs of our state for its well-being and continued prosperity . This is in its way a model executive document . The evils are bravely stated and the language of righteous indignation is not emasculated by weak recommendations as to side issues . The election frauds of last autumn ( in San Francisco particularly ) , both at the primaries and at the polls , the bribing , bullying , ballot stealing , and even bloodshed , followed as it all was by weary , not to say demoralizing contested elections , give point to every word Gov . Waterman has written , and his proposed remedies fit his diagnosis ; while his final appeal to the better classes for participation in politics shows the genuine American instincts of the farmer governor of California . Gov . Cyrus G. Luce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous crimes that can be committed is to corrupt the ballot . Our laws against the use of improper means to influence voters are stringent and seem to be ample . Bribery by this use of money or other valuables is severely punished by our laws . And still rumors are current that those wholesome laws are violated with impunity . Whether this is well-founded or not , it is weakening the confidence in our system . And to avoid the injurious effects of this , it is hoped that the election laws may be amended in such a way as to render bribery more difficult and detection more certain . The open charges made in so many quarters that our elections are controlled by the cor // rupt use of money in glaring violation of law are painful to hear and alarming if true . If false , those charges are a gross libel upon our civilization . Unfortunate for state and nation will it be , if the fact is established that men are elected to positions of public trust because of their wealth or ability to use or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the Massachusetts system is earnestly commended to your careful consideration . From that community we hear of little or no complaint against corrupt influences at the polls . To this important subject your best thought is invoked . The objection to the remarks of Gov . Lace is that they are tentative and vagne . He neither affirms or denies that bribery prevails extensively in Michigan . The inference is that in his mind something is wrong , because he recommends the Massachnsetts ballot system . And yet he rather bewilders the reader by stating that under that system Massachusetts shows little or no sign of political corruption . What is known as the Massachusetts system is a modification of the Australian system , but as Massachusetts has placed it upon its statute books but not held an election under it , it is difficult to see what Gov . Luce means . He either has not examined the subject , or , having done so , finds no cause for anxiety . Perhaps it would be considered hypercritical to include Gov . Royal C. Taft of Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Luce has shown . The Rhode Island executive dismisses the subject with the remark : " The question of ballot reform , now being considered by a joint special committee of your body , will come before you for action . The subject is one now occupying the public mind and its importance demands your serious consideration . " Rhode Island is passing through a crisis in constitutional and political matters , and the scandals at elections are notorious . It would not be fair to say , however , that he has done unwisely in refraining from discussing ballot reform after the Legislature has taken the matter up . Gov . J. A. Martin of Kansas treats the subject in a terse , business like way , and tells the Legislature what remedial legislation is needed : I again call the attention of the Legislature to the fact that our present registration law invites and encourages rather than prevents and punishes illegal voting . All good citizens of all political opinions // recognize the necessity of stringent laws to secure purity , honesty , and correctness in the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest coQnt wrongs no one . Every legal voter should be protected in the full enjoymeut of his rights at the ballot box , and at the same time no one should be allowed to cast a vote who has not all the qualifications of a legal voter . A just , wise and adequate , registry hiw wil1 secure these results , and the Legislature should at its present session provide such a law . Our third group of executive messages comes from " the four doubtful States , " - Connecticut , Indiana , New York , and New Jersey , the governors of which are , so it proves , two of them repablican and two of them democratic . In these important conimonwealths strung along through the very heart of our country the untoward elements of political chichanery were stirred to their depths . The most revolting and disquieting phase of venality at the expense of political conviction was that it penetrated the rural districts . We are accustomed to fraud in the low wards of cities , and are hardly surprised when we see the proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignorant voting population in our municipalities is so great . But in the country towns we have hitherto felt sure that no true American will sell his vote . But November 6 has undeceived us . In Connecticut the Yankee farmer drove a hard bargain for his suffrage in numerous in*tances . In some towns it is said the market price reached $50 , and in isolated cases even a higher figure . " At individual sale , " says one Connecticut boss , " the farmer is the best man to approach for his vote . Foreigners can be reached through a leader and not individually . The Connecticut farmers must be bought one by one . " The scandalous scenes in some of the Connecticut towns at the November election were unprecedented . It was not a naturalized voters ' raid for money ; the foreign vote was bought , but Americans living upon land that perchance has passed down in the family from colonial owners , dickered with both republican and democratic heelers as though citizenship were a clover-lot to be harvested . Natwrally Gov . IMlorgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good citizens , especially in New England . He said : The policy and tradition of the state in all its legislation has been and , in the statutes as they now exist , is to provide that every elector shall // be permitted the exercise of the sacred right of the elective franchise , free from the control and knowledge of others as to their individual action or choice . The present provisions of the law fail in the minds of many to provide that absolute secrecy necessary for the fullest and freest exercise of the franchise : renewed demands have been made to successive Legislatures for relief in the belief that such legislation as was asked would tend greatly to the welfare of the state in the purity of its elections , and provide against imaginary or possible intimidation *f the voter . Such measures as have been presented from time to time have failed to receive approval after careful examination as too cumbrous in their execution or suited to the needs of the intelligent people of the state . I would advise , however , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , and that some law , simple in its character and at the same time effective in its operation , be enacted for the protection and secrecy of the ballot . The systems proposed to which my attention has been attracted as suggested and enacted in other states seem too extensive in their provisions and involve unnecessary delays to the elector and large expense to the public without compensating security . The governor proceeds to recommend a modification of the registration laws and the adoption of a provision enforcing the reading of the constitution or statutes as an educational test for voters . All things considered , the words of the Connecticut governor are very disappointing . There is not a whisper of bribery ; - while intimidation , which is not prevalent in Connecticut to any measurable extent , is denounced and the Australian ballot system unmistakably discredited . In striking contrast to Gov . Bulkeley 's ill-judged candor are the following words of Gov . David B. Hill of New York in his message : It is believed that the recent presidential election was the most corrupt of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct use of money was concerned in influencing the electors , and public sentiment is naturally awakened to the desirability of some relief . The peculiar causes which induce this immense corruption are apparent . It was adroitly proclaimed that the success of one of the great political parties would endanger certain of the manufacturing interests of the country which had theretofore been accustomed to receive the fostering aid of the government at the expense of the masses of the people . . . . The anxiety to subserve selfish and private advantage rather than the general interests of the public naturally led to the campaign being conducted upon illegal business principles , whereby it is asserted that electors were bought and sold like goods and chattels in the open market . It is claimed that at least $100,000 were expended in the 20th and 24th Con. * // gressional districts in this state in efforts made therein to elect congressmen and to secure electors believed to be favorable to the policy of fostering private interests . After bringing a serious indictment against the conduct of electors in the Empire State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evidence facts that place the blame upon the republicans . He exposes himself to the imputation of using an official document as the vehicle of partisanship . The menace to our institutions in a chattel electorship is that both parties accepted the gauge of battle , and bought freely . His Excellency takes up ten pages out of a message of thirty pages in the discussion of the subject of ballot reform . He praises the election laws of New York , recommends amendments rendering the act of bribery more difficult , and isolating the polls from party runners , favors a law compelling electors to vote and to cast a secret ballot furnished if thought necessary , at the expense of the state , incorrectly states that the English or Australian system compels each candidate to furnish ballots , opposes the marking of ballots by ballot clerks , thinks that the election districts throughout the state should be multiplied in order to facilitate the work of receiving votes , denounces political mottoes on " pay envelopes** to employ&amp; , favors a compulsory statement of election expenses to be lodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each election , applauds the Massachusetts law giving each employe two hours of working time on election days to perform his political duties and finally warns the Legislature against sudden and radical changes of election laws or the adoption of any " pet scheme of some club , association , or other self-constituted or irresponsible body or individual without any practical experience in the public service and charged with no responsibility for corrupt legislation , but filled with pride of authorship , seeks ( seeking ? ) to impose upon the Legislature its or his own peculiar plan regardless of its actual merits . " In view of the struggle now at its heat in Albany , in the light of which Gov . Hill 's message must be judged , it will be unadvisable to analyze this message here . After his sweeping admissions of bribery and fraud , the wonder is that Gov . Hill should assume the responsibility of obstructing any bill constructed on the general lines of the // Australian ballot method . The insinuation concerning irresponsible bodies inspired by " pride of authorship " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit more and more toward men in private life who discuss affairs of state . Gov . Hill 's message is a curious fusion of the spirit of apparent candor and the instincts of the martinet . He is appalled at the spread of bribery , confesses for his enemies , distrusts lay reformers , calls upon the State to force voters to the polls when the stay-at-home contingent is not important enough to be considered a political evil , yet vetoes a ballot bill drafted from laws that have proved successful after years of trial in other countries . It will be seen by the snbjoined extracts from the message of Gov . Robert S. Green of New Jersey , that at least one democratic executive takes issue with the Hill view of intricate election machinery like the Australian method . Gov . Green frankly spreads the untoward fact of bribery upon his page , and then suggests such remedies as appeals to his common sense : Our statute books are full of laws for the protection of the elector and the punishment of those who seek to improperly influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to have utterly failed of their purpose . The corruptor and the corrupt seem willing to take the risk of detection , indictment and conviction . Corruption stalks unpunished around the election polls ; and men , dignified by law with the privilege and power of electors barter away their manhood and citizenship as merchandise in the market to the highest bidder . If open corruption of the voter is not carried on , the flimsiest pretexts of employment at exorbitant and extravagant amounts are resorted to , until it is notorious that immense sums of money are spent to effect political results . One of the most astounding incidents of this undermining of our institutions is that public political morals seem to be well nigh debauched , and men who are high in public estimation , who in their lives are exemplary and correct not only look with complacency upon this debasement of the franchise , but willingly contribute sums which they must know will be improperly and illegally expended , and triumphantly exult in the success of the corrupt employment of their contributions . . . . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in elections and the intimidation of the voters ineffective . Making it a crime and providing for its punishment fails as a preventive remedy , and the time has come when some other remedial provision should be adopted . No other plan seems to offer so // many advantages as the complete isolation of the voter in preparing and casting his ballot . . . . The details of the system may require much care in their preparation , but the plan of furnishing the voter with his ticket and his perfect isolation while preparing it give more promise of preventing the growing evil of corruption and intimidation at the polls than any other which has been brought to my attention . I again recommend that violation of the election laws be made a cause of challenge . . . . I also recommend that the law with reference to what shall be considered as intimidation or corrupt practices shall be made more clear by defining more fully what acts shall constitute such offenses . . . . The election laws in England , once notorious for corruption , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice . They are subject to the review of the judges , whose determination settles the question , a system which can not be adopted here as to our legislative bodies , as each is by the constitution made the sole judge of the election of its own members ; but the other system which has been adopted and tried successfully in Australia and certain parts of this country can with proper care as to its details , be constitutionally put into operation . These words have no uncertain sound . The governor appears to be aiming at general results and spins no fine theories . It remains to be seen what effect his urgent appeal will have upon the New Jersey Legislature . The last message which we shall examine is that of Gov . Alvin P. Hovey of Indiana , a state that probably felt the shock of the November battle more severely than any in the union . The now common expressions ,  --  " blocks of five " and " the floaters , " designating gangs of purchased voters and the purchasable vote , originated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a matter of issue in the criminal courts . That there was ground for belief among men entrusted with campaign funds that the " floaters " of Indiana were numerous may be reasonably inferred from the words of Gov. ilovey to the Legislature after the elections were over and the party to which he is allied had triumphed : In the late election , charges of fraud and corruption have been freely made by the contending parties , and while we are not authorized to sit in judgment as to the particular acts or cases , we can not shut our eyes to the facts . There is reason to believe that the ballot has been polluted , not only in this state but in many of the other states of the union and in both political parties , until in the eyes of many respectable men it seems to be no longer regarded as a crime . This can not continue and // increase if we hope to perpetuate our free institutions . If it does , a moneyed aristocracy will soon control the destinies of our nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost to us forever . The demagogue who would buy the vote of his poor and needy neighbor is far more corrupt and vile than his victim and will only wait his chance to sell the liberties of his country for a higher price . As a rule , he who buys a vote will sell his own . It is greatly to Gov . Hovey 's credit that he has had the candor and conrage to include his own party in his arraignment of political bribers . He is unsound , we think , in declaring that the bribe-giver is " far more corrupt and vile " than the bribe-taker . However , no good purpose is served by recognizing two degrees of self-abasement in a dishonorable dicker . The legislation suggested by his Excellency is practical and to the point . He reminds the General Assembly that the Indiana constitution has been disregarded in not providing for a registration of voters ; he recommends smaller election precincts , poUing places isolated from political runners , the disenfranchisement of voters who bribe or are bribed for the first offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the disenfranchisement of those who exact contributions from candidates , and he favors a law making false challenges of legal voters at the polls punishable by fine and imprisonment . We have reached the bottom of the list-this dismal and alarming succession of executive warnings . Bribery without precedent in our history is pilloried in all modes and considered from all sides . It is not the purpose of the writer to draw a political moral or to examine what he considers the causes for this epidemic of political vice , but simply to place in compact form the various treatments proposed by the governors . Taken as a body , the six republican and the six democratic governors have not spoken the wisest word in a confessedly serious emergency . They are strong in the academic denunciation of political crime , but many of them lack grip in formulating legislation . Political debauchery can not be cured , it is true , by statutes without the legislation of just minds and the assertion of that popular sentiment which is the genius of our American civilization . Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country now looks to the Legislatures to begin the work of reform . MASON A. GREEN .
