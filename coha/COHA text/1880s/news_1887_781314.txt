txt Another water famine is upon the greater portion of this city , caused by the third break within a short time of the 36-inch water main which supplies all of Washington north of L-street , The break is the most serious which has yet occurred , and it is feared that the northern part of the city will be without water for some days to come . The break took place about 3 o'clock this morning without a moment 's warning . Suddenly and with a loud report the water spouted up in the air . The people iu the neighborhood were ' startled from their sleep by the noise , and in a few moments the vicinity of the accident was alive with excited and alarmed people . On the south side or L-street , between Twentieth and Twenty-first street , a column of water broke from the pavement , with it roar and a rush that could be heard squares away . L-street , from Nineteenth to Twenty-first street , was one great river , the water pouring along like a torrent , deep enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes not only the concrete road . way . but the sidewalks and the major portion of the parking on each side . The side streets were also flooded , but not so much , the grade up to K-street keeping the water from rising in that direction . The alleys were like creeks , in which the water was ankle deep . The sewers at the various corners were utterlyinadequate to carry off the water , and in a few minutes the cellars and basements of the houses on the north side of the street opposite the break were flooded . The property damaged is considerable , but this is as nothing compared with the inconvenience to thousands of citizens and certain disaster in case of lire . The public wells were exhausted at an early hour , and crowds of people with buckets in hand were walking from place to place in the endeavor to obtain enough water to prepare the morning meal . The officers of the Water Board are making temporary repairs to the broken main ; and hope to relieve the citizens some time to-morrow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home when found . It is thought the large main will have to be taken up and relaid.
