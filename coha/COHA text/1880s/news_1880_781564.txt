txt It is evident that , in the formation of the Massachusetts Democratic ticket , yesterday , BUTLER conceded much to " the boys . " It was BUTLER 'S convention , and if anything were needed to complete his triumph in the presence of his bitterest enemies , it might have been found in his nomination by acclamation . But the cunning old man declined this honor in advance . At a word from him , the assemblage would have carried his name through with a hurrah and a blaze of glory . BUTLER said that " he could afford to wait . " He laid his hand upon his honest heart and said , in the words of another great Democrat , " Your candidate I can not be . " This was a disappointment to his ardent followers . They refused , therefore , to take the man who had been selected for them by their chief . Ex-Gov . GASTON was BUTLER 'S choice . His nomination would show that BUTLER was willing to concede everything now to the " Silver Top , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party is different and hostile to BUTLER . But " the boys " would have none of him . A vehement attack was made on the highly respectable ex-Governor , who must writhe with shame when he knows that , after his name had been kicked about the convention , he was finally defeated by CHARLES P. THOMPSON , justly celebrated as " the man who beat BUTLER " several years since . THOMPSON received 530 votes to GASTON 'S 448 . Curiously enough , ALPHA E. TuomPsoig , of Woburn , was nominated for Lieutenant-Governor , so that the Democrats of Massachusetts go into the canvass with the euphonious slogan of Thom's= and THOMPSON . This is a great year in Massachusetts for the THOMPSON family . It should not be presume d , however , that BUTLER has been defeated by his own followers . They consider that he is too magnanimous in his treatment of the Democracy . He has fairly vanquished the Abbotts , Averys , and Saltonstalls , who have so long derided him as an unprincipled and vulgar adventurer . Last year they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Massachusetts . This year he has both machinery and votes . He is wise in his forbearance . The nomination of THOMPSON for Governor , though against BUTLER 'S wishes , can not be distasteful to him . Although TnoNt-Psox did beat BUTLER for Congress years ago , the two men are now friends and workers together . BUTLER has proved the sincerity of his conversion by his willingness to give the nomination to GASTON . He has seen his own followers force the nomination of THomrsoN and TRox-rsoN . It was BUTLER 'S convention , and the crafty old man must have hugged himself with delight when his name and those of ABBOTT , CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS , CHARLES LEVI WOODBURY , and TARBOX were read out as among the Vice-Presidents of the convention . Politics makes strange bedfellows , and nothing more grotesque than this combination has been seen in many a day . It was BUTLER 'S convention , too , as shown by the eager desire of its members to bear him speak . Ifntimely interruptions in the order of business were made by his admirers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much as a favorite comic actor is entreated to sing when he should be doing something else . BUTLER 'S speech , when it did come , was not a happy one . He was neither epigrammatic nor abusive . He spoke , however , of the unbroken , glorious record of the Democratic Party as though he had never for a day ceased to be a member of that organization . Of course , the audience rapturously applauded the audacious statement that Democrats fought the late war through and , thereby , abolished slavery . What a Democratic solid South will say to this we can not say ; but the hero of Dutch Gap might have spared the Republican Party the hard blow dealt in his assertion that , but for their opposition , Gen. GRANT , " one of the greatest of Democrats , " would have added San Domingo , Jamaica , Porto Rico , and probably Cuba , to the national domain . We can endure being told that Democratic Administrations made the Louisiana purchase and " bought " California , as against the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be reminded that we do not now own the West Indies because the Republican Party is not in favor of universal annexation . The platform adopted by the convention is a sort of " confound everybody " yell of discontent and defiance . Nothing has gone right anywhere since the Democrats went out of power in the State and in the Republic . As usual with Democrats when platform-making , they of Massachusetts do not propose to do anything themselves . They are content with condemning all that has been undone , or left undone , by the Republicans . They are like that class of zealous agnostics who are so busy with demolishing the religious beliefs of other people that they have no time to construct one for themselves . But why should the Massachusetts Democracy bother with platforms and principles ? All that they have , and are , or expect to be , may now be summed up in one word  --  BUTLER . The party has but one mission  --  to elect BUTLER . For the present , THOMPSON and THOMPSON is a phrase good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he will do what he pleases with it . He had only to reach out his hand and the Gubernatorial nomination was his . He prefers to wait . It is a bad time for BUTLER or anybody else to go into the Democratic Party . But this is all that is left him . He is a roaring convert . When he has been fumigated for a year , he will be ready to lead the party as its candidate .
