txt Within the past few months , as attentive newspaper readers must have noticed , there have been many murders and attempts at mfirder of young women by young men who have been.rejected suitors . One might almost say that there has been something very like an epidemic of this peculiar variety of crime . It has be- come common for men who are denied the privilege ( as they consider it ) of marrying a woman to kill her , or to try to kill her . A young woman tells a suitor that she can not marry him ; that she does not love him , and that her heart is Another 's . He persists in his entreaties and importunities . She is obdurate . He says that his life will be a blank without her , and that he is bound to " do something desperate " if she refuses him . Perhaps she laughs . It is natural for a woman to be tickled by the thought that she is essential to a man 's happiness , even although the man be otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that his suit is all in Vain , he draws a pistol and shoots the object of his devotion . The farce becomes a tragedy . Why do not philosophers and psychologists investigate this subject ? It would be interesting to men of science , and the student of human society would like to know how it happens that a man who really and truly loves a woman is willing under any circumstances to kill her . It will not do to call this passion jealousy . The jealous Moor , to be sure , slew his wife because his reason had been taken captive by " the green.eyed monster . " But Desdemona was the lawful and wedded wife of Othello ; and , moreover , he believed her guilty of the gravest sin which a woman can commit against her husband . The jealousy of the Moor had in it an element of revenge which does not enter into the complex emotion which drives a man to , the murder of the irresponsive object of his affections . Although the desperate and passionate suitor declares that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before he fires the fatal shot , it is generally a blind sort of rage which moves him to the murderous act . He has not been outraged by any crime against himself . Vain he may be , but never so vain as to believe that he has been betrayed by the woman whom he has sought to win but has never won . The rape of the Sabine women may he taken as a historical instance indicative of the temper with which men sbmetimea woo . The Romans wanted wives . No women were to be had in the region of Rome , and the Romans rode over into the country of the Sabines , seized the women , and carried them off . It is a tradition that these strangely mated couples " lived happily all the days of their lives , " after the manner of people in story-books . If the modern wooer had the facilities for kidnapping and keeping captives which were enjoyed by the men of old times , he would probably carry off his obdurate sweetheart and lock her up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with the Sabine women , but they carried them off for all that . The men who make love with a pistol concealed in the hip-pocket of their pantaloons only lack opportunity to imitate the abductors of the Sabines . Failing in this , they make all secure , . so far as possible rivals are concerned , by killing the women who will not marry them . If there is anything more selfish than this in the whole catalogue of human weakness it has not become notorious . Compared to this crime murder for the sake of money is a light and genteel employment . The irrational feature of the crime which we are considering lies in the willingness of a man to put to death by violence a woman who , he swears , is the object of his deepest affections . A man may love a woman , and yet , moved by jealousy and rage , may kill her , as the Moor killed Desdemona . But how he who swears that he adores a woman , and is desirous of making her his life-long mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do this deed immediately after an urgent pressing of his suit , this is what seems monstrous and unnatural . We associate assassination with hatred and malice . How can a sane creature love a woman so passionately that he is willing to kill her ? Of course , it would be useless to argue with one of these maniacs  --  for they are little less than maniacs  --  that women who have a right to choose a husband have a right to live . There is no approach to the reason of a man who has wrought himself up to that pitch that he will commit murder rather than live apart from some one woman . Men have been refused by lovely-women before now , and have lived to be glad of it . The man who , instead of waiting for the healing influences of time , adds crime to his apparent ill-luck , is an abnormal development worthy of the study of those who would explore the hidden motives of men .                @ @ @ @ @
