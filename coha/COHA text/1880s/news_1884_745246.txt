txt There could be no better evidence of an utter lack of ammunition on the part of the opponents of Gov . CLEVELAND than is afforded by the so-called report of the Subcommittee of the Executive Committee of the Young Men 's Republican Club of this city . Whether this report was ever submitted to the Executive Committee and by it adopted does not appear , but great care seems to have been exercised to restrict its circulation by furnishing it only to the Blaine organ and the Butler organ in this city . The Young Men 's Republican Club is composed chiefly of officeholders and officeseekers who have been wont to masquerade as reformers because they could not obtain all they asked for from the regular machine . This is especially true of its leading light , Mr. GILBERT R. HAwES , whose efforts to obtain office have been many times disappointed , and whose signature is appended to this " report . " The report is made up of stale charges , most of which have been repeatedly refuted . It sets out with a labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office bill was not justified , and was induced by a desire to retain the political favor of HUBERT 0 . THOMPSON . The statement of Mr. FRANCIS M. SCOTT , the framer and an earnest advocate of the original bill , may be recalled as a sufficient answer to all this . The Dayton amendment so muddled the bill that it provided for a twenty-three months ' term of office for those appointed under it and made no provision for the appointment of their successors or the duration of their terms . The Governor followed his invariable rule in withholding his approval from a defective act that would surely create confusion and litigation . ) In the language of Mr. SCOTT , as it , reached him " it was a very shabby piece of legislation , quite unfit to find a place . in the statute book . " The Governor 's failure to act upon the charges against Sheriff DAVIDSON is the next count in this precious indictment . Our Albany dispatches show that this , the only serious point in the whole document , was altogether " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Governor in June he has . been constantly engaged . upon the accumulated business of his office , even taking papers with him on his .. vacation trip , and he reached this case in the regular order about the middle of September . After giving it careful study he sent to the Sheriff ten days ago an official notification to file his answer to the charges in twenty days . The matter has not been neglected and the Governor 's final action is yet to be taken . There is no reason to believe that it will be influenced by any dread of the wrath of Irving Hall . The Governor signed a bill under which the expenses of Commissioner THOMPSON in defending himself against charges before the Senate investigating committee may be paid by the city . : 1 As no action was recommended by the committee or taken by any authority based on a justification of the charges , he simply followed what has been a uniform custom in such cases . If there is any responsibility for the failure of . the investigation it rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ? the Governor ; but so long as it failed the accused officer could not be justly left to pay the cost of defending his office . But this is made the subject of attack upon the Governor . ; At this point is injected a flimsy charge of injustice in rejecting certain appropriations for the payment of outlawed private claims while one was allowed for the payment of unpaid salaries of public officers nearly as old . Against the merits of the latter claim nothing whatever is alleged . The veto of the Five-cent Fare bill is brought up once more , but the discussion of this has become tiresome and is no longer likely to change opinions . We have only to say that there is no doubt that the Governor acted upon an earnest conviction of duty in the performance of an act which he knew would be unpopular . He is also arraigned once more for vetoing the Mechanics ' Lien bill . As to ? this , the President of the State Trades Assembly wrote on the 21st of July : " It is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bill , because , through errors of our own in drafting the measure , the bill as passed would have been a positive injury to us . " He is therefore condemned by this zealous subcommittee for saving the workingmen of the State from a " positive injury . " The next charge is that the Governor did not veto the bill providing for the new aqueduct and the commission charged with its construction . We leave this to have its full effect . With the exception of another claim upon the Treasury of the State , of the merits of which we have no knowledge , and of the failure to approve the payment of the Capitol architects for certain extra work , which we have always thought was a mistake , this is the whole arraignment , the total result of this investigation of " the public career and official record of GROVER CLEVELAND . " Nobody pretends that the Governor is the embodiment of human perfection and has made no mistakes , but it is surprising how little can be found by the bitterest partisanship to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impair the splendid record which , on the whole , he has made while keeping constantly before his mind the motto of his official life , " . Public office is a public trust . "
