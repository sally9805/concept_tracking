txt We give in our Washington dispatches this morning our usual monthly analysis and explanation of the Treasury statement , and of the operations of the Treasury during the month . It will repay careful examination by those who realize the great influence exerted upon the business of the country by the extensive transactions of the Government . Two-thirds of the fiscal year have now passed . The receipts from all sources in that time , as compared with the corresponding period of last year , have fallen off some $33,000,000 ; the expenditures have also been reduced some $7X100,000 , and the net surplus revenue is less than last year by over $26,000,000 , ( $26,342,663 . ) The surplus for the eight months remains , however , over $66,000,000 , or at the rate of $100,000,000 a year . This is after eight months ' operation of the tax reduction of last March . The Customs receipts have been $16,000,000 less , and the internal revenue has been $18,000,000 less . Of these figures it is only necessary to say that they show conclusively that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people demand and what they have a right to get from the hands of their representatives . It has not relieved the country of the burden of unnecessary , and therefore unjust and oppressive , taxation . The production and the industry of the Union are still weighed down by the $100,000,000 which they are obliged by law to pour into the vaults of the Treasury without receiving any adequate equivalent , and in a manner peculiarly injurious . The duty of Congress is perfectly plain . The taxes should be reduced at least $50,000,000 . Nothing less will satisfy the needs or the wishes of the people . The details of . the Treasury statement also show that the poison of the debased coinage is beginning to work . Last month the Treasury received $3,500,000 of the depreciated silver dollars , or about threequarters of a million more than were issued from the mints , which can only be explained by the payment of Government dues to that amount in silver . As has been repeatedly explained , silver goes , and is bound to go , into the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country for gold , for at that moment the relative inferiority of silver is felt by every one , and it begins to be got rid of . Our correspondent states that the " Treasury officials do not attach any particular significance to the exportation of gold and are inclined to believe that it is attributable to artificial causes , and perhaps mainly to the fact that the Assistant Treasurer at New-York recently propounded to the Clearing-house Association a question touching the settlement of balances against the Treasury in silver certificates . " We do not know to what officials this refers , but we advise them to restrain their inclination to interpret financial events in this way . The " causes " of the exportation of gold are no more " artificial " than the movements of the storm centres , and Mr. ACTON has no more influence over them than has the Signal Service Bureau over the latter . Gold will go out of the country only because it pays to send it , and the only serious danger from its departure is the fact that depreciated silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary , but the danger from it steadily increases from the coinage of sil- ver , which goes on regardless of the law of trade or the dictates of common sense Here again the duty of Congress is plain It should stop the coinage of silver . Al the people of the United States ask is fo the Government to take by taxation ni more of their earnings than is needed , am to cease forcing on them a coin which i not worth its face value .
