SCENE as before . Alison and Franklin are sitting together after luncheon . FRANKLIN. - HOW the day has changed since the morning ! The sky has become like lead , and-yes , I thought so-there is a spot of rain on the window . A sudden blight seems to have fallen upon everything . One would almost fancy one was looking at a different world . ALISON. -I foresaw something like this as we were coming up from the rocks . The wind had shifted even then , and the trawlers , as , you noticed , were being got ready for sea . How pleasant the breeze sounded , flapping the red sails ! FRANKLJN. -I was thinking less of the sails than of the sailors . What fine , bold faces , and what muscular chests and arms ! If your grottoes of this morning might be the homes of Greek sea-nymphs , these Jersey fishermen might well be the descendants of vikings . ALIsoN. - They not only might be : they very probably are . All the same , I am surprised to hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? ALJsoN. - Because , according to your ideas , they might as well be the descendants of counter-jumpers . It is surely the Radical view that descent is nothing more than an accident . I am surprised , too , that a Radical should think it any praise to a fisherman to say of him that he looked as if he had a monster like a king for his father . FRANKLIN. - Kings would not be monsters , they would be models , if they really were the fathers of fishermen ; and when our next Royal Highness asks to be settled in life by the nation , I would willingly support a parliamentary grant to him of a fishing-smack . However , to be serious : as regards the question 46* // of descent , Radicals are by no means so irrational in their views as you imagine them . Hereditary qualities they acknowledge and would utilize ; all they object to is hereditary prestige . A healthy father and mother will have , probably , healthy children ; but if you wanted an active laborer , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born of muscular parents . It is precisely because we believe so strongly in natural distinctions that we are resolved as soon as possible to do away with artificial distinctions . ALIsoN. - The question is , how far do natural distinctions descend ; or , how far , in other words , do artificial distinctions coincide with them * So far as political capacity goes , you and your party think they do not coincide at all . I was surprised , therefore , at a man , who ridicules the idea of a race of hereditary politicians , taking so naturally to the idea of a race of hereditary sea-f arers . FRANKLJN. -I ani glad you have brought me back to the point we started from ; but , in the first place , let me set you right about one thing . No Radical denies that the son of a great politician may , in many cases , inherit his father 's talents ; and when this happens every Radical will be delighted . Practically , however , such an event is an accident ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a certainty . With regard to these Jersey fishermen , the question is different . Physical peculiarities descend far more calculably than mental . High cheek-bones are inherited , when high thoughts are not ; and you can tell the son of a Chinaman more easily than the son of a genius . But if you ask me to explain seriously the allusion which I made just now to the vikings , I was thinking of something far more certain than the heredity of any congenital qualities whatsoever . Let us hold what views we will as to birth , we can none of us doubt the results of early habit and education . AUISON. - On the contrary . The results of education are to me doubtful in the extreme . FRANKLIN. -I am not speaking now of the education given in board-schools ; though if we were , I should be well prepared to defend it . I am speaking of the education that comes from the practice of any calling , and the results of it , in that sense , even you must admit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen any vikings ; but we all of us have at least sonic conventional notion of them ; and if these fishermen struck // me as being like their descendants , it was because they struck me as the inheritors of a very similar education . Of course , that chance fancy of mine is in itself not worth talking about ; but the truth that lay at the bottom of it is one of the first importance . Of the physique of the fishermen , something , no doubt , is due to race ; but even of that , not all ; while , as to their other characteristics , education may claim nearly the whole of them . Do you remember that huge man , with the red handkerchief round his neck , whom we both of us just now noticed , as he sang , while arranging his nets , what sounded like some Norse seasong ? Well-his blue eyes , his fair hair , and his staturethese , no doubt , he had as a birth-right from his parents . But his cheeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his parents , or to the sun and the sea winds ? While , as to his hardihood , his endurance , his presence of mind in the face of special dangers , his insensibility to many things that to other men would be intolerable ,  --  still more plainly does he owe these not to birth , but to education . Suppose that same man had a twin brother , brought up in a city office , who went daily to and from his work in an omnibus , and spent his evenings at a music-hall or in the pit of a theater . How different even in look , still more in character , would the clerk be from the fisherman ! Nature to each would wear a totally different aspect , each would meet it with a different front and feelings-with a different standard of what is painful , neutral , or pleasurable ; so that what to the fisherman is a healthy life and livelihood , would be first a terror and then death to the clerk . You may be sure that the clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , in spite of his birth , have suggested few thoughts to me of the vikings . ALIsON. - Pcrhaps not . All the same I believe that such a clerk as you speak of would have all his brother 's special faculties dormant in him ; and that a few weeks ' experience of the ancestral life would show him possessed of every ancestral aptitude . I do not mean that in so short a time he would have mas - tered all the details of a fisherman 's special knowledge , or that he would prove to have been born with a chart of the coasts of Jersey , ingrained like a strawberry-mark in his soul 's inner consciousness . I speak merely of those striking general qualities , such as courage , presence of mind , and physical endurance which you attribute to his brother . // FRANKLIN. - YOU mean that there would exist in him , solely in virtue of his parentage , and wholly apart from early example and education , a natural taste for the sea , a natural indifference to and familiarity with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave and weather ? Ai*IsoN. - Such is my faith in the virtue of pure blood , no matter whether it be that of fisherman or aristocrat . Surely you ought to agree with me-you , who are a disciple of Darwin . FR*i*uN. *-The importance of what you call pure blood , whatever it may be in the case of pouter pigeons and race-horses , is less in man than in any other animal , and is confined almost to his lower and less human qualities . Amongst the civilized races , at all events , its effects are hardly appreciable , when compared with those of education . Did not the scholars and saints of the Middle Ages rise continually from the rank of serfs and peasants ? Even feminine beauty , which no doubt does run in families , owes much to similarities in post-natal circumstances ; and what foolish novelists call the " patrician type " buds , though it may not blossom , among the families of the people . But to come back to the fishermen . Can you think , even for an instant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born insensible to it ? Will one who has held a pen all his life in an office acquire suddenly the horny hands of a sailor ? Will one who has been sheltered from every draft of air and from every shower not feel intolerable the squall and the driving foam ? These things to the fisherman , though not pleasant , are merely part of the wear and tear of existence . He climbs the mast as indifferently as his brother , the clerk , mounts an omnibus ; and he has the same sort of liking for the sea that his brother , the clerk , has for London . But why ? Not because he is his father 's son , but because he has been his father 's companion ; and that character which you think he inherits , it has really taken years of a special life to fabricate . ALisoN. - According to your view , then , if some half dozen brothers were adopted from the cradle by as many different foster-parents , they might be so brought up as to present no trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the same class . They might be different , not only in tastes , in habits , and in thoughts , but even in phyJeal capacities and constitutions . Different kinds of food , different modes of life , would be pleasant to them . To the palate of one anything but // f7I&amp;dteau* Margaux might be distasteful ; to the palate of another , anything but gin or beer . One might be a sailor with a frame , as you say , insensible to what we call hardship ; another might be so organized that he would really feel as a hardship what would , to most men , be merely the absence of a luxury . FRANKLIN. - Of course , as I said before , descent , though not much , is something . Some children are born cripples , or idiots ; here and there , again , is an infant Hercules . But taking the average of mankind among the civilized races , I should say that in their cradles all classes were equal ; and that the average baby , whether born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which peer or peasant might be made . AUsON.  --  and you think this truth so clearly proved , that a person like myself can be blind to it through class prejudice only ? FRANimIN. -I have no wish to overstate the matter . I think it possible for a man , quite apart from prejudice , to believe in inherited differences somewhat more than I do ; but when these are compared with the differences produced by education , I believe that , apart from prejudice , no one would think them great enough to be of any practical importance , still less to justify any formal recognition of them by society . ALJSON.  --  and supposing a man-myself , for instance-to have got rid of his prejudices , and thus to see the question as you do , you believe that , if he is honest and logical , he will become a Radical , as you are ? FRANJiuN. -I do believe so , most certainly . As for prejudice , or what Herbert Spencer calls the class-bias , the extent to which it hides social truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects , nor in all cases blame the sufferers from them . Still , when you gravely tell me that a man brought up as a cockney would , simply because he was born of a long line of sailors , prove a seasoned sailor himself the moment he set foot in a fishing-smack , I must confess that you seem to be intentionally allowing your prejudice to run away with you ; if , indeed , I am really to believe you serious . ALISON. - My dear fellow , that 's the very thing you arc not to believe . Of what I said to you about the clerk and the sailor , prejudiced as I am , I did not mean a word . FRANKLIN. - It tends , perhaps , to make discussion a little difficult , if one of the disputants is reasoning from a proposition which he admits to be meaningless . // ALISON. - DO n't be offended . I was not playing the fool with you . I merely told a lie , that I might draw from your own lips as strong a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . There are certain claims , no doubt , which I should make for birth , and which you would disallow . But compared with the claims of education they are , as you say , insignificant ; and for argument 's sake I will cede them altogether . Yes , education , - we are not talking , remember , of schools , but of the education that comes of all formative experience - the education of board and bed , the education of business , of labor , and of association , - education in this sense of the word is indeed the main power which fashions the raw human material , if not into different characters , at least into different classes . I grant you all this , I say , for argument 's sake ; I grant you most of it for the sake of truth ; and yet , for all this , I am not a Radical . FRANKLIN. - YOu mean that , in spite of what you have just now admitted , you are still an advocate of hereditary rank and privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves born to rule and others born to submit ? I can conceive your maintaining that the son of a rich father is , from superior opportunities , more likely than the son of a poor man to acquire capacities for government . Myself , I should demur even to this ; but you , I conceive , mean more than this . You mean that not only is the son of a rich man better than the son of a poor man ; but that the descendant of ten rich men is better than the son of one . ALJsON. -I do ; though I should allow , with the utmost liberality , for exceptions . FRANKLIN .  --  and yet you admit that , on the average , in our cradles we all are equal ; and that the baby who numbers twenty earls as his ancestors , is nof* socially different from the baby of a village grocer . ALJsoN. - For argument 's sake I admit it . You need not look at me so suspiciously . I am perfectly serious now . All are equal when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you wonder I am not a Radical . When babies govern us , and when society consists of babies , I will become one instantly - then , but not till then . FRANKLIN. - That is well enough for a retort ; but retorts are not arguments . ALizso*. - On the contrary , whether it be a retort or no , it is an argument of the gravest and most matter-of-fact kind . // Let me put my own position a little more plainly before you . Here we are - having come there by another route - at exactly the same point where we broke off our discussion this morning . I maintained , if you recollect , that those feelings between class and class , which are somewhat analagons to those of lord and vassal , and which it is the main desire of you Radicals to eradicate , are in reality the very soul of national life ; and that , though as time goes on they will naturally undergo many changes , to destroy them would be to destroy civilization . FRANKLJN. - Am I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play upon me ? ALISoN. -I am trying to be as sober as possible , and to speak with as little exaggeration . FRANKLIN. - YOu think , then , that to abolish the House of Lords would rdin the trade of England , and make us all once more savages ? ALIsoN. - The House of Lords is but a sign of our civilization ; our trade and wealth in themselves are merely the soulless body of it . FRANKLIN. - Our civilization , I think , must be in a bad way , if the House of Lords is a sign of it . ALIsoN. - You are now doing what a moment ago you said I was . You are using retorts , not arguments . Why should you be angry or irritated with me ? Bear with me patiently , at least till I have explained my meaning , which as yet , I fear , I must have done very imperfectly . With regard to the House of Lords , I can conceive of its being abolished , or of its powers being modified , on the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition or its continued existence will , either of them , depend entirely on the grounds on which it is attacked or defended . I must , however , run the risk of annoying you by saying that , should it be abolished , on the gronuds which are put forward by you ,  --  should its abolition , if it took place , indicate the triumph of your special principles ,  --  its abolition would , in my judgment , be a sign of a gradual relapse on the part of England into barbarism . Let me put the matter more plainly yet . I was not speaking of the Honse of Lords nor thinking of it ; it was you who brought it into the conversation . Since , however , I responded to your implied challenge about it , I must tell you in what spirit I spoke of the House of Lords , not in any way as a part of the English constitution , but as a // convenient symbol of the structure of English society ; and , regarding it in that light , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I mainly value it is the very reason for which Radicals mainly hate it . I value it because it is a symbol of the loyalty of class to class-of submission on the one side , and care and patronage on the other ; because it is a public , a national acknowledgment that men are not equal , but that some are born to serve , others to rule ; and that , exceptional cases apart , we all come into the world with our wants , our pleasures , our duties , and our ambitions circumscribed for us by the station into which we are born . See , I have put my case strongly ; and I think , by this time at any rate , you must understand me . I am much obliged to you for having listened to me so kindly ; and now treat me as I have treated you . Put your case strongly also ; and however irrational , inhuman , stupid , selfish , dishonest , or brutal you think my views to be , do not scruple to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality in the cradle , we are both of us taking our stand on exactly the same premises . FR*iIJN. - A few moments ago , you thought that what you said irritated me . Let me beg you to believe I am not speaking in irritation now . I am obliged to make this preface , for I certainly shall speak strongly . That view of life , then , which you insist I am to accept as your own , seems to me a negation , at once cruel , stupid , and hopeless , of everything in the social order which , in these days , makes the idea of society tolerable , which benevolence wishes , which reason demands , and which the course of events is accomplishing . I will not indulge my feelings farther in any indignant generalities . These are enough , and indignant enough ; I will now explain them in detail . What the Radical believes , and what you , too , say you believe , is that Nature , when she sends children into the world , is no respecter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of class superstition , what really differentiates , and what really graduates men , is not their birth , but their life . ALISON. - Excuse my interrupting you ; but so long as men are born to unequal fortunes , their life will be differentiated and graduated by the accident of their birth ; nor will they any the less be divided into different classes . FRANKLIN. - If you listen , you will see that that is the very point I was coming to . Of course , there will be different classes so long as civilization lasts . No Radical is such a fool as to // think there will not . As long as knowledge lasts there will be thinkers and men of science ; as long as men eat fish there will be fishermen . ALISON .  --  and do I not gather from what you just now said that the man of science and the fisherman will be so far different beings , that not only their happiness , but even their health , will depend on social conditions of a widely different character ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with insisting on . If physical labor were as hard to the physical laborers as it would be to those whose labor is mainly mental , we should have to regard civilization itself as criminal . You seem to imagine , however , from the tone in which you urge this fact on me , that there is something in it that is inconsistent with my position . That shows how imperfectly , even yet , you grasp what that position is . We do not say there is to be no difference in classes , any more than we say that there is no difference in capacity ; but what we declare to be the truth , and what we desire to see recognized as being the truth , is that class depends on capacity , not capacity on class . We do not think that any * child can become a prime minister ; but we should wish every fisherman 's child to be conscious that , did his talents and opportunities fit him for the career of politics , there would be nothing incongruous , nothing unusual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state . So , too , with regard to social distinctions ( supposing their continued existence ) , we should wish every fisherman 's son to feel that , had he social talents and social opportunities , there 15 no company , no matter how brilliant , with which he would not have a natural right to mix . ALIsoN. - If that is what you mean , your millennium has begun already . Surely in politics , even you must be satisfied with the number of men who are wholly without pedigree , and I might say the same thing , very nearly , of smart London society . FRANKLIN. - YeS , things are moving in the right direction ; but before we are satisfied , they have far to move yet . As to smart society , I mentioned that as an illustration of my meaning merely , not as any part of the substance of it ; but as an illustration it is exceedingly useful . I heard the other day of a man , of what you would call high family , who had been honored VOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great Liberal peer , by meeting at dinner several of the most brilliant thinkers of the day , and on some one remarking to him how the fine ladies present paid court to them , " It is the distinguished thing now , " he said , " not to have had a grandfather . " ALISoN. - Such a sneer , on his part , seems to me to have been rather vulgar . FRANKLIN. -I am not concerned with its vulgarity , and I am not quoting it as a sneer . Let me suppose it to be the literal truth . What I want to tell you is this : It is not a truth with which any Radical would be satisfied . We no more want it to be a distinguished thing not to have had a grandfather than to have had one . We want the matter to be one of total indifference , and the position of a man 's parents to be of no more social importance to him than the color of their eyes , or the number and length of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How often , in England , does one hear the families of farmers laughed at for living , not beyond their means , but beyond their station ! Again , a certain pomp of life , which would be thought quite natural in a duke , would be thought ludicrous in an opulent butcher who could equally well afford it . Now , as for myself , in my own house I have nothing but maidservants : the present question , therefore , does not touch me . But though I am no apologist for pompous living in any one , I may say that , in the state of society which Radicals are laboring to realize , it will , among those who can pay for it , be thought quite as becoming or as unbecoming in one man as in another . At present , it is thought to symbolize in the duke 's position some underlying reality which in the butcher 's has no existence . The Radical desires that this so-called reality should be frankly recognized as having no existence in either case . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not for their own sake , but for the sake of the view of society they symbolize ; and I hope that , if you take them in that light , they will have at last made my meaning clear to you . AursoN. - The general meaning you have in your own mind is , I think , perfectly clear to me . As to the practical application of your principles I am not quite so clear . Benevolence , you say , wishes their application , and reason demands it . As to why this should be so , 1* confess I am as dark as ever . // FR*sxnN. - Must I really , then , draw my inference for you ? Is that so ? Is it not self-evident ? It was well said , the other day , in a Radical English newspaper , that the practical watchwords of the Radical party are these : " Promotion by merit , " and " The tools to him who best can use them . " Apply this , not to politics only , but to every distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical meaning of Radicalism-of freedom , of justice , of progress . All men are born equal ,  --  that weboth acknowledge ,  --  notpersonally , but socially . Let each man , then , be free to be what he can make himself . Let no man say , " Because I am the son of a fisherman , therefore it is presumption in me to aspire to be more than a * Talent , ambition , aspiration are on all sides of us - among poor and rich alike . Let a career be open to them indifferently , wherever they are . Let us all feel , not that we can all take the highest prizes in life , but that we are , each of us , equally free to take the highest prize that we can merit . ALISON. - Thank you . That is quite plain enough . Let me now ask you a question or two . All men are equal at birth , whether their parents are rich or poor ? FR*1mIN. - We have both agreed as to that . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does this equality last ? How soon does the brain and body of the fisherman begin to differentiate itself from the brain and body of the clerk ? FRANJnN. - llitherto we have said nothing of education in its *echnica1 sense . I am now coming to that . Without such education , most children will very early take a permanent bent according to their early surroundings , and it will be difficult for their ideas or their natural talents to extend themselves beyond the circle of their parents ' life and occupations . But education prevents this premature fixing of the character . It opens a boy 's eyes , so that , before his lot is chosen , he is aware that , for the resolute , there are many lots to choose from ; he is able to ask himself for which he is best fitted : thus his destiny is - partly , at least - placed in his own hands ; and if his talents fail to meet with what he thinks their fitting reward , he will not have to revile society with having failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own conscience , because he has failed to do justice to himself . Thus wealth and all distinction being recog // nized as the reward of merit , wealth and distinction will excite no envy-or , at all events , but little , and only in exceptional natures . ALIsON. - Js the rich man 's child reaping the reward of merit when it gradually learns that it has ready prepared for it all those means of pleasure , of learning , and of beneficence , which the poor man 's child , should he prove ambitious , must spend half his life in a doubtful struggle to obtain * ? FRANKLIN. - Men can well put up with an inferiority in circumstances so long as no inferiority is thought to inhere in themselves . The cardinal social truth , both in the head and in the heart of the Radical is that each man is what he makes himself ; and that any man may make himself anything . If riches have helped some to make themselves exceptionally wise or useful , let the rest look up to them as wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cringing to a man , not because he has used opportunities , but merely because he has had them . You said just now that I had already made my position plain enough . That is not the case . The most important practical issue of the Radical tone and temper I have hardly done more than mention . Once let these views of society I have been speaking of penetrate all classes , rich and poor aiike ,  --  driving away the shadows and the superstitions of Feudalism ,  --  and society will recognize far more clearly than now the extent of the state 's duty to the poor in the matter of education . One result , I need hardy say , will be that , for the poor , education will be free ; but more than that , and even more important , it will gradually change its character . It will aim not only at quickening the intelligence , but at enlarging the imagination , at giving every young eye a commanding view of life , and impressing every young mind with a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , putting aside the question of personal luxuries , the distribution of which it can never be possible to equalize , the children of each generation , be their parents rich or poor , will start in life with their opportunities equalized to a degree which at present is to you almost unimaginable . Now , I think my whole case is before you , and I am ready now to listen to yours , which , so far as I understand it , is a direct negation of mine . ALTSON. - NOt quite so . You forget that I am conceding to you that all classes are born equal . But I concede even more // than that . I concede something you have not directly stated , but which of course you imply , that those social and those political arrangements are best which most diffuse happiness , not among the few only , but among all . ALIsoN. -I concede even more than that . I concede-at least , for argument 's sake-that education might be so regulated as to produce among the young of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the university , between the son of a small tradesman and the son of a millionaire merchant . FRANKLIN. - Supposing such a pair to be friends , and the one not to despise the other , the equality between them would represent all that I hope or ask for . ALIsoN. -I concede , then , that education might produce itnot that I think it would , but for the sake of argument . Now , I boldly , with my eyes and my heart open , declare that , supposing such a consummation possible , I would , were I statesman , do everything in my power to avert it , and I should regard it , did it ever take place , as the greatest of social calamities and the beginning of social dissolution . FRANKLIN. - Are you serious ? ALISoN. - Wait a moment longer , you have not heard me out yet . You would wish , you say , to enlarge the imaginations of the poor , to give their eyes a commanding view of life , and to teach each poor child to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition . I , for my part , would offer to their eyes not as many careers as possible , but as few . I would have them think that careers and ambitions , both , were fixed for them by their birth within certain well defined limits , and that what lay beyond these limits for them was the moon and stars . You tell me you would enlarge their imaginations . My dear Franklin , I would restrain and chasten them . FRANKLIN. - What then ! And is the son of the laborer to have no hope ? Would you say to those who must always be the majority of mankind , " Aspiration is not for you . Among you genius will receive the reward of a crime , and can only beat itself to death against its birth 's invidious bar ' ? ' * ALTSoN. - Let us put genius out of the question . Genius will always rise , and will rise the brighter from having made its way through difficulties . We are talking now of the general // run of men ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of * station , I should say as a general truth , not to laborers only , but to every other class , " Aspiration is not for you . " But since it is the laboring class you allude to specially , let us speak of that ; or , better still , of that section of it which has really formed our text ,  --  these Jersey fishermen , whose red sails at this moment are already dotting the gray surface of the sea . You think-I can see it by your face- you think what I have just been saying is monstrous . I am going to meet you with an argumentum ad hominem . Compare these fishermen with yourself . What a contrast in every way . You are full of wishes for the welfare of the world at large , and able yourself to appreciate the high and refined happiness that comes from the exercise of your own intellect , the approbation of your own conscience , and the pure affection of your family ; you desire that such blessings should be diffused . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they know or care for all the fine things you wish them ? If you offered them money , no doubt they would clutch at it with a stupid avarice , to which before they were strangers ; but what leisure can be theirs to know anything of the pleasures either of thought , of right doing , or of affection ? If you could abolish fishermen altogether , well and good ; but since you can not , it is well that you should recognize the fact that , between you and them there is no kind of equality , and that your Radical principles can never , except for harm , alter their condition any more than a dog 's . FRANTiIN. - Suppose you made a speech like that at a public meeting . Would not you be howled down by the indignation of all your hearers ? I do not howl you down ; but my blood boils none the less . Still , I will answer you calmly . In physical constitution , thefishermanandldiffer ; our thoughts have been trained to employ themselves on different subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more stupid men , and unhappier men than I. But if so , that is not because they are fishermen . God knows AI*IsoN. -I thought you did not believe in God . FnANJ*uN. - Whether I do or no , let the name be a sign of the solemnity and the conviction I am speaking with . God knows , I say , that in those boats yonder , in those cottages below us , by the simple hearth , or among the foam , the ropes , and the fishbaskets , hearts may beat as tender as , perhaps more tender than // mine ; lives may be led as liappy as mine , and in all human essentials nobler than wliat I can attain to . ALIsON. - What ! does your wealth , your culture , and the power which your wealth gives you - does not that raise you high above these men we are speaking of ? FR*KuN. - This makes my life different ; it enlarges my sphere of action ; but it need not make me a truer man , nor , though I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of severity . Let your blood cease to boil . In every word you say , I agree with you ; and when I spoke just now those words that shocked you , I was not stating any views of my own ; I was merely stating what is the logical deduction from yours . FR*iuuN. - From mine ! ALIsoN. - Yes , from yours . It is you , not 1 ,  --  it is the Radicals , not the aristocrats ,  --  who insult the people , and who treat the workman 's life as a degradation . Is it not the gist of your gospel that the prizes of life should be open to all-meaning by the prizes , station , wealth , distinction , political power , and so on ? and do you not ridicule those who deny your gospel ? and do not you call it cruel to say that the man who is born a laborer , must , as a rule , remain a laborer always ? Why , if the laborer , in all essentials , can be as happy as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should , in most cases , remain as he is ? FR*KLIN. - Have I not said there must always be distinctions of classes ? But talent demands for its exercise a wider though not a happier sphere , than that which belongs to the laborer . Let every laborer with talents be free to rise , so as to use them . You tcll me these cases are rare , and that we may put them aside as exceptions . In doing that , you are begging the whole question . We can set nothing aside as , properly speaking , exceptional , save genius of the very highest and very rarest order . A percentage of talent in every generation , is the rule , not an exception . Were it not so , civilization could not sustain itself ; and you yourself are admitting , quite as fully as I , that among the children of laborers the percentage of natural talent is as large as among the children of the wealthy ; that as many are born with capacities for law , art , politics , military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at present , we Radicals think that all this mass of talent lies undeveloped , practically non-existent , lost to the world , through the mal-ad // justment of society ; and it is these sleeping forces that our reforms would set free . Half of the talent of the working classes is scarcely ever conscious of itself ; the other half is conscious only to resent the injustice that oppresses it . AlasoN. - Let it be , as you say , that among the millions of the people there is as large a percentage of talent as there is among the thousands or the hundreds of the wealthy ; that for every competitor for distinction in commerce , in science , in law , or in politics , that is supplied by the villa or the castle , a thousand others would be supplied by the cottage or the workman 's quarter . What then ? You will have more men wanting to be lawyers ; but you will not make more lawyers wanted . You will have more men wanting office , but not a society wanting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates , without multiplying the number of posts , and without , on your own showing , making the quality of the candidates higher . What you do will be simply this : you will multiply failures , you will not multiply successes . FRi*KUN. -J call it a failure , when a man who is fit for a higher occupation has to spend his life in a lower one ; and the world in that sense is peopled with failures now . ALISoN. - Again you are doing it-doing what I just now taxed you with . You are insulting the people  --  the masses , whose champion you declare yourself to be . Listentome ; I will go even farther than you . I will say that , of the laboring classes , not merely that there is a large percentage born fit for occupations other than manual labor ; I will say that , with a few exceptions , this might be said of all of them . There arc few men who , if bred to it , might not do more than dig or , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than fish . But so long as the earth is earth , and so long as man is man , diggers and fishers the mass of mankind must be ; and your fine radical gospel as to rising in life is an exhortation to human society to escape from its own shadow . FRANKujx. - You admit that it is a shadow , then ? ALISoN. -I admit nothing of the kind . I had no intention that you should take my simile literally . If you like to deplore the lot of the manual laborer as in itself an evil , and one not worthy of a man , you are of course free to do so ; but to deplore as an evil conditions which you never can alter is to make these conditions the very curse you say they are . Let us suppose that // labor is an evil . Is not death an evil also ? And yet we all can be cheerful-even knaves and cowards-under its shadow ; and all but knaves and cowards can be resigned and calm in its presence . Suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to preventable causes , and could be altogether eluded by some form of revolution , then , indeed , to this generation of dupes , death for the first time would begin to make life a hell . It is the same thing with labor ; except that death can never quite lose its sting , whereas labor is a nettle which , if grasped , may turn into a flower . My dear Franklin , I would ask you to lay this to heart - that , in an honest and useful life , its necessary conditions become intolerable only when we are taught to indulge in a false hope that we can escape from them . To go back once more to our exceptions , I should no doubt think it deplorable if a man were to die a carpenter who might have been a Shakespeare or a Raphael ; but I should see nothing deplorable in a million men dying carpenters , who , born in a different sphere , would have been firstrate clerks or attorneys . FRANKLIN. - Supposing you had the technical skill , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a carpenter 's education ? According to you , it is education makes us what we are ; and the life that would be happy for a carpenter would be miserable to me . I need not answer your question , you have emphatically answered it yourself . FRANKLIN. - The worth of opinions in these days can best be tested by considering what reception they would meet with , if freely addressed to the democracy . Apply that test for a moment to these views of yours . Would the people listen to you in this nineteenth century , if you were to get up on a platform merely to preach content to them , and to tell them they were doomed for life to the lot they have happened to be born to ? Would you tell them that ? Or , if not that , what would you tell them ? ALIsoN. -I would tell them this . I would tell them that the first and the best ambition for each of us , is not to leave our station , but to make the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own stations-then every one of you may succeed . Once learn to put your ambitions higher , then all of you- except some very few , will be failures . // FRANKLIN. - Do you think , in these days of education , such a limiting of the ambitions is possible ? ALISoN. - That surely depends on what the education is . If education teaches that there are no limits imposed on the individual by the nature of the social structure , thenFRANKLIN. - Then , what ? ALISON. - Then will be the reign of Radicalism , and that will mean a war against nature . FRANI*IN. - You have taxed me , in my social scheme , of thinking of what would be best , irrespective of what is possible . Are not you doing the same thing ? Is it possible , I ask you , in these days of knowledge ( for I will drop the word education , since you think it ambiguous ) ,  --  is it possible that the intelligent poor shall be blind to the advantage and pleasure , not of riches only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in their power to deserve and win these for themselves ? ALISON. - This insane struggle of the millions for what can only belong to the hundreds , if once excited , it is no doubt hopeless to check . Hopeless ? -I would I might retract the word . There may be hope yet . One thing only can check it . FRANKLN. - AThd what is that ? ALIsoN. - The strength of the national character ; the loyal subordination of one rank to another ; and the recognition that , though the highest prize of life  --  the sense of having done our duty-is open to all , what you call " the prizes of life " can be profitably competed for but by few , and can be possessed but by very few . FRANKLIN .  --  and by these arguments you will persuade the English people to bow down to the House of Lords , will you ? And you will call that a sign of the soundness of the national character ? I wonder what you would say were you in America ! ALIsoN. - Here you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that subordination of class to class I speak of can take many forms ; and the forms will vary with each nation 's history . I have reminded you already that America is growing ; but if all I hear be true , these very virtues are forming themselves in America which you and yours are trying to destroy in England . But why should we continue talking ? I can see you are not convinced . Nothing I have said has made the least impression on you . FRANKMN. - Nothing . I may as well be frank with you ; for // I believe that I represent as well as most people the democratic intellect of the day ; and if that be the case , I may well say , on behalf of all us Radicals , " Time is on our side . " Be our cause bad or good , it is the advancing cause . AusoN. - " Time is on our side . " Who was it said that ? PRANKLJN. -A great Radical statesman . He took it for his motto . ALISoN. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our quarrelings , we may part agreeing about one thing : that may be my motto also , for Death , who will so soon have dealings with me , will take me away from the evil and the wretchedness that is to come .
