MARIE BASIIKIRTSEFF . GUSTAVE FLAUBERT , at ten years of age , had a premonitory sense of life which was like the smell of the soup through a hole in the cover of the tureen : it took away his appetite . To Mademoiselle Marie Bashkirtseff , who opened a pair of charming eyes upon the world in 1860 , in the government of Poltava , Little Russia , and who had the odor of life wafted to her nostrils a few years , or months , later , the soup-fragrance was in the highest degree appetizing , stimulating as the smell of battle to the war-horse of tradition . " From the time that I began to think , " she confides to us , " from the time I was three years old ( and I remained at the breast till three and a half ) , I had aspirations towards indefinable grandeurs . " The dates are deliciously Gallic , but may be accepted without protest , particularly as the record extends too far back for accurate verification . That a child should stretch hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a commissariat for the supply of wealth , incense , happiness to her own pretty person , is no novel phase of history ; were it new it would lose thereby much of its piquancy and significance . Shy little Hetty , alone in the Poyser attic , tied on her beads in the same faith ; and the dreams , air-castles , imperious demands upon life , which a Parisian princess of the Ukraine heaps up in her journal have that adorable touch of nature which makes them kin to many a vagrant fancy buzzing unrecorded in other pretty or less pretty heads . There is individuality , too , and to spare , in this journal of Marie Bashkirtseff , - a book which came out in Paris a year ago , but does not seem yet to have caught the ear of its right public in this country , where the demand for such untranslated sauce piquante , though small , is not unappreciative . It has the interest not alone of dreams and caprices , but of poignant realities ; it is not alone the outspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own heart , and poising for her public at the same moment , but the self-revelation of a gifted and forceful nature , working itself out through successive phases of a life which , concentrated into a few short years , leaves an impression almost complete in its distinctness . Marie Bashkirtseff , who began to think and to aspire at so early an age , and who wrote the last word of her lifestory at an hour when most workers are still upon the threshold , was the daughter of a small provincial land-owner in Little Russia , her paternal grandfather being an officer who had risen to the rank of general in the Crimean War . Her mother was of higher position , a Babanine , of older nobility and supposed Tartar origin , " of the first invasion , " says Marie , shrugging her shoulders at the tradition . She was a beauty who married at one and twenty , " after refusing very desirable offers , " and who , after two years of the society of M. Bashkirtseff , returned to the Babanine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul . Marie was brought up by her grandmother , who idolized her , and her aunt , " younger than mamma , but not pretty , sacrificed by everybody , and sacrificing herself to all . " After the death of the grandmother , her mother , who had yearnings after the gay world , managed to effect a migration of the family to foreign soil . They set out in May , 1870 : grandfather , mamma and aunt , Di , - a cousin , daughter of a son of the Babanines who seems to have married beneath him , - Marie , Paul , and a family doctor and friend , Walitsky , " a Pole free from exaggerations of patriotism , " who seems // to have undertaken , with some measure of success , the rale of peacemaker in the household . They went to Vienna , and luxuriated for a month in the shops and theatres ; then to Baden-Baden , in the height of the season , just before its gayeties were eclipsed by the outbreak of the Franco - Prussian War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world and of fashion , and was " tortured by vanity . " From BadenBaden they went to Geneva , and thence to Nice , where they were established for some years , and where the published journal ( preceded , we are told , by other efforts ) opens in January , 1873 , its author and heroine being twelve years old . At Baden-Baden , on the promenade and at the races , she had seen the Duc de H. , apparently a typical and more or less prominent member of the society of that watering-place , and later of that of Nice . She had not spoken to him ; but her imagination , prematurely active , and craving a part in the brilliant scene before her , had entrusted to him the leading rOle in its drama . Two years later the candle still burns before his image . If she had been a Boston girl , the object of this exalted sentiment would probably have been an older person of her own sex , a pretty Sundayschool teacher or an unhappy society woman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marie is too ambitious to waste her dreams . She will have no lever de rideau , but must plunge at once into the drama . " Aunt Sophie is still playing ; the music reaches me at intervals and penetrates all my being . I have no lessons to learn for to-morrow ; it is Sophie 's birthday . 0 God , give me the Duc de H. ! I will love him and make him happy . I will be happy too . I will do good to the poor . It is a sin to believe that one can purchase the mercies of God by good works , but I do not know how to express myself . " The lessons , the Duc de H. , and the good God make a curious company throughout these early pages . She prays on her knees , with tears , that she may make the duke 's acquaintance . She can hardly believe that God will leave so ardent a desire unfulfilled . " Three times already he has heard and answered me . The first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunt brought me one from Geneva ; the second time , I implored his aid in learning English . I prayed and wept so hard that I seemed to see an image of the Virgin in the corner of my room which promised me success . " She is invited by an English lady to spend Sunday with her children , and after dinner she sings to the young people in the gloomy salon . " They were all in such ecstasies that they began to embrace me frightfully , - aifreusement , - there is no other word for it . " She is enchanted with this admiration , even from children , and the thought comes to her , What if others should admire also ? " I was born for triumphs and emotions ; therefore the best thing for me to do is to become a singer . If the good God will only preserve , strengthen , and enlarge my voice " ( the italics are her own , as well as the definiteness of the prayer ) , " I shall have in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the satisfaction of being celebrated , known , admired ; and thus I may be able to obtain the man I love . If I remain where I am , there is little hope of his loving me ; he will not even know that I exist ; but when he sees me in the midst of glory and triumph ! " A little later she concludes that she will have to be " either the Duchess of H. - that is what I desire the most ( for God sees how I love him ) - or a celebrity of the stage ; " and she balances the two careers carefully , deciding , however , in favor of the duchess . Meagre as are the materials of her novel , there is no lack of intensity in the style . She goes // back in memory to the day at BadenBaden when she sat near the duke 's mistress at the races , and heard his name mentioned , while " my heart gave a throb which I did not then understand . " Afterwards , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , and interpreted his mocking look into " What an absurd little girl ! " " And I was absurd in my little silk frocks ; I was ridiculous ! I refrained from looking at him . And then whenever I met him my heart knocked so hard against my chest that it hurt me . I do not know whether any one else has had that experience , but I am afraid that my heart will be heard beating . I used to believe that the heart was only a piece of flesh , but I see noW that it is in communication with the mind . I understand now the phrase It made my heart beat . ' Before , when I heard it at the theatre , I thought of it without comprehension ; now I recognize emotions which I have myself experienced . The heart is a piece of flesh which communicates by a little string with the brain , which in its turn receives information from the eyes or the ears ; and thus it is the heart which speaks , because the string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sends the blood to the face . " We get glimpses of the whole French environment - le monde et demi - in this infantile diary . She sees the photograph of the duke 's mistress , and pays tribute to her beauty . " But in ten years she will be faded ; in ten years I shall be grown . I should be more beautiful if I were taller . " This is a long way from the idyl of Pet Marjorie , but a certain mixture of intensity and naive precocity recalls that happier child-journal and clears the air for us . Besides , young as she is , Marie has weighed her world , and subscribed unhesitatingly her allegiance to virtue and religion . She will marry and love nobody but her husband . If her brother marries , he must love his wife , and be faithful to her . She thinks of the temptations which will assail him when he grows up , of the need of his having a profession , and decides that when that time arrives she will write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters of a comrade , to help and encourage him . Alongside of the budding coquette , the embryo prima donna , there is a sweet little woman , well grown for her age , in Marie . The Duc de H. romance ends like other novels with a marriage . She goes through the regulation amount of suffering , and steels herself to forget him , which time will enable her to do . No one has ever suffered so much , and yet she can read and write . And there are other grievances , less important , but more irritating . " Tuesday , October 21 . We come in ; they are already at dinner , and we get a little reprimand - un petit savon - from mamma for having eaten between meals . A breeze ruffles the sweet family life . Paul is scolded by mamma ; grandpapa tries to stop mamma , meddling with matters which do not concern him , and thus annihilating Paul 's respect for mamma . Paul goes off muttering between his teeth , like a servant . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration , but to let mamma do as she will ; for it is a crime to set children against their parents simply from want of tact . Grandpapa became indignant : that made me laugh ; such squalls always make me laugh , and afterwards I am filled with pity for all those unfortunate people who have no misfortunes , and who make their life a martyrdom for want of something to do . Ifon Dieu , if I were ten years older ! If I were only free ! But what can one do when one is bound hand and foot by aunts , grandpapa , lessons , governesses , and one 's family ? What a paraphernalia , mUle trompettes / // At fifteen , the quinze ans of French poetry , she is blooming into beauty . " My hair , in a Psyche knot , is redder than ever . . . . My photographs can never do me justice ; the color is lacking and my freshness . The whiteness of my skin is my principal beauty . " The portrait given as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows rounded contours and a childish seriousness of expression . She is looking out yearningly , but not with that bitterness of longing which we find in her journal . " In every opera I find something of myself ; the most ordinary words go to my heart . Such a state would do honor to a woman of thirty . But at fifteen , to have nerves , to cry like an idiot at every stupid , sentimental phrase ! . . . I should like to possess the talent of all the authors who ever wrote , to be able to give an adequate idea of my profound despair , of my wounded vanity , of all my thwarted desires . Let me only long for something and it is enough ; nothing comes . " After all , the miseries of youth are not entirely reserved for a sickly little Flaubert , with the growing burden of French realism on his childish shoulders . A coquettish , pretty Marie , in " little silk frocks , " with a mile-long list of expectations and demands to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; for to her also the specific which fills the horizon for most people was only a part . Behind all these catalogued desires - she prays for a pony and the Duc de H. in the same breath - there is an immense , undefined craving , the passion for another image ; a feat of personification on her part more real than the effigy of the duke . It is life that she is in love with , - life in large capitals , with all the meaning that can be compressed into the word . This little Talma of ten , ready to recognize and portray emotions which she has herself experienced ; this inquiring spirit of twelve who demands a physiological explanation of the beating of her heart ; this sentimentalist who doubts " whether any one else has had that experience , " has a leaven of the artist within her . She has generalized early ; her dream is half a reality to her . An Italian who comes up now and then in the journal , a certain Doria , said of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-fever , " - une telle ft*vre de vie . It is a fever which consumes her from the first . Life will not come to her fast enough . She can not wait . What if it should not come at all ? She must seize , anticipate , invent it , if need be . She is fifteen , beautiful , with hair of a Titian red , and a resemblance , as she tells us , to the blonde woman painted by Paul Veronese as an embodiment of Venice ; and yet nothing has happened . She compares herself , with an information which has a very second-hand air , to Hagar in the desert waiting for some one , - apparently for a kindred spirit . But at last a ray of light comes . The entry for New Year 's Day , 1876 , is dated Rome , and at Rome she finds a lover . He sings at her window in troubadour fashion , and is afterwards brought to the house and introduced regularly , with a hint of his desirability . Pietro A. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nephew of Cardinal A. , a charming fellow , " with a mustache of twenty-three , " flings himself at her feet with all the passion of his nationality , eats the violets from her bouquet and the threads of silk which she pulls out of the fringe on her dress . The real drama has begun . Marie takes her cue quickly . But she will not commit herself . She does not forget that she is made for the most superb fortune . " Saturday , March 18 . I have not had a moment alone with A. ; it is so tiresome . I love to hear him tell me that he loves me . Since his disclosure I have been thinking , with my elbows // resting on the table . I am in love , perhaps . It is when I am tired and half asleep that I believe myself to be in love with Pietro . Why am I vain ? Why am I ambitious ? Why do I reason so much ? I am incapable of sacrificing to a moment of pleasure whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the novelists , but this moment of pleasure will illuminate with its rays a whole existence ! Ah , no , indeed ! To-day I am cold and in love , to-morrow I shall be warm and not in love . On such changes of temperature hang the destinies of men . In taking leave , A. said Good-night ' and took my hand , which he held in his , asking a dozen questions to gain time . I told mamma about it at once . I tell her everything . " She is enchanted with her new toy , and will pull all the wires . b* March 20 . I behaved foolishly this evening . I talked to the creature in a corner , and gave him every reason to believe in things that will never be . .. . I listen mockingly to his outpourings from the height of my proud indifference , and at the same time allow him to take my hamid . I take his with an almost maternal air , and if he were not reduced to idiocy by his passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see that while driving him away with my words I hold him back with my eyes . And while declaring that I will never love him , I love him , or at least I behave as if I did . I say all sorts of things to him . Any other man would be content , - any older man , at least , - but not he ; he tears a napkin , breaks two paint-brushes , destroys a picture . " It is delightful to be able to look down from a height of indifference , to matronize a desperate lover , to yield one 's self to the charm of the moment in happy consciousness of a loftier fate waiting behind the curtain of tomorrow ; but the medal has a reverse side . It is one thing to coquet with one 's desires ; another , not to be desired . The cardinal will not hear of the match . Pietro is dependent upon allowances from the family purse , and exhibits all the Italian docility to the demands of his relatives , even allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convent . Marie is furious . She returns to Nice . There are promises of letters , of a visit to Nice , which remain unfulfilled . Negotiations are begun between the families . Away from Pietro , mademoiselle is no longer quite indifferent to impassioned speeches . Excitement is lacking . She goes back to Rome with her aunt , and sees him again " by chance . " He rises to the occasion with a renewed ardor . The flirtation takes a leaf from American literature , or perhaps from the Italian of an earlier day : she accords him a short interview at midnight at the foot of the staircase in the palazzo , the ground floor of which is unoccupied . In this damp trysting-place there is a holding of hands , a conversation , which is transferred in all its youthfulness and sentiment to the diary , and - a kiss , on which the modern Juliet makes her escape , thinking it is like a scene of some novel that she has read , and wondering if she can be really in love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic to her own drama . This time she does not tell mamma . A few more negotiations and heartburnings , and the page is turned over . The cardinal will not be moved . Marie leaves Rome ; and the impression which is strongest and most lasting in her mind is that of Rome itself , of its monuments and its pictures . She wonders if the ancients have sucked the world dry , if the human mind has nothing left to achieve . For the rest she is unhappy , but that also is a part of life . Already in her loneliness at Nice she had declared her ardor for life to be no mere love of pleasure . " But I love life ; I love its disappointments as well as its pleasures . I love God , and I love his world with all its meannesses , and in // spite of all its meannesses , and perhaps because of all its meannesses . " Love being out of the question for the time , at least , Marie determines to bend all her energies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say magnificent - marriage . She assumes the responsibility herself , with the readiness with which a man undertakes to make a fire ; recognizing the inefficiency , in a matter requiring so much tact and delicacy , of the rest of the family . For this purpose , and also with a view to effecting a reconciliation between her parents , - for a touch of the mis-* sionary spirit is part of her mental outfit as a nineteenth - century maiden , - she goes to Little Russia , to stay with her father and make acquaintance with her native land . The episode is entertaining , but not fertile in results . No ideal match presents itself ; she can not make up her mind to the dreariness of the country , the absence of conversation . She likes to hear people talk about the ancients and about science , and Poltava is not a centre of intellectual life and activity . The other mission , though partially successful , is an ultimate failure . Her father - her flchu p*re , as she calls him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraiture as a sort of semi-respectable Lapidoth . She brings him back to her mother , and they remain together a short time in Paris ; but the cord soon snaps again , and he takes his departure , having borrowed freely of his daughter 's pocket-money . " My father is gone ! " she writes on the 26th of November , 1876 . " For the first time in four months I can breathe freely . " To have the responsibility of her own establishment in life is to a European girl the extreme of loneliness and of selfdependence . But Marie has a deeper problem to contend with . To control in some manner that flb , re de vie , to reduce the temperature , to bring all those tossing ambitions and desires into some clear purpose , to organize a discipline that has not been forced upon her from without , - all this has to be done , and she is not blind to the necessity . " The Slavonic character , " she says in her preface , " scrawled over with French civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs no further testimony than her own journal to show that the French civilization is not the whole story . This precocious little creature , devoured by vanity and living all her days in an unwritten novel , is tormented by the falseness of her situation . " I am not even writing my own language ! " she exclaims somewhere . " I am making all sorts of mistakes . " One of the most curious evidences of foreign French in the early pages of the journal is a tendency to italicize words and syllables , with an emphasis which the intonations of the language would not allow in speaking ; as when she writes , at the time of the duke 's marriage , " C ' &amp;ait une douleur mouill6e , et c'est une douleur s*che . " But she has no other language equally at her command , and French is from the first that of her thoughts . She is constantly posing , and yet continually longing for reality . She can not wait for her romance to grow , and yet she must have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots , and is tormented at its instability . She knows that the affair with Pietro is all a play , and puts in notes to beg the reader not to believe in what she writes ; at the same time she would fain have it real . The only poignant and true note in the episode is in the remorse which follows the kiss given - offered , as we learn afterwards - to Pietro . It comes in again and again , like a thought that rankles . " He believed that it was a simple matter for me , that it was not for the first time , that it was a habit ! Vatican and Kremlin ! I shall suffocate with rage and shame ! " This poor little life , moulded beforehand // by restlessness and anticipation , has to be brought into accord with its present and made a reality . Marie has none of those outside helps which come in one form or another to the young of either sex , no person to guide or sympathize with her studies , no religious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak of natural uprightness in her , an ever-growing enthusiasm for art , and there is that declared love of life and of God 's world " with all its meannesses . " Success must lie before her , for the element of success is within ; but it is not to be gained without effort , and the temperature is not likely to be lowered by the proceeding . She clings a little to the old idea of the stage , and makes a visit incognita to Wartel , who hears her sing , and pronounces the organ a fine one , dwells upon the necessity of hard work , but promises that she shall succeed , that in three years she will be fitted for a career . But in this direction there is only disappointment . A throat trouble , which is the precursor of a more serious difficulty , and in fact the beginning of the end , carries away her voice . Hope has to be given up , and it never revives . " Tuesday , May 29 1877 . The more I advance towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap myself in indifference . Few things agitate me , and everything used to agitate me ; so much so that in reading over my past I attach too much importance to trifles , seeing how they made my blood boil at the time . . . . I have been turning over the A. episode ; it is really surprising how well I reasoned . I am astonished and filled with admiration . I had forgotten all those clear perceptions and true conclusions . I was anxious lest people should believe in a ( past ) passion for Count A. It is a year since that time , and I was really afraid of having written nonsense . No , truly , I am quite pleased . Only I do not understand how I could behave so foolishly and reason so well . I am obliged to tell myself that no counsel in the world would have hindered me from doing anything whatever , and that experience was needed . " " La vieillesse de ma jeunesse " is a bit of felicity in expression which suggests Sophie Arnauld 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marie has wisely begun her adjustment to the present by acceptance of the past . But the past is also to be laid aside . Dramatic and effective in her earnestness as well as in her poses , she draws up a paper of resolutions which rounds off deliciously the first volume of her journal . It is italicized throughout , with an emphasis of capitals . The date is September 6 , 1877 . " I am resolved to remain in Paris , to study there , and to make excursions from there in the summer to watering places . All dreams are exhausted ; Russia has failed me ; and I have been soundly punished . I feel that the moment has at last come to STOP . With my natural aptitudes , in two years I shall make up for the time I have lost . Therefore , in the name of the Father , of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , so be it ; and may the divine protection be with me . This is not an ephemeral decision , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find ourselves in a different atmosphere in the second volume . True there is a whiff of sulphur in the air ; the first day is spent in tears ; there is the old fever and rage : but underneath all we are aware of a strong current of resolution ; we feel a power which grows daily , an intellectual perception and force which is constantly gaining . She enters the Julian studio , is well received there from the first , and is assured that by the end of the winter she will be able to execute very fair portraits . She deducts at once from the praise bestowed anything which may be due to her position , or to the fact that as a society girl nothing is expected of her . She takes // account in the first week of her own powers and prospects . " All my companions draw better than I do , but no one of them produces so good a likeness . What makes me believe that I shall do better than they is that , appreciating their merits , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas beginners generally think , If I could only draw like such or such a one ! They have had practice , study , experience , but these middle-aged women will never do better than they do now . Those who are young . . . draw well and have time before them , but no future . I may not succeed myself , but it could only be because of my impatience . I could kill myself for not having begun four years ago . I feel that it may be too late . " Her first " acad*mie " wins warm praise from the artist who visits the studio , M. Tony Robert - Fleury , who pronounces it astonishing for a beginner , and hints at des dispositions tout *t fait extraordinaires . From him she receives encouragement throughout , as well as from her master , Julian . She works incessantly , feverishly , pursued by the phantoni of those four lost years . There are feuds in the studio , gusts of jealousy to be met : she herself is swayed by them . Her judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , at least , of her fellow-students has talent enough to be a dangerous rival . " Breslau had many compliments from Robert-Fleury , I had none . . . . I have been working just two weeks , excepting of course the two Sundays . Two weeks ! Breslau has been working two years at the studio , and she is twenty years old , while I am seventeen ; then Breslau had drawn a great deal before coming here . " Time , like life , is personified in her mind : it stands over her like a vision . Everything is going well , but when will the goal be reached ? " Time is more terrible , more enervating , more crushing , when there are no other obstacles . " She clenches her fist , shuts her teeth , and battles with the idea . " Sunday , February 24 . I will go to the studio , and I will prove that one succeeds when one has the will , and when one is desperate , bruised , and infuriated , as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has acquired a vigorous , " almost brutal " style , an endowment well calculated to hold its own in a Parisian studio . She reads Zola , and subscribes her allegiance to realism and the modern spirit . " Ah ! for us of this day who have read Balzac and who read Zola what enjoyments of observation ! " She is investigating , expanding in every direction , and the results are tumbled pell-mell into the journal : we have discussions on Kant and Epictetus , readings in Roman history ( " Up to this moment , " she cries , " I have never loved anything but Rome ! " ) , and aphorisms on marriage . In regard to this vexed question she comes to the tranquil resolution , " I will try first to achieve the marriage of my dream . If that fails , I will marry , like the rest of the world , by means of my dowry . " Religious speculations and fervors alternate with art gossip , flirtations , and ennuis . Often her remarks show great insight , nearly always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct perception , an empoignement of the object itself , a truth of feeling which has not come to her at second-hand . The effect throughout is that of rapid talk , charming , witty , variable , sympathetic , excited , - talk in which we seem to hear the voice , and see the lithe little figure , the auburn head on which at twenty she discovers two gray hairs , the figure d'enfant which prevents her from looking as old as she feels . Alas ! it was not for nothing that she found time terrible in its shortness , and clung with both hands to life . Throughout the volume we watch the inroads of the disease , destroying as resolutely , as impetuously , as its victim seeks to build . // The fever is no longer wholly mental ; to the exaltations and depressions of temperament are added the alternate hopefulness and depression of consumption . At first we read of colds , of laryngitis , of medical examinations , courses of treatment , orders to this and that wateringplace , and anxieties on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shutting herself up with her work , yet reproaching herself bitterly for her coldness to those who love her : to her mother , whom she adores , " and yet we can not remain together two hours without exasperating each other almost to tears ; " and to the aunt who " believes that I do not love her , and when I think of the life made up of sacrifices of this heroic creature I burst into tears ; she has not even the consolation of being loved like a good aunt ! " One of the most distressing of her symptoms is a growing deafness caused by the throat disease . " The wind in the branches , the murmur of waters , the rain falling on the panes , the low tones of the voice , - I shall hear nothing of all that ! " She pushes on with her work , determined to make a position , to do something for her fame , before the end comes . She has two favorite ideas for pictures : one of a studio interior , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is seated astride a chair smoking a cigarette , and looking at the skeleton with a pipe in its mouth ; the other is one to which she recurs again and again as " my picture . " " What I want to do is something which I feel profoundly ; I am held by it heart and head , and have been for months , for nearly two years . I do not know that I shall be strong enough this winter to do it well . . . . It is when Joseph of Arimathea has buried the body of Jesus and the stone has been rolled before the sepulchre : all have departed , the night is falling , and Mary Magdalen and the other Mary remain alone seated before the sepulchre . It is one of the greatest moments of the sublime drama , and one of the least hackneyed in art . There is in it a grandeur , a simplicity , something awful , touching , and human ; a sort of formidable calm , the exhaustion of grief . " This is after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she has seen Velasquez and Ribera , and comprehended more things in painting than ever before . But the strength to do is fast ebbing . " Wednesday , January 26 . Tuesday , on coming home from the studio , I was seized with fever , and remained till seven o'clock without a light , shaking in my arm-chair , half unconscious , and always with my picture before my eyes . " Not her favorite picture , which is never painted . She waits for more strength and opportunity , and in the mean time paints for the Salon a group of street boys . The various influences about her are evidently beginning to blend and to crystallize into an aim and manner of her own . Strongest of all , stronger even than Zola , is an influence which was a pronounced one at the moment in French studios , that of the latest and youngest talent of the higher school of French painting , - Bastien - Lepage . She is penetrated by his pictures . She notes certain defects in them from the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape to come forward , to the injury of the figures ; but the truth , the poetry , of these idyls of realism is an inspiration to her . " I come back to the street . . . . I dare not attempt the country ; BastienLepage is sovereign there ; but for the street there has been as yet no Bastien . And in our garden one can paint almost everything . " She is introduced to Bastien-Lepage at his studio . A little later he goes to see her pictures . His brother Emile appears to be already a friend of the Bashkirtseff household . " Sunday , December 117 1882 . The real , the only , the unique , the great Bastien-Lepage came to-day . " I received him in a flutter of excitement , // awkward and confused , enervated and humiliated at having nothing to show him . " He stayed more than two hours after having looked at all the pictures in every corner ; only I hindered him from seeing , being nervous and laughing at the wrong moment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm me , and we talked of Julian , who is the cause of this immense discouragement . " " Saturday , February 24 . Do you know , I think continually of BastienLepage : I have got a habit of repeating his name , and I avoid repeating it before people , as if I were guilty . And when I speak of him , it is with a sort of tender familiarity , which seems to me natural , considering his talent , but which might be misinterpreted . " What a pity , mon Dieu , that he can not come often , like his brother ! " And on what footing ? As a friend ! What ! Do you know what friendship is ? Ah ! for my part , I could adore my friends if they were great men , not only from vanity , but from perception , on account of their qualities , of their intellect , of their talent , their genius : it is a race apart ; get beyond a certain commonplace mediocrity , and we find ourselves in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could join hands and dance a round in honor of - What am I saying ? Do you . know , really , Bastien has a charming head . " I am afraid of painting in his manner . I copy nature very sincerely , it is true , but I think always of his painting . But then a gifted artist loving nature sincerely and endeavoring to reproduce her will always resemble Bastien . " Is it a note of deeper feeling repeated with the old indomitable accent of girlish folly ? Is it part of that ardent enthusiasm which has never really " loved anything but Rome , " of that exaltation for art , that passion for passion , that delight in living , which inspires such a passage as this ? " It seems to me that nobody living loves everything as I do , - art , music , painting , books , the world , dresses , luxury , noise , quiet , laughter , sorrow , melancholy , blagite , love , cold , sunshine ; all seasons , all atmospheric states ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples ; snow in winter , the autumn rains , spring and its madness , the serene summer days and beautiful nights with brilliant stars . I adore and delight in them all . Everything presents itself to me in an interesting or sublime light : I want to see everything , to have everything , to embrace everything , to be confounded with the whole , and to die , since I must die , in two years or in thirty years , - to die with ecstasy in order to experience this last mystery , this end of all things or the divine beginning . " This universal love is not a consumptive 's dream : I have always been thus , and I remember exactly ten years ago I wrote ( 1874 ) , after having enumerated all the charms of the various seasons : It is in vain that I attempt to make a choice ; all seasons are beautiful , all the year , the whole of life . I must have the whole ! The rest will never content me . I must have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , everything in life gives me pleasure , I find everything good , and while demanding happiness I find myself happy in being wretched . My body weeps and cries out , but something which is above me rejoices to live , in spite of all ! This is written not far from the end . The intimacy with Bastien-Lepage deepens ; the two families see each other often . " Saturday , September 13 . We are friends : he is attached to us ; he esteems me , he likes me . I interest him . He said yesterday that I am wrong to torment myself ; that I ought to consider myself very fortunate . No woman , he said , had had the success that I have , after so few years of work . " // The Salon of 1884 affords her first real triumph . Her picture is accepted , talked about , praised , reproduced in the newspapers . But it gains her no medal , and disappointment succeeds to triumph . She sits down and counts up the results of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her first , must be finished effectively . " Friday , August 1 . When I serve you up touching phrases , do not let yourself be taken in by them . " Of the two parts of me which are seeking to live , one says to the other , Why do n't you experience something , sapristi ! ' And the other , who endeavors to be touched , is always ruled by the first , by the looker-on in me , who is at his post of observation and absorbs the actor . " Will it always be thus ? " And love ? " Do you know , it seems to me that becomes impossible when one sees human nature under the microscope . They are happy who see no more than is necessary . " Shall I tell you ? Well , I am neither a painter , nor a sculptor , nor a musician , nor a woman , nor a daughter , nor a friend . All reduces itself in me to subjects of observation , of reflection , of analysis . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a grief , are immediately weighed , classified , recorded . And when I have said or written I am satisfied . " From the period of the little silk frocks and the long list of desires , from the longing to be understood , she has come to sacrifice everything for the sake of understanding . But there is still the same insatiable spirit . She can not get near enough to her object . If love is impossible , - though we must not take her even here too literally , - the loneliness is gone . She speaks herself , somewhure , of her lack of pathos , of her never finding the pathetic note . It is a fact , yet one which has its origin in her very passion for truth . After arranging a pose , a touching effect , she pushes away with both hands the pity it inspires ; she will have no light on it but the clearest . The story of these closing days has all the features of a finished de'noi*-ment . She knows her Dumas fits too well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she is true to her watchword of realism . She has longed to feel the whole experience of death , to study it as she studies life . She moves towards it with the spectacle before her in another , who is going through the same ordeal ; it is a question which will reach the goal first . Bastien-Lepage , like herself , is dying by inches . As long as she is able she goes to see him , getting scolded affectionately if she is absent a day beyond her usual time . But the visits , brightened at first by happy art-talks , grow more and more sad . " He is going , and he suffers greatly . When one is there it is like being detached from the earth ; he is already in a region above us ; there are days when I am conscious of a similar condition . One sees people , they talk to you , one answers , but one no longer belongs to the earth , - a quiet indifference , not painful , a little like the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . I only go there from habit : it is his shade , I also am half shadow ; of what use is it ? " He does not particularly feel my presence ; I can do nothing . I have not the gift to call life into his eyes . He is pleased to see me . That is all . " Yes , he is dying , and it hardly matters to me : I can not explain it ; it is something which is going from me . . " Thursday , October 16 . I have terrible fevers , which leave me exhausted . I pass the whole day in the salon , going from arm-chair to lounge . Dma reads novels to me . I can not get out , but poor Bastien-Lepage is able to go out ; he has himself brought here , installed in an // 693 arm-chair , with his legs stretched out on cushions , and with me beside him in another chair , and so we remain till six o'clock . " I am dressed in a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites ; Bastien-Lepage 's eye dilates upon it with pleasure . Oh ! if I could only paint ! ' he says . " Monday , October 20 . Notwithstanding the magnificent weather , Bastien-Lepage comes here instead of going to the Bois . He can scarcely walk ; his brother holds him under the arms , almost carrying him . And once in his arm-chair the poor fellow is breathless . Alas for us ! And how many concierges have perfect health ! Emile is an admirable brother . It is he who carries Jules on his shoulders up and down the stairs leading to their third story . I have from Dma an equal devotion . For two days my bed has been in the salon ; but as the room is large and partitioned off by screens it is not noticeable . It is too hard for me to get up-stairs . " The journal breaks off , and a note tells us that Marie Bashkirtseff died eleven days later , on the 3lst of October , 1884 . Bastien - Lepage lingered into the following year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own feverish , impetuous , cleareyed way , Marie had found reality to be better than dream . She had determined , if she did not die young , to be a great artist ; but if that fate overtook her , to have her journal published . She claims for it - she makes claims to the last - the merit of being " the exact , the absolute , the strict truth . " " Jn the first place , " she says , " I wrote for a long time without any thought of being read ; and in the second place , it is precisely because I hope to be read that I am entirely sincere . " The reader who has followed with enjoyment this entertaining record of her follies , her caprices , her hopes and disappointments , her efforts and observations , is not likely to quarrel with it on the score of insincerity . Her affectations belong mainly to the singularly impressionable quality of her nature . One is reminded now and then of Bettina by her precocity of sentiment , her responsiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the phases which Marie not only reflected but absorbed and made part of herself belong to its later decades . She had the thirst for genius ; had she " the vision and the faculty " ? One is hardly tempted to think so from this record ; but the intellectual ardor shown in it is something distinct from a mere desire to be intellectual . M. Andr* Theuriet , who writes some verses by way of preface to the book , speaks of the truth and beauty of her painting . His vision of her in the future as a " blanche et pure statue " may be taken as a fee to the conventional demands of French verse . If Marie goes a little way into the future , it will be as a very human , breathing , and rather breathless creature , charming in her whims , ready with her vote for truth , and living through her very love of life .
