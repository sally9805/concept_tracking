txt The city of Gloucester , adjoining this , is excited over a mysterious death . At first it was thought to be a case of suicide ; now it is believed to be one of murder . The Intern Club house is on the river-front . Down upon the river 's edge is one of the outhouses attached to the premises . Last Sunday afternoon Charles Haas , a boatman , entered this outhouse and , to his horror , almost ran against the dead body of a man . The latter 's head was down , and in his hand he held a pistol . When the body was removed the name H. Tarras was found written on the shirt . In the pockets was found over $170 in money . A man of the name of Tarras had driven a horse car in Camden at one time , but he went to live with some of his friends , iu South Carolina , five years ago . Some of Tarras 's relatives in Camden viewed the body , but were unable to identify it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , resembled their relative , but were not able to say that he was the dead man . Others who had known Torras declared positively that this was not his body . After the body had been removed to the Morgue ; Dr. Morgan made a post-mortem examination . His suspicions that the case was not one of suicide had been aroused from the fact that the dead man 's hand so firmly grasped the pistol . Not one suicide in five hundred , he says , holds the pistol so tightly In his hand . The almost : universal rule is that the pistol falls from his nerveless grasp as soon as he has accomplished its work . His suspicion was strengthened by subsequent . developments of the autopsy . In the skull he found fractures which were not made by a pistol-ball , but had been made , apparently , with a blunt instrument of some kind . The people of Camden have settled down to the belief that the man was first stunned , if not killed , by the blow on the head ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in his hands before the rigor of death had set in , so as to give to the death an appearance of suicide . But they are puzzled to account for the fact that the door of the outhouse was buttoned on the inside . A loose board in the top of the closet leaves an opening large enough for a man to crawl through , but one could scarcely get through it without being pulled through by confederates on the outside . Dr. 3forgan 's idea is that the body had been several days in the outbuilding before it was discovered . The bar-tender of Haggerty 's saloon is convinced , however , that he saw the dead man in the saloon on Friday , when he drank a bottle of ginger ale and took another away with him , and the watchman on the premises says that when . in the course of his rounds . he went to the outbuilding on Thursday night there was no one in it .
