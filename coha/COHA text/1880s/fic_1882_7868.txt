Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : PROEM. from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Long left unwounded by the grisly foe , Who sometime pieces all with fatal shaft , Still on my cheek fresh youth did lively glow , And at his threatening arrow gaily laught ; Came then my friendly scholar , and we quaffed From learning 's spring , its sparkling overflow ; All through the lingering evening 's charmd hours , Delightful fellowship in thought was ours : If I from Poesy could not all abstain , He my poor verses oft did quite undress , New wrapt in words my thought 's veiled nakedness , Or kindly clipt my steed 's luxuriant mane : ' T was my delight his searching eye to meet , In days of genial versing , memories sweet .

Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : II . Ah ! why so brief the visit , short his stay ? from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Ah ! why so brief the visit , short his stay ? The acquaintance so surprising , and so sweet , Stolen is my heart , ' t is journeying far away , With that shy stranger whom my voice did greet . That hour so fertile of entrancing thought , So rapt the conversation , and so free ,  --  My heart lost soundings , tenderly upcaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was I then ? was I ? clasped in Love 's embrace , And touched with ardors of divinity ?

Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : III . Not all the brilliant beauties I have seen from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Not all the brilliant beauties I have seen , Mid the gay splendors of some Southern hall , In jewelled grandeur , or in plainest mien , Did so my fancy and my heart enthral , As doth this noble woman , Nature 's queen ! Such hearty greeting from her lips did fall , And I ennobled was through her esteem ; At once made sharer of her confidence , As by enchantment of some rapturous dream ; With subtler vision gifted , finer sense , She loosed my tongue 's refraining diffidence , And softer accents lent our varying theme : So much my Lady others doth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The April rains are past , the frosts austere from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 The April rains are past , the frosts austere ,  --  The flowers are hungering for the genial sun , The snow ' s dissolved , the merry birds are here , And rural labors now are well begun . Hither , from the disturbing , noisy Court I ' ve flown to this sequestered , quiet scene , To mediate on Love and Love 's disport Mid these smooth pastures and the meadows green . Sure ' t were no fault of mine , no whispering sin , If these coy leaves he sends me seem to speak All that my heart , caressing , folds within ; Nor if I sought to smother , my flushed cheek Would tell too plainly what I can not hide , Fond fancy disenchant nor set aside .

Sure ' t is a tender and a sparkling flame That letters kindle and do sweetly feed ; Wilt fly , schoolmaster , for such noble game ? Maiden that doth all other maids exceed ! She writes with passion , and a nimble wit , Void of all pedantry and vain pretence , With native genius forcible and fit , A flowing humor and surpassing sense : Who gains her heart will win a precious prize , And fortunate be in every lover 's eyes .

Now , whilst the full moon glances soft and bright O'er Mall and Mill-Dam and suburban street , Turn hitherward thine unaccustomed feet , At afternoon , or evening , or late night ; A change of scene oft rare attraction lends To new acquaintance , as to older friends . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : VII . The morning 's clear , the sky without a frown from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 The morning 's clear , the sky without a frown , The dew-bespangled pastures wet the shoe ; Sauntering full early toward the sleeping town , We ' ll take the dry , well-trodden avenue ; On these crisp pathways , and familiar grounds ( Unless my flattering heart be over-bold ) , While lingering purposely amid our rounds , Some shady lane may love to hear all told . One name has captured his too partial ear ,  --  ( These kind , concealing bushes love invite No tell-tales are , nor neighbors impolite ; ) I ' ll hear his suit devoid of blame or fear . Impatiently the moment I await ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronson , 1799-1888 : VIII . Mean are all titles of nobility from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Mean are all titles of nobility , And kings poor spendthrifts , while I do compare The wealth she daily lavishes on me Of love , the noble kingdom that I share : Is it the jealous year , for emphasis , Sheds beauteous sunshine and refreshing dews ? My maiden 's month doth softlier court and kiss , Tint springtime 's virgin cheek with rosier hues Fly faster o'er my page , impassioned quill , Signing this note of mine with tenderer touch ! Say I no measure find to mete my will , Say that I love , but can not tell how much ; Let time and trouble the full story tell : I can not love thee more , I know I love thee well . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : IX .

Enamoured thus and holden by its spell , Evasive words disloyal were , unfit To emphasize the exquisite happiness My boldest accents falteringly express ; Here , take my hand , and , life-long wedded , lead Me by thy side ; and , with my hand , my heart Given thee long since in thought , given now in deed ; My life , my love , shall play no faithless part . Blest be that hour , when , meeting face to face , Our vows are plighted , ours the dear embrace ! Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : X. Unconquerable and inviolate from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Unconquerable and inviolate Is Love ; servant and sov'reign of man 's wit : Though the light-wingd fancy changeful flit , She rules unswervingly her fair estate , O'erbears mischance and error , envy and hate ; High intellect , ambition , passion , pride , Endowments that capricious Fortune brings , By her disfranchisements are set aside ; The mistress she alike of slaves and kings , Empress of Earth 's dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest born . Of all in Heaven above or Earth below , No being so illustrious or forlorn , That to Love 's sceptre both not gladly bow . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XI . Ancestral tendencies far down descend from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Ancestral tendencies far down descend ; They bless or blame for generations long ; They prick us forward toward our destined end , Alike the weak , the sluggish , and the strong . When her grave ancestor , of Winthrop 's date , Did with the rich mint-master 's daughter join In wedlock , he , sagacious magistrate , Gained more in sterling worth than silver coin : So , when King 's Chapel saw , in gladsome May , The mild schoolmaster lead his willing bride , And the courtly warden give her hand away , Mintage of like worth had no land beside . True love alone nobility doth outvie , And character 's the sterling currency . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XII .

Then by the tilting rail Millbrook we cross , And sally through the fields to Walden wave , Plunging within the cove , or swimming o'er ; Through woodpaths wending , he with gesture quick Rhymes deftly in mid-air with circling stick , Skims the smooth pebbles from the leafy shore , Or deeper ripples raises as we lave ; Nor slumb'rous pillow touches at late night , Till converse with the stars his eyes invite .

Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XXI . Poet of the Pulpit , whose full-chorded lyre from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Poet of the Pulpit , whose full-chorded lyre Startles the churches from their slumbers late , Discoursing music , mixed with lofty ire , At wrangling factions in the restless state , Till tingles with thy note each listening ear ,  --  Then household charities by the friendly fire Of home , soothe all to fellowship and good cheer . No sin escapes thy fervent eloquence , Yet , touching with compassion the true word , Thou leavest the trembling culprit 's dark offence To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep dost thou dispense Due meed of praise , strict in thy just award . Can other pulpits with this preacher cope ? I glory in thy genius , and take hope ! Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XXII . People 's Attorney , servant of the Right from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 People 's Attorney , servant of the Right ! Pleader for all shades of the solar ray , Complexions dusky , yellow , red , or white ; Who , in thy country 's and thy time 's despite , Hast only questioned , What will Duty say ? And followed swiftly in her narrow way : Tipped is thy tongue with golden eloquence , All honeyed accents fall from off thy lips ,  --  Each eager listener his full measure sips , Yet runs to waste the sparkling opulence ,  --  The scorn of bigots , and the wordling 's flout . If Time long held thy merit in suspense , Hastening repentant now , with pen devout , Impartial History dare not leave thee out . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break free from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 ' T was when the land was struggling to break free From Slavery 's fetter and provincial ban , Whilst a great people dreaded liberty ,  --  That the dire conflict of thine age began . Thy voice rang clear o'er selfish sect and clan ; Nor politician 's , priest 's , nor tradesman 's plea Did aught avail to quench , but more to fan The flame that must consume all slavery ,  --  The serf then franchised and proclaimed a man . Long wast thou heard amid the scoff and scorn Of voices potent in thy city dear ; Steadfast didst face the storm , with heart of cheer , And prove thyself the freeman nobly born , Preacher of righteousness , of saints the peer . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XXIV . Bold Saint , thou firm believer in the Cross from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Bold Saint , thou firm believer in the Cross , Again made glorious by self-sacrifice ,  --  Love 's free atonement given without love 's loss ,  --  That martyrdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its liberties should gain ; Flash its sure consequence in Slavery 's eyes When , ' scaping sabre 's clash and battle 's smoke , She felt the justice of thy master-stroke : Peaceful prosperity around us lies , Freedom with loyalty thy valor gave ; Whilst thou , no felon doomed , for gallows fit , O Patriot true ! O Christian meek and brave ! Throned in the martyr 's seat henceforth shalt sit ; Prophet of God ! Messias of the Slave ! Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XXV . Nobly censorious of our transient age from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Nobly censorious of our transient age , Hating oppressors in thy love of man , Thou didst stride forward on the public stage With the bold liberators to the van , Scourging delinquents with a lofty rage . Iconoclast , who ' gainst foul idols ran , Tumbling false gods from their wide-worshipped shrine , To throne therein the human and divine . Charged was thy soul with vehement eloquence , Strenuous with ample reason 's manly art ; Thy prayers were fervent , void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heart ; Eagerly of all learning mad'st thou spoil , Before thy lamp , extinguished , spent its oil . Alcott , Amos Bronson , 1799-1888 : XXVI . Freedom 's first champion in our fettered land from Sonnets and canzonets 1882 Freedom 's first champion in our fettered land ! Nor politician nor base citizen Could gibbet thee , nor silence , nor withstand . Thy trenchant and emancipating pen The patriot Lincoln snatched with steady hand , Writing his name and thine on parchment white , Midst war 's resistless and ensanguined flood ; Then held that proclamation high in sight Before his fratricidal countrymen ,  --  " Freedom henceforth throughout the land for all , "  --  And sealed the instrument with his own blood , Bowing his mighty strength for slavery 's fall ; Whilst thou , stanch friend of largest liberty , Survived ,  --  its ruin and our peace to see .

See the brave stripling rise From lowliest hut and poverty , From stair to stair ; Nor hardly fix his footsteps there , Ere he another round Doth upward bound ; Still , step by step , to higher stair Forward he leaps , Broader his vision sweeps , Till he the loftiest summit gain ,  --  A people 's hope to further and maintain .

Wasted by weary pains , His pale remains Now lie in state , Swathed in his bloody shroud ; Peoples and kingdoms bathed in tears . Hear'st thou the welcome greet his ears , As he his holier throne doth take ? This brave of fifty manly years , Dies he not now for thy dear sake ? III .
