txt Whatever the workingmen may accomplish by means of united political action , there are certain advantages they may gain without such action , of which in this country they have been very slow in availing themselves . The most obvious and the most practical method of improving their condition is through co-operation . We do not now refer to co-operation in manufacturing or production , because this is far more difficult and risky than co-operation in the purchases of goods for daily consumption . It requires a much more extended organization , more skilled management , and larger capital , involves greater risks of loss , and can at best be applied . only gradually and with great care . In time it may be successfully carried out with reference to staple articles of production of relatively simple character , but it is plainly not an experiment to enter upon rashly , and it is yet doubtful whether it can ever be carried to an extent to affect seriously the general condition of wage workers . But what is sometimes called co-operative distribution , which is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such goods as they need at wholesale prices , and . to divide the difference between wholesale and ordinary retail prices among themselves , is a very simple operation . It is capable of being applied on a small scale nearly as well as on a large one . It involves very little risk of loss of any kind . It requires no more general business capacity for its management than is easily to be found among sensible and good workmen . Its profits , which are really savings , are immediate , or nearly so . It is readily understood by all who take part in it , and it can be carried on just as easily in a small village or in any single factory as in large towns . Moreover , it is not an untried experiment . Co-operative stores have been established for many years in England . They have grown in number and in the extent of their sales and profits almost without interruption . The English figures are , in fact , almost startling . Twenty-four years ago their sales had . reached - what then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in 1883 , the date of the last compilation published , the sales were $140 , - 000,000 , on which the profits alone were $12,500,000 . And , says Mr. ACKLAND in his article in the last number of Harper 's , " to show more clearly what an immense hold co-operation has over certain districts , it may be mentioned that in the county of Durham the members of co-operative societies amount to more than 30 per cent . of the total population , in Lancashire and Yorkshire to 27 per cent. , in Cumberland to 24 per cent. , and in Northumberland to 2212 per cent . " The largest of these societies is at Leeds , with a membership of 22,000 and over , a share capital of $1,110,000 , a loan capital of $85,000 , a reserve fund of $40,000 , land , building , and fixed stock of $825,000 , annual sales of $2,500,000 , and net profits of $290,000 . This is an example of the extent to which a society of this sort can be developed , but , with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Leeds society are precisely the same , and its management is on the same principles as in the case of a society with a capital of $500 and sales of $5,000 a year . The essence of the whole thing is the purchase of goods at wholesale , their sale to members at the ordinary retail prices , and . the division of the profits in the ratio of the purchases of each individual . At first , of course , it is necessary that purchasers should leave with the managers a certain percentage of profits in order to make up a solid working capital ; after that the entire profits may be drawn out , or loaned to the society so long as they can be profitably employed . If the profits are so left , the society acts as a savings bank . If they are drawn out , it acts only as a means of reducing the cost of living . In either case its advantages are obvious . We do not know the number of co-operative ( purchasing ) societies in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However many or few , they would gain greatly by a central organization . The gain , in the first instance , would be in mutual instruction both as to improvements to be made and errors to be avoided . In the second place , a central organization , properly maintained , could secure the purchase of goods for the individual societies at a very great reduction . It will be seen that the average profits on the sales of the English societies as a whole are a little less than 9 per cent. , while those of the Leeds society are a little over 11.5 per cent. , or more than one-fourth greater . As the sales are nia , cle at the average retail prices throughout the kingdom , this difference shows the advantage of purchases on . a large scale . The question of the improvement of the workingmen 's position is always a pressing one . Mere is one means of improving it absolutely independent of the question of wages ; or of working hours , or of anything in which there is danger of disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
