IVAN TURG*NIEFF . WHEN the mortal remains of Ivan Turg6nieff were about to be transported from Paris for interment in his own country , a short commemorative service was held at the Gare du Nord . Ernest Renan and Edmond About , standing beside the train in which his coffin had been placed , bade farewell in the name of the French people to the illustrious stranger who for so many years had been their honored and grateful guest . M. Renan made a beautiful speech , and M. About a very clever one , and each of them characterized with ingenuity the genius and the moral nature of the most touching of writers , the most lovable of men . " turu*nieff , " said NI . Renan , " received by the mysterious decree which marks out human vocations the gift which is noble beyond all others : he was born essentially impersonal . " The passage is so eloquent that I shall repeat the whole of it : " His conscience was not that of an individtial to whom nature had been more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people . Before he was born he had lived for thousands of years ; infinite successions of reveries had amassed themselves in the bottom of his heart . No man has been as much as he the incarnation of a whole race ; generations of ancestors , lost in the sleep of centuries , speechless , came through him to life and utterance . " I quote these lines for the pleasure of quoting them ; for while I see what M. Renan means by calling Turg*nieff impersonal , it has been my wish to devote to his delightful memory a few pages written under the impression of his personal character . He seems to us impersonal , because it is from his writings almost alone that we of English , French , and German speech have derived our notions - even yet , I fear , rather meagre and erroneous - of the Russian people . His genius for us is the Slav genius ; his voice the voice of those vaguely imagined multitudes whom wc think of more and more to-day as waiting their turn , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North . There is much in his writings to encourage this view , and it is certain that he interpreted with wonderful vividness the temperament of his fellow-countrymen . Cosmopolite that he had become by the force of circumstances , his roots had never been loosened in his native soil . The ignorance with regard to Russia and the Russians which he found in abundance in the rest of Europe - and not least in the country he inhabited for ten years before his death - had indeed the effect , to a certain degree , to throw him back upon the deep feelings that so many of his companions were unable to share with him , the memories of his early years , the sense of wide Russian horizons , the joy and pride of his mothertongue . In the collection of short pieces , so deeply interesting , written during the last few years of his life , and translated into German under the name of Senilia , I find a passage - it is the last in the little book - which illustrates perfectly this reversionary impulse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought on the destiny of my native land , thou alone art my support and my staff , 0 great , powerful , Russian tongue , truthful and free ! If it were not for thee , how should man not despair at the sight of what is going on at home ? But it is inconceivable that such a language has not been given to a great people . " This national , home-loving note pervades his productions , though it is between the lines , as it were , that we must listen for it . None the less does it remain true that he was a very definite individual . // He was not a simple conduit or mouthpiece ; the inspiration was his own as well as the voice . He was a person , in other words , of the most substantial kind , and those who had the happiness to know him have no difficulty to-day in thinking of him as a detached and responsible figure . This pleasure , for the writer of these lines , was as great as the pleasure of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life and feeling ; it was perhaps even greater , for it was not only with the pen that nature had given Turg6nieff the power to express himself . He was the richest , the most delightful , of talkers , and his face , his person , his temper , the thoroughness with which he had been equipped for human intercourse , make in the memory of his friends an image which is completed , but not thrown into the shade , by his literary distinction . The whole image is touched with sadness : partly because the element of melancholy in his nature was deep and constant - readers of his novels have no need to be told of that ; and partly because , during the last years of his life , he had been condemned to suffer atrociously . Intolerable pain had been his portion for many months before he died ; his end was not serene and propitious , but dark and almost violent . But of brightness , of the faculty of enjoyment , he had also the large allowance usually made to first-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had greatly admired his writings before I had the fortune to make his acquaintance , and this privilege , when it presented itself , was highly illuminating . The man and the writer together occupied from that moment a very high place in my affections . Some time before knowing him I committed to print certain reflections which his tales had led me to make ; and I may perhaps , therefore , without impropriety give them a supplement which shall have a more vivifying refqrence . It is almost irresistible to attempt to say , from one 's own point of view , what manner of man he was . It was in consequence of the article I just mentioned that I found reason to meet him , in Paris , where he was then living , in 1875 . I shall never forget the impression he made upon me at that first interview . I found him adorable ; I could scarcely believe that he would prove - that any man could prove - on nearer acquaintance as delightful as that . Nearer acquaintance only confirmed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practicable , the least precarious , mali of genius it has been my fortune to meet . He was so simple , so natural , so modest , so destitute of personal pretension and of what is called the consciousness of powers , that one almost doubted at moments whether he were a man of genius , after all . Everything good and fruitful lay near to him ; he was interested in everything ; and he was absolutely without that eagerness of self-reference which sometimes accompanies great , and even small , reputations . He had not a particle of vanity ; nothing whatever of the air of having a part to play , or a reputation to keep up . His humor exercised itself as freely upon himself as upon other subjects , and he told stories at his own expense with a sweetness of hilarity which made his peculiarities really sacred in the eyes of a friend . I remember vividly the smile and tone of voice with which he once repeated to me a figurative epithet which Gustave Flaubert ( of whom he was extremely fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterize a certain expansive softness , a comprehensive indecision , which pervaded his nature , just as it pervades so many of the characters he has described . He enjoyed Flaubert 's use of this term , good-naturedly opprobrious , more even than Flanbert himself , and recognized perfectly the element of truth in it . He was natural to an extraordinary degree ; I // Ivan Turg6nieff. do not think I have ever seen his match in this respect , certainly not among people who bear , as he did , at the same time the stamp of the highest cultivation . Like all men of a large pattern , he was composed of many different elements ; and what was always striking in him was the mixture of simplicity with the fruit of the most various observation . In the little article in which I had attempted to express my admiration for his works , I had been moved to say of him that he had the aristocratic temperament ; a remark which , in the light of further knowledge , seemed to me singularly inane . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that he was democratic would be ( though his political ideal was a democracy ) to give an equally superficial account of him . He felt and understood the opposite sides of life ; he was imaginative , humorous , ironical . He had not in his mind a grain of prejudice as large as the point of a needle , and people ( there are many ) who think this a defect would have missed it immensely in Ivan SergeNevitch . Our Anglo-Saxon , Protestant , moralistic , conventional standards were far away from him , and he judged things with a freedom and spontaneity in which I found a perpetual refreshment . His sense of beauty , his love of truth and right , were the foundation of his nature ; but half the charm of conversation with him was that one breathed an air in which cant phrases and arbitrary measurements simply sounded ridiculous . I may add that it was not because I had written a laudatory article about his books that he gave me a friendly welcome ; for in the first place my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second it had never been either his habit or his hope to bask in the light of criticism . Supremely modest as he was , I think he attached no great weight to what might happen to be said about him ; for he felt that he was destined to encounter a very small amount of intelligent appreciation , especially in foreign countries . I never heard him even allude to any judgment which might have been passed upon his productions in England . In France he knew that he was read very moderately ; the " demand " for his volumes was small , and he had no illusions whatever on the subject of his popularity . He had heard with pleasure that several different persons in the United States were impatient for everything that might come from his pen ; but I think he was never convinced , as one or two of the more zealous of these persons had endeavored to convince him , that he could boast of a " public " in America . He gave me the impression of thinking of criticism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amusement , the exercise , the subsistence , of the critic ( and , so far as this goes , of immense use ) ; but that , though it may often concern other readers , it does not much concern the artist himself . In comparison with all those things which the production of a considered work forces the artist little by little to say to himself , the remarks of the critic are vague and of the moment ; and yet , owing to the large publicity of the proceeding , they have a power to irritate or discourage which is quite out of proportion to their use to the person criticised . It was not , moreover ( this is a very frank allusion ) , on account of any esteem which he accorded to my own productions ( I used regularly to send them to him ) that I found him so agreeable , for to the best of my belief he was unable to read them . As regards one of the first that I had offered him , he wrote me a little note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his constant companion , had read three or four chapters aloud to him the evening before , and that one of them was written de main de maitre ! This gave me great pleasure , but it was my first and last pleasure of the kind . 44 S January , // I continued , as I say , to send him my stories , because they were the only thing I had to give ; but he never alluded to the rest of the work in question , which he evidently did not finish , and never gave any sign of having read its successors . Presently I quite ceased to expect this , and saw why it was ( it interested me much ) that my writings could not appeal to him . He cared , more than anything else , for the air of reality , and my reality was a good deal too thin . I do not think my stories struck him as quite meat for men . The manner was more apparent than the matter ; they were too tarabiscot6 , as I once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface too many little flowers and knots of ribbon . He had read a great deal of English , and knew the language remarkably well - too well , I used often to think , for he liked to speak it with those to whom it was native , and , successful as the effort always was , it deprived him of the facility and raciness with which he expressed himself in French . I have said that he had no prejudices : but perhaps after all he had one . I think he imagined it to be impossible to a person of English speech to converse in French with complete correctness . He knew Shakespeare thoroughly , and at one time had wandered far and wide in English literature . His onportunities for speaking English were not at all frequent , so that when the necessity ( or at least the occasion ) presented itself he remembered the phrases he had encountered in books . This often gave a charming quaintness and an unexpected literary turn to what he said . " In Russia , in spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me from the very last time I saw him . He continued to read English books , and was not incapable of attacking the usual Tauchnitz novel . The English writer ( of our day ) of whom I remember to have heard him speak with most admiration was Dickens , of whose faults he was conscious , but whose power of presenting to the eye a vivid , definite figure he rated very high . George Eliot he also greatly admired . He had made her acquaintance during the sorrowful winter of the Franco-Prussian war , which he spent in London , and I have heard her express a high appreciation of his own genius . In the young French school he was much interested ; I mean , in the new votaries of realism , the grandsons of Balzac . He was a good friend of most of them , and with Gustave Flaubert , the most singular and most original of the group , lie was altogether intimate . He had his reservations and discriminations , and he had , above all , the great back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which the door constantly stood open , and into which the grandsons of Balzac were not , I think , particularly free to accompany him . But he had much sympathy with their experiment , their general movement , and it was on the side of the careful study of life as the best line of the novelist that , as may easily be supposed , he ranged himself . For some of the manifestations of the opposite tradition he had a great contempt . This was a kind of emotion he rarely expressed , save in regard to certain public wrongs and iniquities ; bitterness and denunciation seldom passed his mild lips . But I remember well the little flush of conviction , the seriousness , with which lie once said , in allusion to a novel which had just been running through the Revue des Deux Mondes , " If I had written anything so bad as that , I should blush for it all my life . " His was not , I should say , predominantly , or even in a high degree , the artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the distinction , the poetic . Buteduring the last twelve years of his life he lived much with artists and men of letters , and he was eminently capable // of kindling in the glow of discussion . He cared for questions of form , though not in the degree in which Flaubert and Edmoud de Goncourt cared for them , and lie had very lively sympathies . He had a great regard for Madame George Sand , the head and front of the old romantic tradition ; but this was on general grounds , quite independent of her novels , which he never read , and which she never expected him , or apparently any one else , to read . He thought her character remarkably noble and sincere . His opinion of Victor Hugo could not have been expressed in a few words , but admiration , of course , was a considerable part of it . I remember ( on rrurg*nieff*s lips ) a brilliant description of Victor Hugo 's transcendent state of mind with regard to himself ( Victor Hugo ) , and as a corollary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminating , it was also pictorial and humorous . He had , as I have said , a great affection for Gustave Flaubert , who returned it ; and he was much interested in Flaubert 's extraordinary attempts at refinement of form and irony of matter , knowing perfectly well when they failed . During those months which it was Flaubert 's habit to spend in Paris , Turg3nieff went almost regularly to see him on Sunday afternoons , and was so good as to introduce me to the author of Madame Bovary , in whom I saw many reasons for Turg*nieff 's regard . It was on these Sundays , in Flaubert 's little salon , which , at the top of a house at the head of the Fanbourg Saint-Honor* , looked rather bare and provisional , that , in the company of the other familiars of the spot , more than one of whom have commemorated these occasions , Turg*nieff 's beautiful faculty of talk showed at its best . He was easy , natural , abundant , more than I can describe , and everything that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alphonse Daudet , Emile Zola. quality of his imagination . What was discussed in that little smoke-clouded room was chiefly questions of taste , questions of art and form ; and the speakers , for the most part , were in testhetic matters radicals of the deepest dye . It would have been late in the day to propose among them any discussiori of the relation of art to morality , any question as to the degree in which a novel might or might not concern itself with the teaching of a lesson . They had settled these preliminaries long ago , and it would have been primitive and incongruous to recur to them . Tile conviction that held them together was the conviction that art and morality are two perfectly different things , and that the former has no more to do with the latter than it has with astronomy or embryology . The only duty of a novel was to be well written ; that merit included every other of which it was capable . this state of mind was never more apparent than one afternoou when ces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just befallen one of them . L'Assommoir of Emile Zola had been discontinued in the journal through which it was running as a serial , in consequence of repeated protests from the subscribers . The subscriber , as a type of human imbecility , received a wonderful dressing , and the Philistine in general was roughly handled . There were gulfs of difference between Turginieff and Zola , but Turg* nieff , who , as I say , understood everything , understood Zola too , and rendered perfect justice to the extraordinary solidity of much of his work . His attitude , at such times , was admirable , and I could imagine nothing more genial or more fitted to give an idea of light , easy human intelligence . No one could desire more than he that art should be art ; always , ever , incorruptibly , art . To him this proposition would have seemed as little in need of proof , or susceptible of refutation , as the // axiom that law should always be law , or medicine always medicine . As much as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the demand for abdications and concessions never comes from artists themselves , but always from purchasers , editors , subscribers . I am pretty sure that his word about all this would have been that he coLild not quite see what was meant by the talk about novels being moral or the reverse ; that a novel could no more propose to itself to be moral than a painting or a symphony , and that it was arbitrary to lay down a distinction between such forms of art . I suspect that he would have said , in short , that distinctions were demanded in the interest of the moralists , and that the demand was indelicate , owing to their want of jurisdiction . It was not for art to be moral , any more than for chemistry ; it was for morality , since it cared so much about the matter , to be artful . Yet at the same time that I make this suggestion as to Turg6nieff 's state of mind , I remember how litth he struck me as bound by mere neatness of formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the pleader . What he thought of the relation of art to life , his stories , after all , show better than anything else . The immense variety of life was ever present to his mind , and he would never have argued the question I have just hinted at , in the interest of particular liberties - the liberties that were apparently the dearest to his French confr*res . It was this air that he carried about with him of feeling all the variety of life , of knowing strange and far-off things , of having an horizon in which the Parisian horizon - so familiar , so wanting in mystery , so perpetually exploit6 - easily lost itself , that distinguished him from these companions . He was not all there , as the phrase is ; he had something behind , in reserve . It was Russia , of course , in a large measure ; and , especially before the spectacle of what is going on there to-day , that was a large quantity . But so far as he was on the spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everything that was said , and the simplicity , naturalness , bonhomie , of his talk made it as charming as it was just . His contribution to every discussion always touched the essential part of it . I did not intend to go into these details immediately , for I had only begun to say what an impression of magnificent manhood he made upon me when I first knew him . That impression , indeed , always remained with me , even after ' it had been brought home to me how much there was in him of the quality of genius . He was a beautiful intellect , of course , but above all he was a delightful , mild , masculine figure . The combination of his deep , soft , lovable spirit , in which one felt all the tender parts of genius , with his immense , fair Russian physique was one of the most attractive things I have known . He had a frame which would have made it perfectly lawful , and even becoming , for him to be brutal ; but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had always been a passionate sportsman ; to wander in the woods or the steppes , with his dog and gun , was the pleasure of his heart . Late in life he continued to shoot , and he had a friend in Cambridgeshire for the sake of whose partridges , which were famous , he used sometimes to cross the Channel . It would have been impossible to imagine a better representation of a Nimrod of the North . He was exceedingly tall , and broad and robust in proportion . His head was one of the finest , and though the line of his features was irregular there was a great deal of beauty in his face . It was eminently of tho Russian type , - almost everything in it was wide . His expression had a singular sweetness , with a touch of Slav languor , and his eye , the kindest of eyes , was deep and melancholy . His hair , abundant and straight , was as white // as silver ; and his beard , which he wore trimmed rather short , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall person , which was very striking wherever it appeared , there was an air of neglected strength , as if it had been a part of his modesty never to remind himself that he was strong . He used sometimes to blush like a boy of sixteen . He had very few forms and ceremonies , and almost as little manner as was possible to a man of his natural prestance . His noble appearance was in itself a manner ; but whatever he did he did very simply , and he had not the slightest pretension of not being subject to rectification . I never saw any one receive it with less irritation . Friendly , candid , unaffectedly benignant , the impression that he produced most strongly and most generally was , 1 think , simply that of goodness . When I made his acquaintance he had been living , since his removal from Baden-Baden , which took place in consequence of the Franco-Prussian war , in a large detached house on the bill of Montmartre , with his friends of many years , Madame Pauline Pierdot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper floor , and I like to recall , for the sake of certain delightful talks , the aspect of his little green sitting-room , which has , in memory , the consecration of irrecoverable hours . It was almost entirely green , and the walls were not covered with paper , but draped in stuff . The port*res werc green , and there was one of those immense divans , so indispensable to Russians , which had apparently been fashioned for the great person of the master , so that smaller folk had to lie upon it rather than sit . I remember the white light of the Paris street , which came in through windows more or less blinded in their lower part , like those of a studio . It rested , during the first years that I went to see Turg6-nieff , upon several choice pictures of the modern French school , especially upon a very fine specimen of Th6odore Rousseau , which he valued exceedingly . He had a great love of painting , and was an excellent critic of a picture . The last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country - he showed me half a dozen large copies of Italian works , made by a young Russian , in whom he was interested , which he had , with characteristic Liadness , taken into his own apartments , in order that he might bring them to the knowledge of his friends . He thought them , as copies , remarkable ; and they were so , indeed , especially when one perceived that the original work of the artist had little value . Turg*nieff warmed to the work of praising them , as he was very apt to do ; like all men of imagination , he had frequent and zealous admirations . As a matter of course , there was almost always some young Russian in whom he was interested , and refugees and pilgrims of both sexes were his natural clients . I have heard it said , by persons who had known him long and well , that these enthusiasms sometimes led him into error ; that in the French phrase he was apt to se monte* la tate on behalf of his prohigis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming Russian genius ; he talked about his discovery for a month , and then , suddenly , one heard no more of it . I remember his once telling me of a young woman who had come to see him on her return from America , where she had been studying obstetrics at some medical college , and who , without means and without friends , was in want of help and of work . He accidentally learned that she had written something , and asked her to let him see it . She sent it to him , and it proved to be a tale in which certain phases of rural life were described with striking truthfulness . He perceived in the young lady a great natural talent ; he sent her story off to Russia to be printed , with the conviction that it would make a great impression , and he expressed the hope of // 49 being able to introduce her to French readers . When I mentioned this to an old friend of Turg*nieff , he smiled and said that we should not hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great many surprising talents , who , as a general thing had not borne the test . There was apparently some truth in this , and Turginieff 's liability to be deceived was too generous a weakness for me to hesitate to allude to it , even after I have insisted on the usual certainty of his taste . He was deeply interested in his young Russians ; they were what interested him most in the world . They were almost always unhappy , in want , and in rebellion against an order of things which he himself detested . The study of the Rus. sian character absorbed and fascinated him , as all readers of his stories know . Rich , unformed , undeveloped , with all sorts of adumbrations , of qualities in a state of fusion , it stretched itself out as a mysterious expanse , in which it was impossible as yet to perceive the relation between gifts and weaknesses . Of its weaknesses he was keenly conscious , and I once heard him express himself with an energy that did him honor , and a frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen that he spoke ) , in regard to a weakness which he deemed the greatest of all - a weakness for which a man whose love of the truth was his strongest feeling would have least toleration . His young compatriots , seeking their fortune in foreign lands , touched his imagination and his pity , and it is easy to conceive that under the circumstances the impression they often made upon him may have had great intensity . The Parisian background , with its brilliant sameness , its absence of surprises ( for those who have known it long ) , threw them into relief , and made him see them as he saw the figures in his tales , in relations , in situations , which brought them out . There passed before him , in the course of time , many wonderful Russian types . He told me once of his having been visited by a religious sect . The sect consisted of but two persons , one of whom was the object of worship , and the other the worshiper . The divinity , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were intensely serious ; but it was very bandy , as the term is , for each . The god had always his altar , and the altar had ( un . like some altars ) always its god . On the first floor of the house in the Rue de Douai was a gallery of pictures ( wherelater , I remember , one evening , I saw him take part with delightful comicality in an extemporized charade ) , into which , one of the first times I saw him , he took me to look at a portrait just painted of him by a Russian artist working in Paris . This , perhaps , was one of his premature admirations , for the picture , though respectable , could not long satisfy any one who carried well in his eye the admirable head and the deep physiognomy of the original ; and I remember that in the Salon of that year it produced little effect . To paint Turginieff at all properly would have required a painter of style . I may appear to gossip too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more irresponsible method of the pen one attempts a sketch of so interesting a man , every trifle is of value as an item of resemblance . I will venture to say , then , that in his personal arrangements there was an almost exaggerated neatness , a love of order which resulted sometimes in angularity . In this little green salon nothing was out of place ; there were none of the odds and ends of the usual man of letters , which indeed Turg*nieff was not ; and the case was the same in his library at Bougival , of which I shall presently speak . Few books , even , were visible ; it was as if everything had been put away . The traces of work had been carefully removed . An air of great comfort , an immeasurable divan , . and sev // eral valuable pictures - that was the effect of the place . I know not exactly at what hours Turg*nieff did his work ; I think he had no regular times and seasons , being in this respect as different as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of fixed habits , I have just been reading . It is my impression that in Paris Turg*nieff wrote little ; his times of production being rather those weeks of the summer that he spent at Bougival , and the period of that visit to Russia which he supposed himself to make every year . I say " supposed himself , " because it was impossible to see much of him without discovering that he was a man of delays . As on the part of some other Russians whom I have known , there was something almost Asiatic in his faculty of procrastination . But even if one suffered from it a little , one thought of it with kindness , as a part of his general mildness and want of rigidity . He went to Russia , at any rate , at intervals not infrequent , and he spoke of these visits as his best time for production . He had an estate far in the interior , and here , amid the stillness of the country and the scenes and figures which give such a charm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without interruption . It is not out of place to allude to the fact that he possessed considerable fortune ; for such an accident in the life of a man of letters has the highest importance . It had been of great value to Turgdnieff , and I think that much of the fine quality of his work is owing to it . He could write according to his taste and his mood ; he was never pressed nor checked ( putting the Russian censorship aside ) by considerations foreign to his plan , and never was in danger of becoming a hack . Indeed , taking into consideration the absence of a pecuniary spur , and that complicated indolence from which he was not e*emji1i , . his industry is surprising , for his tales are very numerous . In Paris , at all events , he was always open to proposals for the midday breakfast . He liked to breakfast au cabaret , and freely consented to an appointment . It is not unkind to add that , at first , he never kept it . I may mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place it was so inveterate as to be very amusing - it amused not only his friends , but himself ; and in the second , he was as sure to come in the end as he was sure not to come in the beginning . After the appointment had been made , or the invitation accepted , when the occasion was at hand , there arrived a note or a telegram , in which Ivan SergeYevitch excused himself , and begged that the meeting might be deferred to another date , which he usually himself proposed . For this second date , still another was sometimes substituted ; but if I remember no appointment that he exactly kept , I remember none that he completely missed . His friends waited for him frequently , but they never lost him . He was very fond of that wonderful Parisian dejeziner - fond of it , I mean , as a feast of reason . He was extremely temperate , and often ate no breakfast at all ; but he found it a good hour for talk , and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree with him , if he was at the table one was speedily convinced . I call it wonderful , the dijeiiner of Paris , on account of the assurance with which it plants itself in the very middle of the morning . It divides the day between rising and dinner so unequally , and opposes such barriers of repletion to any view of ulterior labors , that the unacclimated stranger wonders when the fertile French people do their work . Not the least wonderful part of it is that the stranger himself likes it , at last , and manages to piece together his day with the shattered fragments that survive . It was not , at any rate , when one had the good fortune to breakfast at twelve // o'clock with Turgdnieff that one was struck with its being an inconvenient hour . Any hour was convenient for meeting a human being that conformed so completely to one 's idea of the best that human nature is capable of . There are places in Paris which I can think of only in relation to some occasion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particular things I heard him say there come back to me . There is a cafe in the Avenue de l'Opira - a new , sumptuous establishment , with very deep settees - on the right as you leave the Boulevard , where I once had a talk with him , over an order singularly " moderate , " which was prolonged far into the afternoon , and in the course of which he was extraordinarily suggestive and interesting , so that my memory now reverts to all the circumstances with a tenderness that I can not express . It evokes the gray damp of a Parisian December , which made the dark interior of the caf6 look more and more rich and hospitable , while the light faded , the lamps were lit , the habitu*s came in to drink absinthe and play their afternoon game of dominoes , and we still lingered over our " breakfast . " Turg6nieff talked almost exclusively about Russia , the Nihilists , the remarkable figures that came to light among them , the curious visits he received , the dark prospects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no man could speak more to the imagination of his auditor . For myself , at least , at such times , there was something extraordinarily vivifying and stimulating in his talk , and I always left him in a state of " intimate " excitement , with a feeling that all sorts of valuable things had been suggested to me ; the condition in which a man swings his cane as he walks , leaps lightly over gutters , and then stops , for no reason at all , to look with an air of brightness into a shopwindow , where he sees nothing . I remember another symposium at a restaurant on one of the corners of the little place in front of the Op6ra Comique , where we were four , including Ivan Sergelevitch , and the two other guests were also Russian , one of them uniting to the charm of this nationality the merit of a sex that makes the combination irresistible . The establishment had been a discovery of Turgdnieff 's - a discovery , at least , as far as our particular needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . The dinner , in a low entresol , was not what it had been intended to be , but the talk was better even than our expectations . It was not about Nihilism , but about some more agreeable features of life , and I have no recollection of Turg*nieff in a mood more spontaneous and charming . One of our friends had , when he spoke French , a peculiar way of sounding the word adorable , which was frequently on his lips , and I remember well his expressive prolongation of the a when , in speaking of the occasion afterwards , he applied this term to Ivan Sergeievitch . I scarcely know , however , why I should drop into the detail of such reminiscences , and my excuse is but the desire that we all have , when a human relationship is closed , to save a little of it from the past - to make a mark which may stand for some of the moments of it . Nothing that Turg*nieff had to say could be more interesting than his talk about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard him tell of these things was worthy of the beautiful results he produced ; of the deep purpose , pervading them all , to show us life itself . The germ of a story , with him , was never an affair of plot - that was the last thing he thought of ; it was the representation of certain persons . The first form in which a tale appeared to him was as the figure of one individual or a combination of individuals , whom he wished to see in action , being sure that such people must do something very special and interesting . They stood before // him definite , vivid , and he wished to know , and to show , as much as possible of their nature . The first thing was to make clear to himself what he did know , to begin with ; and to this end , he wrote out a sort of biography of each of his characters and everything that they had done and that had happened to them , up to the opening of the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the police has of that of every conspicuous criminal . With this material in his hand he was able to proceed ; the story all lay in the question , What shall I make them do ? He always made them do things that showed them completely ; but , as he said , the defect of his manner and the reproach that was made him was his want of " architecture " - in other words , of composition . The great thing , of course , is to have architecture as well as precious material , as Walter Scott had them , as Balzac had them . If one iZeads Turg*nieff 's stories with the knowledge that they were composed - or rather that they came into being - in this way , one can trace the process in every line . Story , in the conventional sense of the word , - a fable constructed , like Wordsworth 's phantom , " to startle and waylay , " - there is as little as possible . The thing consists of the motions of a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preconceived action , but a consequence of the qualities of the actors . Works of art are produced from every possible . point of view , and stories , and very good ones , will continue to be writte* in order to illustrate a plot . Such stories will always , probably , find most favor with many readers , because they remind them enough , with*ut reminding them too much , of life . On this opposition many young talents , in France , are ready to rend each other , for there is a numerous school on either side . We have not yet , in England and America , arrived at the point of treating such questions with passion , for we have not yet arrived at the point of feeling them intensely , or indeed , for that matter , of understanding them very well . It is not open to us , as yet , to discuss whether a novel had better be an excision from life , or a structure built up of picture-cards , for we have not made up our mind as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , even a certain ridicule attaches to the consideration of such alternatives . But individuals may feel their way , and perhaps even pass unchallenged if they remark that for them the manner in which Turg6nieff worked will always seem the most fruitful . It has the immense recommendation that in relation to any human occurrence it begins , as it were , further back . It lies in its power to tell us the most about men and women . Of course it will but slenderly satisfy those numerous readers among whom the answer to this would be , " Hang it , we do n't care a straw about men and women : we want a good story ! " And yet , after all , Elena is a good story , and A Nest of Noblemen and Virgin Soil are good stories . Reading over lately several of Turg*nieff 's novels and tales , I was struck afresh with their combination of beauty and reality . One must never forget , in speaking of him , that he was both an observer and a poet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangeness and power . It inspired most of the short things that he wrote during the last few years of his life , since the publication of Virgin Soil , and which are in the highest degree fanciful and exotic . It pervades the frequent little reveries , visions , epigrams , of the Senilia . It was no part of my intention , here , to criticise his writings , having said my say about them , so far as possible , some years ago . But I may mention that in re-reading them I find in them all that I formerly found of two other elements - their depth and their sadness . They give one the impression of life itself , and not of an // arrangement , a r*char*fl'e ' of life . I remember Turg*nieff 's once saying in regard to Homais , the little Norman country apothecary , with his pedantry of " enlightened opinions , " in Madame Bovary , that the great strength of such a portrait consisted in its being at once an individual , of the most concrete sort , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own representations of character ; they are so strangely , fascinatingly particular , and yet they are so recognizably general . Such a remark as that about Homais makes me wonder why it was that Turg*nieff should have rated Dickens so high , the weakness of Dickens being in regard to just that point . If Dickens fails to live long , it will be because his figures are particular without being general ; because they are individuals without being types ; because we do not feel their continuity with the rest of humanity - see the matching of the pattern with the piece out of which all the creations of the novelist and the dramatist are cut . I often meant , but accidentally neglected , to put Turginieff on the subject of Dickens again , and ask him to explain his opinion . I suspect that his opinion was in a large measure merely that Dickens entertained him , as well he might . That curiosity of the pattern was in itself fascinating . I have mentioned Flaubert , and I will return to him simply to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the friendship that united these two men . It is much to the honor of Flaubert , to my sense , that he appreciated Ivan Turg*nieff . There was a partial similarity between them . Both were tall , massive men , though the Russian reached to a greater height than the Norman ; both were completely honest arid sincere , and both had in their composition the element of irony and sadness . Each had a tender regard for the other , and I think that I am neither incorrect nor indiscreet in saying that on Turg*nieff 's part this regard had in it a strain of compassion . There was something in Gustave Flaubert that appealed to such a feeling . He had failed , on the whole , more than he had succeeded , and the great machinery of erudition and labor which he brought to bear upon his productions was not accompanied with proportionate results . He had talent without having cleverness , and imagination without having fancy . His effort was heroic , but except in the case of Madame Bovary , a masterpiece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than floated them . He had a passion for perfection of form and for a certain splendid suggestiveness of style . He wished to produce perfect phrases , perfectly interrelated , and as closely woven together as a suit of chain-mail . He looked at life altogether as an artist , and took his worli .. with a seriousness that never belied itself . To write an admirable page - and his idea of what constituted an admirable page was transcendent - seemed to him something to live for . He tried it again and again , and he came very near it ; more than once he touched it , for Madame Bovary surely will live . But there was something unfruitful in his genius . He was cold , and he would have given everything he had to be able to glow . There is nothing in his novels like the passion of Elena for lassaroff , like the purity of Lisa , like the anguish of the parents of Bazaroff , like the hidden wound of Tatiana ; and yet Flaubert yearned , with all the accumulations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some parts of his mind that did not " give , " as the French say , that did not render a sound . He had had too much of some sorts of experience , and not enough of others . And yet this local dumbness , as I may call it , inspired those who knew him with a kindness . If Flaubert was powerful and limited , there is something impressive in a strong man who has not been able completely to express himself . // After the first year of my acquaintance with Turg*nieff , I saw him much less often . I was seldom in Paris , and sometimes when I was there he was absent . But I neglected no opportunity of seeing him , and fortune frequently favored me . He came two or three times to London , for visits provokingly brief . He went to shoot in Cambridgeshire , and he passed through town in arriving and departing . He liked the English , but I am not sure that he liked London , where he had passed a lugubrious winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period , especially a visit that he had paid to a " bishopess " surrounded by her daughters , and a description of the cookery at the lodgings which he occupied . After 1876 I frequently saw him as an invalid . He was tormented by gout , and sometimes terribly besieged ; but his account of what he suffered was as charming - I can apply no other word to it - as his description of everything else . He had so the habit of observation that he perceived in excruciating sensations all sorts of curious images and analogies , and analyzed them to an extraordinary fineness . Several times I found him at Bougival , above the Seine , in a very spacious and handsome chalet - a little unzunned , it is true - which he had built alongside of the villa occupied by the family to which , for years , his life had been devoted . The place is delightful ; the two houses are midway up a long slope , which descends , with the softest inclination , to the river , and behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , in the distance , high up , and above an horizon of woods , stretches the romantic aqueduct of Marly . It is a very pretty domain . The last time I saw him , in November , 1882 , it was at Bougival . He bad been very ill , with strange , intolerable symptoms , but he was better , and he had good hopes . They were not justified by the event . He got worse again , and the months that followed . were cruel . His beautiful , serene mind should not have been darkened and made acquainted with violence ; it should have been able to the last to take part , as it had always done , in the decrees and mysteries of fate . At the moment I saw him , however , he was , as they say in London , in very good form , and my last impression of him was almost bright . He was to drive into Paris , not being able to bear the railway , and he gave me a seat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , and never better . When we got into the city I alighted on the Boulevard ext*rieur , as we were to go in different directions . I bade him good-by at the carriage window , and never saw him again . There was a kind of fair going on , near by , in the chill November air , beneath the denuded little trees of the Boulevard , and a Punch and Judy show , from which nasal sounds proceeded . I almost regret having accidentally to mix up so much of Paris with this , perhaps too coinplacent , enumeration of occasions , for the effect of it may be to suggest that Ivan Sergeievitch had been gallicized . But this was not the case ; no sojourner in Paris was less French than he . Paris touched him at many points , but , it let him alouc at many others , and he had with that great tradition of ventilation of the Russian mind windows open into distances which stretched far beyond the banlieue . I have spoken of him from the limited point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself little space to allude to a matter which filled his existence a good deal more than the consideration of how a story should be written - his hopes and fears on behalf of his native land . He wrote fictions and dramas , but the great drama of his life was the struggle for a better state of things in Russia . In this drama he played a distinguished part , and the splendid obsequies that , simple and modest as he was , have an- // folded themselves over his grave , sufficiently attest the recognition of it by his countrymen . His funeral , restricted and officialized , was none the less a magnificent " manifestation . " I have read the accounts of it , however , with a kind of chill , a feeling in which assent to the honors paid him bore less part than it ought . All this pomp and ceremony seemed to lift him out of the range of familiar recollection , of valued reci procity , into the majestic position of a national glory . And yet it is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew and loved him must address their farewell to him now . After all , it is difficult to see how the obstacle can be removed . He was the most generous , the most tender , the most delightful , of men ; his large nature overflowed with the love of justice ; but he was also a rare genius . ilenry James . @
