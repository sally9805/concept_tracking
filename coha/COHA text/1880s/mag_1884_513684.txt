" OLD HICKORY . " DR . VON HO*LST , the most philosophic of historians , when he passes from the period of John Quincy Adams to that of his successor , is reluctantly compelled to leave the realm of pure history for that of biography , and to entitle a chapter " The Reign of Andrew Jackson . " This change of treatment could , indeed , hardly be helped . Under Adams all was impersonal , methodical , a government of laws and not of men . With an individuality quite as strong as that of Jacksonas the whole nation learned ere his life ended-it had yet been the training of his earlier career to suppress himself , and be simply a perfect official . His policy aided the vast progress of the nation , but won no credit by the process . Men saw with wonder the westward march of an expanding people , but forgot to notice the sedate , passionless , orderly administration that held the door open , and kept the peace for all . In studying the time of Adams we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think of Jackson himself . In him we see the first popular favorite of a nation now well out of leading-strings , and particularly bent on going alone . By so much as he differed from Adams , by so much the people liked him better . His conquests had been those of war , always more dazzling than those of peace ; his temperament was of fire , always more attractive than one of marble . He was helped by what he had done , and by what he had not done . Even his absence of diplomatic training was almost counted for a virtue , because all this training was then necessarily European , and the demand had ripened for a purely American product . It had been quite essential to the selfrespect of the new republic , at the outset , that it should have at its head men who had coped with European statesmen on their own soil and not been discomfited . This was the case with each of the early successors of Washington , and in view of his manifest superiority this advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a sign of self-respect that the new // ANDREW JACKSON . Engraved by G. Kraell from the lithograph hy La Fease , copyrighted hy M. Knoedler and Co. // republic should at last turn from this tradition , and take boldly from the ranks a strong and ill-trained leader , to whom all European precedent-and , indeed , all other precedent-counted for nothing . In Jackson , moreover , there first appeared upon . our national stage the since familiar figure of the self-made man . Other Presidents had sprung from a modest origin , but nobody had made an especial point of it . Nobody had urged Washington for office because he had been a surveyoi* 's lad ; nobody had voted for Adams merely because stately old ladies designated him as " that cobbler 's son . " But when Jackson came into office the people had just had almost a surfeit of regular training in their Chief Magistrates . There was a certain zest in the thought of a change , and the nation certainly had it . It must be remembered that Jackson was in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed in his image . He was narrow , ignorant , violent , unreasonable ; he punished his enemies and rewarded his friends . But he was , on the other hand  --  and his worst opponents hardly denied it-chaste , honest , truthful , and sincere . It was not commonly charged upon him that he enriched himself at the public expense , or that he deliberately invented falsehoods . And as he was for a time more bitterly hated than any one who ever occupied his high office , we may be very sure that these things would have been charged had it been possible . In this respect the contrast was enormous between Jackson and his imitators , and it explains his prolonged influence . He never was found out or exposed before the world , because there was nothing to detect or unveil ; his merits and demerits were as visible as his long , narrow , firmly set features , or as the old military stock that encircled his neck . There he was , always fully revealed ; everybody could see him ; the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him . Moreover , there was after the eight years of Monroe and the four years of Adams an immense popular demand for something piquant and even amusing , and this quality they always had from Jackson . There was nothing in the least melodramatic about him ; he never posed or attitudinized - it would have required too much patience ; but he was always piquant . There was formerly a good deal of discussion as to who wrote the once fa mous " Jack Downing " letters , but we might almost say that they wrote themselves . Nobody was ever less of a humorist than Andrew Jackson , and it was therefore the more essential that he should be the cause of humor in others . It was simply inevitable that during his progresses through the country there should be some amusing shadow evoked , some Yankee parody of the man , such as came from two or three quarters under the name of Jack Downing . The various records of Monroe 's famous tours are as tame as the speeches which these expeditions brought forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronicle ; but wherever Jackson went there went the other Jack , the crude first-fruits of what is now known through the world as " American humors . " Jack Downing was Mark Twain and Hosea Biglow and Artemus Ward in one . The impetuous President enraged many and delighted many , but it is something to know that under him a serious people first found that it knew how to laugh . The very extreme , the perfectly needless extreme , of political foreboding that marked the advent of Jackson furnished a background of lurid solemnity for all this light comedy . Samuel Breck records in his diary that he conversed with Daniel Webster in Philadelphia , March 24 , 1827 , upon the prospects of the government . " Sir , " said Mr. Webster , " if General Jackson is elected , the government of our country will be overthrown ; the judiciary will be destroyed ; Mr. Justice Johnson will be made Chief Justice in the room of Mr. Marshall , who must soon retire , and then in half an hour Mr. Justice Washington and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Johnson , and every constitutional decision hitherto made will be reversed . " As a matter of fact , none of these results followed . Mr. Justice Johnson never became Chief Justice ; Mr. Marshall retained that office till his death in 1835 ; Story and Washington also died in office ; the judiciary was not overthrown , nor the goverunment destroyed . But the very ecstasy of these fears stimulated the excitement of the public mind . No matter how extravagant the supporters of Jackson might be , they could hardly go farther in that direction than did the Websters in the other . But it was not the fault of the Jackson // From the painting by G. P. A. He . ly. // party if anybody went beyond them in exaggeration . An English traveller , William E. Alexander , going in a stage-coach from Baltimore to Washington in 1831 , records the exuberant conversation of six editors , with whom he was shut up for hours . The gentlemen of the press , " he says , " talked of going the whole hog ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( nave ) for General Jackson , who was all brimstone but the head , and that was aquafortis , ' and swore if any one abused him he ought to be set straddle on an iceberg , and shot through with a streak of lightning . " ' Somewhere between the dignified despair of Daniel Webster and the adulatory slang of these gentry we must look for the actual truth about Jackson 's administration . The fears of the statesman were not wholly groundless , for it is always hard to count in advance upon the tendency of high office to make men more reasonable . The enthusiasm of the editors had a certain foundation ; at any rate it was a part of their profession to like stirring times , and they had now the promise of them . After four years of Adams , preceded by eight years of Monroe , any party of editors in America , assembled in a stage-coach , would have showered epithets of endearment on the man who gave such promise in the way of lively items . No **cute journalist could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was called " Old Hickory " by three-quarters of the nation , and who made " Hurrah for Jackson ! " a cry so potent that it had the force of a popular decree . There was , indeed , unbounded room for popular enthusiasm in the review of Jack . son 's early career . Born in such obscurity that it is doubtful to this day whether he was born in South Carolina , as he himself claimed , or on the North Carolina side of the line , as Mr. Parton thinks , he had a childhood of poverty and ignorance . He was taken prisoner as a mere boy during the Revolution , and could never forget that he had been wounded by a British officer whose boots he had refused to brush . Afterward , in a frontier community , he was successively farmer , shop-keeper , law student , lawyer , district attorney , judge , and Congressman , being first Representative from Tennessee , and then Senator , and all before the age of thirty-one . In Congress Albert Gallatin describes him as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long locks of hair hanging over his brows and face , and a queue down his back tied in an eel-skin ; his dress singular , his manners and deportment those of a backwoodsman . " He remained , however , but a year or two in all at Philadelphia-then the seat of national government  --  and afterward became a planter in Tennessee , fought duels , subdued Tecumseh and the Creek Indians , winning finally the great opportunity of his life by being made a Major-General in the United States army on May 31 , 1814 . He now had his old captors , the British , with whom to deal , and entered into the work with a relish . By way of preliminary he took Pensacola , without any definite authority , from the Spaniards , to whom it belonged , and the English whom they harbored ; and then turned , without orders , without support , and without supplies , to undertake the defense of New Orleans . Important as was this city , and plain as it was that the British threatened it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impression prevailed at Washington that it must already have been taken , but that the President would not let it be known . The Washington Republican of January 17 , 1815 , said , " That Mr. Madison will find it convenient and will finally determine to abandon the State of Louisiana we have not a doubt . " A New York newspaper of January 30 , quoted in Mr. Andrew Stevenson 's eulogy on Jackson , said , " It is the general opinion here that the city of New Orleans must fall . " Apparently but one thing averted its fall  --  the energy and will of Andrew Jackson . On his own responsibility lie declared martial law , impressed soldiers , seized powder and supplies , built fortifications of cotton bales , if nothing else came to hand . When the news of the battle of New Orleans came to the seat of government it was almost too bewildering for belief . The British veterans of the Peninsular war , whose march wherever they had landed had heretofore seemed a holiday parade , were repulsed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , while that of the Americans was but thirteen . By a single stroke the national self-respect was restored ; and Henry Clay , at Paris , said , " Now I can go to England without mortification . " All these things must be taken into a& , count in estimating what Dr. Von Holst calls " the reign of Andrew Jackson . " // After this climax of military success he was for a time employed on frontier service , again went to Florida to fight Englishmen and Spaniards , practically conquering that region in a few months , but this time with an overwhelming force . Already his impetuosity had proved to have a troublesome side to it ; he had violated neutral territory , had hung two Indians without justification , and had put to death , with no authority , two Englishmen , Ambrister and Arbuthnot . These irregularities did not harm him in the judgment of his admirers ; they seemed in the line of his character , and helped more than they hurt him . In the winter of 1823-4 he was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field as a candidate for the Presidency , with two things to aid him-his own immense popularity and a friend . This friend was one William B. Lewis , a man in whom all the skillful arts of the modern wire-puller seemed to be born full-grown . There was at that time ( 1824 ) no real division in parties . The Federalists had been effectually put down , and every man who aspired to office claimed to be Democratic-Republican . Nominations were irregularly made , sometimes by a Congressional caucus , sometimes by State Legislatures . Tennessee , and afterward Pennsylvania , nominated Jackson . When it came to the vote , he proved to be by all odds the popular candidate . Professor W. G. Sumner , counting up the vote of the people , finds 155,800 votes for Jackson , 105,300 for Adams , 44,200 for Crawford , 46,000 for Clay . Even with this strong popular vote before it , the House of Representatives , balloting by States , elected on the first trial John Quincy Adams . Seldom in our history has the cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been dashed away again . Yet nothing is surer in a republic than a certain swing of the pendulum , afterward , in favor of any candidate to whom a special injustice has been done , and in the case of a popular favorite like Jackson this might have been foreseen to be irresistible . His election four years later was almost a foregone conclusion , but , as if to make it wholly sure , there came up the rumor of a " corrupt bargain " between the successful candidate and Mr. Clay , whose forces had indeed joined with those of Mr. Adams to make a majority . For General Jackson there could be i*othing more fortunate . The mere ghost of a corrupt bargain is worth many thousand votes to the lucky man who conjures up the ghost . When it came the turn of the Adams party to be defeated , in 1828 , they attributed this result partly to the depravity of the human heart , partly to the tricks of Jackson , and partly to the unfortunate temperament of Mr. Adams . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and says it was just what any one might have foreseen . Ezekiel Webster , writing from New Hampshire , laid the result chiefly on the candidate , whom everybody disliked , and who would persist in leaving his bitter opponents in office . The people , lie said , " always supported his cause from a cold sense of duty , and not from any liking of the man . We soon satisfy ourselves , " lie added , " that we have discharged our duty to the cause of any man when we do not entertain for him one personal kind feeling , nor can not , unless we disembowal ourselves , like a trussed turkey , of all that is human within us . " There is indeed , no doubt that Mr. Adams helped on his own defeat , both by his defects , and by what would now be considered his virtues . The trouble , however , lay further back . Ezekiel Webster thought that " if there had been at the head of affairs a man of popular character , like Mr. Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our natures , instinct , and fixed fate to dislike , the result would have been different . " But we can now see that all this would really have made no difference at all . Had Mr. Adams been personally the most attractive of men , instead of being a conscientious iceberg , the same result would have followed , the people would have felt that Jackson 's turn had come , and the demand for the " old ticket " would have been irresistible . Accordingly , the next election , that of 1828 , was easily settled . Jackson had 178 electoral votes ; Adams but 83-more than two to one . Adams had not an electoral vote south of the Potomac or west of the Alleghanies , though Daniel Webster , writing to Jeremiah Mason , had predicted that he would carry six Western and Southern States . In Georgia no Adams ticket was even nominated , he being there unpopular for one of his best acts  --  the protection of the Cherokees . On the other hand , but one Jackson elector was chosen from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority . This was in the Maine district that included Bowdoin College , and I have heard from an old friend of mine the tale how he , being then a student at Bowdoin , tolled the college bell at midnight to express the shame of the students , although the elector thus chosen ( Judge Preble ) was the own uncle of this volunteer sexton . It would have required many college bells to announce the general wrath of New England , which was not diminished by the fact that Mr. Calhoun , another Southerner , was chosen Vice-President over Richard Rush . To be sure , Mr. Calhoun had filled the same office under John Quincy Adams , but then there was a Northern man for President . For the first time the lines seemed distinctly drawn for the coming sectional antagonism . But even this important fact was really quite subordinate , for the time being , in men 's minds . The opposition to Jackson , like his popularity , was personal . It was not a mere party matter . The older statesmen distrusted him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Jefferson in 1818 if it would not be well to give Jackson the embassy to Russia , Jefferson utterly disapproved it . " He would breed you a quarrel , " he said , " before he had been there a month . " At a later period Jefferson said to Daniel Webster : " I feel much alarmed at the prospect of seeing General Jackson President . He is one of the most unfit men I know of for such a place . He has had very little respect for laws or constitutions , and is , in fact , an able military chief . His passions are terrible . When I was President of the Senate he was a Senator , and lie could never speak on account of the rashness of his feelings . I have seen him attempt it repeatedly , and as often choke with rage . His passions are no doubt cooler now ; he has been much tried since I knew him ; but he is a dangerous man . " And dangerous indeed the public office-holders soon found him . As has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held office under Adams were already partisans of Jackson ; but the rest soon discovered that a changed policy had come in . Between March 4 , 1829 , and March 22 , 1830 , 491 postmasters and 230 other officers were removed , making , as it was thought , with their subordinates , at least two thousand changes . Mr. Sumner well points out that it is unfair to charge this , as we often do , solely upon Jackson . Crawford , as has already been seen , prepared the way for the practice ; it had been perfected in the local politics of New York and Pennsylvania . It was simply a disease which the nation must undergomust ultimately overthrow , indeed , unless overthrown by it ; but it will always be identified , by coincidence of time at least , with the Presidency of Andrew Jackson . If not the father of the evil , he will always stand in history as its godfather . It is a curious fact in political history that a public man is almost always , to a certain extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His opponents may exaggerate , they may distort , but the instinct of the people  --  or even of any large portion of the people-generally goes to the right point , and finds out the weak spot . Jackson was as vehemently attacked as Jefferson , and by the same class of people , but the points of the criticism were wholly different . Those who had habitually denounced Jefferson for being timid in action were equally hard on Jackson for brimming over with superfluous courage , and being ready to slap every one in the face . The discrimination of charges was just . A merely vague and blundering assailant would have been just as likely to call Jackson a coward and Jefferson a fire-eater , which would have been absurd . The summing up of the F*deralist William Sullivan , written in 1834 , was not so very far from the sober judgment of posterity . " Andrew Jackson .... is a sort of lusws reipublicce , held by no rules or laws , and who honestly believes his sycophants that lie was born to command . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but freed from the inconvenience of that gentleman 's constitutional timidity , and familiar with the sword , he has disclosed the real purpose of the American people in fighting the battles of the Revolution and establishing a national republic , viz. , that the will of Andrew Jackson shall be the law and only law of the republic . " Really General Jackson himself would not have so very much objected to this estimate could he have had patience to read it . He was singularly free from hypocrisy or concealment , was not much of a talker , and took very little trouble to invent fine names for what he did . But on another point where he was as sharply criticised he was very , vulnerable ; like // most ignorant and self-willed men , he was easily managed by those who understood him . Here again was an illustration of the discernment of even vehement enemies . Nobody charged Jefferson with being over-influenced by a set of inferior men , though all the opposition charged Jackson with it . The reason was that it was true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constant talk of what Webster called the " cabinet improper , " as distinct from the cabinet proper-what was known in popular phrase as the " kitchen cabinet . " Here again came in the felicity of Jack Downing 's portraiture . The familiarity with which this imaginary ally pulled off the President 's boots or wore his old clothes hardly surpassed the undignified attitudes popularly attributed to Swartwout and Hill and Van Buren . On the day of his inauguration the President was received in Washington with an ardor that might have turned a more modest head . On the day when the new administration began ( March 4 , 1829 ) , Daniel Webster wrote to his sister-in-law , with whom he had left his children that winter : " To-day we have had the inauguration . A monstrous crowd of people is in the city . I never saw anything like it before . Persons have come five hundred miles to see General Jackson , and they really seem to think that the country is rescued from some frightful dan " It is difficult now to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the charges of monarchical tendency made against John Adams had been renewed against his son  --  a renewal that seems absurd in case of a man so scrupulously republican that he would not use a seal ring , and so unambitious that he always sighed after the quieter walks of literature . Equally absurd was the charge of extravagance against a man who kept the White House in better order than his predecessor on less than half the appropriation - an economy wholly counterbalanced in some minds by the fact that he had put in a billiard table . But however all this may have been , the fact is certain that no President had yet entered the White House amid such choruses of delight ; nor did it happen again until Jackson 's pupil , Van Buren , yielded , amid equal popular enthusiam , to another military hero , Harrison . For the social . life of Washington th' President had one advantage which was altogether unexpected , and seemed difficult of explanation by anything in his earlier career . He had at his command the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , Daniel Webster had written to his brother : " General Jackson 's manners are better than those of any of the candidates . He is grave , mild , and reserved . My wife is for him decidedly . " And long after , when the President was to pass in review before those who were perhaps his most implacable opponents , the ladies of Boston , we have the testimony of the late Josiah Quincy , in his Figures from the Past , that the personal bearing of this obnoxious official was most unwillingly approved . Mr. Quincy was detailed by Governor Lincoln , on whose military staff he was , to attend President Jackson everywhere when visiting Boston in 1833 ; and this narrator testifies that , with every prejudice against Jackson , he found him essentially " a knightly personage-prejudiced , narrow , mistaken on many points , it might be , but vigorously a gentleman in his high sense of honor and in the natural straightforward courtesies which are easily distinguished from the veneer of policy . " Sitting erect on his horse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the streets a bearing of such dignity that staid old Bostonians who had refused even to look upon him from their windows would finally be coaxed into taking one peep , and would then hurriedly bring forward their little daughters to wave their handkerchiefs . He wrought , Mr. Quincy declares , " a mysterious charm upon old and young " ; showed , although in feeble health , a great consideration for others ; and was in private a really agreeable companion . It appears from these reminiscences that the President was not merely the cause of wit in others , but now and then appreciated it himself , and that he used to listen with delight to the reading of the " Jack Downing " letters , laughing heartily sometimes , and declaring : " The Vice-President must have written that . Depend upon it , Jack Downing is only Van Buren in masquerade . " It is a curious fact that the satirist is already the better remembered of the two , although Van Buren was in his day so powerful as to preside over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Little Magician. " // But whatever personal attractions of manner President Jackson may have had , he threw away his social leadership at Washington by a single act of what may have been misapplied chivalry . This act was what Mr. Morse has tersely called " the importation of Mrs. Eaton 's visiting list into the politics and government of the country . " It was the nearest approach yet made under our masculine political institutions to those eminent scandals which constitute the minor material of court historians in Europe . The heroine of the comedy , considered merely as Peggy O'Neil , daughter of a Washington innkeeper  --  or as Mrs. Timberlake , the wife of a naval purser who had committed suicide because of strong drinkmight have seemed more like a personage out of one of Fielding 's novels than as a feature in the history of an administration ; but when fate made her Mrs. Secretary Eaton she became one who could disturb cabinets and annihilate long friendships . It was not merely out of regard for her personal wrongs that all this took place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a little irregularity about President Jackson 's own marriage . He had espoused his wife after a supposed divorce from a previous husband ; and when the divorce really took place the ceremony had to be repeated . Moreover , as the divorce itself had originally been based on some scandal about Jackson , he was left in a state of violent sensitiveness on the whole matrimonial question . Mrs. Eaton had nothing in the world to do with all this , but she got the benefit of it . The mere fact that she to whom the President had good-naturedly nodded as Peggy O'Neil had been censured by his own officials , after she had become the wife of one of them , was enough to enrage him , and lie doubtless looked across the fire-place at the excellent Mrs. Jackson - a plain , estimable backwoodswoman , who sat smoking her corn-cob pipe in the opposite corner-and swore to himself , and very probably aloud , that Peggy O'Neil should be sustained . For once lie overestimated his powers . He had conquered Indian tribes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington society were too much for him . Every member of his cabinet expressed the utmost approval of his position , but they said with one accord that those matters must be left to their wives . Mrs. Donelson , his own niecethat is , the wife of his nephew , and the lady who received company for him at the White House-would not receive Mrs. Eaton , and was sent back to Tennessee . Mrs. Calhoun , the wife of the Vice-President , took the same attitude , and ruined thereby her husband 's political prospects , Mr. Calhoun being utterly superseded in the President 's good graces by Mr. Van Buren , who , being a widower , could pay attention to the offending fair one without let or hinderance . Through his influence Baron Krudener , the Russian Minister* and Mr. Vaughan , the British Minister , both bachelors , gave entertainments at which " Bellona , " as the newspapers afterward called the lady , from her influence in creating strife , was present . It did no good ; every dance in which she stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Washington letter-writer , " instantly dissolved into its original elements , " and though she was placed at the head of the supper table , every lady present ignored her very existence . Thus the amenities of Van Buren were as powerless as the ancrer of Jackson ; but the astute Secretary won the President 's heart , and with it that of his whole immediate circle-cabinet proper and cabinet improper . It was one of the things that turned the scale between Calhoun and Van Buren , putting the New York " magician " in line for the Presidential succession ; and in this way Peggy O'Neil had an appreciable influence on the political history of the nation . It was fortunate that she did not also lead to foreign embroilments , for the wife of the Dutch Minister once refused to sit next to her at a public entertainment , upon which the President threatened to demand the Minister 's rec'all . All this time Jackson himself remained utterly free from scandal , nor did his enemies commonly charge him with anything beyond ill-timed quixotism . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recalls Charles Churchill 's couplet : " Women , who 've oft as sovereigns graced the land , But never governed well at second-hand . " The two acts with which the administration of President Jackson will be lon - est identified are his dealings with South Carolina in respect to nullification , and his long warfare with the United States Bank . The first brought the New England States back to him , and the second // took them away again . He perhaps won rather more applause than he merited by the one act , and more condemnation than was just for the other . Let us first consider the matter of nullification . When various Southern States-Georgia at first , not South Carolina , taking the lead-had quarrelled with the tariff of 1828 , and openly threatened to set it aside , they evidently hoped for the co-operation of the President ; or at least for that silent acquiescence he had shown when Georgia had been almost equally turbulent on the Indian question , and lie would not interfere , as his predecessor had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole South was therefore startled when he gave at a banquet on Jefferson 's birthday ( April 13 , 1830 ) a toast that now seems commonplace- " The Federal Union ; it must be preserved . " But this was not all ; when the time came he took vigorous , if not altogether consistent , steps to preserve it . When , in November , 1832 , South Carolina for the first time officially voted that certain tariff acts were null and void in that State , the gauntlet of defiance was fairly thrown down , and Jackson took it up . He sent General Scott to take command at Charleston , with troops near by , and two gun-boats at hand ; he issued a dignified proclamation , written by Livingston ( December 10 , 1832 ) , which pronounced the act of South Carolina contradictory to the Constitution , unauthorized by it , and destructive of its aims . So far , so good ; but unfortunately the President had , the week before ( December 4 , 1832 ) , sent a tariff message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It goes far to dissolve the UaiQn into its original elements , and is in substance a complete surrender into the hands of the nullifiers of South Carolina . " Then came Mr. Clay*s compromise tariff of 1833 , following in part the line indicated by this message , and achieving , as Mr. Calhoun said , a victory for nullification-leaving the matter a drawn game , at any rate . The action of Jackson thus accompanied settled nothing ; it was like valiantly ordering a burglar out of your house with a pistol , and adding the suggestion that he will find a portion of the family silver on the hall table , ready packed for his use , as he goes out . Nevertheless , the burglar was gone for the moment , and the President had the credit of it . He had already been re-elected by an overwhelming majority in November , 1832 , receiving 219 electoral votes , and Clay 49 , while Floyd had the 11 votes of South Carolina ( which still chose electors by its Legislature - a practice now abandoned ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chosen Vice-President , being nominated in place of Calhoun by the Democratic National Convention , which now for the first time came into operation . The President was now at his high-water mark of popularity-always a dangerous time for a public man . His vehement nature accepted his re-election as a proof that he was right in everything , and he grew more self - confident than ever . More imperiously than ever , lie ordered about friends and opponents , and his friends repaid it by guiding his affairs , unconsciously to himself . Meantime he was encountering another enemy of greater power , because more silent , than Southern nullification , and he was drifting on to his final contest with the United States Baiik . Sydney Smith says that every Englishman feels him self able , without instruction , to drive a pony - chaise , conduct a small farm , and edit a newspaper ? The average American assumes , in addition to all this , that he is competent to nianage a bank . President Jackson claimed for himself in this respect no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in possession of power . A man so ignorant that a member of his own family , according to Mr. Trist , used to say that the General did not believe the world was round , might easily convince himself that he knew all about banking . As he had besides all this very keen observation and great intuitive judgment of character , he was probably right in his point of attack . There is little doubt that the bank of the United States , under Nicholas Biddle , concentrated in itself an enormous power ; and it spent in four years , by confession of its directors , $58,000 in what they called self - defense ' ' against politicians . When on July 10 , 1832 , General Jackson , in a message supposed to have been inspired by Amos Kendall , vetoed the bill renewing the charter of the bank , he performed an act of courage , taking counsel with his instincts . But when in the year following he performed the act known as the " removal of the deposits , " or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // longer deposited in the National Bank and its twenty-five branches , but in a variety of State banks instead , then he took counsel of his ignorance . The act originally creating the bank had , indeed , given the Secretary of the Treasury authority to remove these deposits at any time , lie afterward giving to Congress his reasons . The President had in vain urged Congress to order the removal ; that body declined . He had in vain urged the Secretary of the Treasury to remove them , and on his refusing , had displaced the official himself . The President at last found a Secretary of the Treasury ( Roger B. Taney ) to order the removal , or rather cessation , of deposits . The consequence , immediate or remote , was an immense galvanizing into existence of State banks , and ultimately a vast increase of paper money . The Sub-Treasury system had not then been thought of ; there was no proper place of deposit for the public funds ; their possession was a direct stimulus to speculation ; and the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation of 1835 and 1836 and the business collapse of 1837 were due to the fact not merely that Andrew Jackson brought all his violent and persistent will to bear against the United States Bank , but that when he got the power into his own hands he did not know what to do with it . Not one of his biographers-hardly even a bigoted admirer , so far as I know-now claims that his course in this respect was anything but a mistake . " No monster bank , " says Professor W. G. Sumner , " under the most malicious management , could have produced as much havoc , either political or financial , as this system produced while it lasted . " If the bank was , as is now generally admitted , a dangerous institution , Jackson was in the right to resist it ; he was right even in disregarding the enormous flood of petitions that poured in to its support . But to oppose a daiigerous bank does not necessarily make one an expert in banking . The utmost that can be said in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great power of the institution he overthrew , and that if he had let it alone the final result might have been as bad . Two new States were added to the Union in President Jackson 's time-Arkansas ( 1836 ) and Michigan ( 1837 ) . The population of the United States in 1830 had risen to nearly thirteen millions ( 12,866,020 ) . There was no foreign war during his administration , although one with France was barely averted , and no domestic contest except the second Seminole war against the Florida Indians  --  a contest in which these combatants held their ground so well , under the half-breed chief Osceola , that he himself was only captured by the violation of a flag of truce , and that even to this day , as the Indian Commissioners tell us , some three hundred of the tribe remain in Florida . The war being equally carried on against fugitive slaves called Maroons , who had intermarried with the Indians , did something to prepare the public mind for a new agitation which was to remould American political parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be remembered that the very air began to be filled in Jackson 's time with rumors of insurrections and uprisings in different parts of the world . The French revolution of the Three Days had roused all the American people to sympathy , and called forth especial enthusiasm in such cities as Baltimore , Richmond , and Charleston . The Polish revolution had excited universal interest , and John Randolph had said , " The Greeks are at your doors . " All these things were being discussed at every dinner table , and the debates in Virginia as to the necessity of restricting the growing intelligence of the slaves had added to the agitation . In the session of 1829-30 a bill had passed the Virginia Assembly by one majority , and had failed in the Senate , prohibiting slaves from being taught to read or write ; and the next year it had passed almost unanimous ly . There had been , about the same time , alarms of insurrection in North Carolina , so that a party of slaves were attacked and killed by the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been imprisoned on the Eastern Shore ; alarms in Louisiana , so that re-enforcemeuts of troops had been ordered to Baton Rouge ; and a traveller had written even from Richmond , Virginia , on the 12th of February , that there were constant fears of insurrections and special patrols . Then came the insurrection of Nat Turner in Virginia-an uprising described niinutely by myself elsewhere ; the remarkable inflammatory pamphlet called " Walker 's Appeal , " by a Northern colored man-a piece of writing surpassed in lurid power by nothing in the literature of the // French Revolution ; and , more potent than either or both of these , the appearance of the first number of the Liberator in Boston . When Garrison wrote , " I am in earnest , I will not equivocate , I will not excuse , I will not retreat a single inch , and I will be heard , " Andrew Jackson for once met a will firmer than his own , because more steadfast , and moved by a lofticr purpose . Thenceforth , for nearly half a century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great antislavery contest . The administration of Jackson will thus be most remarkable , after all , not because of any triumph of his will , but because of something that arose in spite of it-an agitation so far opposed to his wishes , in fact , that he wished for the passage of a law excluding antislavery publications from the mails . It was an agita tion destined to draw new lines , establish new standards , and create new reputations ; and it is to be remembered that the Democratic President did not abhor it more , on the one side , than did his fiercest Federalist opponents on the other . The Federalist William Sullivan , at the close of his Familiar Letters on Public Characters , afterexhausting language to depict the outrages committed by President Jackson , points out as equally objectionable the rising antislavery movement , and predicts that , if it has its full course , " even an Andrew Jackson may be a blessing . " But of the wholly new series of events which were to date from that agitation neither Sullivan nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers may well close , for the present , with the dawn of that great agitation .
