txt We are not able to say how far the Central Labor Union is a body fairly representative of the organized workingmen of the . city , but if , as its action and title seem to imply , it is really made up of delegates chosen from the various trades unions , its members deserve a good deal of watching on the part of their constituents . The adoption by the Central Union on Sunday , after debate , of resolutions condemning Judge BARRETT in unmeasured terms , and with him the jury and the prosecuting attorneys who were engaged in the trial of the boycotters of THEISS is a long step in the wrong direction . The addition to these resolutions of another directed against EHRET , the brewer , because of his part in the Theiss matter is still worse . The ground of the resolutions first referred to is that the juries were not made up of the " peers " of the accused ; that the Judge was " servile , " and that the trial guaranteed by the Constitution was not afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple fact that , being summoned as ' a witness , he testified to the fact that THEISS paid $1,000 to the prisoners under threat , while he was himself menaced with a boycott if he did not foreclose a mortgage held by him on THEISS 'S property unless THEISS yielded to the boycotters . Thero never was a clearer case of violation of the rights insured to every citizen by our Constitution and oar laws than the Theiss boycott . It was not so contemptible as the boycott against Mrs. LANDGRAF , for instance , because THEISS was in a position to protect himself to a greater degree , and because his business was one which the public would see suppressed with less indignation than that of an honest baker . But it was in every essential regard absolutely unlawful , and the law had to be and ought to be enforced . The jurors were carefully selected from a large panel , and in two of the cases at least were not objected to by the prisoners ' counsel , while two of the accused dispensed with a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said against the jurors , except that they were not acknowledged boycotters . They could not very well belong to the class to which the prisoners belonged , because the latter were not citizens , and their " peers " could not lawfully serve on a jury . Nor in fairness could they even be workingmen , unless they professed to disapprove of the crime charged upon the accused . If employers were accused of a conspiracy to deprive workingmen of their lawful rights the law would not allow on the jury employers who avowed the belief that the workingmen had no lawful rights , and that they could be robbed at pleasure by employers . The most serious feature of the Central Labor Union 's defense and advocacy of the boycott is the injury it must surely bring upon honest and industrious men in the trades unions . The course of the Central Union must result in one of two ways , unless its constituents repudiate it . Either it must involve the laboring men in vain and costly resistance to the law , for which they will be directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boycott in defiance of the law , in which case there will be a general withdrawal of capital from the employment of labor , a , corresponding decrease in the amount of wages paid , and consequent suffering among wage earners . And back of this lies the fact that no class can receive so much Injury from the weakening of the force of law and . order as the - Wage workers . They are , in fact , entirely dependent upon it . Men of property can preserve or transfer their possessions , even if at a loss , when they are menaced , but men whose sole possessions are their strength and skill can only have the use of them wider the orderly protection of the law . What they lose in one day or one week is lost forever . It can not be saved up . This vital fact should be remembered by every workingman when leaders like the crazy BLISSERT address him in favor of the unlawful , unfair , un-American , and disastrous policy of the boycott .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
