txt A decision of great importance to operators on the Board of Trade was rendered to-day by Judge Moran in the Circuit Court in the case of Foote against Pierce , Assignee of S. G. Hooker &; Co. , grain commission dealers , giving judgment for Foote for $7,285 on a note and interest , growing out of a grain gambling transaction on the Board of Trade . The scope and meaning of the statute against grain gambling are elaborately construed and made applicable to middlemen or commission dealers . The substance and effect is to holdibrokers to the same responsibility under the statute that the principals are held . Judge Moran said in conclusion : " The argument is that Hooker &; Co. acted merely as the agent of Foote in dealing on the board , and the persons with whom they made the deals and to whom the differences were paid by them were the winners of Foote 's money , and that the notes were turned over by Foote in repayment of the money which Hooker &; Co. paid to the winners for Foote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To do so would seem to me to give this statute an evasive construction , to interpret it so as to defeat in a great measure the object the Legislature intended to accomplish . Hooker &; Co. agree to gamble in grain for Foote . It does not appear from the evidence that Foote knew with what persons they made the deals , nor does:it appear that the persons with whom they made the deals ever knew or heard of Foote in the transaction . They were constrained by the honqr that obtains in such gambling transactions to pay the loss when the deals went against them if the transaction was a gambling one , and if a legitimate one they were bound legally and in business honor to pay it . In either case the commission man stands as principal to the party with whom or for whom he deals . This is the practical result of the method in which business is done . As to Foote , standing in place of whom they had paid differences , they require Foote to pay to them the money lost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in obedience to their demand these notes are paid over to them . To say they are not winners within the intent of this law is to say that grain gambling can be largely carried on without the discouragement intended by this section of the statute . The broker who receives the money of broker his principal in payment of losses made by the roker in gambling for the principal in grain is practically and to all intents and purposes the winner of such money . In such transactions the loser knows no other winner than the commission man . To make the law effective , all the penalties it denounces against such gambling must be made applicable to those who most actively engage in its violation . Without the aid of commission men like Hooker &; Co. , parties like this plaintiff would have had little opportunity to indulge in forbidden speculation . The commission men furnish the access to the board ; they open the door of temptation , and , by agreements such as made in this case , they encourage and actually induce a violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
