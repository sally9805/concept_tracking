txt THE FAILURE OF THE STRIKE . Some thousands of persons have been fined about $15 each for their folly in quitting work in order to maintain the dignity and secure the " recognition " of sundry persons calling themselves an Executive Committee . each of whom has doubtless received much more than that sum during the same time . This is all there was of the strike . It is quite idle to say that it was a strike for higher pay or shorter hours . It was not a strike for the drivers and conductors , but for MAGEE and his associates . The companies did . not reject any propositions made by their mon . They simply refused to entertain any propositions made by MAGEE and other extraneous persons who professed to represent their men , but with whom they had never made any agreement and in respect of whom they had no responsibility . The question whether what MAGEE and his companions proposed was just or - unjust did not arise at all . That is why the strikers have received no sympathy from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to take their side in any disputes that may arise . At the best , drivers and conductors of horse cars are not overpaid or too well treated , and proof that a company had violated its agreement with its men , and that they had quit work on that account , would have availed them much . Nothing of that kind has been proved , or even stated . The charges of bad faith against the companies have been too loose and general to bear or to warrant an investigation . ' It might be hoped that the penalty of eight days ' pay which has been exacted of these foolish men should secure them against a repetition of the conduct for which it is paid . Experience does not justify this hope . Unscrupulous adventurers seem to find little difficulty in leading into a hopeless strike those with whom the remembrance of an unsuccessful strike is still recent . The strike two or three years ago on the Third-avenue road must be well remembered by the men who took part in it , and many off whom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fine of eight days ' pay should be severe enough to administer a lesson to men whose wages are very close to the limit of subsistence . The Third-avenue strike threw the men engaged in it out of employment , not for days only , but fmr weeks , and months , and they were beaten in the end . Yet here has been the same kind . of " Executive Committee " conducting the same kind of straggle for " recognition , " with the help of nearly all the drivers and conductors in the city , and , with the active assent of a majority of them . It is a great mistake to suppose that public sympathy either is or ought to be on the side of strikers , merely as strikes . A man engaged in driving a horse car presents to the well-constituted mind a much more dignified spectacle than a man who stands on ' the sidewalk and throws paving stones at him . He is " showing his power " in a much more useful and commendable way . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his broad and butter except for valid reasons , nor quit work when he has no money and no prospect of other work , except under the pressure of an intolerable grievance , But the recent history of strikes it this . ' country , especially of strikes of unskilled labor , has been such as to overthrow this presumption . It has beer shown that hundreds and thousands oi men will abandon their means of living upon the most frivolous protextp . But the strikers who have now returned to work , upon conditions imposed by their employers and not . by themselves , might at least make up their minds in future not , to take counsel , with regard to striking , of anybody who has not the same interest as themselves in the result . If only the companies and the men in their employ had been concerned , it , is not likely that this strike would . have taken place . If outsiders are permitted to manage affairs for the men there is no security that another equally silly strike may not be proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
