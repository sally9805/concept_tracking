Iv .. ECONOMICALLY , Pennsylvania is a most interesting State , and would well repay a comprehensive examination of the conditions of labor in its varied industries . For this , however , I can not now spare time . In three preceding papers , I have given some idea of the conditions of labor in the largest of the industries for which Pennsylvania is noted-that of coal mining . From this the conditions of labor generally may be inferred , and the futility of that policy of " protection to labor " for which Pennsylvania has been so clamorous may be readily seen . The condition of the coal miners in the much protected State of Pennsylvania is bad enough . Yet , bad as it is , it is evident that it would be worse , but for the miners ' associations , backed by strikes or the fear of strikes . Whomsoever the tariff may protect , it does not protect the coal miners . As for iron mining , another petted industry of Pennsylvania , the protection of which , directly and indirectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country , wages are in that even below those of coal mining , for the reason that there is less combination among the miners . In Lehigh , in Northampton , and in Berks , according to the reports made by employers to the Bureau of Industrial Statistics , iron miners are working for 70 cents a day , and engineers for 80 and 90 cents . In other counties the rate rises to 75 cents , 80 cents , 90 cents , and $1.00 per day for miners , and correspondingly for engineers . But these wages , it must always be remembered , do not secure steady work . Of the returns I have noted , the highest number of days worked in the year is 265  --  a case in which 70 cents per day was paid miners . In another case , in which miners ' wages are placed at 70 cents , the number of days worked is 190 . Carnegie Brothers &amp; Co. , who have been " protected " into enormous fortunes // by the tariff , and who are really generous men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But should " Triumphant Democracy " point to this with pride , it should add that , iu the year for which these returns are given , the Carnegie miners had only 119 days work . The highest wages paid in irou mining appear to be in the Cornwall mine , in Lebanon County , where miners get $1.40 per day . These exceptional high wages seem to be attributable to the liberality of the managing owner . This Cornwall iron mine is worth a passing notice . It is in Lebanon County , a few miles from the city of that name , and is the richest deposit of iron ore yet known in the world , with the possible exception of one in Mexico . It is not a mine in the common understanding of the word , but rather a quarry . Three great hills of very nearly pure magnetic iron rise from the plain , and all that has to be done is to dig it out and carry it away . Since 1740 , and up to the 1st of January of this year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; but thirty or forty million tons are estimated to yet remain above water-level , and below that borings have shown the deposit to reach to a depth of at least 300 feet . This great store of the richest iron ore is believed by most of the people of those parts-for old ideas yet prevail about Lebanonto have been made by God . But in some way that they do not readily explain , it seems to be held that the right to dispose of it for all future time inhered , about 1680 , in one James Stuart , since dead , who was awhile King of England , and then retired into France . This James Stuart , from whom , although he is now nearly two centuries dead , all rights to the use of this part of the world are still supposed to come , made a grant of a considerable part of the planet he was so soon to leave to John , Thomas , and William Penn , their heirs or assigns , forever . Of this piece of the planet the Penns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that lay below the surface , to one Joseph Turner , by whom it was in turn assigned , in 1732 , to a William Alden . In 1737 this Alden , in consideration of ? 135 ( probably depreciated currency ) , to him in hand paid , assigned the right to the exclusive and perpetual use and enjoyment of three hundred acres , containing the iron hills , to one Peter Grubb . Between 1786 and 1789 one Robert Coleman bought various interests from the heirs of Grubb , until he had secured five-sixths , // leaving to one of the Grubbs a one-sixth interest . These interests have descended through the Grubb and Coleman families until , at the present time , there are four Colemans , two male and two female , who own fifteen ninety-sixths each , and a Coleman or two and several Grubbs who own the rest in smaller interests . The value of the deposit may be inferred from the fact that the reservation made by one of the original Grubbs , in his sale to the first Coleman , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which now attaches to . the Robesonia furnace , sold , some years since , for $700,000 , being bought in by the Colemans . The ore is now taken out under one management , by the use of air-drills and dynamite , and the proceeds are divided between the various interests . One of the two male Colemans lives in Paris , where he prefers to enjoy the enormous income which comes to him , without work on his part , by virtue of the grant of James II . The other , Robert II . Coleman , a young man of enterprise and liberality , lives at Lebanon , and is the manager of the estate . In all but the title , he is an American nobleman of the best English type . His interest in the iron deposit , rich as it is , is only a part of his estate . He has some 20,000 acres of the finest Pennsylvania limestone land , kept in the best cultivation , under competent , superintendents , and stocked with the very finest of choice cattle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading systems , a splendid mansion , and nobody knows what else besides . On the day of his majority , besides the real and other personal property , his guardian turned over to him $1,200 ,  - -  000 . In the neighborhood of Lebanon , the Colemans are believed to be the richest family in the country , the Yanderbilts and Astors not excepted . Young Robert builds churches in Lebanon and Cornwall , makes good turnpikes of the slack out of his furnaces ; plants them with shade trees ; has given largely to the college in which he was educated , ; is kindly and liberal to his tenants and employees ; entertains societies when they visit Lebanon , and seems to be , in short , the kind of a young prince that would delight the heart of a Tennyson  --  a genial , upright , and free-handed lord of land and master of men , who takes the world as he finds it , but doubtless often wonders in his heart at the superstitious reverence for James II. , which renders this wonderful iron quarry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully the private property of the Colemans and Grubbs as though they made it . // But all this aside , what , in the face of such a deposit of ore as this , becomes of the contention that a heavy duty on iron and iron ore is necessary to prevent the suppression of the Pennsylvania iron industry by the competition of the pauper-made iron of Europe ? The Cornwall deposit was worked for years and years before we had any duty upon iron and iron ore . It could not , of course , be worked if the Colemans and Grubbs chose to shut it up , as the eccentric proprietor of an iron mine near Edinburgh chose to do with his mine some years since , answering all remonstrance as to the destruction of a considerable industry , and the starving out of a considerable population , with the laconic observation that the ore in the ground might stay there , since it would " no eat anything . " But with the permission of the Colemans and Grubbs , this rich iron deposit could be worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if the " pauper " iron ore producers of Europe would work for nothing and pay their own board . It came out in legal proceedings , taken in about 1859 , to determine whether the right reserved to as much ore as would feed one furnace , applied only to such a furnace as was in use in the last century , or to a modern furnace , that the cost of mining ore in Cornwall was only 16 cents per ton , which , to say nothing of the superior quality of the ore , is much less than the transportation of European pauper ore would cost . It is not probable that a single additional ton of iron ore has been mined at Cornwall because of our tariff . If the tariff has had any effect it has simply been to increase the profits of the Cornwall owners , and not in the slightest degree to add to the wages which they must pay their men . If , as a matter of fact , they do pay more than current wages , it is because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than current wages , but his business is unprotected by the tariff . So , too , it is with the duty on coal . This duty is a grievous burden upon the industries of California , the Gulf States , and some parts of New England , and gives protection to the monopolies which largely neutralize the natural advantages of Philadelphia as a manufacturing city by compelling her people to pay a considerably higher price for coal than the same coal is sold for shipment at the Philadelphia wharves . But its benefits , such as there are , certainly do not go either to the miners or to their immediate employers , the coal operators . If any one at all is benefited , it is the owners of coal land and the monopolists of // transportation . The competition which would force the wages of miners down to a point that would give them only a bare subsistence is only held in check by miners ' combinations and strikesbitter struggles of endurance , not always entirely bloodless , which entail almost as much loss and suffering as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , are fought with such tenacity that I find in the recent number of the Coal Trade Journal a statement , made as a cool matter of business information , that at the conclusion of a recent strike , near Reynoldsville , the miners were in such a reduced condition , physically , for want of proper food , that they could not perform a day 's work for some time . No matter what the profits of coal mining may be , it is evident that , under what we call the free competition of labor and capital , they can not , for any length of time , go either to miners or to operators , but must at length be taken up in the royalties paid for the privilege of mining coal and in the increased values of coal lands . The royalty now paid in the anthracite district ranges from 40 to 60 cents per ton , and will probably average 50 cents , and where mines are worked by the owners , as is the case with the mines owned by the great railroad companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , to the credit of the capital invested in the purchase of the mines ; so that the effect of the duty , whatever it may be , is not to benefit the miner or the operator , who is his immediate employer , but merely to increase the charge which the owner of coal land can make for the use of the natural agent of production  --  the coal imbedded in the soil by the slow processes of nature , ages and ages before men came upon the earth , and which would exist with all its usefulness unimpaired whether the owner could get any royalty or not , or whether there was any individual owner or not . These principles , clear enough in regard to the mining industries of Pennsylvania , apply to all her other industries . The plausible pretension that the somewhat higher rate of wages in this country than in Europe necessitates the building of a tariff wall around our coasts , and along the imaginary line which separates us from Canada and Mexico , is utterly negatived by the difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Johnstown-great sticklers , by the bye , in Washington lobbies and before Congressional Committees for the " protection of American labor " - having crushed out the Labor Associations , // pay wages some 20 per cent . less than are paid in Pittsbnrgh . There is quite as great a difference between the wages paid in glassmaking in the Eastern and in the Western part of the State . Cigarmakers in Reading get two or three dollars less per thousand than cigarmakers in Philadelphia and New York , and so it is with other industries . If a difference in wages necessitates the putting up of a tariff , then , instead of being in common with the rest of the country shut in by one tariff line along our National boundary , Pennsylvania ought to be intersected by tariff lines , in all directions , with their attending collectors , searchers , and seizers . There is , of course , in Pennsylvania what may be called a general level of wages , just as there is a general level of water in the ocean , even when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , toward which both depression and elevation tend to return ; but this fact of itself proves the futility of the tariff in raising wages . Even in Pennsylvania the largest single industry is the agricultural , and the industries for which any pretense of protection by the tariff can be made , amount to only a small part of the total industries , since manifestly not only the agricultural industry , but all such industries as building , railroading , etc. , can not be protected by any tariff . The level of wages in any particular occupation , can , therefore , no matter how high the tariff , only be raised above the general level by conditions , natural or artificial , which in them check the competition for employment . And the same law must apply to the profits of capital , so that it is impossible for any ar*iount of protection either to permanently increase wages , or to augment the profits of the manufacturer or operator , except as the element of monopoly enters in and fences off from home competition those whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , where no monopoly exists , wages and profits in the protected industries of Pennsylvania are not higher , but , I am inclined to think , rather lower than in the unprotected industries . Protection has been for years a superstition in Pennsylvania , taught to the rising generation as an article of faith , and propagated by all the organs of public opinion and education . I think , however , its real and permanent strength lies in the fact , perceived by the working classes , that the competition of men whose only hope of gaining a livelihood is in getting the wages of some employer , does tend to cut down their earnings ; and in the habit // of thought that arises from this state of things , of regarding work as something that must be furnished or provided for the laborer , instead of something which has its natural origin in human wants . At the present time , at least , I think the working men of Pennsylvania realize pretty generally that the tariff which excludes the productions of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and that they are anything but satisfied with their share of " protection . " But , as railroads that may make half a dozen twentyfold millionaires , at the expense of the general public , will command the vote of the needy laborer whose only hope is to get the poor pay of a few days hard work , so , in spite of all its manifest absurdities and iniquities , does the idea of tariff protection commend itself to the masses of workingmen , because to them it seems to have at least the merit of " keeping work in the country "  --  or " preventing foreigners from doing our work . " For my part , I do not think it makes more than a temporary difference to the workingmen of Pennsylvania , or any other State , whether there is a protective tariff , a revenue tariff , or no tariff at all . A tariff only operates upon the movement of goods , not upon the movement of labor , and its effect is similar to that of a range of mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making more difficult the transportation of commodities . And with or without any of these things to affect the transportation of goods from other countries , the conditions of labor in Pennsylvania are such as must beget a tendency of wages towards the minimum which gives the mere laborer only a bare existence-a tendency which can only here and there be held somewhat in check by custom , labor combinations , boycotts , and strikes . The existence of the tramp , the pauper , the needy workman vainly seeking the opportunity to sell the only thing he has to sell , his power of labor , is proof of the existence and force of this tendency , against which the strongest labor combinations struggle like swimmers against a current . But the belief in protection , by drawing the attention of men away from the real case of this tendency , and hounding them upon a false scent , diverts them from the only road by which the rights of labor can be secured . If Pennsylvania could be cut off from all the rest of mankind by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania protectionists might lead them // devoutly to wish  --  the natural growth of population and the progress of material development must constantly tend to force the wages of the ihere laborer towards the point of bare existence . For though labor is the appointed means by which all our material needs must be satisfied  --  the active factor in the production of all wealth-labor is of itself absolutely helpless . To make labor of any use it must have something to impress itself upon-must , in short , be able to avail itself of land . In any community , therefore , in which the land is the private property of some of the people , the other people , who have nothing but the ordinary power to labor , provided they get food , clothing , and shelter , become helpless , and must compete with each other for permission from the first class to live and to work . The influence of competition with each other among these mere laborers must tend to force them to give up to the owners of land all that their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in life . The whole philosophy of the labor question may be seen as clearly upon a Pennsylvania coal estate as amid the primitive industrial conditions which obtain in Connemara or Skye . From zenith to nadir , that part of the globe embraced in one of these coal estates is the exclusive property of one man , or corporation . Other men can only live there on his sufferance , and can only go to work at his pleasure and on terms agreed to with him . Having an absolute power over the natural means of livelihood , he has thus a power over the laborers , which is only modified by their power of moving away and of making combinations among themselves by which he can be compelled to treat with them in the aggregate , and can be put to loss or inconvenience by their refusal to work . In the complex industries of the great city which lies at the other extreme of the industrial scale , where much labor is devoted to exchanging , to the rendering of services , and to the working up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoirs , the relation between land and labor is not so obvious , especially as there are many other monopolies of various kinds that share with the monopoly of land the earnings which the helplessness of labor compels it to yield up . But the same relation still obtains . No matter where he exists , man is a land aninial , who can only live on and from land , and all of whose production is but the changing in place or form of what he finds // already in existence on the superficies of the globe . The mere laborer , unless he has such special skill or ability as make a peculiar demand for his services , is as helpless in the one place as the other , and every avenue of employment is crowded with applicants who , disinherited of their natural right to employ themselves , must compete with each other for the wages of an employer . The treatment of land as the private property of individuals  --  the attaching to the element from which all must live of the same exclusive rights of ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to reason , so repugnant to all moral perceptions , that it has only come to be accepted through a long course of fraud and usurpation , in which habit has dulled the sense of natural right . Secure possession by the individual user , is , of course , necessary to the use of land , since it is requisite to secure the right of property in improvements . The manifest way to combine the individual right to improvements and products with the common right to the land itself , is that the holder of valuable land-i. e. , land which is worth a premiumshould pay a fair rent to the community in return for the special privilege granted him . This , in a rude way , was accomplished by the feudal system , and the road by which private property in land was instituted among English-speaking people was , by the shaking off their rents on the part of the feudal tenants , and the resort to general taxation for the public revenues , originally obtained from land . Conversely , the best and easiest way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country , is to abolish all other taxation , and by a tax on land values to take for public use that value which attaches to land by reason of the growth of the community , and to make it unprofitable for any one to hold land he is not putting to use . It is instructive to observe how , in Pennsylvania as in England , the interests of the wealthy classes who have been most influential in directing public opinion and making laws , have led to the taxing of everything rather than land values . The State of Pennsylvania not only attempts to tax mortgages , money at interest and notes , but also capital loaned or invested in any other State . Great tracts of mineral land are taxed at such nominal rates that they can be easily withheld from use , while the miner , taxed indirectly in all other ways , must also pay a tax upon his occupation , which // is rated according to the county at from $150 to $300 , the millionaire coal owner being rated on his occupation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special privilege leads to general corruption , might nowhere be better illustrated than in ring-ridden Pennsylvania , with its railroad octopus , its coal combination , its Standard Oil Company , and its pig-iron " statesmen . " And Pennsylvania may well feel hopeless of cutting away the monopolistic creepers which have enmeshed the Keystone State . " Take a pass ! " said a Pennsylvanian to me , as I manifested some mild surprise at the statement that , although railroad passes are prohibited by the Constitution , Governor Pattison was the only man in the State who would not take a pass- " Take a pass ! What is the use of fighting a corporation that rules the State . I would take a whole freight train , if they would give it to me . " But though it may be useless to hack away at the branches , the tree of monopoly will fall if the ax be laid at its root . And private property in land , it will be found on examination , is the root of lesser monopolies . HENRY GEORGE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
