txt The courts have decided that a seat in the New-York Stock Exchange is property . This property . like all other , has a marketable value , and is sold and transferred . Why , then , by " due process of law , " can not a seat be attached and sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of a debt due one by a member ? An answer will much oblige me and no doubt many others . A. T. D. A. T. D. 's question is answered , so far as this State is concerned , by an article in THE TIMES of July 17 , chronicling a decision of the Court of Appeals that a Receiver of an insolvent broker may sell the broker 's seat and use the money in paying debts , and that the buyer at the Receiver 's sale will be entitled to the privileges of the seat , subject to the rules of the association or exchange governing transfers of membership , whatever they may be . In a very technical sense of the words this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The general reader whose attention has been called to recent investigations of the doings of Receivers will easily understand that the " law " does not use Receiverships , for ho has observed that Receivers are rather a lawless class of persons . He may not be so ready to credit that they are the children of " equity , " and were first created to aid Chancellors in settling estates according to good conscience . They are now used in the courts in obedience to special statutes which adopted them:from former equity practice . Mr. Cox said , in Congress , when Gen. Butler declared that he was not made by the newspaper press , but GOD had made him , " Well , the gentleman does not look nor act much like his father . " So we may say of Receivers , that there is not much family resemblance between them and their mother  --  the benign , wise , and liberal Goddess of Equity I But there is no denying that they are her progeny . The remedy employed by the " law " for enforcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property of the delinquent , sell it , and pay the money to the creditor . This can not well be applied to a broker 's seat , because there is nothing tangible which the officer can seize , remove , and sell . The " seat " is not a chair of state , but a personal privilege , a right to attend the meetings of the board and buy and sell . The Sheriff who should attempt to enter a New-York City board-room asking to be shown to Mr. Blank 's seat , for the purpose of carrying it to the auction-room to be sold , would probably experience a most " halcyon and vociferous " reception . The " boys " would throng around him to " give him points . " Not only his stock but his hat and coat and other investments would be " sold short , " and he would be lucky if the fun did not end with his being ran out of the jovial precinct a " straddle " of some extemporized rail , and his getting a " put " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Police at his " option . " His experiences would far exceed in discomfort those of the forgetful member who annually saunters into the room wearing a white bat after the Summer , as recognized among brokers , is past . A seat can not well be attached or sold on execution . But the question of chief interest is whether creditors can realize the value of the seat ; not whether the lawyer should proceed at law or in equity . In this State a broker 's seat is regarded not as a mere personal privilege like a man 's right to practice law or medicine , or his claim to services of wife or children , but as a valuable though intangible property , like a patent or copywright , which may be sold through the medium of a Receiver , who will be aided in completing the transfer by an order of court imprisoning for contempt the former owner or any official of the association , if he refuses to give his signature to the necessary papers . The Receiver is thus enabled to realize the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho will , if a high-minded and honorable man , give credit for the sum thus obtained as satisfying part of his fees , instead of embezzling it outright , but this is further than we wish to pursue the topic .
