AND UNTIL within the last two or three years the name of Tourgenieff probably stood , to more than nine out of ten readers in the western world , for the whole of Russian literature . Moreover , such acquaintance as they had with him was attained through the French , and hardly went beyond the novel " Smoke . " Known in this way , Tourgenieff did not reveal to his readers either a new art or a new world . He had become so saturated with the French literary method , and his own eastern thought had been so modified by his long residence under western civilization , that his race characteristics were obscured . But he introduced the French to the study of the Russian language . They h*ive found other and greater minds in that literature , and it is chiefly they who have made the names of half a dozen of the great Russian writers familiar to us all . Not only this , but direct translations from the originals into English and German , as well as into French , are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation and understanding as translation will allow . // This extension of our knowledge of the contents of Russian literature has revealed a school of literary art that is new . The form of the Russian novel is something that has no counterpart in other languages . We have in fact been obliged to widen the definition of the novel in order to admit it at all into that category , so careless is it of the canons that have hitherto governed that form of art . It is a form that succeeds in maintaining interest without a plot , that creates characters but no heroes , that is realistic but not trivial , that is poetic but not false . Tolstoi 's novels have deservedly been the most read of all the recently discovered Russian fictions , both because they are the most perfect exemplars of the school , and because they are in all respects very remarkable books . I think too that the per . sonal character of the writer , as revealed by his later vagaries in the domains of ethics and theology , have added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no need of such curiosity to carry the reader from the Sebastopol sketches to the perusal of " The Cosacks , " or to lead one from his " War and Peace " to his " Anna Karenina . " These last two are his great books , those by which he will be ranked , and those in which all his traits will be found in their best development . There are two sides to the interest they excite , that due to their literary art , and that arising from the philosophy of U e which they express . " War and Peace " is a book of twelve hundred closely printed pages , in the French translation , and is a wide and varied , and at the same time minute picture of the Russia of the first quarter of this century , into which , together with the potrayal of society and of individual characters , is woven a whole philosophy of history . " Anna Karenina " is a story of the present into which has entered a theory of social ethics . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written with a moral or philosophical purpose . Edmond de Goncourt says in one of his prefaces that the novel of the future is to be " a report written by an artist . " That form of the novel has never been so nearly attained as in these two books by Tolstoi . They are clearly and unmistakably of the realistic school . // And by realistic in the literary sense , as applied to a school of fiction , is not meant simply an adherence to truth in the minuthe of description , or the maintainance of probability in the scheme or the incidents of the story , but the recognition and expression of a necessity of relation between condition and character , between character and motive , between motive and action , and then between action and consequence . It is the portrayal of life , in its hidden springs and in its outward manifestation , as it is ; not as it ought to be , nor as it would be pleasant to have it , but as it must be . This is the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a not very enlivening class of English novelists , and in their hands it has become an offense to many delicate and artistic souls . But it has been the fault of the followers of the doctrine , and not of the doctrine itself . Tolstoi has shown us that this method , which has reason and logic for its foundation , can be followed by the genius that creates beauty , that it is not bound to lives that are low and mean , or to characters that are commonplace , or to facts that can have interest only to the student of social pathology in its most revolting subjects . Tolstoi 's literary life began with the transcript of his own experience in the siege of Sebastopol . He tells here the story of what he doubtless went through , as well as what he saw . This he follows with another chapter of autobiographical interest , " The Cosacks , " where he first exercises his power of miunte and yet artistic description . His first work of observation and reflection is the " War and Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Russian life of the time moves before us , from the moujik and the common soldier to the emperor and his court . The characters are both fictitious and historical , but they are all real . The story can not be said to have a plot . The characters are introduced , or introduce themselves , and we learn from their words and their actions who and what they are . We are not told that they are weak or strong , or that they are good or bad , but we know that they are the one or the other from what they do , and what they say . They live on through the book , influencing one another , and undergoing the influence of the public events that are moving about them , and // our interest lies in seeing how these influences work . The book is long , and it is slow . The action drags , or seems to drag , in many places . This northern Homer distinctly nods . But it is the slow work of miniature painting . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of Baizac , it is of such firm and closely woven texture , that none of it can be skipped without the loss of something that is necessary to the understanding of what follows . This book has been likened to a panorama , but a panorama painted by IMleissonier . It is not , however , to the exterior of life alone that this minute care is given . Wonderful as is the detail and accuracy of Tolstoi 's observation of outward things , just as is his selection of that which tells the most of what he wishes to convey , it is not this which makes his book the living picture that it is . It is rather his clear , quick , analytic perception and understanding of the play of passion , of the subtlest motives , and of the slightest disturbances of the individual conscience . He is not satisfied till he has traced an action back to its last motive , and has drawn this motive forth . It is quite impossible to analyze this novel . The crowd of characters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them grow from youth to adolescence , and the steadily changing relations into which the fortunes of life bring them , make any connected sketch of what in another book would be called the plot , misleading , because it must be inadequate . The reader is taken through the court circles of the two capitals of St. Petersburg and Moscow , into the country house of the retired noble , and onto the farm of the peasant . He attends the festival of the middle class family , he sits at the council board of the emperor in the palace and on the field , and participates in battles and inano*uvres . Nothing , by the way , is more striking than the impression of a battle that Tolstoi 's method gives . It is not a show piece , but it is the corner of the great transaction which is all that any one engaged in the action ever can see . It is not Victor Hugo 's Waterloo , but rather that of Steudhal . And all the time we are with the same people , whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more real and interesting to us , and the purport of whose lives we are more and more clearly understanding . // " Anna Karenina " is a book of more regular form . It has a beginning , an artistic progress of interest in a single , definite chain of actions and events , it has a distinct denouement , it has its contrasting sub-plot . In a word , it is more like the western novel , it is more dramatic . It is the story of a wife 's unfaithfulness , and of its consequences to herself and to those dependent upon her for their happiness or their training . Anna Karenina , a delicate , highly organized creatnre , who is nnsympathetically mated ,  --  evidently by a marictge de convenance ,  --  is seized with a passion for a young prince , a man in every way worthy and fit for her , except that he is not her hnsband . The book is the story of how this relation , that was an offence to both God and man , worked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woman 's case to snicide , and in that of the man to a military death not far removed from it . It is not the picture of a common passion . The error of these two sonis is ennobled by all the qualities that make love the power that it is . They are devoted and faithfnl to one another . If the woman has given np her reputation and her home for her lover , he sacrifices as cheerfully for her the position to which he is by birth entitled , and the consideration of his friends and family . There is nothing sordid or degrading in their attachment save its sin . But that it is sin , and that it must work out its proper fruit , are written with the iron pen of holy truth in every chapter and line . The abstract hero of the book is Duty , as opposed to unrestrained passion . But this is not all of it . The secondary thread of the story is a charming idyl of honest love , not romantic , but tine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family and of the home . The character of Levine , the speculator on the things of life , the nneasy doubter , this hoper for the better times for all men , this natural optimist , the lover of love , whom the sober facts of life make a pessimist , probably speaks for the author as much as any of his characters . The writer evidently loves him , sympathizes with him , and wishes that life could be easier for him . Side by side with the story of the destruction of two lives , runs this tale of the love , the wooing , the marriage , and the domestic life of Levine , the phases of his development , his optimism , his struggle with the // obscure problems that life presents to him , his resulting pessimism , and his ultimate believing fatalism . Levine is the typical young modern Russian . It is the production of such characters in their novels that has led a French critic to say of the Russian writers that it seems as if the wind that wanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these men something of its own eternal to and fro . But it is in the research of the motives of such a heart , in portraying the play of the experiences of life on such a soul , in tracing its to last source every emotion and every act , that Tolstoi is at his best . He had curiously enough taken his own life , and those of his own family for his first ground in this kind of examination , and he shows in the single volume of memoires that he has published , covering infancy , childhood and youth , the same subtlety of analysis , the same impersonality of narration , the same truth of observation , and logic of deduction which are the great qualities of his more serious works . It is said by those who are acquainted with the Russian language that Tolstoi has neglected style , save so far as to make it an uncolored transcript of what he wishes to describe , or a clear statement of his thought . This is something that can not be judged of from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are qualities in his prose that arise out of his selection of object and of epithet , out of his skill in juxtaposition , out of what is suggested rather than said , which are very close to some high qualities of style . This is perhaps more noticeable in his earlier work , " The Cossacks , " and his sketches of Sebastopol . In the latter he describes in one chapter the death of one officer from the bursting of a shell at the storming of a redoubt , and the wounding of another , and after a passage of rapid analysis of sensations and emotions in a supreme situation , ending in the one case in darkness , and in the other in agony , he pauses a moment at the close of the fight , and then writes this para-graph : " Hundreds of bodies , stained with fresh blood , which two hours before were moved by a many different wills , by hopes that were high , or by hopes that were mean , were couched with stiffened limbs in the flowered and dewy valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the level earth of the chapel of the dead in Sebastopol . Hundreds of men , with curses or prayers on their parched lips , lay writhing and groaning , some abandoned among the dead bodies of that flowered valley , others stretched on beds or litters , or the drenched floors of the ambulances . Yet , as on days before , the sky grew bright with the gleams of the aurora above Mount Sapoun , the glittering stars began to fade , a pale mist rose over the dull and murmuring sea . The purple dawn kissed the east ; long flames of cloud stretched across the clear blue horizon ; and , as on days before , rose the magnificent and puissant torch of day , promising joy , and love , and happiness to the re-animated earth . " I think that it is plain , even through the dim medium of a translation from a translation , that the man who could write in that way had the capacities of style , though he may not have cared to use them . Tolstoi calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in this world fifty-five years . IL have lived thirty-five years a nihilist in the proper sense of the word ; not a socialist and revolutionist , according to the twisted meaning that custom has given the word ; but nihilist , that is to say , void of all faith . " His novels all tell this story , without his own somewhat late avowal . There is nothing beyond the observed phenomena of this life in any of them . But ,  --   --  and here is the point at which Tolstoi separates from the school of realists in European literature , who also profess to be without faith ,  - -  he sees that faith exists , and he sees and acknowledges the craving necessity for faith that human nature discloses . He sees and describes phenomena of human life that we would call spiritual , though he may have another name for them . One of the most interesting things in these novels is the apparent attraction that the supreme moments of birth and death have for the author . His death scenes are numerous , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Without the hint of a religious motive , with perfectly calm conviction that death is extinction , and with an utter absence of sentimentalism , he has made his varying death scenes of the most marked impressiveness , solemnity , and dignity . Whether it be the old nobleman , dying in the midst of a family quarreling over his succession , or the peasant who slips out of the toil and burden , unseen , from the top of his // March , stove in the crowded hovel , or the soldier overtaken in the charge , or the bnsy magistrate who watches approaching dissolution in the progress of a slow and fatal malady , we are made to feel that we are witnesses of the great mystery , that behind the moujiks who come to bear away the body , enters a presence that is supreme . And not *only this , but he has observed and records over and over again , the occurrence of a time of spiritual and moral enlightenment preceding the great change . No matter where death comes , whether on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident or from disease , with Tolstoi the inquiring soul always then sees light and has peace . The novel of a Russian nihilist is not the place where one would naturally look for the portrayal of a death-bed repentance , but in a short sketch , called " The Death of Ivan Iliitch , " we have all the elements of death-bed repentance , save the hope of a future life . Ivan Iliitch is a man of the world , a successful and able magistrate , who in consequence Ot a fall is attacked by an obscure and lingering malady , the progress and termination of which form the subject of the sketch . It is not an attractive subject , but it is a fascinating piece of work . Ivan fights against the idea that he , Ivan , must die . The truth that all men are mortal had been a general proposition that he had never applied to himself . But the fact forces itself to recognition in his mind , and then , in the midst of a family feigning that he will recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be better , this man wrestles with the awful question , why ? He has been a happy and a fortunate man , rich , respected , with wife and children , and an acknowledged position , and in this period of struggle he begins to review his life , when lo , everything appears to him in far different colors . Away Thick in his childhood he sees that which would brighten life , could it come back again , but when he comes to the Ivan of to-day all his joys and pleasures change into something mean and nulL He sees that when he thought that he was mounting the heights of life , it was only so much life slipping away from him , and now here he is at the end , dying . it is impossible that life be such a // mean thing , such a nothing , but if it is , why die ? and why have at death the horrible consciousness of this fact ? Why ? And no answer comes . If the idea occurs to him that he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect correctness of his life , and dismisses the thought . And thus he lies for days , and no answer comes to the eternal " why ? " The struggle goes on in its agony , and the soul goes down to the edge of the grave in darkness . But the idea which he had put aside , that his life may not have been what it ought to have been , comes and takes up its abode with him . Like the idea of death , it forces acceptance . It is now the justification of this past life that tortures him and holds him back . " Suddenly a force strikes him in the breast , and he is plunged into the darkness , and there , in the depths , there is , as it were , light He opens his eyes and sees his son and his wife , the tears streaming down their cheeks . And at once he sees clearly that the problem that had tortured him was cleared up in all its aspects . I pity them , I would see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself from my suffering . How good and simple is this ! , . . . . And where is death ? ' He sought for his accustomed fear of death , and did not find it . Where is death ? What is death ? ' He no longer feared , for there was no more death . In place of death there was light . " A similar experience is told of other characters . These things show that Tolstoi 's absence of faith is not of the kind that blinds him to the existence of emotions that he can not share , or of phenomena that he can not understand . While also Tolstoi is a pessimist , in the sense that he entertains no hope of a better career for man , no better condition for him either on this earth , or in any other life , he recognizes the recuperative powers of the human soul nuder suffering and disappointuient . If any one thing can be said to be the theme of " War and Peace , " it is this , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severest moral and emotional shocks , especially where these are caused by the action of others , and are not the consequences of sin . In this book no less than three of the principal characters think , at some time in the course of the narrative , that life has told its whole story to them , that their capacity for action and for enjoyment has gone forever , and this in consequence of some overwhelming sorrow or disappointment which has come upon them . But with each // of the three the gentle and soothing hand of time is seen acting to restore vitality and tone to their emotional nature , to string again the cords of motive that they , in the shock , had thought were loosed forever , to revive in them a sense of the reality of the common aims and purposes of life . This is not done suddenly , but gently , as nature acts , and the quiet transformation of the soul is watched and traced from stage to stage with the precision of science . The effect on the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soberness , and a convincing accuracy of analysis . Nor is there in the telling of it the slightest touch of bitterness . These young souls assert their right to happiness , and stretch out toward it as naturally as the bare branches bud and flower in the spring , and under the same beneficent influence . They have a simple , complete and innocent forgetfulness of past sufferings and loves . Their souls can not always wear mourning for that which is dead , and as a loyal and thorough observer Tolstoi sees no reason to mourn over this fact . We are always changing , and even after the severest trials we do regain our love for life . It has been said of Tolstoi that this stream of vitality , which reappears after brief exhaustion , to sustain us either till death , or till that definitive settlement of our existence which is called happiness , such as this world gives it , is one of the postulates of his conception of the universe . In his treatment of love and passion Tolstoi contents himself with showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love as coming unbidden , neither he nor the subject knowing whence or how . Two souls touch , and there passes the fatal spark , and then they can no more escape from its consequences than from their own lives . It is the novelist 's work to trace its course , to follow its growth and note its manifestations , but not to explain it . Why two beings act thus on one another is beyond explanation . That they do is one of the facts of life that it is his to describe , but not to account for . As a consequence there is found in his novels none of the conventional jargon that has been supposed to lead to or to be occasioned by this passion . But this is only the application of his customary sobriety to this , as to all subjects . Everything is treated seriously . There is little or nothing of the lightness of touch that gives so great a charm // to a class of works far below his in thoughtfulness . Neither are there many smiles in Tolstoi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , though now and then they show a capacity for painting an entire situation in a word or a phrase that is a close approach to wit . But nothing in the characters or the incidents makes us laugh . The weight of feeling is too heavy for smiles ; nor does it find its expression in tears . I can not say that pathos does not have its part in these works , but it arises entirely from the facts , not from the way in which they are told . The sketch of the death of Ivan Iliitch , from which I have quoted , is , as a whole , one of the most pathetic things that I know in literature , and there are in it passages of profound pitifulness , but it would be only in rereading it that the voice would tremble or the lip quiver . Such qualities take books out of the list of light reading . These are , indeed , not light reading , but they are of the most absorbing interest . Not at the first , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strangeness of the scene , the slowness of the movement , the crowd of actors , the multiplicity of relations developed , and the minuteness of detail , all call for more than the ordinary patience of a novel reader . But the patience is well rewarded . If life is worth portraying at all , it is worth care and pains in the effort , and if the picture is true , it is worth care and patience to examine it . In the end we find ourselves face to face with living men and women of a type that we are glad to know , under conditions that appeal to our sympathy , drawn with a justice and skill that , as we go on and become better and better acquainted with them , rouse our highest admiration , and as the last pages of the long story are read , we feel that we are parting with those with whom we lived and felt , and whom we shall always remember . They are our acquaintances . And , after reading , experience and observation continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have reflected humanity and life to us , as we have read , and humanity and life reflect the books back to us , and keep them alive in our memories . Tolstoi has now abandoned the writing of novels , and has devoted himself to the composition of elaborate works in exposition of his recent supposed discoveries in religion and // ethics . He has passed from nihilism to quietism , and from describing life to an endeavor to direct it . This change is only that through which he had before , in the logic of his analysis , taken all three of his principal male characters . And they all find their deliverer in one of the lowly and despised of the race . Prince , and farmer , and magistrate , have all found what to them has been a satisfactory solution of their problems in the teachings of a peasant whom the chance of life has thrown in their way , just as in these later years the teachings of a peasant have changed the author 's life . This is the typical personage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is enlightened on the dark things of life , to whom has been revealed that which is hidden from the wise and prudent . His name is legion . He is a soldier on the terrible march from Moscow as a prisoner of the French , he is the oldest of the serfs that work the farm , he is the drudge of the sick chamber , but he is always the same , a simple contented fatalist , to whom what is must be , to whom what shall be is of no concern . It is his example , and his words that bring back these questioning and anxious souls , one after the other , to the haven of uncomplaining submission to that which is ordered . This transformation of the soul is recorded only of men . Such of Tolstoi 's women as have thoughts , as distinguished from feelings , have faith . They are distinctly and sincerely religious , as religion seems to be understood in the Greek church . Some of them are charming , all of them are natural , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , nor is the happiness that their love brings entirely without alloy , nor is the distress that their indifference or their unfaithfulness causes without a possible cure . They are li'ke all the elements of life in this psychological imagination , parts of a succession or chain of influences and events , not separate forces . In all these books , life is conceived of as a movement more or less rhythmical , more or less rapid or agitated , but with a steady trend onward in a broad and sweeping stream . So these stories are not the history of crises , they are not pictures of eddies in the current , but photographs across the whole spreading flood of the river , taken with lenses of wide range and great precision . // It is not necessary to dwell on the national traits of this writer , except to say that they are purely Russian . Though he has traveled , Tolstoi has never lived under any but Russian influences , and shows in his books nothing but Russian tendencies . He is familiar with nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Russian life . There is no cosmopolitanism in him , as there is in Tourgenieti . His books do not carry us over the half of Europe , or introduce us to the society of any but the northern capitals . But it can not be said that this is any restriction to an imagination of this kind . Humanity is his province , life is his study , and with his acuteness of observation and precision of analysis any country would furnish him material . He does not find the life to which he was born too narrow a field for his work , for the same reason that Shakespeare did not find England too small for his genius . His subject is everywhere , for he loves life . This , I think , is his distinguishing trait , that human life in itself , as something from which he may stand apart , as something that he can observe , has an all-absorbing interest to him , both as a philosopher and as an artist . His great care has been to see things as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. TYLER .
