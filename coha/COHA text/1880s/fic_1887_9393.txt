" One touch of Nature makes the whole world Kin , That all , with one consent , praise new-born gawds Though they are made and moulded of things past ; And give to dust , that is a little gilt , More laud than gilt o'er-dusted . " INTRODUCTORY NOTE In the early days of 1895 I read , in the pages of the Pall Mall Magazine , my old friend Bret Harte 's story , " The Judgment of Bolinas Plain . " Seeing in it great dramatic possibilities , I asked him if he would permit me to adapt it to the stage . He readily assented , but , at the same time , said that he thought I was mistaken in my view of his work , and that my hours would be wasted . When I sent him my scenario , however , he at once saw how his slender story , by the introduction of other characters , and the putting into action things only hinted at or suggested in the narrative , might be made into a three-act play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to write it with me . To this , of course , I more than readily agreed , and many happy days were spent over the completion of " Sue . " It was accepted by Mr Charles Frohman , and presented by him in New York on 15th September 1896 . Neither of us could be there , and on the eve of the production of the play Bret Harte grew very anxious as to its fete . On the following day I was able to reassure him with a comforting telegram from the management , which ran as follows :  --  " Well received . Fine acting . Press praises . " Having exhausted her time in New York , " Sue " was taken on a prolonged tour throughout the States , and everywhere Miss Annie Russell made a triumph as Bret Harte 's tenderly drawn little heroine of Bolinas Plain . On 10th June 1898 Mr Frohman produced the play in London . On that occasion Bret Harte and I were present , and it was pleasant to witness his delight at the perfect way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece was acted , and how every line seemed to go home to the hearts of a crowded and distinguished audience . Its artistic success in its English home was immediately secured ; and Miss Annie Russell , by the force , humour , and pathos of her acting , moved the house in no ordinary way . The subsequent judgment of the critics was as gratifying to her as it was to the writers of the play . How much they owed to her charming personality , and her deft handling of a difficult part they freely and gratefully acknowledged . During his last weeks of ill-health , Bret Harte expressed a wish that " Sue " should be published in book form ; and we were in correspondence on the subject when the terrible news of his shockingly sudden death came to me . I am glad to be able to fulfil my dear friend 's desire . Save to say that Mr Frohman assures me that " Sue " will soon be seen and heard again in stage-land , I have nothing to add . T.

Main text ACT I Scene :  --  Interior of Lone Farm See Stage Plan ( Silas Prescott discovered . He has pencil and paper in his hand , and is feebly trying to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures ; seated at L. of table C. His hat is on table . ) Yes  --  it might do . There 's a livin ' to be got out of it ; and the Lord wot knows everything knows that Silas Prescott is bound to get a livin ' out o ' suthin ' . But that gal 's in the way . That 's the hitch of it . My daughter  --  Sue Prescott 's in the way . If she 'd marry and settle down , I might get on and settle down , but Providence seems to have ordained that children stand in their parents ' ways even unto the third and fourth generation . ( Sound of footsteps heard without . ) ( Listening . ) Now , what 's that ? Just my luck ! Someone 's comin ' round interferin ' with my calculations ! ( Rises and goes to chair L. , which should be close against wing and might be unobserved by anyone entering door in flat R.C. ) ( Enter Parson Davies R.C. , carrying stick and travelling bag . Sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . ) Parson Parson Davies ( Looking off . ) That 's a new face in Bolinas Plain and at Ira Beasley 's farm too . ( Looking at flowers in window seat . ) And flowers too  --  in Ira Beasley 's room ! I am not the only guest here ! Well , so much the better for this lonely bachelor of Lone Farm  --  and so much the better for me . ( Sits meditatively at table . ) ( During this speech Silas watches him attentively , trying to listen and yet pretending to scribble in book when Parson seems to turn in his direction . ) When I accepted Ira 's invitation I thought it might afford me a chance to watch that scoundrel Jim Wynd , who has been haunting this vicinity  --  as criminals haunt the scenes of their crimes ; and since he ruined my daughter 's home at Lowville , he has been seen in company with my young friends the Olbers , too , and this is my chance to warn them also . With other guests here , Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look after that scoundrel without betraying my poor child 's secret . ( Rises , but suddenly discovers Silas , who puts book before his face and pretends to be writing . ) I beg your pardon . ( Taking off hat . ) I thought I was alone . Is Ira Beasley around ? Silas Silas Prescott Ay  --  he 's around . I reckon he 'll be here any minute . Parson Parson Davies Let me see  --  you 're his guest , are you not ? Silas Silas Prescott Well , I reckon we 've been stayin ' here a matter of three or four days . Parson Parson Davies We ? Silas Silas Prescott Me and my daughter . Parson Parson Davies ( At window . ) That pretty girl , as pretty as those flowers she has gathered ? Silas Silas Prescott Yes , that 's my daughter  --  that 's Sue Prescott . Parson Parson Davies ( In a surprised tone . ) Indeed ! Silas Silas Prescott Sartain ! Seems to me you 're thinking that as far as good looks goes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . ) Then you are both Ira 's guests , and so am I. We shall be friends , I hope . No one wants them more than poor Ira . Perhaps you are  --  relations ? Silas Silas Prescott No . Parson Parson Davies ( At table . ) Then I 'm wrong . He has got friends ? Silas Silas Prescott None that I knows of . Parson Parson Davies But you and your daughter are staying in his house ? Silas Silas Prescott Well , that ai n't always calculated to make folks friends . As fur as we 're concerned , it 's like this . Me and my wife and daughter come along here in our emigrant waggon , me calkilatin ' to put what cash I had got into land out Lowville way . Me and my wife could have made a go of it . She hed a good head for business , but now she 's gone I ai n't in it somehow . Parson Parson Davies Your wife has gone , do you say ? Silas Silas Prescott Yes ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return ticket . She died two weeks ago in that thar emigrant waggon . Parson Parson Davies ( Sympathetically . ) Dear me ! I 'm very sorry to hear it . Silas Silas Prescott Yes , I reckon it was n't what she 'd have chosen , either . It war n't too comfortable for her ; she grumbled considerable , and it caused a lot of unpleasantness with her fellow-passengers  --  not to speak of the day we took in hevin ' to pull up and plant her . ( Crosses L. ) Me and my daughter had had enough of that thar emigrant waggon when it pulled up afore this yer Lone Farm . Parson Parson Davies And Ira Beasley took you in ? ( Puts hat on table . ) Silas Silas Prescott Yes , Parson ; to make free with your language , " we was strangers and he took us in . " You are a parson , are n't you ? Parson Parson Davies Certainly . Silas Silas Prescott And it 's your business to give advice ? Parson Parson Davies To the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. and sits on table . ) Silas Silas Prescott And without pay ? Parson Parson Davies ( Laughing . ) Oh yes . Invariably without pay . Silas Silas Prescott Ah ! ( Sits . ) Now to me that 's where the parson gets the pull over the doctor , and , for the matter o ' that , the lawyer too . No fees is what draws the honest , hard-working man who takes a proper pride in himself ; and that 's why I allus feels like letting business in the way of the deserving parson . I always was of a religious turn of mind . Parson Parson Davies ( Quietly . ) What do you want me to tell you ? Silas Silas Prescott Why do you call Beasley , " poor " Beasley ? Parson Parson Davies ( Warmly . ) I call any man poor who lives the life he does  --  friendless and alone ; and I call him all the more poor because it is his own fault . Silas Silas Prescott If I 'm following of you correctly , Parson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind such is my desire  --  you do n't call Ira Beasley poor , except from a parson 's soul-convictin ' kind o ' way ? Parson Parson Davies From a worldly point of view a man might envy Ira Beasley . His well-stocked farm is his own ; he can not only earn an income , but can save for the rainy day , that must , sooner or later , overtake us all . But what is the good of all that if he does not take his hands to the fire of life and warm them ? Silas Silas Prescott Why , it 's mighty rough on the fire of life , Parson , and I reckon the collectin ' plates in your church is a good deal lighter for it . Now , who 's to light that thar fire for him ? Parson Parson Davies There 's no one could do it so well as a wife . Silas Silas Prescott ( Delighted , and rising . ) Darned if you have n't hit it , Parson . ( Crosses to C. ) If you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your fees . Beasley does want a wife , and I 'm thinkin ' of leavin ' my Sue with him . Parson Parson Davies ( In consternation . ) Your Sue ? ( Rises . ) Silas Silas Prescott My daughter . Parson Parson Davies That pretty girl ? ( Crosses to window . ) Silas Silas Prescott ( Leaning on table . ) Her prettiness against his land and stock . Parson Parson Davies ( In remonstrance . ) That pretty girl the wife of that unhappy , self-neglected man , Ira Beasley ? No ! no ! I meant a wife of his own age , and his own way of life . Silas Silas Prescott If he 'll have Sue , why not ? Would n't she be better off with him than with me ? Parson Parson Davies ( At door R.C. going off , and speaking with suppressed indignation . At table and taking hat . ) There , I believe you are right ! ( Crosses to door . ) Silas Silas Prescott Ai n't you goin ' to wait to see Beasley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a little fresh air . ( Exit Parson Davies R.C. ) Silas Silas Prescott ( C. ) Easily satisfied , parsons is ! If I could do with a little fresh air I could do with Sue , but nature 's made me want more than that . ( Taking bottle from pocket and drinking . ) Yes , there 's a livin ' to be got out of this if Sue was n't in the way , and I must see as Sue stops here . Beasley 's land and stocks seem safe . The Parson would n't tell me that if he did n't know it . That 's the best of a Parson . He 's bound to tell the truth to keep his job . I must see as Sue stops here . ( Sue without , laughing . ) Silas Silas Prescott That 's her , just playin ' with the stock agin  --  his stock too . Sue stops here . ( Calling . ) Sue ! O Sue ! ( Crosses L. ) Sue Sue ( Without . ) O dad ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas Silas Prescott Come here , will ye ? ( Crosses to L.C. ) ( Enter Sue R.C. , laughing , yet shyly . She holds behind her back a wisp of straw . ) Silas Silas Prescott Up to your tricks with the stock again ? Do you call that company manners , and you only company here ? Sue Sue I was only tryin ' to teach the brindled calf , and make him kneel afore me . ( C. ) Silas Silas Prescott ( L.C. ) Kneel afore ye ! ( Snatching the wisp of straw from her hand and throwing it down . ) And that 's your bait , is it ? You 'd a darned sight better make somebody else kneel afore ye ! ( Checking himself quickly . ) Look here , Sue  --  you 're altogether too frisky . You 're as bad as the calves you play with . Ai n't you never goin ' to grow up ? Sue Sue ( Laughing . ) And be a decent cow , dad ? And come home regularly and stand at the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some day . But it 's good fun to play with them now , dad , and Bos is just the sweetest calf you ever saw , for all he 's a little wild . You ought to have seen the chase we had yesterday from the far Spring , and Ira Beasley and the Parson just staring and looking on ! ( Swings her sun-bonnet by the strings . ) Silas Silas Prescott ( Sharply . ) And Ira saw you makin ' a sight of yourself ? Sue Sue ( Folding her apron demurely , yet with a half-childish , half-thoughtful coquetry . ) I reckon he did n't seem to think I was such an awful sight , dad . Silas Silas Prescott ( Correcting himself . ) I meant the Parson . Sue Sue Oh ( demurely. ) , you need n't mind about the Parson . ( Crosses to stool , laughing . ) Lord ! he 'd hardly time to look , for Bos ran between his legs and gave him plenty to think about ( Sits . ) Silas Silas Prescott And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're gettin ' too old for this sorter nonsense . Sue Sue ( Thoughtfully . ) Too old ? Why , I 've never seemed to have been young enough for it , dad . I 've never had a doll or anything to play with like other girls . Silas Silas Prescott ( C. ) Did n't you ? No doll ? Where 's your gratitude ? I suppose you did n't have our yaller dog all to yourself from St Jo here , and part of that nigger girl , till we had to sell her afore we entered the free settlements . What are ye talkin ' of ? And who gave you your mother 's hymn-book  --  and all her patent medicine bottles with the coloured labels ? There 's gratitude ! ( Crosses L. ) Go away . You 're makin ' me tired . ( Sits . ) Sue Sue And there 's nothing that moves on the Bolinas Plain but the wind and the dust , and so it 's a comfort to start up the calves and the colts and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at least real things and not shadows . ( Crosses up to window R. ) Silas Silas Prescott Real things , you bet , and they cost money . ( Aside . ) If she do n't cotton to Ira , she will to his stock . Sue Sue ( Looking dreamily through window over plain . ) When I 'm just sick of the dust-clouds that never turn into anything , and the wind that keeps on murmuring and never telling you anything , it 's real fun to have the calves and colts for company . Maybe it 's because they ai n't grown up , and are young like me . Silas Silas Prescott ( Aside . ) That 's mighty rough on Ira ! ( Aloud . ) There 's Mr Beasley  --  is n't he company ? Sue Sue ( Crosses to table , laughing . ) Fancy him chasing me ! Why he ca n't run a dozen yards without limping . Why , I 'm only a girl , and I can out-run and out-jump him . Are all single men like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they do n't care to run after tomboys . Sue Sue ( Simply . ) But I think Mr Beasley does n't mind racing after me sometimes . Silas Silas Prescott ( Aside . ) Oho ! ( Aloud . ) Then he does chase you sometimes ? ( Rises . ) Sue S ue ( Simply . ) Yes  --  but he never catches me . ( Crosses to C. ) Oh , it 's too funny ! Silas Silas Prescott ( Taking her hand with simulated playfulness . ) But girls need n't run so fast sometimes . Sue Sue ( In utter astonishment . ) Eh ? And get caught ? What 's the fun of that ? ( Crosses to R.C. ) Silas Silas Prescott ( Impatiently and aside . ) The girl 's a fool  --  or knows what she 's about . ( Aloud . ) Look here , Sue  --  should you like to have them colts and calves all for your own ? Sue Sue Of course I should ; but that 's not likely unless you bought ' em for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And me with hardly enough to struggle through life with ? No . It seems to me if you want ' em you can have ' em , but you 'll have to do the buying . Sue Sue ( C. ) But I 've got no money . Silas Silas Prescott Money ! Listen . Some folks kin buy without money . Sue Sue That 's nonsense ! What could I buy without money ? Silas Silas Prescott A husband !  --  who 's got money . Sue Sue ( Laughing . ) You know nothing about such things . Girls do n't buy husbands . ( Crosses to window . ) Silas Silas Prescott ( C. rather angrily . ) Now look here , Sue  --  I reckon it 's about time you rewarded me for all the lovin ' care I 've took of you in emigrant waggons , to say nothing of less expensive homes , and got settled . ( Goes to chair L. and sits . ) Sue Sue Settled ? ( Crosses to table C. ) Silas Silas Prescott Yes  --  to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she married you ? Silas Silas Prescott Settled for life . If she was n't dead she 'd tell you so . Sue Sue ( Crosses to L.C. after a little pause . ) Father , I do n't seem to keer to be married . Silas Silas Prescott Not keer to be married ? What  --  ai n't you a woman ? Not keer to he married ? Sue Sue ( Rather scornfully . ) I do n't believe any woman ever wanted to be married until she saw the man she 'd like to have for a husband . Silas Silas Prescott ( Angrily . ) Ah , you 're a high-toned miss , you are ! It 's lucky for you your mother did n't give herself such airs ! Sue Sue ( At table , with a sigh . ) Poor mother ! ( Then gaily . ) But I promised to draw poor Bossy some fresh water . ( Exit Sue R. ) Silas Silas Prescott ( Contemptuously . Rises . ) Why , it 's fresh water now ! Parsons live on fresh air ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on fresh water , and it 's only unfortunate men like me that wants other food and has to work to get it . ( At table . Drinks . ) Yes , there 's a right smart livin ' to be got out of it if it was n't for Sue . Good Lord ! what a regular buck-jumper she is ! What 's the use of me trying to be religious ( crosses L. ) when I 've got a double serpent 's tooth of a child like Sue . ( Sits . ) ( Enter Ira Beasley L. He is very shabbily dressed , untidy and slovenly in person and uncouth in manner . He is rather lame . He comes in awkwardly , and with an embarrassed and discontented expression . He looks round the room , and seeing only Silas , is making his may to go off R. when Silas speaks . ) Silas Silas Prescott ( Insinuatingly . ) Looking for anything ? Ira Ira Beasley No  --  ( awkwardly mumbling. )  --  only wondering where that cussed calf had got to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around vacantly. ) might know . ( Cautiously . ) You ai n't seen her ? Silas Silas Prescott Yes ; she 's just gone to draw some water . Ira Ira Beasley ( Crosses to door R. ) Oh yes  --  I see  --  of course  --  ( hesitatingly ) . Sila s Silas Prescott You 're going ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes . ( Awkwardly and going . ) Ye see , I 'd better ask her about that calf . Silas Silas Prescott ( Quietly . Rises . ) That calf 's in the barn . Come here , Ira . I want to talk with you . ( Ira approaches him awkwardly , discontentedly , and half-sullenly , glancing at window for Sue . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( C. ) Well ? Silas Silas Prescott ( L.C. ) I 'm thinking me and Sue must be moving on to-day . Ira Ira Beasley ( Eagerly . ) Why ? You know you 're both welcome here ? Silas Silas Prescott Maybe ; but a religious father like me owes a good-looking girl like my Sue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more society . There 's many a well-to-do young chap at Lowville just lying low to get a look at my Sue . Ira Ira Beasley ( Uneasily . ) Ah ! I was thinking that might be so . Silas Silas Prescott Yes ; and I must see her well married . That 's what 's due to a good-looking girl like my Sue ; and I 've got the right man in my eye for her . ( Musingly . ) He 's six foot three , twenty-three , as good-looking as his photograph , and making his eternal fortune . Ira Ira Beasley ( Distressed . ) Ah ! And no doubt she thinks all the world of him ? ( Sits on table . ) Silas Silas Prescott Sue ? Not much . She 's been too well brought up to think of any man until her father comes to her and says : " Sue , that 's the man that your father has chosen for you . Marry him , for better or worse ; me and the Parson gives you to each other  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " Ira Ira Beasley ( Crosses to window . ) And she 'd do it ? Silas Silas Prescott Oh yes , she 'd do it ; though maybe , being but a woman after all , she 'll be glad he 's twenty-three , six foot three , as good-looking as his photograph , and making his fortune . ( Crossing up C. , and taking hat . ) Yes ; as a religious man , I must do my duty by Sue , so I reckon this afternoon we 'll pack and go . ( Exit Silas Prescott R. C. ) Ira Ira Beasley ( At window , dazed . ) Goin ' away this afternoon ! Eh , but the place will seem cold and lonesome without her ! There she is now alongside the well , standing there like a picture , with her soft round arms , her little feet , and her pretty curly hair  --  and all ( hat on bench. ) the colts and calves canoodlin ' round her , just lovin ' her and admirin ' her . Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? Ah , I 'm more than that . Six foot three , is he ? Ah , I 'm less than that . As good-looking as his photograph , is he ? D  --  n his photograph ! Well , if ever I had mine took , perhaps I 'd catch him up there ; and as to his fortune  --  well  --  maybe I can lay over him there easy ! Darned if she is n't prettier  --  I must go to her ! ( Goes out quickly R. as if acting on a sudden and irresistible impulse . ) ( Enter Parson Davies R.C. ) Parson Parson Davies No Ira yet ? ( Crosses to C. back ) . I 've hunted all round and ca n't find him . It seems unnatural to think of a pure young girl mated to such a self-neglected man as Ira Beasley , and yet the poor fellow 's heart may be in the right place , and she might be better off in the quiet protection of this lonely spot than exposed to the gaudy glitter and feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) No , I fear such a marriage would be fatal . I 've seen enough of that with my own poor daughter . Would Ira really love her ? Would he know what love is ? No ; his coarseness only shocks her , and therein lies her safety . ( Rises . ) Poor Ira ! He 's hopeless  --  hopeless ! ( Crosses to window R. At window looking out . ) I wonder if I 'm wrong ? He 's with her now , paying her uncouth attentions . As I live , his plain face is lit up by a tenderness I never saw before ; even his timidity and shyness have softened his harsh ways . If he were only wise now he would  --  ( In half comic distress . ) Oh dear , dear ! No  --  not that ! He 's tried to snatch a kiss ! Ah  --  serves him right ! ( With satisfaction . ) The girl knows her value . ( With a little laugh . ) Well , he wo n't want to see me just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and Sue 's laugh heard without . ) ( Enter Ira R. , dripping with water , dazed and disconcerted . ) IraIra Beasley ( C. ) Now , what did that mean ? I only tried to kiss her , and she up and heaved a bucketful of water over me . I do n't know much about such doings , but I do n't believe that 's the reg'lar thing . ( Enter Sue R. , laughing . ) Sue Sue ( C. ) Goodness me !  --  what a sight you are ! I do believe you are wet through ! Ira Ira Beasley ( Rather sullenly , L.C. ) ' Tai n't your fault if I 'm not Sue Sue ( Throwing him her apron . ) My fault ? It was all your fault . There , dry yourself with that . Ira Ira Beasley ( Using the apron . ) There you go again ! Always making me think what a useful thing it is to have a young woman about the place ; and yet whenever I try to come near you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foot . ) What do you want to come near me for ? It makes me mad . Ira Ira Beasley Well ; but you ought to know as well as I do  --  it 's the reg'lar thing , ai n't it ? Sue Sue ( R.C. ) What 's the reg'lar thing ? I do n't know what you 're driving at , unless you want to drive me away . Ira Ira Beasley It 's your father wants you to go away . He 's talking of taking you away this afternoon , and ( awkwardly. ) that 's why  --  ( Crosses to R.C. , approaching her . ) Sue Sue ( Retreating . ) That 'll do  --  do n't . If I ca n't bear you near me when you 're dry , what must my feelings be now you 're wet ? ( Sits on stool . ) Do you mean to say Dad talks of taking me away from that little soft-nosed Bossy this afternoon ? Ira Ira Beasley ( With inspiration . ) Ah ! You would n't like to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , now ? Sue Sue ( Scornfully . ) No . I 'd miss them . And I believe they 'd miss me . Ira Ira Beasley ( R.C. ) And I 'd miss you too , Sue . Sue Sue I was n't thinking of you . ( With a little sigh . ) Poor Bossy ! Ira Ira Beasley But , Sue , if you 'd only stay here after your Dad 's gone , all the young stock , and for the matter of that all the old stock too , might be yours . Sue Sue Me stay on with you ? What for ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Awkwardly . ) Oh  --  well  --  for whatever 's the reg'lar thing . Sue Sue If I stayed , should I feed all the young things and do just as I liked with ' em ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes ; that 's light work . You 'd do all that  --  and I 'd do the heavy work . Sue Sue ( Musingly ) . And maybe I could live there in the barn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beasley ( Very awkwardly . ) I do n't know as that would be just the reg'lar thing . You see  --  ( Approaching her . ) Sue Sue ( Rising . ) That 'll do . This is all talk . I ai n't gone yet , and I 'll go and feed my Bossy while I can . ( Exit Sue R. , calling : " Bos  --  Bossy ! " ) Ira Ira Beasley ( C. , wiping his forehead with Sue 's apron . ) I wish to the Lord I know 'd what was the reg'lar thing . Who 'd have thought she 'd have served me like this ? ( Exit Ira mopping himself L. ) ( Enter Jim Wynd stealthily R.C. He looks cautiously round the room , and seeing he is alone , goes cautiously to window R. and looks out . ) Jim Jim Wynd There 's the mysterious little beauty of Lone Farm again  --  and alone now , eh ?

This will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has his hand on the latch of door R. , when Parson enters quickly R.C. , puts hat on bench , and seizes him by the shoulder . ) Parson Parson Davies ( Passionately . ) You scoundrel ! What brings you here ? Jim Jim Wynd ( Impudently , though evidently somewhat disconcerted . ) Why , Parson , is that you ? Well , and how are you , Parson , eh ? Parson Parson Davies ( Trying to suppress his anger . ) How dare you show your wicked face again near my wrecked home ! Jim Jim Wynd Steady , Parson , steady . Lone Farm do n't belong to you , nor yet Bolinas Plain ; and if it comes to faces you 'll allow there are those who like to look at mine . Parson Parson Davies It has done enough wicked work already . Go ! ( Crosses to L.C. ) Jim Jim Wynd ( At table . ) Come  --  considering you 're a parson , you 're a bit in a hurry . How ( mockingly ) do you know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know that  --  supposing you treat me as a parson should treat a gentleman  --  I have n't come to say that after all I 'm willing to own up I was wrong and make you happy by marrying your daughter ? I ca n't make her husband take her back , can I ? Parson Parson Davies ( Crosses to table , in hot indignation . ) No ! Degraded and disgraced though she is , broken in heart and spirit though she is , cast off by her husband though she be , I would rather she remained so than have her join her lot with yours . Jim Jim Wynd ( With a sneer . ) Oh , that 's it , is it ? Well then , if you take it like that you may be glad to know I did n't come here to say anything of the sort . I 'm not a marrying man .

Oh ! Well , you are a marrying man ! Parson Parson Davies ( With an effort . ) Has she seen you ? Jim Jim Wynd No . But she 's going to . ( Crossing to door and about to go off . ) Parson Parson Davies Stop ! Now , listen to me . ( Speaking with intense decision . ) Unless you leave this house immediately I will expose you to the wrath of the rough but honest folk who live in and about it .

You and me have kept that quiet until now . ( With a cruel sneer . ) I 've too much respect for her to speak , and if you come to think it over you 'll find that 's so with you .

Come ; your time is short  --  are you going ? ( Crossing to L. ) Jim Jim Wynd ( Astonished . ) Why , Parson  --  you really mean it ? Parson Parson Davies ( L. ) Yes . At any cost , I mean it ( Menacingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parson bullyingly and threateningly . ) Look here !

Parson Parson Davies No . There 's nothing the matter with me , but there 's something very wrong with you . Come  --  what is it ? ( C. ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Simply .

Ira Ira Beasley It 's what you seldom do in the church , Parson , but I 'm that off the track I 'd listen to anybody . Parson Parson Davies ( C. ) Do you mean to marry Sue Prescott ? Ira Ira Beasley You 've hit it ! But there 's a man in the way . Parson Parson Davies ( Startled . ) What ? She has heard of him ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Gloomily . ) I 'm afraid so .

Lay out some money on some clothes and fancy fixin 's . Parson Parson Davies Yes ; and then try to hold yourself upright , do n't limp so much ; and above all , my good fellow , when you 've won and wedded your wife , guard her closely and keep her free from designing scoundrels . Ira Ira Beasley It 's the winnin ' as bothers me . The weddin ' ' s your business . Parson Parson Davies She 's to be won , believe me .

And when you 've secured your wife , come to me and we 'll tie the knot in no time . ( Takes hat .  --  Exit Parson Davies R.C. ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Sitting on table . ) I wonder if there 's anything in what he says ? From an infant I 've been brought up to know thar ai n't much in anything as any parson ever said , and hi times o ' trouble it 's been a comfort to feel that 's so . But , through finding time hang heavy on their hands , mebee parsons gets a insight into many queer things , and I 've heard folks say they know a lot about women . I wonder  --  ( Silas Prescott heard whistling without . ) Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with that velvet jacket maybe it would be the reg'lar thing to put a word or two to him .

Ira Ira Beasley ( C. ) Is it all fixed between your girl Sue and that six foot three-er as has had his photograph took and fools away his time in trying to look like it ? Silas Silas Prescott ( R.C. ) Well , no  --  we have n't come to any arrangement , and no man marries my Sue without that . Ira Ira Beasley And arrangement , maybe , means money ? Silas Silas Prescott Money , or property . That 's so . Ira Ira Beasley ( Nervously . ) Then maybe you 'd make that arrangement with me ? Silas Silas Prescott For Sue ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes . Silas Silas Prescott You mean business ? Ira Ira Beasley Square business . Silas Silas Prescott ( With intense satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit each side of table . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( L. of table . ) Well , you see , as far as my land goes  --  Silas Silas Prescott ( R. of table , interrupting him . ) You need n't say a word about your land ; I 've stepped it , every inch . Ira Ira Beasley And as for the stock  --  Silas Silas Prescott ( Interrupting him . ) You can leave off about the stock ; I 've counted it , every head . Ira Ira Beasley And the house  --  Silas Silas Prescott The house is quite good enough for Sue . Have you got anything put by besides all this ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes . I 've worked hard , I 've spent nothing , and I 've saved a decent pile . Silas Silas Prescott Then it 's your duty to go down on your knees and thank the Lord for all His mercies .

Silas Silas Prescott ( R.C. , indignantly . ) Do I think she 'll have ye ? Well  --  I 'll allow as Sue do n't know much about the ways o ' the world , but I 've no occasion to think that any daughter of mine would turn at marrying age into a blithering idiot .

Sue Sue ( Petulantly . ) I wo n't be married . I do n't want to be married . Silas Silas Prescott Not want to be married to a man who would give you half of what he 's got while he lives , and all of it when he dies ?

And that 's what the Parson will make ye say ; only being , as he thinks , a busy man , he 'll make ye say it once and not three times . Of course it 's Ira Beasley . Sue Sue Father  --  do n't . Why , only just now he tried to kiss me ! Silas Silas Prescott ( Exasperated . ) D  --  n this girl ! ( Rises . ) She 's too much for anything .

Silas Silas Prescott ( L.C. ) You 'll have to do as he pleases about that . Sue Sue ( R.C. ) Married people do n't always kiss . I never saw you kiss mother . Silas Silas Prescott If you expect all men to be as considerate to their womankind as I 've been you 'll find out your mistake . Now let 's have no more of this yer foolishness . You 're goin ' to marry Ira Beasley , and if you do n't name the day I 'll name it for ye . Sue Sue ( At table , with decision . ) Father , I wo n't marry Ira Beasley . Silas Silas Prescott ( In amazed anger . ) You wo n't ? Sue Sue ( Very decidedly . ) I wo n't . Silas Silas Prescott Then by the Lord  --  ( He is beginning in hot anger , when he is interrupted by the sudden entrance of Will and Anne Olber R.C. ) ( Will and Anne Olber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Silas Silas Prescott ( Rudely . ) I reckon thar ai n't any stranger here waitin ' to be picked up by another stranger . Will Will Olber ( R.C. , aside to his wife , who is regarding Sue kindly . ) Amiable old coyote  --  ai n't he ? There 's suthin ' wrong here that we 've just dropped into .

Sue Sue ( L. of table , speaking kindly to Anne . ) This is Ira Beasley 's house . We are only visitors here  --  strangers indeed , like yourselves ; but I will call him .

Silas Silas Prescott ( Aside , watching Parson . ) He do n't believe it either . These folks are just interferin ' . Should n't wonder if that gal had her eye on Ira .

If I 'd minded your preachin ' , Will Olber and me would never have been man and wife . Parson Parson Davies Well  --  although I always knew that Will had his good points , I confess I doubted him as a husband , You see , he was so wild . Anne Annie Olber He 's tame enough now . Will Will Olber Tame as a lap-dog . Parson Parson Davies ( To Anne . ) And he is a good husband ? Anne Annie Olber He 's what I made him ; and when I set my hand to a thing I do n't allow it to turn out wrong .

You are evidently very happy together , and that shows you are a good husband . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue ( L. , to Anne . ) And are you very happy ?

Will Will Olber ( With a chuckle . ) It wo n't do to contradict her  --  eh , Parson ? Parson Parson Davies Not for you , most assuredly . She 's so improved you that I should hardly have known you . Anne Annie Olber Yes , and he 's so pleased with the way he 's got on that I 'm taking him for a little treat to Lowville to see the circus and the theatre .

Have you never seen them lovely men riding standing on cream-coloured horses and dressed as near their beautiful human natures as sparkling spangles will allow ? Why , it was one of them we promised to pick up with the waggon . He was walking on just for training you know , but he beat us for all that . I wonder where he is ? Parson Parson Davies ( Quickly . ) He 's gone on !  --  he 's gone on ! ( To Will anxiously . ) Tell me , do you know him well ? Is he your friend ? Will Will Olber Oh no .

Sue Sue ( R.C. ) About marrying Ira Beasley ? No , I wo n't marry him ! Silas Silas Prescott ( Threateningly . ) You mean it ? You wo n't ? Not after sticking up for him just now ? Sue Sue ( Firmly . ) No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never thought of him like that . Slouching about as he does , he does n't seem to be like a man , or to have the spirit of a man .

Then he 'd already passed the house afore you saw him ? Sue Sue I reckon  --  if it was him . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas He must have lit out ! Eh ? ( Looking at Constable . ) But then he runs like a deer ; it 's his trade . ( Sits on well . ) Sue Sue Wot trade ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Acrobat . Sue Sue Wot 's that ? ( Sheriff and Constable exchange looks and laugh . Constable sits on steps C. ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas A man who runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing , in a circus . Sue Sue ( Innocently . ) Well , does n't it seem as if he 's running , jumping and climbing away from you ? Constable Const able ( Stiffly , to Sheriff . ) She 's right . ( Rising . ) SheriffSheriff of Bolinas ( Rising , resuming his gravity . ) Yes , and we must be after him . We 're bound to come up with him before he reaches Lowville ; and between that and this house is a dead level where a gopher could n't leave his hole without your seein ' him a mile off ! Good-bye . Now then , the horses  --  quick ! ( Crosses up C. to doors . ) ( As the Sheriff and Constable go off through large barn doors , they give a parting glance of admiration at Sue . Ira closes door behind them . ) ( Sound of bits , chains , etc. , on their exit . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Uneasily . ) Well , they wo n't ketch much if they go on yawpin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue ( Disdainfully . ) Not much I reckon ! ( Noise of hoofs . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Pleased . ) Oh , ye do n't think much of them then ? ( Crosses down L. ) ( Sue puts pan on table back . ) Sue Sue ( Scornfully . ) I think nothin ' of ' em ! Ira Ira Beasley ( Looking at her curiously . ) Ah ! You 've summed ' em up I see ; that 's the kind of official trash we have to pay rates and taxes to keep up . ( Aside , as he goes off , and again uneasily . ) But Sue never looked like that at me ! ( Exit into house . ) ( Sue complacently resumes plate washing . A short pause , during which Sue looks anxiously at loft door , and then , with a little start , at Ira 's gun . ) Sue Sue ( At table . ) Ira , what be ye doin ' ? Ira Ira Beasley ( From within . ) Mending the riata . Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have no need to hurry over it . Sue Sue Did you notice them two men carried guns ? ( Sits on stool . ) Ira Ira Beasley Of course they carried guns . Sue Sue What for ? Ira Ira Beasley ( With a surly laugh . ) Maybe to shoot with . Sue Sue To shoot what with ? Ira Ira Beasley Circus chaps , if they do n't hand themselves over mighty spry ! Sue Sue ( With a swift glance at loft door and with a little shudder . ) Oh ! Then their guns are loaded ? Ira Ira Beasley Oh yes  --  you bet they 're loaded . Sue Sue Is your gun loaded ? Ira Ira Beasley No . There 's nothing I 'm hankering to shoot just now . Sue Sue Do n't you think I ought to know how to load a gun ? Ira Ira Beasley You ?  --  what for ? Sue Sue Well , with these circus-riders running away , and officers after them as do n't seem too particular in the way they look at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , ye thought that , did ye ? Sue Sue ( Not heeding him . ) I say , with such fine folks about , and me often left alone here while you look after the stock , I think I ought to be taught how to take care of myself . Ira Ira Beasley Ah ! Maybe you 're right , and some day I 'll show ye how to load a gun . Sue Sue Why not show me now ? ( Turns . ) Ira Ira Beasley I 'm busy . Sue Sue But the gun 's here ( crosses L. ) , and the powder , and the shot . Tell me now while you go on mendin ' the riata . It would be real fun for me . Ira Ira Beasley I never see sich a woman . You seem to live on real fun . Sue Sue ( With a sigh . ) No , I do n't . I live on Bolinas Plain . ( With gun in hand , and a little impatiently . ) Come  --  tell me . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put the powder in first ( Sue takes up powder flask . ) Wait till I come out and I 'll show ye how to measure it . Sue Sue ( Commencing to load gun . ) I know how to do that , for I 've watched you . I thought perhaps the shot had to go in first . Ira Ira Beasley Ah ! bein ' a woman , that 's just the kind o ' thing you would think ! Is the powder in ? Sue Sue Yes . Ira Ira Beasley Well , now then , a wad on the top of the powder . You 'll find some in my pocket , along with a box o ' caps . Sue Sue ( Crosses and gets caps and wad , crosses back to stool , continuing to load gun . ) Yes . And then the shot ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes . Now be careful how you measure the shot . It 's all I 've got in the house . Sue Sue ( With shot flask in hand . ) Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures ? Ira Ira Beasley One , of course . Be careful ; the flask 's quite full . Sue Sue ( With gun in one hand , flask in the other . ) What shall you be shootin ' the next time you go out with the gun , Ira ? Ira Ira Beasley Rabbits , I reckon . Sue Sue ( Eagerly . ) I suppose one of these measures would be enough to kill a man ? Ira Ira Beasley If you was near enough to the man it would . Sue Sue But two measures would make it more certain ? Ira Ira Beasley Well , maybe if you was the man you 'd rather have the one than the two . Sue Sue ( Aside , as she quietly puts down gun and puts flask in her pocket . ) I 'll wait till Ira 's gone , and then I 'll put in two measures . There 's two men after him ( with a glance at the loft ) , poor fellow ! I 'll have a measure for each . Ira Ira Beasley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) That 's all right . There , now you 've taught me how to look after myself . ( Crosses up to table . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( With a rough laugh . ) Ha ! ha ! It 's one thing to load a gun and another thing to fire it off . I do n't believe you 'd dare do that . Sue Sue ( Resuming plate washing . ) If my blood was up I would . Wait a bit and perhaps you 'll see . ( Aside . ) And perhaps the Sheriff 'll see . ( After a little pause , in which the " click " of the plates is heard as she puts them down . ) Wonder if that Sheriff 's caught anything yet ? I 've a good mind to meander up the road and see . Ira Ira Beasley ( Quickly appearing at door . ) What for ? Sue Sue Because I want to know . I sha n't be long . Ira Ira Beasley You 're going ? Sue Sue Yes . Why not ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go myself . You 'd better stay and look after the house . ( Takes coat . ) Sue Sue Very well . You could go farther than me . ( Ira is about to take gun . ) ( C. ) Do n't take the gun . Ira Ira Beasley Why not ? Sue Sue If there 's any shootin ' why should you be in it ? It 's the Sheriffs business  --  not yours . Ira Ira Beasley Ah well , perhaps you 're right . ( Goes towards barn door , putting on coal , and when he is near it turns and faces Sue . ) I suppose if I did n't go and see what the Sheriff is doing , you would ? Sue Sue ( R.C. ) Yes , I would . Ira Ira Beasley ( Significantly . ) Ah , well  --  then I reckon I 'll go . ( Exit through small door in barn . ) ( Sue closes door after him , listens for a moment to his retreating footsteps , and then comes quickly to loft steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes her mind , and goes quickly into house . Immediately she reappears with a small hand-mirror , which she brings into the light , and , smiling at herself in it , runs her fingers through her hair . Then she puts the little mirror down and hastens up the loft steps . She seem to have forgotten all about the gun . ) Sue Sue ( At loft door , knocking . ) It 's safe now ; you can come out . Jim Jim Wynd ( From within . ) Wait a minute . I 'm changing . Sue Sue ( Aside . ) Changing ! Poor fellow !  --  he ca n't have much to change . ( Aloud . ) Can I get you anything ? Jim Jim Wynd No ; I 'm ready now . ( Jim Wynd appears at door and joins Sue on little platform . He has discarded the long coal in which he was concealed , and now appears in the fleshings and spangles of the circus-rider or acrobat . He is a well-made man , and his costume shows off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has washed his face and hands , and his wet hair is plastered in curls on his low forehead . ) Sue Sue ( Regarding him with astonishment and admiration . ) My ! How lovely ! Jim Jim Wynd ( With a conceited laugh . ) A bit better than when you saw me last , eh ? ( Aside . ) It 's the pretty girl I saw here three years ago , when I told the Parson I 'd come back . Well , I 've come back . Sue Sue ( Almost awe-stricken . ) Are ye quite sure ye 're the same man ? Jim Jim Wynd Not a doubt about that ; but finding a bucket of water in here , I managed to wash the dust off me . Sue Sue Do you always wear them beautiful clothes ? Jim Jim Wynd No ; but ye see I had to get off in such a hurry , I had no chance to change . Now tell me , what 's been up ? I could hear a rumpus , but could make nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here . Jim Jim Wynd After me ? Sue Sue Yes . Jim Jim Wynd ( Nervously . ) Where are they now ? Sue Sue Huntin ' you over Bolinas Plain . Jim Jim Wynd That 's because you did n't let on I was here ? Sue Sue Yes . ( With undisguised admiration and quite innocently . ) And I did n't know how beautiful you were then . Jim Jim Wynd ( With a low laugh . ) You 're the right sort , you are ; we could get on well together , me and you . ( Then , anxiously . ) There 's no getting away just yet . Could ye keep me in here to-night ? Sue Sue Yes , but ye must lie low in the loft . Jim Jim Wynd And could you  --  ye see I 've eaten nothing since last night  --  could you  --  Sue Sue ( Turning to go doom steps . ) Yes , I 'll bring you something . ( Going . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( Stopping her . ) And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Sue Sue ( Half may damn steps , and disappointed . ) What ! You do n't mean to say you 're going to change them splendid things ? Jim Jim Wynd Well , you see , it would disguise me and put ' em off the track . Sue Sue ( With alacrity . ) I see  --  and I 'll fetch ' em . ( Aside , when she has reached the bottom of steps . ) He 'd look just sweet in the vacquero 's clothes as Ira tried to wear the day I  --  ( with a sigh )  --  the day I married him . ( She is going into the house , when Jim leans over the steps and softly calls to her . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( With a forced smile . ) Did they say  --  did they tell you  --  anything about me ? Sue Sue ( Rather troubled . ) Yes . Jim Jim Wynd You see  --  I 'll tell you how it was . Sue Sue ( Quickly . ) No , do n't . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Especially about that woman . ( Aloud . ) I must go and get the things before he comes back . Jim Jim Wynd Who 's he ? Sue Sue My husband . ( Turning , as she goes off . ) What 's your name ? Jim Jim Wynd Jim . What 's yours ? Sue Sue Sue . Sue Beasley . ( Aside . ) Jim ! It 's a pretty name ! ( Exit Sue into house . ) Jim Jim Wynd Sue , eh ? And so Sue 's married ? and she did n't marry the Parson . Well , so much the better for him . She 's ( with intense satisfaction ) clean gone on me , and I 'm safe with her . Ah ! if I lived in a land o ' women there 'd be no danger for me . It 's these yer cursed men who ai n't got my luck with the girls who try to run me down  --  but I 'll fix ' em yet ! ( Enter Sue from house . She carries provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsating like a schoolgirl . She runs up steps and deposits her packages by the side of Jim . ) Sue Sue There ! Jim Jim Wynd ( Gloating over the provisions . ) Well  --  that looks rather like business ! ( Begins to eat ravenously . ) Sue Sue And now for the disguise . ( Running down steps and going towards house , but pausing at bottom and looking at him with admiration . ) I suppose you must have them , but it does seem a pity to change them lovely clothes . ( Jim , as he continues eating , gives her a patronising wave of his hand , and Sue goes gaily into house . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( With his mouth half full . ) She 's party  --  you bet ! Purty as a pink ! A fetching face , and a trim figure  --  and ( with a conceited laugh ) she 's dead gone on me .

Sue Sue In case ye should be hard put to get away , I 'll show ye how . Jim Jim Wynd Why , you do n't want me to go , do you ? Sue Sue No . But I do n't want you to stay here to be shot . Jim Jim Wynd That means you 'd like me to stay here alive  --  eh ? Sue Sue ( Innocently . ) Yes , I should . Jim Jim Wynd I thought as much . ( With a coarse laugh . ) You women are pretty much alike . But if it comes to shooting I 've got a loaded revolver in my coat pocket ( pointing to loft and speaking with bravado ) and perhaps I could teach Mr Sheriff something . ( Then suddenly altering his tone and speaking very timidly . ) But as you say you would n't like me to be shot ; and so , for your sake , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sue Sue Well , inside the loft there , in the far corner , you 'll find a trap door ; drop through that . By the way , I suppose you could drop through ? It 's rather high , but I 've done it often when no one 's been looking . Jim Jim Wynd ( Contemptuously . ) Drop through ? Why I could drop from the moon to the earth and turn a double-somersault in between , if there was any building big enough to roof in the show . Sue Sue ( Enthusiastically . ) I suppose there never was anyone so brave as you ? Jim Jim Wynd Well ( boastfully ) I never met him , and if I did he 'd have a challenge . ( Then very nervously . ) Now , go on  --  tell me how to get out . Sue Sue Well , when you 've dropped through the trap door you 'll find yourself opposite another door . That 'll take you into the lean-to shed . ( Points to R. ) Run along that until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Again points R. ) In that you 'll find a door that 'll lead you straight on to the plain . Jim Jim Wynd ( Doubtfully . ) Oh ! Sue Sue But mind you , you need n't do all this until I give you a signal , and ( with a toss of her head and in a tone of determination ) when I do that you wo n't have much to fear from Mr Sheriff and his Constable . Jim Jim Wynd ( Taking her hand tenderly in his . ) Darling , you seem as if you 'd do anything for me  --  and  --  Sue Sue ( Suddenly interrupting him and very quickly with-drawing her hand . ) Be quiet ! Jim Jim Wynd ( Amazed . ) Why , ye 're not riled , are ye ? I thought  --  Sue Sue ( Quickly . ) Hush ! ( Then turning to him tenderly . ) It 's not that . You 'd be welcome to hold my hand any time you could spare for it  --  but  --  hush ! ( On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Jim Wynd ( Frightened . ) Where ? Sue Sue Outside the barn . ( Walk of horses heard outside . ) Yes . I 'm right ! They 're coming back ! Jim Jim Wynd Who ? Sue Sue The Sheriff and his man ! Into the loft ! Quick ! ( Jim makes an ignominious exit into loft . Sue , speaking very quietly , and in a hushed voice , throws things after him . ) Sue Sue There 's plenty of food there yet , and whisky in the flask , and there 's the dress ; but you must lie still . Jim Jim Wynd ( In a muffled voice from within . ) And you 'll be sure and give me some signal if there 's danger about ?  --  for your own sake , you know . Sue Sue Yes  --  you can trust me . Jim Jim Wynd ( As before . ) Yes  --  I believe you 're a brave girl . Sue Sue ( To herself , at the descends steps . ) I do n't know as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be telling me to-day what a woman can do  --  for Jim . Jim !  --  it 's a pretty name ! ( When the reaches bottom of steps she turns and kisses her hand to loft door , and then goes into house . In meantime voices of Ira , Sheriff , and Constable are heard outside barn doors . ) ( The large doors are thrown open and Ira , the Sheriff and Constable enter . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( R.C. ) No . My mind 's made up . Reckon I sha n't go any farther to-day , but just camp down here for a spell . Ira Ira Beasley ( R. ) You mean to say you ai n't goin ' to shove on to Lowville ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas No . ( To Constable , and giving him hit gun . ) See that the horses are properly stabled and then come back to me . ( Exit Constable through barn doors , with guns . ) Ira Ira Beasley What are you going to do then ? Do n't ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chances are with him and against us . Maybe , while we 're hunting the plain he 's lying down behind some low wire grass ridge , watching us , and only waiting for the night to draw a bead of us . Ira Ira Beasley ( Vaguely repeating himself . ) What are ye goin ' to do , then ? ( Helplessly . ) You 're not goin ' to stop here ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Yes . Ira Ira Beasley What  --  in my house ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Certainly . ( With a laugh . ) Ye know I have the right to summon ye as my posse to aid and assist me in carrying out the law ; but I ai n't the man to be rough on my friends , so I reckon it will do just as well if I " requisition " your house . Ira Ira Beasley ( Indignantly . ) D'ye mean to say ye 've the right ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Interrupting him , and drawlingly . ) Yes ; and if it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt the plain while I stayed here to see that no harm came to Mrs Beasley . ( Aside . ) I reckon that 'll fetch him ! ( Crosses to L. ) Ira Ira Beasley ( With a gasp . ) Oh ! But I 'll stop here with ye and make ye welcome . ( Enter Constable through barn doors . Stands L. , near Sheriff . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( With a good-natured laugh , taking a seat L. on chair , and lighting a cigar . ) That 's right . ( Sue enters from the house . She has taken some pains with her dress , has changed her cuffs and collar , taken off her apron , and re-dressed her hair . ) Sue Sue ( Aside , C ) . I ca n't be as fine as Jim , but when he sees me again he shall see a difference . Ira Ira Beasley ( Looking at her in amazement . ) Oh ! Sue Sue ( Turning upon him sharply . ) What 's the matter ? Ira Ira Beasley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you was expectin ' company . ( Aside . ) Sue never dressed like that for me . Sue Sue ( Saucily , and looking very graciously at Sheriff . ) Well , and I 've got company , have n't I ? ( Aside . ) Ira 's jealous of the Sheriff . So much the better . Ira Ira Beasley ( Aside , very uneasily . ) Sue never looked like that at me . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Certainly you 've got company  --  and the right sort o ' company to be looked after by a pretty woman . ( To Ira . ) Did n't I hear ye say something about a drop of whisky ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Sulkily . ) There 's a full bottle in the house . I 'll fetch it . ( Moving towards house . ) Sue Sue ( C. , quickly stopping him . ) No ! Ef you men ca n't get along with the coffee and flap-jacks I 'm goin ' to give ye , ye kin just toddle right along to the first bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a bar-keeper you 're lookin ' for , and not a lady , say so . ( Exit Sue into house . Sheriff end Constable laugh heartily . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( To Ira . ) You 're in luck with your wife , my friend ; reckon the time slips by pretty freely , even in Bolinas Plain , with her for a partner ? Constable Const able Free with her tongue too  --  ( crosses to C. )  --  ai n't she ? Why , it 's a treat to hear her . Ira Ira Beasley ( At well , troubled . ) Well , ye see , she 's naturally a bit excited at seeing strangers ; we do n't see much company at Lone Farm , and if her manners ai n't quite company manners , ye 'll maybe make allowances . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Allowances ! Why , she 's just lovely ! ( Rises . To Constable . ) We would n't have her altered  --  would we ? Constable Constable Not one little bit of her . ( Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah ! I was thinkin ' ye seemed satisfied with her . ( Aside . ) What 's come to Sue ? I do n't seem to know Sue to-day . ( Sue enters from house , carrying tray bearing cakes and steaming coffee . Places tray on table . ) Note : 1kb Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Coming down C. ) And what a housekeeper she is ! Now , I 'll bet these cakes are of your own baking ? Sue Sue There 's no one else to bake ' em here . ( Places table down between chair and stool L. ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Ah ! Beasley 's a wise man . When he 's got a good thing he knows how to keep it to himself . And yet , ye know , friend Beasley , there 's such a thing as being extra selfish . ( Sits R. of table . ) Sue Sue That 's what I 'm always telling him . Now , ought n't he to take me for a trip to Lowville ? Constable Constable Gosh ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of table . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas And she shall , too . ( To Sue . ) You leave that to me . We 'll arrange all that before I go . Sue Sue ( Saucily to Ira . ) There , now  --  see what it is to make friends . Ira Ira Beasley ( Distressed . ) It 's getting dark . ( Touching Sheriff on shoulder . ) Sheriff She riff of Bolinas Well , what 's that matter ? except that when it gets darker we sha n't be able to see so much of Mrs Beasley . Ira Ira Beasley ( Quickly yet hesitatingly , C. ) But , look yar ! Ai n't you goin ' to have another look round for your man afore night comes on ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Lazily . ) Well , I do n't know as I shall  --  I 'm very comfortable where I am . Sue Sue Well , I 'm glad of that !

( To Constable . ) Go and get the horses ready  --  quick ! ( Exit Constable through barn door . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( To Ira . ) You and he shall go and look , and ( gallantly ) I 'll stop here and help Mrs Beasley with the cows . Ira Ira Beasley ( With sudden determination . ) No ! I 'm d  --  d ! Sue Sue ( Interrupting him , and speaking sharply . ) Be quiet .

Did n't I say we 'd camp the night here ? Where can you shake us down ? Any room in the house ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Decidedly . ) No ! Sue Sue Not unless  --  ye 'd have me turn out . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Gallantly . ) Not for the world . ( Looking round yard . ) I 'm an old soldier , and ( pointing to shed at R. ) if I can have a rug or a blanket I 'll do very well in there , and the Constable can make shift in the barn . Ira Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wo n't ye have to take him to Lowville ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Not to-night . I 'd bring him back here . Sue Sue Would you , indeed , and where would you stow him ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Pointing to loft . ) Well , I should think we might make him snug up there . Sue Sue Well I never ! Yes , perhaps you could ! Ira Ira Beasley ( At door . ) We 'd best be going . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( To Sue . ) When I come back I shall expect that drop of whisky . ( Crosses up to door . ) Sue Sue Very well . Will the man ye catch want any whisky ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas No . His whisky days are over . Sue Sue Poor man ! Now go and catch him . ( Sue laughs merrily , and Ira and Sheriff go off through barn doors . Then she listens intently for a moment , and bolts the doors upon them . ) ( Noise of horses without . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tapping at loft door . ) Ye can come out now . Jim Jim Wynd ( Opening door and appearing at it . ) I thought you were never coming . ( He still wears his tights and spangles . ) Where have they gone ?

If they thought ye was here , d'ye think they 'd go ! ( Laughing . ) And where d'ye think they 're goin ' to put ye when ye 're caught ? Jim Jim Wynd ( Bitterly . ) Ye need n't ask me that . Sue Sue But ye do n't know . ( Pointing to loft . ) They 're goin ' to put ye in there ! Jim Jim Wynd What for ? Sue Sue Because they 're coming back . Jim Jim Wynd What for ? Sue Sue For the night  --  and whisky . Jim Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more whisky ?  --  ' cause if you do  --  ( About to descend steps . ) Jim Jim Wynd No . D'ye think I 'd be what I am ( regarding his well-made limbs ) if I soaked myself in whisky ? I 'm a gentleman . Sue Sue ( Excitedly . ) I thought so ! Oh , do tell me all about yourself . Jim Jim Wynd ( Nervously . ) But are ye quite sure I 'm  --  I mean we 're  --  safe ? Sue Sue ( Firmly . ) Ye 're safer here with me about the place to look after ye than ye could be anywhere . Let the men come back ; let ' em stay here . I 'll keep ' em off ye , never fear . You just trust me ! ( Her eyes flash . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( Looking at her approvingly . ) I will ! Sue Sue And now sit down and tell me everything that a gentleman does . ( They sit together on top of steps . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( Boastfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer offhand .

If I took you for a week I reckon he 'd expect you to stay away altogether . Sue Sue ( Dreamily . ) Would he ? Jim Jim Wynd Yes . Sue Sue ( Innocently . ) Why ?

Sue Sue Why because it would keep you out of the salons . Jim Jim Wynd ( Bumptiously . ) I 've my name to keep up , and I steer a middle course between the two .

I must think what  --  No ; I must stop thinkin ' or I 'll go mad . Bah ! I 'm a fool ! He 'll go to-morrow , and then she 'll be the same again . But why did she never look like that at me ? Perhaps it 's " women 's ways "  --  women 's ways as I 've heard men talk of  --  women 's ways she 's never shown to me . Would she have been different with that derned grinning Sheriff if she had married him instead of me ? Blast him !  --  it was him that made her look like that !

Nobody must know it , until I 've brought the hound back  --  myself alone !

Not that there is any doubt about the general guilt of the prisoner , nor that there never was a time in his youthful career when he could n't have been hung if his fellow-citizens had been public-spirited enough to do it . But that , gentlemen , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to allow the weakness of the community to tell agin the individual . All All That 's so .

Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill ( To Softy . ) And bring in that measley psalm-singin ' chap that wanted to serve on the Committee . ( Exit Sofly L. , quickly re-entering with Constable and Silas . ) I reckon if this charge agin the prisoner peters out , we may find suthin ' against him ! ( Sits . ) Silas Silas Prescott ( C. , obsequiously to Judge . ) I was just sayin ' I was willin '  --  Judge Judge Lynch ( Sternly interrupting . ) Shut up ! ( To Sofly . ) Who is this man ? Another prisoner ? Sofly The Softy From ' Frisco ( L.C. ) Not yet , Judge ; but we have hopes and expectations . Just now he was anxious  --  very anxious  --  to serve on the Jury . Judge Judge Lynch Ah ! Was he ? We all know what that means ! Shove him in there , alongside the prisoner ! Silas Silas Prescott ( Protesting . ) But I 'm a religious man , and  --  Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott I 'm a religious man  --  Judge Judge Lynch ( Interrupting him . ) Gag him if he do n't dry up . ( Silas is thrust ignominiously into chair beside Jim Wynd . ) ( Constable goes to witness bench . Softy sits . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( To Constable . ) Now we all know your evidence . Have you anything to add to or take away from it ? Constable Constable Nothing . Judge Judge Lynch And you are certain the Sheriff was shot by the prisoner ? Constable Constable It 's as clear as day . We were out huntin ' him . That he was hid away in the loft at Lone Farm is proved by his circus get-up , in which he got away from Lowville , being found there ; that he got away again directly after the murder is proved by his stealing Ira Beasley 's horse . All All ( Rising and drawing pistols . ) ( Excitedly and angrily . ) Hoss-stealin ' ! Jim Jim Wynd ( Appealingly . ) In self-defence , gentlemen  --  in self-defence only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge , Ira slips in through door C. ) Judge Judge Lynch ( To Constable . ) Is there any other witness ? Constable Constable No . ( Ira Beasley comes forward . He limps painfully and seems exhausted , but is better dressed than in the last Act ; his hair has been cut and his beard cropped , and an evident effort made to " smarten himself up . " . ) ( Ira arrests the attention of everyone . ) Ira Ira Beasley Yes . Judge Judge Lynch ( To Ira , and having quelled the buzz of excitement that his appearance has elicited . ) Who are you ? Ira Ira Beasley ( C. , faintly , and as if tired out . ) Ira Beasley . Judge Judge Lynch Of Lone Farm ? Ira Ira Beasley Yes . ( Renewed excitement on part of bystanders . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( To crowd . ) Silence ! ( To Ira . ) Do you know the prisoner ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Looking at Jim Wynd and shaking his head . ) No . ( Faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sternly . ) Then what are you doing here ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Collecting himself with an evident effort . ) Because I killed the Sheriff . ( Manifest " sensation " on part of all present , which " silences " itself in the evident eager excitement of everyone to hear more . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( With outstretched hand , and gaining strength , and even dignity , as he speaks and turns his head slowly around the circle of eager listeners . ) I killed him because he made love to my wife . I killed him because he wanted to run away with her . I killed him because I saw him waitin ' for her at the dead o ' night , when she 'd got outer bed to join him . He had n't no gun , he had n't no fight . I killed him in his tracks . That man ( pointing to Wynd ) was n't in it at all . ( Pausing , loosening his collar and baring his throat . ) Now , take me out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What proof have we of this ? Where 's your wife ? Does she corroborate this ? Ira Ira Beasley ( With a tremor in his voice and bearing . ) She ran away that night , and never come back again . Judge Judge Lynch ( To Ira . ) Why did she run away ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Slowly . ) P'r'aps because she loved him and could n't bear me . P'r'aps , as I 've sometimes allowed to myself , gentlemen , it was because she did n't want to bear evidence against me . Jim Jim Wynd May I speak now ? Judge Judge Lynch Yes . ( To the auditors . ) We 'll hear him . ( All sit . ) Jim Jim Wynd ( Audaciously and confidentially . ) What that man says ( indicating Ira ) is true . After I stole the horse to get away , and my life being in danger I had to get away somehow , I found his wife runnin ' wild down the road crying and sobbing . At first I thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it was that man ( indicating Ira ) , her husband . It made her afraid to go back to him , and she begged me to take her along with me . It was a risky thing for me to do , gentlemen , but I took her up on the horse and got her away to Lowville . It was that much dead weight agin my chances , but I took it . She was a woman , and I ai n't a dog ! ( Murmurs of approbation from all present . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Limping across the room and extending his hand to Jim . ) Shake ! ( Sits . ) ( Renewed murmurs of approbation . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( To Constable . ) What do you know of the Sheriff 's attentions to Mrs Beasley ? Were they enough to justify the husband 's jealousy ? Did he make love to her ? ( All turn to Constable . ) ( Auditors await Constable 's reply in intense excitement . Constable hesitates . ) Judge Judge Lynch You must answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( All lean forward . ) ( Constable seems about to speak , and then resumes his awkward silence . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Turns to Constable and exposes pistol from his hip pocket . ) Did he make love to her ? Constable Constable ( After a pause ; slowly and half defiantly . ) Well , Judge , he was a man ! ( Everyone laughs violently and unrestrainedly . ) ( Violent knocking heard at door C. Everybody starts . Witness and spectators edge away from door , and whole assembly rises with revolvers drawn in their hands . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Standing with a certain calm dignity , addressing Saleratus Bill . ) See who it is who dares to interrupt the Court at such a moment  --  but let no living man enter . Are you ready , gentlemen ? ( Drawing pistol . ) All All ( Raising revolvers . ) Ready ! Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill ( Goes to door , revolver in hand , and peers out ; then returns quickly , in amazement and , gasping . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill Yes , and a regular beauty ! Judge Judge Lynch ( Sternly . ) She must wait . ( Bill exits , and returns immediately . ) Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill She says she has important business with the Court . Judge Judge Lynch ( Hurriedly buttoning his frock coat and pulling up his collar . ) Admit her ! ( All put pistols away . ) ( Bill opens door C. and admits Sue . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( L. ) My God ! Sue ! My wife ! Judge Judge Lynch ( R. ) Your wife ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Dropping his head between his hands . ) Yes . ( Sensation . Every man passes his hand through his hair , pulls his moustache and straightens himself . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Solemnly to Jury . ) Gentlemen , the last witness was correct . The Sheriff was  --  a man ! ( Murmurs of assent from the Jury . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Placing chair . To Sue . ) Be seated , madam . ( All sit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Bowing and pulling up his collar . ) It is at your service . ( Slight pause . Sue seems to be agitated . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Very blandly . ) What is your business here ? Sue Sue ( Excitedly . ) To tell the truth ! Judge Judge Lynch ( Stepping down . ) Well ? Go on . Sue Sue ( In evident agitation . ) He  --  he  --  he did n't kill the Sheriff . Judge Judge Lynch ( Going back to table . ) Who is " he " ? Please be more explicit . Sue Sue ( With a shamefaced glance at Ira . ) My husband  --  he did n't do it . Ira Ira Beasley ( Seated L. , addressing Judge . ) You 'll allow it 's reasonable in a woman to want to get me off like that  --  and , maybe , in my name , you 'll take your chance of thanking her for it ; but I did it , and I 'm here to suffer for it . Sue Sue ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know he thought he did it . He was  --  and it was all my fault  --  mad jealous of the Sheriff , though Heaven knows he had no need to be ; but he did n't kill him . Ira Ira Beasley ( Doggedly . ) I did , and I 'd do it again ! ( All rise , and draw revolvers levelled at Ira , with cries of " Quit that ! " . ) Judge Judge Lynch ( Sharply . ) Order , gentlemen ! What does this mean ? Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill He 's contradicted a lady ! ( Sullenly . ) Do n't let him do it again . ( All sit down again . Pause . ) Sue Sue ( Still addressing Judge . ) He could n't have killed him  --  ( in a broken voice )  --  for I loaded the gun that day and put no shot in it . Judge Judge Lynch This is an improbable story . How can you prove this ? Sue Sue ( Excitedly . ) He ( indicating Ira ) will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . He knows that all the shot he had in the house was in the flask . I never put any shot in the gun . I can prove it , for I 've got his shot flask here ( producing shot flask ) , and it 's as full as the day when I loaded the gun . Ira Ira Beasley My God ! She 's right ! ( Sits L. ) Judge Judge Lynch ( At table . ) Your evidence , madam , is interesting as to how a woman loads a shot gun , but it can hardly , I am afraid , be called conclusive . Jim Jim Wynd ( L. , vehemently . ) Ca n't you see it 's all a put-up job between these two ?  --  to make me swing instead of him ? What 's that shot flask proved ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Simply . ) It 's made me see that Sue was right , and I was wrong . Jim Jim Wynd D'ye hear him ?  --  playing into her hands as if they thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shot flask could have been filled and emptied twenty times over between then and now ? Sue Sue ( Defiantly . ) I 'm telling the truth . Jim Jim Wynd ( With scorn . ) Upon my soul this is playing it a little bit too low down . Why , did n't I see him ( indicating Ira. ) shoot the Sheriff , face to face ? Ira Ira Beasley That 's true . Judge Judge Lynch ( To Ira . ) You freely admit that ? Ira Ira Beasley ( Simply . ) There 's no getting over it . I believe what my wife says , but I meant to kill him and I 'm here to suffer . I suppose I deserve to suffer , and , anyway , I 'm tired o ' life and ready to do it . Sue Sue ( To Judge . ) You hear what he says , sir ? ( Turning to men . ) You hear what he says , gentlemen ? Then let me speak too , for I 'm tired of life . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless , and  --  and  --  if you wo n't take me as a witness to save him , then for the sake of making all things square and even , let me , who am just as guilty as he is , stand by his side , and suffer with him . ( During this , the Jury have become greatly interested , and at the conclusion , Saleratus Bill , listening eagerly , lets his revolver slip accidentally to the floor . ) Judge Judge Lynch Silence in Court ! The next man who  --  Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill ( Rebelliously . ) Ca n't a man accidentally let up his feelings in your darned Court without yer raving . Look yer , boys  --  ( turning to Jury )  --  there ai n't no humanity in this yer Court ! Chorus of Jurymen Jurymen No ! No ! Judge Judge Lynch Silence ! It strikes me , gentlemen , that this has gone on long enough . My opinion is , that this Court is being played upon and trifled with in its highest and noblest emotions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who on their own showin ' ai n't competent to settle which is their own funeral . We are not here to usurp the functions of the fool-killer for this district . With the exception of the lady  --  ( Enter C. No. 22 , who has gone off . ) No. 22 No 22 ( Excitedly . ) Save yourselves , boys ! There 's a mounted posse of citizens and State troops comin ' up the stage road , not two miles away , howlin ' out for Regulators ! Some one has blabbed ! Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill ( Furiously , and pointing to Silas and Constable . ) There are the traitors ! I suspected them from the first ! Seize them ! ( Great excitement . Silas and Constable are seized . Their first joy at the news it changed to terror . Jim Wynd slinks behind them . Ira and Judge alone remain calm . Patrol bolts door C. ) Judge Judge Lynch ( With dignity and determination . ) Order , gentlemen , order ! ( After a pause , and when silence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a collision with the authorities . There is ample time for you all to slip quietly away and resume your occupations as simple American citizens . Release those two men ( pointing to Silas and Constable ) . They dared not have led the posse here , knowing , as they do , that they are themselves inculpated in these proceedings before the authorities , and that they are under our rules , which prescribe death to them if they divulge our secrets . Take them beyond the limits of the town and set them free . As to our prisoners , this one ( pointing to Ira ) , who has voluntarily given himself up to us , we leave the same privilege of giving himself up to the Law , which has more time to look after those delicate distinctions he has raised than we have . As to this one  --  ( pointing to Jim Wynd )  --  Jim Jim Wynd Mercy ! Mercy ! ( Cross to C. ) Judge Judge Lynch We might safely leave him to answer to the Law for that old-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imploringly . ) Let me go ! Judge Judge Lynch ( Continuing , inflexibly . ) But we propose to temper justice with mercy . We will give him one more chance for his life . ( Croat to R.C. Regards Wynd critically . To Wynd . ) You are an acrobat ? Jim Jim Wynd I am . Judge Judge Lynch Good at your trade , I believe ? Jim Jim Wynd ( Straightening himself , and with pride . ) The best in the country . Judge Judge Lynch Good ! Then , as you owe us some return for the trouble you have given us , you shall give us a taste of your quality now . ( Taking him by the arm and pointing to window R. ) Do you see that tree , with the one straight branch below the window ? Jim Jim Wynd ( Trembling . ) Yes . Judge Judge Lynch In ten minutes more you would have been dangling from it . Now is your one chance for escape . The branch is twenty feet from the ground , the tree fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run and a single bound from that window to the branch and another to the ground ? Jim Jim Wynd ( Hesitatingly . ) I  --  I  --  ( then boldly )  --  I can ! ( Cries of " Good ! " " Bully ! " and great excitement , as men make a lane across the stage and Jim retires for his start . Chairs placed in oblique line . ) Hopkins Napoleon Hopkins Ten dollars that he breaks his neck ! Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill Fifteen his leg ! Softy The Softy From ' Frisco Twenty that he gets clear away ! Judge Judge Lynch Are you ready ? One ! Two ! Three ! ( Jim runs to window and clears it with a flying bound . All run eagerly to window . ) Saleratus Bill Saleratus Bill ( At window . ) He 's done it , by God ! ( Cries and shouts of " Bully for the acrobat ! "  --  " Beautiful ! " . ) Sue Sue ( Excitedly . ) Thank God ! Ira Ira Beasley ( Who has watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , that 's the kind o ' man as takes a woman ! ( Noise and shouts without . All turn to door C. and draw . ) Sue Sue ( Anxiously . ) Oh ! Perhaps they 've caught him ! Judge Judge Lynch No . It 's only the coming of the posse . ( To Committee . ) Now , gentlemen ! Out the back way ! We 're just in time ! ( The stage is cleared at once , the men passing out R. and L. Door at C. remains closed . ) ( Save for Ira and Sue the stage it empty . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( C. , approaching Sue awkwardly . ) I reckon I ought to thank ye for coming here to save my life , and I do thank ye . I 'd clean forgotten about your loadin ' that gun , and even if I 'd remembered it , I should n't have known ye 'd put no shot in it . Well , I thank ye  --  and  --  well  --  good-bye . ( Turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Ira , I know how wrong I 've been , but Heaven knows I 'm sorry . Ira , ca n't you forgive me ? Wo n't you take me home ? Ira Ira Beasley ( L.C. , slowly . ) Maybe I 've nothing to forgive . God knows I 've a lot to be forgiven for . Ye see , I meant to shoot that man , and so it 's as bad as if I did it . And ( deliberately ) I know I 'd do it again if the devil was in me as he was that night . Sue Sue ( C. ) But wo n't you take me home and trust me ? Ira Ira Beasley I 've found out I ca n't trust myself . I do n't know as I 'm fit to have a home . Though ( touching his coat and beard with a faint display of pride ) I 'll allow I 've laid out a little money on myself , since  --  since  --  ( with a deep sigh , and ajler a little pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all wrong about that man . Ira Ira Beasley You never looked like that at me , you never dressed like that for me , add if I saw it again I know I 'd want to kill somebody . You see , I ca n't trust myself . I 'm not fit to have a wife ; I 'm not fit to have a home . The dead man stands between us . I 'm best alone . ( Turns to go . ) ( Knocking heard at door . ) ( Sheriff 's voice without . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Open , in the name of the law ! Ira Ira Beasley That voice ! Who are you ? Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas The Sheriff of Bolinas ! Ira Ira Beasley My God ! Impossible ! Sue Sue Thank Heaven ! ( Ira opens door C. and Sheriff enters . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( Looking round stage . ) All cleared out  --  eh ? ( To Ira . ) I 'm a witness ye did n't expect to see in this yer trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas Well  --  does it look like it ? Though I reckon it war n't your fault that bullet lodged itself in my leg instead of my head . And to think that I 've laid quiet so long and I 've tracked down my man only to see him get away ! ( Crosses R. ) Ira Ira Beasley ( Uneasily . ) Alive ! And with me and Sue again . Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas ( To Ira . ) And do n't you worry about me either . If you want to keep clear o ' me take your wife home . ( Enter Parson . ) Sheriff Sheriff of Bolinas The Parson told me that you had come here to own up to my murder , and I came here as a witness to show I was n't dead . Goodbye , and bad luck to Lone Farm ! ( Exit Sheriff C. ) Sue Sue ( R.C. , to Ira . ) There  --  you see how wrong you have been . Ira Ira Beasley ( L.C. , doggedly . ) There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to that night ? Sue Sue ( To Parson , in acute distress . ) Oh , what shall I do ? I want to show him I am sorry ? Parson Parson Davies Tell him the truth . Sue Sue What would he say ? Parson Parson Davies Shall I speak for you ? Sue Sue Yes . Parson Parson Davies ( To Ira . ) Jim Wynd was hidden in your loft that night . Ira Ira Beasley ( Indifferently ) . Well  --  he 'd got to hide somewhere . Parson Parson Davies He was secreted there , he was fed there , he was supplied there with a disguise by  --  your wife . ( Sue sits on chair L. of table R. , covers her face with her hands , and sobs . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( With a sudden burst of intense passion . ) Then it was for him ! That was why she dressed her hair and made herself smart  --  that  --  ( In a frenzy he raises his hand to strike Sue , who , without flinching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira Ira Beasley ( Lowering his hand and turning away as if in intense shame . ) You see , I ca n't trust myself . Parson Parson Davies ( Speaking very kindly . ) You have just shown me that you can control yourself . On that night I found your wife and that man , Wynd , talking to each other in the road . Ira Ira Beasley ( With a cry of pain . ) Oh ! Parson Parson Davies ( C. ) He had your horse by the bridle and he was begging her to go with him . She was resolutely declining , when I interfered between the two . Ira Ira Beasley ( Breathlessly . ) Well ? Parson Parson Davies He mounted your horse and rode away alone . Ira Ira Beasley ( L. ) D  --  n him  --  he was welcome to my horse ; but my wife  --  Parson Parson Davies It had been in her mind to go with Wynd that night . Ira Ira Beasley ( In agony . ) Oh ! Parson Parson Davies But before I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When from his own wicked lips she knew that Wynd , thinking he had killed the Sheriff , meant to saddle you with the murder , she hated him . Ira Ira Beasley But she promised to go . Parson Parson Davies Man ! Ca n't you see that this trial in your lives was sure to come ? Your loveless marriage was bound to be followed by trouble , and ca n't you go down on your knees and thank God that the trouble has come in such a form that it 's not too late to begin again ? Sue Sue ( Crosses to Ira . ) But I did n't go . Ca n't you forgive me ? Ca n't you take me home and trust me ? ( Kneels . ) Do n't you remember how we once lost a brown calf , one that we prized most , which had broken its rope and strayed away ?  --  how we wandered about half the wet night looking for it , broken-hearted , in the darkness , and then at last came back sadly to the cow-shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , waiting to be let in ? Ira Ira Beasley It broke its rope . Yes ! that was because it was always frisky and venturesome . Sue Sue No , Ira ; it was because it was young and tied up . Ira Ira Beasley ( To Parson . ) What 's she been doing since she left me ? Parson Parson Davies I took her into my own family . Until to-day she has not left it . When I told her you were coming here , to give yourself up for the murder of the Sheriff , she determined to come too , and save your life . You see she 's innocent and repentant Why , man ! does n't your heart tell you to forgive her ? ( Crosses to Ira . ) Ira Ira Beasley ( With outstretched arms . ) Yes . O Sue  --  Sue ! ( Sue rises . ) In my own way I 've always loved you  --  come to me again , and I 'll try to make it a better way . ( Sue , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) Parson Parson Davies That 's good ! ( Crosses to C. ) Ira Ira Beasley Yes ; and , Parson  --  ( with Sue 's face between his hands and gazing at her lovingly. )  --  Sue never looked like this at me before .
