MUCH has been accomplished , but much more remains to be done by the Civil Service Reformers . President Hayes ( seconded by Carl Schurz as Secretary of the Interior ) , gave them his hearty and vigorous assistance . Pres*dent Garfield would have done the same if his life had been spared . President Arthur made a change for the better in his course and conduct towards them , after the New York election of November , 1882 . In 1880 , there were signs of a great awakening in the public mind on the subject of administrative reform . Undoubtedly IDorman B. Eaton 's book on the Civil Service in Great Britain contributed largely to this revival . In the fall of 1880 , the Civil Service Reform Association of New York City started anew , and reorganized itself , with George William Curtis as President , and Everett P. Wheeler as Chairman of its ExeenLive Committee . This committee set to work in good earnest and framed two bills to be laid before Congress . They were drafted by Mr. Eaton . No man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . No man had studied the subject in all its details more diligently , or mastered it more thoroughly or discussed it at greater length . One of these bills provided for open competitive examinations for admission to certain branches of the subordinate Civil Service , and the other prohibited political assessments . Both were introduced into the Senate on the 10th day of January , 1881 . In February , Mr. Eaton and Mr. Wheeler , the one being a Republican and the other a Democrat , were sent on to Washington to see if they could find anybody there who would hear what they had to say about these bills . There were two gentlemen in Congress , both Democrats , who had become interested in the reform of the Civil Service , and who looked with compassion and sympathy upon the strangers from New York . They were Senator Pendleton of Ohio , and Representative Willis of Kentucky . The two bills had been referred to a select committee of the Senate , of which Mr. Pendleton , though not formally the chairman , appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing before this committee . When they came back to New York to make report of what they had seen and done , it was as if a couple of missionaries had just returned from the heathen . They brought good news . At least they thought so . They had been listened to with patience and courtesy . That of itself was encouraging . But more than this , senator Pendleton had concluded to put aside a bill of his own , to adopt in its place that one of the reformers that provided for competitive examinations , and to report it back to the Senate with an earnest recommendation for its passage . This was done on the 16th of February , and this bill was afterwards known as the " Pendleton bill . " But nothing further was heard of it that winter . Congress was fast drawing to a close , and on the 4th of March , President Hayes was to retire and President Garfield to be inaugurated . The Congressional Record of that session covers 2472 closely printed pages , but no speech or utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or con , can be found in this vast mass of Congressional verbiage . So deaf to the voice of public opinion and so blind to the signs of the times , were the men who composed the Forty-Sixth Congress . // The next two years brought about a wonderful change . On the 16th of January , 1883 , the Pendleton bill , in an amended form , having passed both houses of Congress , was approved by President Arthur . He appointed as Civil Service Commissioners , to aid him in carrying out the new statute , Dorman B. Eaton of New York , John M. Gregory , of Illinois , and Leroy D. Thoman , of Ohio . In February last , the President transmitted to Congress the first annual report of this Commission . It affords an opportunity to observe the practical operation of the new merit system of making appointments , as contrasted with the old spoils system . The first thing that we notice is the extremely limited application of the new statute . None of the post-masters , of whom the number is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their tenure of office or their salaries . Nor does it touch the mode of appointing any of the officers of the government , the appointment of whom is confirmed by the Senate . Senatorial patronage therefore , so far as regards the power of confirmation , is as yet undisturbed . Persons employed as laborers or workmen are also expressly excepted from the operation of the act . There are only three branches of the service that have thus far been subjected to the new system of appointment . The first embraces 5,652 clerkships and other places in the executive departments at Washington , with salaries not exceeding $1800 and not less than $900 per annum . The second embraces 2,573 places , with salaries varying from $900 to $1800 or over , in those customs districts , where the number of such places in each , are " all together as many as fifty . " There are only eleven such districts , to wit : Boston , Portland , Burlington , New York City , Philadelphia , Baltimore , New Orleans , Detroit , Port Huron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies to 5,699 clerks and other employees in those post offices , where the whole number of such clerks and employees in each , " together amount to as many as fifty . " There are twenty-three such post-offices and they are as follows : Boston , Providence , New York City , Brooklyn , Albany , Rochester , Buffalo , Newark , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Baltimore , Washington , New Orleans , Louisville , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Detroit , Indianapolis , Chicago , St. Louis , Milwaukee , // Kansas City , and San Francisco . Add together the number of places as above stated , in the departments at Washington and in the customs service and postal service , and you have an aggregate of 13,924 . According to the Report of the Corumission , there has been a subsequent increase , so as to carry the number above 14,000 . Stated then in round numbers , there are 14,000 clerks and other employees of the Government , who have been brought under the protection of the civil serviceact , and who hold their places independently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good beginning . The authors of the Pendleton bill never expected from it as its immediate result any thing more than such a begin . fling . They were practical men and not such visionary theorists as they were often represented to be . They might easily have projected a measure of reform that would have been farmore sweeping and radical . But they were dealing with the subject before them from a practical point of view , and they rejected all such radical propositions and suggestions as chimerical . They saw plainly that it would be impracticable to induce Congressmen to surrender all their patronage at a single stroke . They said to themselves " This is a reform that may be accomplished gradually . We can not do every thing all at once . We will first make an experiment , and the American people shall see how it works . We will select and set off by themselves a few sections or branches of the Civil Service . We will cut them off from all connection with the spoils system , and from the partisan and machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the operation of the merit system . " And this is what has been done by the civil service act . Some of the other features of the reformed system in actual practice can only be touched upon in the fewest words possible . According to the Report of the Commission , the whole number of applicants examined was 3,542 . The number of thosewho were successful , having been graded above the minimum of sixty-five ( the figure for the maximum of complete proficiency being 100 ) was 2,044 . Of these , the number appointed to the service during the period of six months from July 16r 1883 ( until which date the old methods of appointment were // continued ) to January l6th,1884 , was 516 . Of these , sixtyfive per cent . were educated in the common schools alone . This interesting fact sufficiently disposes of the objection that the new system would create an aristocracy or bureaucracy of college graduates . It has been well said , that this is especially *a people 's reform , that it deposes bosses as the dictators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide to all the people . Again , the Reformers have never regarded competitive *examinations as a perfect and final test of fitness . Accordingly , the civil service act and the rules promulgated under it , pro . vide for a probationary service of six months , before any absolute appointment can be made . It is also to be noted that the act is so framed that the reformed system may be extended to *other parts of the executive service , whenever the President shall so direct , without the necessity of additional legislation . It is a prevailing error , that the reform under review aims at a life tenure or some other kind of permanent tenure of office . The civil service act and rules only prohibit removals for refusal to contribute to any political fund or to render any polit. ical service . They steer carefully clear of all the vexed questions of tenure . . This reform is inconsistent of course with the doctrine of rotation in office , which is an element of the spoils system . But it is plain that the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , the moment it is seen that the places thus vacated can no longer be filled on partisan grounds , or with political or personal favorites , without reference to their merits . Section ten of the civil service act may be referred to as an illustration of the destructive effect of the reformed system upon Congressional patronage . It provi ( les that no recoinmeidation from a Congressman except as to the character or residence of the applicant shall be received or considered . To prevent misapprehension , it may also be noted , that the Commission under the power given it in the act , excepts from examination a few persons such as confidential clerks and secretaries , cashiers , interpreters , stenographers , and others . The civil service act was drawn with wisdom and foresight so as to avoid constitutional questions and difficulties . It does // not take away any power of appointment vested in the President or other executive officers . But this power is one of choice . It is " a right of selection for appointment among several . " Congress may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is filled by a selection by the appointing officer from the four names certified to him by the Commission , as among those graded highest in the list of those who have passed the examination successfully and have thus become eligible . The act is not mandatory upon the President . It does not require him , but only authorizes him to appoint the Commissioners . And they are required " to aid the President , as he shall request , in preparing suitable rules to carry this act into effect . " The whole thing , as has well been said , presupposes a friendly President , the whole aim of the examinations being to bring to his notice the qualifications of those who seek to enter the service . Five sections of the civil service act are directed against the evils of political assessments . Congressmen as well as executive officers and employees are prohibited from soliciting or receiving them . No person is allowed to solicit or receive them in the public offices or in the navy yards or arsenals . No officer or employee mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official rank or compensation of any other officer or employee , for giving or withholding a contribution for a political purpose . The violation of any of these provisions is made a misdemeanor , punishable by fine or imprisonment or both , and the offence , if the offender be in the service , is good cause for his removal . Averaged at the sum of one thousand dollars , the salaries of the 14,000 to whom the act applies , would amount to fourteen millions of dollars . An assessment or tax of two per cent . on this sum would yield a fund for electioneering purposes of two hundred and eighty thousand dollars . Hereafter , no part of this fund can be collected by intimidation and extortion as heretofore . Still , the provisions against assessments are not so searching and comprehensive , as the bill that was framed in New York and intro duced into the Senate as already stated , in January , 1881 , which bill however did not pass the House of Representatives . Mention is made in the Report of the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two States , " in the form of surreptitiously sending or carrying circulars into the departments at Washington , by which contributions were solicited from those in the public service in aid of the political funds of those States . " As the act now reads , it will be difficult to procure or sustain a conviction for sending such circulars by mail . That point was covered in the bill referred to , in terms so explicit as to leave no room for construction . Unfortunately , the civil service act provides that appointments shall be apportioned among the several States , according to population . This provision was inserted in the Senate , as an amendment to the Pendleton bill . It interpolates an inconsistency into a system based solely on merit . It is an extension to the States of the old doctrine of the spoils system in respect to individuals , that every one has a right to an office It is a penalty upon superior intelligence , and a premium on comparative ignorance . One other amendment deserves notice . The original Pendleton bill adopted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington , and provided for a similar arrangement into classes of the clerks and other employees in the customs offices and post-offices to which it should apply . It then provided that original entrance into the service so classified should be at the lowest grade , and that promotions should be made from the lower grades to the higher on the basis of merit and competition . This was all plain and simple . It was just and proper that new comers should begin at the bottom , and work their way up . The Senate struck out the provision in reference to promotion and entrance at the lowest grade . This amendment was made on the motion of Senator Brown of Georgia , with the avowed purpose of giving Democrats from outside an equal chance for entrance to the higher grades with those Republicans who should be promoted from lower grades , it being assumed that the lower grades were filled with Republicans . The amendment was a concession to the spoils system . It materially impaired the significance and value of the classification . It gave rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which however have hardly been realized . It seems that in actual practice , ninetyeight // per cent . of the entrances to the service under the act , have been at the lower grades . Then again , competitive examinations for promotion are not so essential as is often supposed . There is no such necessity or occasion for them , as in the case of original entrance to the service . There are no such examinations for promotion in the British postal service , and not ten per cent . of the other promotions in the British Civil Service are subjected to them . As a general rule , those candidates should be promoted who have made the best record of merit in the service below . The Civil Service Reformers have become a political power . They have fought their battles and achieved their victories before the courts , at the polls and in the halls of legislation . In 1881 , discovery was made of an act of Congress passed in 1876 , leveled against executive officers and employees of the Government , appointed without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdemeanor for them to request or receive from other officers or employees " any money or property or other thing of value , for political purposes . " It so happened that a man named Curtis had violated this statute . He was a special agent of the treasury department at Washington , and while holding this position , he became the treasurer of the Republican State Committee of New York , and as such , in the canvass that preceded the election of 1881 , he received from other employees of the Federal Government the assessments imposed upon them by the circular note of the State Committee , directing the payments to be made to him . When the Reformers came to consider the question of the prosecution of Curtis , there were many doubts and misgivings . There were no funds in hand for undertaking so formidable an enterprise , and there were other practical difficulties . Some of them were overcome , and as to the rest , it was concluded to face them boldly and take the chatices as to the result . The first indictment against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground of a misnomer . In May he was indicted again , under the correct name of Newton M. Cartis , and on this indictment he was tried and convicted in the United States Circuit Court , sitting in New York City . He was sentenced to pay a fine of one thousand dollars , which fine was paid , after an affirmance of the // conviction and of the constitutionality of the act under which it was had , by the full bench of the Circuit Court , and by the Supreme Court of the United States . This result was vastly more than the defeat and punishment of an individual . It was * victory over the political machine of which he happened to be only the operator . It was a triumph over an established system , and upon a point touching the pretended constitutional rights of office-holders , hitherto regarded by its votaries as sacred and impregnable . It gave great strength to the Reform*rs in the estimation of the public . They had flooded the country with their pamphlets and stuffed the newspapers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too busy to read them , who were nevertheless greatly affected by the intelligence of the conviction of Curtis , and who then for the first time began to see that there might after all be something of practical consequence in this movement for reform . It has been the good fortune of the Reformers , indeed it is to some extent the secret of their success , that they have had the press on their side . Take , if you please , half a dozen large independent journals , representing di verse interests and circulating among different classes of readers , such as Harpers Weekly , The New York Times , The New York Herald , arid The Evening Post . Bring them together on the approach of an important election Wheel them into line and make them move in harmony , and if your cause is a just and righteous one , you have an engine of political warfare as powerful and effective as any that has been invented . ft was such an engine as this that the Reformers had to help them in the canvass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day after day and week after week it discharged its volleys , " hot and heavy , " of solid argument and of telling facts , of scathing invective and of poignant wit , against the abuses and scandals of the 5p01l5 system , against the supercilious indifference towards reform of the dominant party in Congress and the deliberate violation of the promises and pledges of conventions and phitforms , and against the organized system of robbery and black-mail involved in the levying of political assessments , as practiced by Honorable Jay A. Hubbell , " of Bedouin ancestry , " chairman and treasurer of the Republican Congressional Executive Committee . // The result is well known . The State of New York , which in 1880 gave Garfield a majority over Hancock of 21,033. in 1882 gave Cleveland a majority over Folger of 192,854 . The elec tions in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and other States showed similar results . The effect upon Congress of this revolution of public opinion is admirably described in the Address delivered at Newport in August , 1883 , at the annual meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis , upon whose presidency and leadership , the Reformers have numberless reasons to congratulate themselves . " When we met here a year ago , " said Mr. Curtis , " Congress was still in session . The Pendleton bill had been reported to the Senate , but no action had been taken . The House of Representatives* with ribald sneers at the project of reform , had con temptuosly granted the President three-fifths of the pittance which he had urgently ' asked to enable him to continue efforts of reform which had been begun . The record of the proceedings upon this subject in the House of Representatives last summer is one of the most di*graceful passages in the history of Congress . " * * * * " The Congress which had adjourned in August laughing at reform , heard the thunder of the elections in November and re-assembled in December .. If members had been draped in sheets and had carried candles , they could not have borne a more penitential aspect . " The Pendleton bill underwent an active debate in the Senate , and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed it as it came to it from the Senate , without the least alteration . Its action was summary and precipitate . Mr. Curtis speaks of it as follows : " The House which was so eager to make the bill a law that it would not tolerate debate and loudly cheered the proposal of an immediate vote , was the same house that five months before had derisively and angrily refused to give a paltry sum and to aid a single experiment of reform . Men who could not laugh loud enough at the ridiculous whim of transacting the public business on business principles , now tumbled over each other in their breathless haste to make that whim the national policy . " Considerable progress has been made in the extension of the reformed system to the States and municipalities . Civil ser* // vice acts were passed by the legislature of New York in May , 1883 , and an excellent commission is now on duty there , consisting of John Jay , Augustus Schoonmaker and Henry A. Richmond . The point towards which the Reformers have recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation which prescribes a term of office of four years for a large portion of the officers who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate . The first statute in the series was passed in 1820 . It was explicitly condemned by Jefferson , Madison , Webster , and Calhoun . " The law itself , " to quote again from the Address of Mr. Curtis , " vacates the office , and gives the President the means of rewarding a favorite , without exercising the power of removal . It thus enables him to displace a satisfactory officer without the responsibility or odium of dismissing him . " As these lines are being written , the prospect of the desired repeal at the present session of Congress is not encouraging . On the 21st of April , the House of Representatives refused by a vote of 146 to 99 to suspend the rules , so as to allow the bill to repeal to be taken up and passed . Greater discouragenents than this , however , have been encountered and overcome . The present agitation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , the same as the Army and Navy . Competitive examinations and the rest of the new machinery are only the means to an end . They have only become necessary by reason of the immense increase and enlargement of the Civil Service , so that it is simply impossible for the Executive to determine , by the ordinary methods of inquiry and recommendation , which of the applicants are the most fit and suitable for appointment . The end which the reformers seek is not an innovation , but a restoration  --  the restoration in place of the spoils system , of the merit system and its principles , as practiced under Washington , Adams , Jefferson and Madison . They want nothing more , and they will be content with nothing less .
