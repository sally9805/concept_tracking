txt Dr. Bliss said at 8 o'clock to-night that he regarded the President 's condition as more critical than at any time since his illness . " When did the change for the worse occur ? " was asked . " Last night , soon after the evening bulletin was issued , " replied the Doctor . " It was then that the vomiting began . We had all along kept the strictest watch upon the President 's stomach . We could not have exercised greater care with this organ than we did . We fully appreciated the very great importance of keeping it in order . We knew what an important factor it was in a case like the President 's , in which so much depends upon keeping up the patient 's strength . When the nausea appeared , it fell like a thunderbolt upon us . We at once realized the gravity of the crisis . We saw the immediate danger in which it nlaced the patient , and we naturally became apprehensive . There has been no improvement in the condition of his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were indications of amelioration . But these were of brief duration . He has not been able to retain anything upon his stomach  --  not even water . We have , however , administered nourishment by injection four times to-day . The last was given to him about 7 o'clock and has produced good results . But unless the stomach resumes its functions he can not , in his debilitated . condition , survive many days . If it were not for his wound we could nourish him by the injection method for some time , but as he has to sustain the heavy ( wain made upon his strength by the discharge of the pus from his wound , the failure of the stomach to retain food reaching it in the natural way must be attended with fatal results in a short time . If the President does not improve in this respect to-morrow , I shall be prepared for the worst . " " Is the President cognizant of the gravity ol ; his condition ? " " Certainly he is . He is very particular about being kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and we answer him without reserve . To-day we gave him the result of the examination of his pulse , temperature , and respiration , and the reasons for the high pulsation . He did not appear perturbed , but was , on the contrary , quite cool and composed . " " Do you regard the case as hopeless , Doctor ? " " By no means , " replied Dr. Bliss . " It is very critical , indeed , but not desperate . " " How is the wound getting along ? " " Admirably . It looked better this evening than it has yet . " " The stomach , then , is the sole cause of the relapse ? " " Entirely , " said the Doctor . " Do you think he will overcome the present trouble ? " " I can not tell , but the President is such a brave man and has had such a good physique that I have strong hopes of an improvement during the night . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
