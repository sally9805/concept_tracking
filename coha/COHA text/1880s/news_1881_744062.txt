txt The torrent of bills pouring in upon the desks of the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate grows with every session of Congress . On Tuesday , with a call of but 18 States in the House , 754 bills were presented . Had the remaining States been called , this number would , no doubt , have been more than doubled . Every imaginable variety of legislation was embraced in this mass of propositions . More than one-half of them , or 443 , were of a private nature  --  that is , with rare exceptions they were intended to draw money from the Treasury for some purpose not provided for in the general appropriations . It is surprising to know that after more than sixteen years of peace there should be 208 applications for special grants of pensions . It would seem that every possible legitimate claim on the bounty of tile Government for services rendered in a war now sixteen years closed could have been brought within some general regulation . That there are still some cases not so included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pension Committee of either house ; but the fact is greatly to the discredit of the law-making body . But , even in such cases , it is obvious that some examining body better fitted than a Congressional committee to get at the facts should be created to whom claims could be referred . Apart from the great number of private bills , hardly any of which form any proper subject for legislation , or can be disposed of with any thoroughness or fairness by the Congressional committees , the new bills include every form and shade of personal hobby and of political fancy . One gentleman asks to have the right to tax United States notes given to the States  --  a frank and complete abandonment of the soyereignity of the Nation , which a very slight knowledge of the Constitution or of the principle on which the Government essentially rests would instantly condemn . Another wishes the trade dollar made a legal tender . We have already three varieties of full legal tender , and three more of partial legal tender . Of these the most vicious is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence of a member of Congress who , at this late day , proposes to add a seventh kind , differing from all the others , and consisting of a coin which has been nearly driven out of circulation  --  where it never should have entered as an unqualified nuisance ? Still another member , this time from Louisiana , and a man of ordinary sanity , proposes to re-establish an income tax , At a moment when the responsible officers of the Government , to the limited extent that we have any officers with responsibility for their suggestions to Congress , are devising means of reducing the burden of taxation , this Louisiana statesman would replace a portion of the tax on whisky by a tax on incomes ? than which nothing more clumsy , unpopular , and unsuited to the temper of the people or the capacity of our civil service was ever devised . It is unnecessary to add that he is wholly oblivious of the absurd and extravagant burden now laid upon sugar , one of the necessities of daily life , a tax which extorts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average rate of nearly GO per cent . In addition to these propositions , there are , of course , the usual batch of bills for subsidies more or less extravagant and more or less disguised , but all of them the offspring of the fascinating theory that it is the duty and right of Congress to bleed the people generally for the benefit of a favored few . The most obvious reflection in this connection , and one which must occur to any observer at all familiar with the work of Congress , is that the lower house especially I is very poorly adapted to take proper charge of the vast body of proposed legislation . Neither its membership , its organization , its mode of action , nor its tenure of office is such as to qualify it to deal with such an extraordinary and difficult labor . It is made up of men of little more than average intelligence ; its members often go out with each recurring election , and rarely remain more than two or three terms ; its committees change materially and generally radically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political change , and so extensive and constant is the confusion which reigns in its proceedings that it is only by a good deal of sheer luck that really important measures secure the degree of attention which they should have . The most serious objection , therefore , to this piling up of bills upon its Clerk 's desk IS that , even where no harm comes of them , they absorb energy and time , all and more than all of which is needed for matters of actual moment . We do not know that under the present system there is any practicable remedy for this evil . So long as we elect nearly three hundred Representatives , chosen in moderately large constituencies , for a short time , and turn them in to work their respective wills , as far as a majority of them can agree , with the " general welfare " of a people of fifty millions , we shall undoubtedly see with each new Congress a greater number of crude , or petty ; or selfish propositions engrossing the attention of Congress . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposes clearly defined responsibility upon a definite number of its leading members , we must expect to see many of these propositions enacted into laws , to the detriment of good government , to the confusion of the statutes , and to the cost and annoyance of the people . But as the affairs of the Nation increase in extent , importance , and complexity , the necessity of some improvement in these regards will become more apparent and more urgent . In the meantime there is a certain check in the good sense of Congress as a whole , which is generally far superior to what might be inferred from the character of the majority of its members . With some tendency to magnify its office ? a tendency to which it yields but too often ? there is still a strong disposition to check at an early stage most of the undisciplined zeal of the men who pour new bills by the thousand upon the Clerk 's desk . It is to this that the country , for the present , must trust .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
