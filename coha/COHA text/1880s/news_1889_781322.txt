txt When Harry Phillips , One of the Pension Office employes under the late Corporal Tanner of generous memory , celebrated his rerating with a diener at one of the betels hero , and Tanner drUnk that memorable toast about " confusion to the surplus , " it was regarded as a foolish thing , and very little attention was paid to it . But there is a very decided disposition manifested in the Congress to regard the surplus as something that ought to be got rid of in any way except by the reduction of taxes . It does not crop out alone in such measures as the bill to refund the direct taxes which Senator Morrill has brought forward , nor in the battered Education bill that Blair has included in his budget of oranerles . The bundle of public building bills . in both houses , is an indication of a feeline that an overflowing Treasury can be most satisfactorily emptied by Senators and Representatives by plunderlug it after it has been unnecessarily and wickedly gorged with ill-gotten taxes , rather than by ad amending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extravagant expenditures . It is apparent that Senator Dolph has come to the conclusion that the surplus is and that the people who made it are inclined to have it spent on the great Northwest . Ho has introduced a great many bills , and they indicate a willingness to spend the taxes of the people freely that is a revelation or Senatorial generosity . One of these bills is a proposition that the United States shall give to the State of Oregon live townships in and about the neighborhood of Crater Lake for a public park , the state to maintain this park after the grant has been made . Another bill gives to the city of The Dales a part of The Dillies military reservation , also to be a a public park . Neither of these bills takes any money out of the Treasury , but each deprives the Government of land that might be sold to put money into the Treasury . His hilt ? to provide tor fortifications and other seacost defenses " Is a " thumper . " It asks for an appropriation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct defenses at all the principal ports en the Atlantic and Pacific coasts , the lake ports , and on the Gulf or Mexico . A gun factory , to cost $1,000000 and to be erected on the Pacific ) coast , is to come out of the appropriation . It is apparently for the purpose of establishine one of the fortifications that are to cost a part of this $120,000,000 that the Senator has introduced another bill to authorize the purchase of a site on Puget Sound . without stating even an approximate price for the lands to be picked out . Then he has a third bill appropriating $1,000,000 to be used in the purchase of sites for fortifications where sites have Dot already Wen reserved or acquired . To provide Portland with a public building he has Introduced a bill appropriating $500,000 . He asks also for another public building at Salem . Oregon . but It is only to cost the small sum of $100,000 , which seems insignificanc after one has read the Fortifications bill A little bill upon which no computation of coat has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-commissioned officers or the army . It proposes that any pre Tate soldier or non-commissioned officer who has served twenty-five years may be retired with 75 per cant , of the pay of his rank . Au enlisted man who has served twenty years and been disabled in the line of duty may be retired on tile amp ? terms as to retired pay . A second section or the bill allows any enlisted man who served one year in the war of the rebellmo , either as officer , non-commissioned officer , or private , and who- had completed twenty years of service , continuous or otherwise , to be retired . at 75 per cent . of his pay at retirement . There is an insignificant little bill from the same Senator asking for the delivery to the State of Washington of ordnance stores of the - value of $12,398 55 , borrowed by Oregon during the Nez Perces war of 1877 , and not returned . A larger one is a bill appropriating $3,296,658 81 to pay a balance said to be due to claimants ir , Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still another and very generous bill is one of which there is no computation of cost . It proposes that " every person who joined , assisted , or was associated with the military forces of the United States " in Oregon , Idaho , and Washington during the Nez Perces , Bannock , and Shoshone wars in 1877 and 1878 , and not heretofore paid by the United States , shall be paid at the rate of 53 a day for their services . All persons who performed services not of a military character , and who have not yet been paid , are invited to present their bills to the Secretary of the Treasury , who io authorized to nay as much as he sees tit . All persons wounded or Gieabled in the service in these wars are to be entitled to the benefits of the pension laws . this is not all that Senator Dolph has found to offer by way of reducing the surplus . He has one bill to pay $28,140 75 for claims for Indian depredations recognized in a treaty with the Rogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to appropriate $5,000,000 to pay depredation claims investigated by the Secretary of the Interior , and by him reported to the Congress . A modest bill to authorize ale payment to Oregon of $13,845 84 " for euppuee furnished to the soldiers , " date not mentioned , is the last of the budget so far as ascertained . Here Is a summary , withallowances for those bills on which no careful coinputatiors have been made : And the session of the Congress is not yet a mouth obi.
