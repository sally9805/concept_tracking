txt Can currency notes be safely issued by State banks ? A few years ago that would have seemed an idle question , but conditions have changed ; and to-day it seems not only no longer idle but sufficiently pertinent and practical to be discussed at some length by the Hon. Wilms S. PALNE. , Superintendent of the Banking Department of this State . His views are entitled to weight , for he is a man of ability and he has conducted his department carefully and . intelligently . When , therefore , he , presents an argument in favor of the issue of notes by State banks , it may at least be assumed that it is as strong as can be made . Mr. PAmn 's plan has been published in our columns . It contemplates a national currency through State bank agencies . It is indeed the present national bank system , so far as note issues are concerned , with the substitution of other bonds for United States bonds . He would have the notes printed , as now , by the National Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would secure them against counterfeiting . He would have the securities deposited . held by the Controller of the Currency , " to be sold . for the purpose of redeeming the circulating notes in cases where the banks failed . to redeem them . " This would . be practically a Government guarantee for the par value of the notes . The serious question , therefore , is , What would be these securities to be deposited . by the banks ? Mr. PAINE describes them as follows : 1 . The stocks or bonds of any State in the Union that has not within ten years defaulted in the payment of any part of either principal or interest of any debt authorized by any Legislature of such State to be contracted . 2 . In the stocks or bonds of any city , county , town , or village in such State , issued pursuant to the authority of a law of that State . Stocks or bonds of a body politic to be unavailable when the indebtedness exceeds a certain percentage of the assessed valuation of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be provided , apart from United . States bonds , which must . sooner or later , become unavailable ; but , if they be the best , are they sufficient ? We think not , and for the chief reason that they could not be promptly and . surely turned into cash in case of an emergency . That they might be ultimately sufficient to repay any loss the Government might sustain is very probable , but that is not enough . The people who take the notes and . use them as money from day to day must not only be sure that they will ultimately get their money , but that they will , with absolute certainty , get it the moment they want it . Anything short of this certainty firmly fixed in the public mind , so that there should never at any time be any shadow of doubt , even of mistaken doubt , regarding it , would not prevent a panic as to the notes .. And a possibility of panic is fatal to any bank currency . ' We have not known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as to any of the issues of the great national banks abroad  --  England , France , Germany . We could . not adopt a system under which such a possibility would occur or could occur without putting ourselves at a grave disadvantage .. It may be said . that there could be no fear , because the Government would . at all times stand ready to redeem the notes , having ample means of recovering its advances . But this would involve the keeping by the Government of a sufficient reserve with which to meet any notes pre'sented . To make it perfectly certain thatnotes would be paid . on presentation , money must be kept on . hand to pay them . The Government can not go into that kind of business . It ought not to do so if it could , and it would not be allowed to do so if it were never so proper that it should . The temper of the people is against it . Congress would . not venture to enact it . Whatever may be the system that shall replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that the one suggested by Mr. PAINE is not likely to do so .
