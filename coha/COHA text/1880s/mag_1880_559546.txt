FROM courses of reasoning , founded upon abstract theory , Lord Bacon helped greatly to turn mankind toward a reasoning founded upon fact . He framed a logical appeal to all philosophers , begging them to abandon the inquiry how many angels might take up a position on the point of a needle , and espouse the question how many men , women , and children should live in a room ten feet square , or how many bushels of wheat may reasonably be expected from an acre of ground , and by what instrument may the grain be harvested , and by what bag or wagon or car may it be best transported to a market . It seemed to him amazing that man had not gathered up all the facts about the winds , the rains , and the soils , to deduce from those habits or qualities lessons of immediate usefulness . Virtually , Bacon was the discoverer of earth in contradistinction from those who had discovered only the world of the spiritual , and fanciful , and the enigmaticaL Philosophy has gone beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dismissing the fanciful and in clinging to the actual , the pupil at last out .. does the instructor . The children of this great earthly house are studying well their temporary home , trying to repair it , and even to decorate it ; but their task is arduous , for great was the damage done the mansion in all the middle centuries . It is one of the pleasures of the passing times to note what strange results are coming from this almost universal study of the earth by those who once studied only an abstract theology or a metaphysical form of science ; but this delight is yet much modifled by the unavoidable reflection that many individual minds and many districts of country , called civilized regions , are still " up in the air " in all their forms of theory and practice . It is particularly true of that professional pursuit called the pulpit , that it betrays the utmost reluctance to a faithful building up of this world in all // 357 its temporal interests , and in many ways expresses the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lands upon Jordan 's better side . In harmony with this humble estimate of this little planet , a clergyman recently , after performing a marriage ceremony for a youthful couple at the altar , submitted to their thought a brief address to the effect that marriage is only a handmaid of salvation , that the chief duty of husband and wife is to help hold each other from falling into the sin of unbelief ; an address not particularly bad , but indicating how wont the pulpit at large is to try to sail through the sea of this life , that sea of a thousand glorious islands , without making a landing in a single alluring harbor . Many , perceiving this defect of the Christian clergy , will thank John Ruskin for his recent little letters to a group of Churchmen , in which he urges them to condense their Christianity into those doctrines outlined in the Lord 's Prayer . While it is evident that no geographical division of the Christian Church may boast of a pulpit which studies sufficiently the temporal welfare of society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man in the assumed eternity , yet it must be confessed by all fair-minded persons that the pulpit of the old slave States surpasses its companion pulpits in the North and in Europe in its neglect of the surrounding multitudes , and perhaps in its ignorance of their wants . Our national Government , yielding to the public taste for facts and for information particularly regarding the habits and riches of the material America , has recently published maps of the coal formations and of the limestone and ore deposits ; and , gathering courage as it advanced , it has even issued maps of fever and ague , and of education and ignorance . Having , for example , adopted yellow as the color of malarial disease , that color deepens where the disease increases , and fades in the high and dry countries , so that a person not fond of sickness can tell by a glance at his map where he and his little ones would best pitch tent for a season or for life . Thus information which once came by legend , or by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable , by experience , comes now by a simple glance at an open map of human malady . No one can look for a moment upon these governmental leaves without wishing that our statisticians might be able to lay before us charts of the Christian Pulpit , revealing to our wondering eyes places and times where that moral and mental force has waxed and waned in ages past , and places where now that same influence were rising or falling , were living or dead . If the red color , the // common emblem of love and charity , were assumed to stand for this gospel power , and a map of the pulpit were elaborated in the different tints of that general hue , it is evident the deepest red would be found in the region of the cities of New York and Brooklyn ; for it seems equally evident that , while a generation ago the deepest color would have been found farther north where New England preached and prayed , the average of pulpit greatness has slowly moved away toward the Hudson . But , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be perceived that , as this color-wave passes into the valley of the Susquehanna , it perceptibly fades , and passing onward into Virginia it grows paler still , and at last becomes in the Gulf States too delicate a tint for the unaided eye to detect ; and the one tracing the interesting stream must raise his eyes at Mobile and New Orleans , with the words , " No greatness of pulpit here . " The fact is not pleasurable , but sad . In all the many forms of happiness and human welfare , the pulpit of the past has acted a large part as discoverer and advocate and defender . Led by the mysterious sentiment of religion , the whole human family has , in its three forms of youth and middle life and old age , gone up to the temple of the Almighty not only to seek forgiveness of sins , but to seek guidance in the paths of varied duty . In the absence of a visible or audible God , His place has been supplied by chosen men called rabbis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peculiar only in some minor qualities of dress or office . These have always spoken to the people in the name of Heaven , and are the only teachers on earth who have ever had for their audience all the human family , and who have had the ear and the heart of all the formative years of youth ; and , what is still more momentous , have spoken to the mind and heart as affected by conscience , and by all the hopes and fears of an impressive world to come . The statesmen have not enjoyed the advantage of having an audience furnished them every Sunday-an audience called together by conscience and by a powerful mystery . No philosophers or orators or common casuists have been permitted to address constantly all the young minds of any generation , and to add to their words the sanction of the Deity and those motives called heaven and hell . It has been the privilege of the clergy alone to find a perpetual audience , which dissolves only to reassemble , and which comes in that form of youth which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature age which craves guidance and consolation . The spec- // 359 tacle of the Christian multitudes assembling once each week to listen to men speaking in the name of the infinite love and the infinite wisdom , is one that has no parallel in our world , full as it is of multiform influences . If , therefore , any one mindful of this vantage ground held by the clergyman shall look through the Southern States of the nation , and shall see there a ruined or a failing pulpit . his reflections will not be pleasurable , but will be as pathetic as though the winds were repeating to his heart the words , " How are the mighty fallen ! " This failure or lamentable shortcoming has resulted from a combination of causes . In the diagnosis of a case of sickness , physicians are often compelled to declare that several diseases have met in their patient , and that they know not what form of enemy to attack , nor by what path the dissolution will come . All must at first smile at that attending doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the demise of a citizen , that " he never was well . " Amid a complication and surplus of causes , an exact diagnosis was gracefully declined by the wise man . It is the first impulse of all who think of the Southern pulpit to abandon the thought with the generalization that " it never was well " ; but that land is so inviting , the people so warm-hearted , the climate so mild , the women so beautiful , the present and future so full of peril , and reform so perfectly possible , that only criminal indolence or indifference can dismiss with a contemptuous word the average clergyman of that part of our domain . All will at once affirm that the institution of slavery laid low this organized eloquence , and indeed a large part of the explanation must be found in the fact that two hundred years ago our ancestors mixed a slow poison in the Southern cup . Unwittingly , the fathers poisoned their children . Under a political and social philosophy which stole labor , all intellectual pursuits declined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is brought out by action , just as the luster of the diamond is brought into existence by the polishing process of the lapidary . Of all labor , intellectual toil is the most exhausting , and an age must be full of industry of all forms before it will persuade even gifted minds to bend to the yoke of mental and spiritual labor . The fact that the largest number of our intellectual leaders passed their early years in comparative poverty does not necessitate the conclusion that poverty is the mother of mental greatness , but it does announce to us the fact that manual labor must precede mental labor , and // that cruel poverty , in compelling the former , prepares its pupil for the latter . Having been compelled to work , man accepts reluctantly of what he at first thinks a misfortune , and at last finds his calamity to be his success . In importing workmen from Africa in order to escape from the misfortune of drudgery , the South escaped at the same moment her triumph , and , at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as weak and as ignorant as she had been idle . While she stole labor , Nature in a dreadful equity was stealing away her intellect and sentiment . In this general fall of mental power , which included the brain of statesman , and scientific man , and novelist , and poet , the clergyman also went down . In such a retrospect must be found a large part of the reason for what we may call the failure of the Southern pulpit ; and what died by a slow process must revive with equal slowness . To the intellectual sluggishness which the prevalence of substitutional labor entailed upon all the forms of mental activity in common , slavery added a special shape of misfortune to the lot of the Southern clergyman . It divided society into three castes , and made him the pastor of only one division . In a slightly modified form , caste holds or held the South as firmly as it held India before it was subject to British rule . Three shapes of humanity lay before the parson of the cotton States  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immense merit attached to the first class ; the last class lay far aver toward the animal world , and salvation followed this law of decrease , and was offered with some zeal to the first families , was often suggested to the poor whites as being desirable , and died away wholly before it reached the ears of those whose complexion was of a dark or mixed character . Prevented thus by political interest and prejudices from dealing with those who most needed the teachings and pity of Heaven , compelled to harden his heart against the cries of those in bonds , and often in torments under the lash , the herald of Jesus Christ slowly became a dealer in intellectual abstractions , or an apologist for a shameful institution and its attendant personal vices . Without doubt the situation was peculiar : the slave was too contemptible to merit any salvation , the master too great to need any . Without possessing the mental power of Seneca , the Southern preacher resembled that moralist in the sublimity of his pupil . Nero was so illustrious as emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , and might put out of the way his own mother if she gave signs of living too long , or was too full of personal thought and opinion . The planter was // 361 some such a piece of human absolutism , and did not need much rebuke for sins , nor much instruction in the line of common morals , inasmuch as his position in society made him a natural heir of the good things of the two worlds . In all times the noblest politics , or philanthropy , or religion has been that which has carried in its heart the common people ; and the caste brought into a part of our land by enforced labor was , therefore , a perpetual drying up of that love which lies at the basis of the clergyman 's office . Hence the injury of the pulpit was deeper than that which fell upon letters and art and science , for they were only robbed of most of their activity ; but the pulpit suffered more , for , besides being weakened in intellect , what life and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exposed to either sin or perdition . The sermons fell upon only a small area , and fell there like a scanty shower in a burning desert . Let us advance now to contemplate a third reason why the Southern pulpit must be estimated as a moral failure . It fails utterly to grasp the meaning of the Christian religion . It assumes that the sole purpose of Christianity is to save the soul from sufferings after death , and to secure for it a certain great positive happiness in a second world ; whereas that religious system attempts a release also from sufferings here , and offers also a happiness in this first stage of man . No religion has ever exhausted itself upon the second life . Whether man 's religious ideas have formulated themselves in Egypt , or in Persia , or in India , or in Palestine under the Hebrews , they have made the virtue and the success and happiness of these threescore years at least the one half of their message and longing . In that highest form of philosophy man has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspread here , or lay reaching beyond these confines , it has been all of one piece , like the unity of childhood and middle life . If we open a Persian religion-the religion of those magis who came in such affection to honor the babe in tfie manger-we find their doctrines to be shapes of duty and of success on this side the grave . The Persians prayed that " they might never be carried away by anger , that angry words and looks might seem to them a sin , that they might reply to an enemy with gentleness , that they might contend constantly against evil morally and physically " ; " I would praise all good thoughts , words , and works : I would curse all evil thoughts , words , and works " ; thus disclosing their conviction that the paradise beyond death was only to be a continuation of a paradise well founded // here . Of similar purport is the theology of the ancient Egyptians . It did not call man a worm , and jump over his earthly career as being contemptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He loved his father , he honored his mother , he loved his brethren ; he never went away from home in anger ; he never preferred the great man to the humble one " ; " He gave bread to the hungry , water to the thirsty , clothes to the naked , shelter to the stranger . " To open the sacred chapters of the Greeks is to find in Pythagoras and Plato and Socrates and Xenophon the same estimate of religion , an estimate which makes it a sublime unfolding of human purity and charity . Pythagoras led the way in the formal statement of the divinest truths in the world around him . He said : " Man is perfected by communing with the gods , which he can do only when he abstains from evil and attempts to resemble the divine nature , and , secondly , by doing good to others . - . - We should eliminate from the body disease , from the mind ignorance , from the appetites luxury , from a city sedition , from a house discord , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer : " Grant me to become beautiful in the inner man , and that all outward things may be at peace with the things within . May I deem the wise man rich , and may I reach only such a portion of gold as a prudent man may employ ! " Plato took up the broken-off music , and , in his loftier notes , approached Christ 's greatest generalization , and uttered the words , " May I not do to others what I would not have them do to me ! "  --  the passive shape of the coming Golden Rule . It is notorious that in the religion of the greatest Latins this world was the most important arena . All was based upon the dignity and demands of this life , and both Aurelius and Seneca declared that the very essence of piety was to do the will of God in this life , and leave to the divine knowledge and wish the exist*ence of any life after this . Seneca says : " It is the care of the wise and good man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well he lives than how long ; for whether he shall die sooner or later is not his business , but whether he shall die ill or well . " Exactly such sentiments pervade the prayers of Aurelius and Epictetus . In parallel lines with all such pagan thoughts appears on the scene the religion of the Hebrews , confessed by all Christians to be the immediate fountain of the New Testament . But , strange to say , that Mosaic religion was wholly occupied in the reform of man 's earthly affairs . The antagonists of the theory // of a revelation adduce as an argument that the Old Testament makes no logical use of a future life . Evidently the mission of Mosaism was to build up an improved nation , an improved morals , and a better manhood . It made no effort to save man from a hell beyond the tomb . The theme of the whole period rises to its highest eloquence in Isaiah when he said , " Cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sins . " " Is not this the fast ( the worship ) that I have chosen ? to loose the bonds of wickedness , to undo heavy burdens , and that ye break every yoke and let the oppressed go free ? Is it not to deal out bread to the hungry , and that thou bring to thy house the poor that are cast out ? that when thou seest the naked thou cover him , and that thou hide not thyself from thinc own flesh ? " Employed chiefly in the affairs of state , when the Hebrew thought moved out upon the absolute doctrines of religion , it invariably made its altar a place where man learned his highest duty and drank in his noblest impulses . Thus , turn whither we may , go back as far as all records will lead us , read in all the old manuscripts or stand by all the old sculptured columns or tombs , and one song comes to us from these combined and harmonious voices , the burden of which song is that religion is an imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a purification of self and a perpetual intercession for others . You can not travel so far back in pagan or Hebrew times . as to get away from this general doctrine . Sir William Jones found upon an island in the Pacific , carved in Arabic over the door of a temple of God , these words : The world was given for our own uphuilding , not for the purpose of raising sumptuous houses ; life for the discharge of moral and religious duties , not for pleasurable indulgence ; wealth to be liberally bestowed , not avariciously hoarded ; and learning to produce good actions , not empty dis-putesan inscription which teaches us that even the islands of the sea unite with the continents in assuring us that religion is a combined care for God and for the immediate welfare of man . These citations and reflections come in now to justify our charge that the Southern pulpit has come to a condition of abject powerlessness , because it has failed to grasp the meaning of the gospel it has presumed to preach . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possessed exhaust itself upon some re // mote misfortune , and made those tears fall upon hell which should have fallen upon the sorrows of this life . If this pulpit in its decrepitude could frame a reply to this charge , it would say , " You have cited the religions of heathen , while I am busy with the religion of Jesus Christ . " The plea is heard , but it is in vain ; for Christ is only the final synthesis of all the imitation of God and service of man of which all other times have dreamed . St. Augustine in the fourth century perceived this , for he says , " What is called the Christian religion existed among the ancients , and was not absent from the beginning of the human race up to the time when Christ came , from which time it began to be called Christian . " But one may easily find better authority than Augustine in Christ himself . His discourses lie almost wholly within the field of duty between men . They are a perpetuation of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less clearness of sight , it having been the office of the Man of Nazareth to survey with divine mind what man had attempted to see through the veil of imperfect sense . It was this One who came at last to say , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . " Hence the Southern pulpit , in its long neglect to preach the elevation of man here , to proclaim the worth and the rights of the African race ; in its long cowardice shown toward dueling ; in its silence over street-encounters between white men , and over the sickening assassinations of poor negroes by day and by night ; in its utter want of even middle-age chivalry over the brutal massacre of the Chisolm family ; in its neglect to urge upon young men the unavoidable duties of industry and mental and moral culture-in all this whole catalogue of neglect it has revealed not only its inability to preach the religion of Jesus , but any other system of morals or piety which can be found even in pagan annals . Whenever that voice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States has touched at all earthly affairs , it has exhausted its logic and passion upon apologies for slavery ; and indeed the last printed form of piety it sent over the world was an argument tending to show that the bondage of the negro to the superior white race was a relationship natural and valuable , and that it must be for ever esteemed and preserved . Since the practical defeat it sustained in that direction the Southern pulpit has let alone all mundane affairs , and has confined itself with great fidelity to metaphysical disquisitions on the nature of Christ , upon the mode of baptism , the necessity of faith , the futility of human good works , the sovereignty of God , and the importance of making some formal // and immediate arrangement touching the next form of existence . Under which devotion to abstractions even the duelist has sunk to the lower condition of an assassin , and what was called once a statesman is content now to appear at night only and in the masked and sepulchral dress of a Ku-klux . Barbarous as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whitened in these darker days which have substituted for it the hideous form of murder . Much as one may denounce the challenge and the thirty paces in some secluded vale , yet all must regret that Dixon could not have had the privilege of some self-defense , and that Judge Elliott had not been invited to repair to some field with his weapons and his second , and that Chisolm and his tender daughter could not have enjoyed the code of the duello  --  a comparative gospel as it would now seem . Not that all these vices and crimes can be charged upon the deadness of the adjoining pulpit , but that the pulpit might have checked much this headlong course of crime , or might at least have made itself great and eloquent in the attempt . It was the hour for transforming preachers into heroes , but an hour unread , and passed by , therefore , in a peaceful religious sleep . The pulpit under our study will say : " We are orthodox clergymen . We preach nothing but Christ and him crucified . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not , like a Starr King or a Theodore Parker , or like all the semi-infidels of the North , go before our people with essays on industry and liberty and morality . We do not count much on mere morality . We preach salvation by faith in Jesus Christ . " And in such words we find further reason for the humble condition of the Southern pulpit . It has misconceived the nature of even its own form of orthodoxy . Admitting that certain doctrines called " orthodox " do belong to the Christian system , yet they do not exhaust the duties and powers of the clergyman ; for Paul himself made Felix tremble by a discourse upon temperance and " mere morality " ; and , sacred as the hours and opportunities of Jesus must have been , instead of finding no time for inculcating the lessons of the earthly life , he absolutely died before he had come to the doctrines which his followers preach with so much endless repetition . The Master preached the doctrines of human righteousness and responsibility in a manner never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox are true , they form only a part of Christianity , and the voice of the pulpit sins painfully and fatally if it does not include in its // themes all the duties , and equities , and amenities of this earthly career . it is possible that a special reason for the decline of the Southern clergy may be found in that narrowness of Christian doctrine which made it necessary for them to be guilty of endless repetitions . With only a half score of ideas to present , in the neverending reappearance of these the audience yawned and slept , and at last disappeared ; and , what was as bad as the gradual evaporation of the audience , there came the unwillingness of the clergyman to perform the labor necessary to the development of any new application of truth to society . It is the quality of all vain repetition that it kills not only the patience of the audience , but the mind of the performer . And , from some facts in the history of persuasion , it is to be believed that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very minds to which the innocent clergyman imagines he is bringing faith . Dr. Robert Hall tells of a preacher who proved so earnestly each Sunday the deity of Christ , that his audience became at last Unitarians from the mere reaction of too much argumentation . The convert from some pagan religion to Christianity accepted , after some logic and some entreaty from the missionary , the story of the whale and Jonah , and at the next Sunday lesson he advanced with some hesitation to the episode of Samson and the foxes ; but on the third Sunday , when he was asked to believe in the narrative about the three children in the furnace , he failed , and said , " And I wo n't believe any longer that story about Jonah . " His faith died of excessive argument . In part of such painful illness the Southern pulpit entered upon its last sickness ; for , undoubtedly , there is a preaching of Christ crucified which leads to the wonder whether such a being as Jesus lived and died , and , if so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , being taugl*t immersion for a thousand Sundays , it goes away and is baptized by sprinkling ; or , being taught for a thousand Sundays that all moralists will be lost , the mind , from a strange form of sympathy , longs more and more to attach itself to such moral companionship and risk their destiny . Let us assume that the doctrines of " orthodoxy " are true they are not the whole of Christianity , but , on the contrary , they are only for the most part the divine side of theology , and in preaching them the Southern pulpit has generally omitted its own business to attend to that of the Almighty . The nature of Jesus Christ , and the details of any settlement made between him and the Father , are // known only in the courts of heaven ; but that man must obey the laws of God , that he must care for his brother , that he must lift up his voice against all crime and injustice , are things known to man , and here is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this department of human welfare and duty , the pulpit in its most evangelical form has made itself felt in all the centuries which have come and gone since the times of Jesus . Here land there heroic servants of the Lord have appeared to espouse all the temporal good of the multitude , and , if need be , to fight the bloody battles of personal and civil liberty . The remote ancestors of the Southern pulpit , the Knoxes and that whole school , planted their feet firmly upon the earth , and made the banners of the cross and of human right wave from one staff . Indeed , it is the glory of all the evangelical sects , from Presbyterianism to the simplest group of Quakers , that in their histories the happiness and rights of man here were joined to his salvation hereafter , and were mingled together in hymn and sermon and prayer . The pulpit , helped America discover her right to " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , " and helped her secure that right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and the unspeakable power of this holy office to help the people when dark days have come . The sermons of that one man were one of the most powerful guns of the Revolution . He became at once a statesman and a preacher , and each office made the other more potent . In all the noble days of past epochs it will be seen that the orthodox clergy hastened to the front to lead their people , not to heaven , but to earthly happiness . In the central and darkest part of the dark ages , persons of culture and piety were deemed too good for any mingling with human affairs , and places of solitude and meditation were built for these , that they might draw nearer and nearer to heaven . This withdrawing of the relatively learned and virtuous brought on the midnight of the period . Both parties , those in retirement and those in the world , were injured by the separation . The monks and nuns failed mentally and morally from want of noble occupation in the outer scenes ; the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what men and women there were of some information and some morality . The convents were full of preachers and lecturers and contemplative minds ; the streets were full of kings and courtiers of low morals , and of loafers , criminals , and clowns . Thus mind , detached from the daily service of the // public , failed and withered as a plant cut off from light ; and stupid ignorance and low vices filled the great lonely buildings in which learning and piety had sought a retreat . In abandoning the daily wants of the common people , learning and virtue had moved away from the sources of their own being . Not into any material convents hidden away in any mountain recess , or perched upon some inaccessible rock , has the Southern pulpit betaken itself , but into a small and dark corner of a badly named orthodoxy has it softly and slowly crept , until the suffering populace no longer sees its wisdom nor grasps the hand of its charity . Out of a few dogmas-the deity of Christ , a commercial atonement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the littleness of earth  --  the Gulf-coast clergymen have made the stones of a monastery gloomy and . lonely upon a bold cliff , up the sides of which by means of a rope they draw up a basket of food daily , secured by pious beggars from the impoverished hamlets in the vale . Thus for a long period has that branch of mental industry been retiring its capital as though intending to retire from the Lord 's business , and few will deny that in this effort it is meeting with abundant success . It is easier thus to mark the simple facts of current history than it would be to determine the quantity of guilt or reproach which should rest upon the Christian ministry of the South who live amid the facts . As men who live upon the high mountain-ranges do not perceive at each respiration the rarity of the air , so those minds , however gifted by nature , who have long lived amid a certain condition of opinion and feeling , do not detect easily the new demand of the hour , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We admire Watt and Fulton , and congratulate them on their power to contravene the old implements and machines , but we do not rebuke the men who before Watt and Fulton failed to see the engine and the steamboat . In the moral world the heart , acting as spectatator , admires those who saw that their hour had come for moving against the old and sluggish tide , but it has no rebuke for those who lived and died without having wakened once from the widespread lethargy . We admire the heroism of Orange and Knox and Wesley , but we can not grow angry over those who stood in the deserts of Egypt and Syria to permit starvation and thirst and the torrid sun to expel sin from their flesh . Toward the men who have revealed great prophetic vision all look with reverence and gratitude , but toward the common masses that see and feel no new impulse all look with either compassion or silence . This is very evi // dent , that the Southern Sates are now offering to the ministers of the gospel within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calm thought of age or to the ambition of youth . The religion of Jesus being an infinite sympathy , being a perfect development of the moral resources of this world , it longs to build up the schoolhouse and to care tenderly for the education of all the children ; it longs to help the African become an educated and moral and free citizen ; it stands ready to persuade the men of murder and violence to put aside the weapon and touch the handle of the plow ; it waits and longs for lips to become bold enough to declare that industry is one of the saving graces of God 's sanctuary ; indeed , it mourns the long absence of an eloquence which shall declare that a good nation is a good church , and that education and industry are steps in the path of salvation . If there be any genius and intellectual fire that have survived the calamities of the past and which remain to-day in something of freshness and hope , there remains for this residue of pulpit force a great success if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atonement and the exact nature of Christ ; shall consider as dross its arguments to prove that a man is saved by faith alone , or to show that no human morals will avail anything in a remote judgment ; and shall fill a heart thus made empty of folly with arguments for the schoolhouse , and for equality and righteousness , and for a general imitation of Jesus Christ . A half score of such Southern preachers could make the South rise more rapidly than the wild-headed politicians have dragged her down . Germany had only one Luther , England began with one John Knox . The pulpit stands near to all hearts . Youth and age , even childhood , wait upon its words ; and those words sink deepest which , spoken by men of kind and pure lives , are made holy by the invocation of God and by grand or awful relations to a land beyond .
