txt In 1875 the Legislature passed an act reaniring the Newaaven and Northampton Road to stop all regular trains at Plantsville , which had been a regular station , but had been abandoned by the railroad for a new depot in the town of Southington , about a mile distant from Plantsville Village , in the same town . The discussion over the matter created a wide interest , and publics sympathy went strongly with the people and against the road . - Subsequently thorn was a long litigation in the courts of this State . and finally in the Supremo Court of the United States , resulting in successive decisions in favor of the legislative action taken . There has never been , however , an amicable adjustment of the troubles between the road and the Plantsville people . At the present session of the Legislature a bill was introduced in the interest of the road , providing that when any railroad company slit 11 refuse to stop any of its passenger trains at any station , whether established by the company or by order of the Commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town may make application to the Superior Court praying that the company may be ordered to stop the trains mentioned . To this application a citation shall be annexed , which shall be served on the company at least six days before the return day . Today this Pill was reported favorably by the Railroad Committee , 8 to 1 , and will come up in the Senate tomorrow or next day . Tho Plantsville people say that the whole object of the bill is to overthrow the rights they obtained in 1875 , while the road claims that its only purpose is to secure the privilege of running through expresses to Saratoga , which it can now do by its connections with the Iloosac . Tunnel route , facilities for travel it did not have in 1875 . Tho feeling against the road is very bitter in Plantsville , and it is scarcely less among some of the representatives of the road on the other side . The light in the Legislature will be spirited , if not ugly , and there will he as warm a discussion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less time for debate , as the two houses have voted to adjourn finally on Wednesday of next week .
