txt The learned lawyers on either side of the suits brought to prevent the carrying out of the consolidation agreement of the Western Union , American Union , and Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Companies appear to differ in opinion as to the importance of the decision rendered yesterday by the General Term of the Superior Court . Ex-Judge DILLON , of counsel for the telegraph monopoly , not only thinks the judgment will be set aside by the Court of Appeals , but says that it has " no legal significance with regard to the destiny of the company or the value of its stock . " Mr. SEWELL , on the other hand , of counsel for the plaintiff in the Williams case , says that the decision is very important and establishes the fact that corporations can not issue stock to represent profits invested in " plant , " that watering stock on the plea of au increase in the value of the property repre-. sented is illegal , and that combinations for the establishment of monopoly will not be sustained by the courts . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this single decision as Mr. SEWELL claims , but it does seem as though it was of considerable importance both to the Western Union Telegraph Company and . to many other corporations . It . will doubtless be vaguely remembered by the public that a year ago last Winter the Western Union Company got rid of its two rivals , one of which it already controlled , by means of an agreement between the j three boards of direction , which was subse- j quently ratified by the stockholders . In accordance with this agreement the Western Union increased its capital stock from about $41,000,000 to $80,000,000 . Some $15,000 , - 000 was used to buy up the American Union Company and about $8,400,000 to wipe out the Atlantic and Pacific Company , the shareholders making an exchange of certificates at certain specified rates . The rest of the new stock , amounting to over $15,500,000 , was distributed among the then existing shareholders , on the plea that the company had for fifteen years been accumulating property by the investment of surplus earnings in the extension of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation in increased capital stock . It was also claimed that the shareholders were entitled to a distribution of the new stock among themselves because it represented earnings which had not been distributed in dividends . Two separate suits were brought to have the agreement of Jan. 19 , 1881 , set aside as invalid , in which the grounds of action were somewhat different , though the principles involved were the same . Injunctions were granted by Judges SEDGWICK and SPEIR to prevent the distribution of stock , but on the trial of the actions before Judge TRUAX judgment was given for the defendants ? on the ground that all that was attempted under the consolidation agreement was within the law . The General Term of the Superior Court , Judges FREEDMAN , RUSSELL , and ARcoux sitting , unanimously reverses the decisions of Judge TRUAX , at Special Term , and orders a new trial on the law as now interpreted . Of course , there may be an appeal to the Court of Appeals , but if no such appeal is taken , or if the law as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems evident that , whatever the practical effect upon the Western Union Telegraph Company may be , an important principle will be established in re- ' 1 gard to stock-watering . The Judges in this case hold in effect that there was no legal impediment to the consolidation of the three companies . The . Western Union had the right to acquire the property of the other two concerns and pay for it by an issue of its own stock for the purpose , but to effect this there was no need and no legal sanction for a dilution of its stock , while the distribution of the excessive issue among its own shareholders was in absolute violation of law . There is a statute which prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends except from surplus profits on hand , or the division , withdrawal , or payment of any part of its capital stock by a corporation without the consent of the Legislature . The value of any accumulation of property or surplus fund attaches to existing stock and forms part of the principal of the company 's capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock might be issued to represent the increase of property , but that it should be held in the treasury or sold for the benefit of the company . To make a distribution of it among the share- , holders is in effect a division , withdrawal , and payment of so much of the capital stock , which can not be made without the consent of the Legislature . The distribution provided for being illegal , the agreement in volving it was invalid . The nature of the re-. lief to be granted in view of the fact that the agreement has been executed since the erroneous dismissal of the complaints by Judge TRUAX is a matter to be determined on the new trial , but the principle is established by this decision that a corporation can not issue new stock to represent accumulated and undivided earnings and distribute it among its shareholders as a stock dividend . Although the reasoning of the court in regard to the application of the statutory prohibition of a division , withdrawal , and payment of any part of the capital stock of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made more clear and explicit against the form of stock-watering which was attempted in this case , and also to be extended so as to prevent consolidations intended to destroy competition and establish monopoly .
