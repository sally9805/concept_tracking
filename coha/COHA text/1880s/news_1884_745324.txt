txt It is plain that in order to do justice to the commercial treaty recently negotiated with Spain , it must be considered as one of a series of treaties which , when completed , will establish practically uniform trade relations between the United States and all the other countries of the western continents . This is clearly involved in the statements of the President 's annual message as well as in the brief message with which the Spanish treaty was submitted to the Senate . The chief objection made to the treaty with Spain covering the trade of Cuba and Porto Rico has been that in admitting free of duty the sugars of those islands it gave a great advantage to their planters and conferred no corresponding benefit upon the consumers of our own country , and that a discrimination of this kind , embracing only a part of our sugar imports , was sure to disorganize the sugar trade and produce uncertainty , stagnation , and loss . This objection would be met by the complete carrying out of the scheme of reciprocal trade treaties contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy undertaken by the President is in its nature and purpose highly creditable to him and his advisers . It is a broad and statesmanlike policy . It aims at the permanent advantage of the Nation , and is intended to open up channels of trade the value of which can not at all justly be estimated by the degree to which we can at present take advantage of them . It is in no sense a partisan and much less a personal policy , but is national and patriotic in its purposes and elevated in its spirit . It is in these regards true to the traditions of the best American diplomacy , and should be so acknowledged . But while we recognize the excellent intent of the Administration in the series of treaties to which those with Spain and Mexico belong , we can not see that it will fulfill the hopes its authors have of it . Were it to be carried out the objection of the removal of duties from only a part of our sugar imports would , of course , be removed ; but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ditties . The imports of dutiable sugar for the last fiscal year were 2,630,000,000 pounds , valued at $91,080,953 , and paying duties ( with molasses , &c.,); of nearly $49,000,000 . The surplus revenue for the same year , after meeting the requirements of the sinking fund , was less than $58,000,000 . In other words , to give up the duty on imported sugars would be to surrender the entire surplus beyond the sinking fund . The estimated surplus for the current year is only $39,000,000 . The sugar duties , on the basis of the past year , would be about 25 per cent . more than this estimated surplus . Even supposing a change to be made in the sinking fund law , and the $57,000,000 required by that to become available in part for reduction of taxation , it is clear that , in any condition of public opinion likely to prevail within the next five or six years , there would be very little chance of any further reduction should the whole of the sugar duties be given up . The question presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , simply : Is the repeal of the sugar duties , in exchange for such trade advantages as can be obtained , the best mode of reforming the revenue ? To that question we are surprised that the extreme protectionists do not return an enthusiastic yes . It ought to be plain to them that the repeal of the sugar duties would make any reduction of the high tariff duties extremely difficult , if not impossible . It would be a complete diversion , for a long time at any rate , of the forces that now threaten their favorite system . But intelligent revenue reformers who wish to see taxation reduced so as to give the greatest stimulus to manufactures , as well as the greatest advantage to consumers generally , can see many other directions in which reduction is more desirable , because it would be more largely beneficial than the abolition of the duty on sugar . These are considerations that will undoubtedly prevail with Congress , and they make the Spanish treaty , viewed in its most favorable light , quite impracticable at the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
