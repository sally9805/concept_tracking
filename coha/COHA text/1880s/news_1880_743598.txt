txt Mr. JOHN KELLY is in a terrible state of mind . Never very clear-headed about the larger political matters which lie outside of the local squabbles in which Mr. KELLY is forever involved , he is in a more muddled condition than usual . But it does not become a great political leader to show even a momentary weakness . He must be continually on dress-parade . So , when the anxious and depressed followers of Tammany called on their chief , at their County Convention the other night , for an explanation of the tidal-wave , he stepped boldly to the front , and gave them wisdom " in solid chunks . " In the first place , Mr. KELLY explained that he had never expected that the Democrats could carry Ohio . In this he showed his wisdom . He put no faith in the World , which , having made " the completest arrangements for obtaining full and confidential information " from Ohio , had said that the Democrats were " calmly confident of carrying the State . " Nor could Mr. KELLY have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful henchman , Mr. S. S. Cox , who said , on the eve of the election , that he " firmly believed " that the Democrats would be victorious . Mr. SAMUEL J. RANDALL , more diplomatic than his comrades , had said that " the Republican majority in Ohio would fall below 5,000 , and that a Democratic majority was not only possible but probable . " In none of these great lights of his party did Mr. JOHN KELLY repose his confidence ? after the election . Mr. JoHN KELLY 'S " hindsight " is admirable . Having , as it were , cleared the ground , the Tammany chief went on to say that he did not think that the tariff question had anything to do with the result in Indiana . " Democrats are not likely to change , " said the Tammany statesman . " There is a necessity here in the East for such a tariff as will enable people to live by their labor . " This , however , is a flying in the face of the platform of Mr. KELLY 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . " Perhaps Mr. KELLY , like his distinguished leader , Gen. HANCOCK , thinks that the taritf question is merely " a local matter , " which has once been settled in Pennsylvania , and with which the general Government has no concern . If the Eastern laborers want a tariff that will enable them to live by their labor , let them have it ; but why should the people of Indiana bother themselves about a purely local matter ? No ; the tariff question had nothing to do with the great defeat . Neither did principle , for , argued Mr. KELLY , " HANCOCK has never been charged with dishonor . All admitted that it was a proper nomination . " And Mr. KELLY confessed that he could not see how the people of Indiana could vote the Republican ticket instead of the Democratic , " if they have been influenced by a principle . " It might be added that it can not fairly be expected of a man of Mr. KELLY 'S calibre that he should see anything of the kind . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his followers . He had heard it said that the people of Indiana , seeing that the country is prosperous , are averse to making a change . . " This is a species of reasoning , " argued this distinguished political economist , " that no lnim can maintain . " For , said he . " prosperity may live for a moment , but it must soon disappear under bad legislation . " Therefore , as his admirable logic shows , we want a change . The country being prosperous under Republican administration , we should have a change , because " prosperity must soon disappear under bad legislation . " And , what is more , " the records show that Republican legislation has always been a reign of corruption . " Exactly so . The records show that Republican legislation is bad ; prosperity must disappear under bad legislation , and , though " the country is Prosperous and the finances were never in a better condition , " according to Mr. KELLY , it is necessary that there should be a change , as prosperity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which the country has prospered should be brought to an end by a Democratic victory in Indiana . At least , this is the way Mr. KELLY looks at it . This time the cat nearly succeeded in catching its own tail . But , after all , the Tammany chief did not give any satisfactory reasons for the Democratic disasters . To be sure , he said that it was not the tariff agitation which did the mischief . It was not because people wanted , or did not want , a change . It was not because the people of Indiana were ' actuated by a principle , nor because the nomination of HANCOCK was not a proper one . He said : " There were spent there , I might say millions , to corrupt the people . " And it is hardly necessary to add that honest JOHN KELLY weeps with mortification when he thinks of corruption in any form . This pure statesman , having conjured up the spectacle of the Republican Party disbursing millions of dollars in one State , wrings his spotless hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do not be discouraged . " " A temporary defeat there is of no importance . " " It 's of no consequence , " says poor Toots . And one can very well imagine a little cunning old man , huddled in the corner of his Gramercy Park mansion , and leering derisively at the floundering chieftain of Tammany , and whispering , " I told you so .
