txt The Collector of the Port of New-York has it last signalized his administration by a 3onspicuous action . He has ordered 1,500 ) f the subordinates of that establishment into uniform . The only subordinates of the Custom House whose duties really require that they should be uniformed are the inspectors , and their uniform might properly be limited to a cap or a badge , which would make their official function apparent to those who had business with them . To put 1,500 men in uniform in order to attain the object of designating to strangers a small number of inspectors is an act of official pedantry , or worse , on the part of the Collector . The facts given in connection with the order leave little doubt that it is the latter . The men are not told to get a prescribed uniform and left to make their own bargains with regard to it . They are ordered to get a certain uniform at a , certain price from a , certain dealer . The dealer is one to whom it is said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were left to go where he liked . The price is said to be exorbitant , considering the material and the workmanship . This price is $22 , and this is for a Summer uniform alone . When a Winter uniform is required it will presumably be ordered from the same dealer , at the dealer 's own price , or at a price fixed by a conference between the dealer and the Collector or the Collector 's agent . None of the usual precautions seem to have been taken to make sure that the customs officers should get the worth of their money . There was no public advertising for bids and no in dication at all that the dealer chosen would furnish the uniforms cheaper or better than anybody else . Making the very large assumption . that the Collector has a right to prescribe a uniform , the men have a right to buy this prescribed uniform wherever they can get it to the best advantage . In this case the dealer runs none of the usual chances of trade . His money is stopped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms , and half of it has already been stopped before the uniforms have been delivered at all . There is no room for argument as to the character of this transaction . On the face of it it is a job , by which the profits of the contract are to be divided between the contractor and whoever procured the job for him . We do not say that this person was Collector HEDDEN . He may not have been able to help himself , except by resigning , which is an act from which his whole nature recoils . He may not have been consulted before he issued the order . But that somebody representing the Collector , or reiiresented by the Collector , has a ; - pecuniary interest in. this tailor 's contract is a proposition to which the only alternative proposition that we can see is that the high officers of the Custom House are all idiots . This interest , if it exists , must be what jurists and moralists describe as a cornipt interest . It is to be hoped that some Senator or Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lay the evidence of it before the President in an authentic and authoritative form . It is exactly the kind of transaction to which Mr. CLEVELAND is most vehemently opposed . It may very well be that tla.A will prove to be the last straw which ollector HEDDEN and his managers have laid upon the patience of the Administration .
