THERE is something eminently satisfactory in the reflection that , when the new faith , " That all men are created equal , " and that " Governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , " was finally assailed by the slave-power of America , and had to pass the ordeal of four years of war , a man horn and reared in poverty , deficient in education , unused to the etiquette even of ordinary society , and untutored in the art of diplomacy and deception , had been selected by the people of the United States to become the representative of the new faith , and the defender of the government established upon it . This man was ABRAHAM LINCOLN , of Illinois , the record of whose life , at once important , eventful , and tragic , it is pleasant to recall . There are , in my judgment , at least four men associated with the period of the civil war , who , in their early lives , their struggles , their training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of this people : Lincoln , the lowly , the exalted , the pure man in rude marble , the plain cover to a gentle nature , the giant frame and noble intellect ; Grant , the defender of the Federal Union , the unflinching soldier , around whose dying couch a whole nation now lingers , whose light will shine down through future ages a warning to conspirators , to freemen a pledge , and to the oppressed a beacon of hope ; Stanton , the lion of Buchanan 's cabinet , the collaborator of Lincoln , the supporter of Grant , gifted with the far-seeing eye of a Carnot , spotless in character , incorruptible in integrity , great in talent and learning , and a fit object of unhesitating trust ; and John Rogers , the American sculptor , who has offered , in his beautiful and famous group of statuary , " The Council of War , " an undying tribute to these three great leaders in American history , and is himself worthy to be grouped with them in our remembrance . " Leaves have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north wind 's hreath , And stars to set ; hot all - Thou Isast all seasons for thine own , 0 Death ! " If we could have looked into a rude log-cabin in Hardin county , Kentucky , on the morning of the izth of February , 1809 , we should have seen an infant just born , - and with what promise of future greatness ? Looking ahead ten years , we should have discerned this infant , Abraham , developing into youth , still living in the old log-cabin , with neither doors nor windows , with wolves and bears for neighbors , with a shiftless father . // But his mother was dead ! Still this mother had left her impress , and she had become in that boy 's heart " an angel of a mother . " She made him what he afterwards proved himself to be . Follow Abraham Lincoln where we will ,  --  from the cradle to the grave ,  --  and we shall find honesty and kindness ever distinguishing him . In his boyhood , among boys , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ; in manhood , he was always protecting the fugitive from an angry mob ; as a lawyer , saving the widow 's son from the gallows , and declining the rich fee of an unrighteous cause ; as a public debater , the fairest ever met in the political arena ; and as president of the republic , honest in his convictions and kind to his bitterest enemies . Let us not forget the difficulties which it was his lot and his good fortune to surmount . He never was six months at school in his life ; and yet , by the use of a single book and the occasional aid of a village schoolmaster , he became an expert surveyor in six weeks ! At the age of twentyone he accompanied his family to Illinois . One morning , when seated *t the breakfast-table of his employer , Lincoln was told that a man living six miles away had a copy of an English grammar . He left the table at once , and went and borrowed the book . During the long winter evenings that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pored over the pages of that book ,  --  studying the science of language , the theory of human speech , and qualifying himself to become the author of one of the three great State papers of modern times , by the light of burning shav-ings ! But we leave that early life of his , which , in rude simplicity , repeats " the short and simple annals of the poor . " In 1832 Black Hawk , the celebrated Indian chief , then in his sixtyseventh year , crossed the Mississippi to regain the Rock River valley , - the scene of his early trials and triumphs . His coming meant war upon the pale-faced stranger , that had ventured to possess the hunting-grounds of the red men . Several companies of volunteers were raised to meet him , and Abraham Lincoln served as captain of one of them . When the war was over Lincoln returned to New Salem , his home in Illinois , and shortly afterwards began the study of the law . He was still poor in purse , his clothing was threadbare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study in the shade of a tree . One day Squire Godbey - a very good man he was , too , so we are told - saw him seated on a pile of wood , absorbed in a book , when , according to the squire , the following dialogue took place : " Says I , Abe , what are you studymo ? - Law , ' says he . Great God Almighty ! ' says I. " Studying law astride of a wood-pile , probably barefooted , was too great a shock for the squire 's susceptible nature . He continued to study , then to practise a little without fee , and finally was admitted to the bar in 1836 . Judge Davis , once on the Supreme Bench of the United States , a man spotless alike upon the throne of justice and in his daily walk , was upon intimate terms with Lincoln for upwards of twenty years , and during // more than half of that period sat upon the judicial bench before which Lincoln most frequently practised . No one is abler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer who became one of the first of the Western bar , - a bar that can proudly point to its Carpenter , its Trumbull , its Ryan , and its Davis . He says - " The framework of Lincoln 's mental and moral being was honesty ; and a wrong cause was poorly defended by him . The ability which some eminent lawyers possess of explaining away the bad points of a cause by ingenious sophistry was denied him . In order to bring into full activity his great powers it was necessary that he should be convinced of the right and justice of the matter which he advocated . When so convinced , whether the cause was great or small , he was usually successful . " He hated wrong and oppression everywhere ; and many a man whose fraudulent conduct was undergoing review in a court of justice has writhed under his terrific indignation and rebukes . He was the most simple and unostentatious of men in his habits , having few wants , and those easily supplied . " In 1837 Mr. Lincoln removed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old friend , John T. Stuart ; and this partnership continued until 1841 . In 1834 he had been elected to the Legislature , and after his removal to Springfield he was again chosen to that body . It was during this period that he found the nerve , when it did require courage , to express and record his protest against the injustice of slavery . Twice as a youth he had made a trip to New Orleans , - in 1828 and 1831 , - and on his second visit had for the first time observed slavery in its most brutal and revolting form . He had gone into the very centre of a slave mart , had seen families sold , the separation forever of husband and wife , of parent and child . When we recall how deeply he always sympathized with suffering , brute as well as human , and his strong love of justice , we can realize how deeply he was affected by these things . His companions on this trip have attempted to describe his indignation and grief . They said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abstracted , sad , and depressed . " The years which Mr. Lincoln passed in Springfield were the preparatory years of his future greatness . From this time onward he was ever a busy man . He was once associated with Mr. Swett in defending a man accused of murder . He listened to the testimony which witness after witness gave against his client until his honest heart could stand it no longer ; then , turning to his associate , he said : " Swett , the man is guilty ; you defend him : I ca n't . " Swett did defend him , and the man was acquitted . When proffered his share of the large fee Lincoln most emphatically declined it , on the ground that " all of it belonged to Mr. Swett , whose ardor and eloquence saved a guilly man from justice . " At another time , when a would-be client had stated the facts of his case , // Mr. Lincoln replied : " Yes ; there is no reasonable doubt but I can gain your case for you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress a widowed mother and her six fatherless children , and thereby get for you $6oo , which rightfully belongs , it seems to me , as much to the woman and her children as it does to you . You must remember that some things that are legally right are not morally right . I shall not take your case , but will give you a little advice , for which I will charge you nothing . You appear to be a sprightly , energetic man : I would advise you to try your hand at making $6oo some other way . " I turn now to another phase of his nature , and recall that he had not grown up to manhood without the usual experiences of the tender passion . It was while he was yet living at New Salem that his heart opened to a fair , sweet-tempered , and intelligent girl , with the romantic name of Anne Rutledge . They were engaged to be married as soon as he should be admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court . But in August , 1835 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early death made a very deep impression upon him . We are told that he idealized her memory , and in his recollections of her there was a poetry of sentiment , which might possibly have been lessened , had she lived , by the prosaic realities of life . With all his love of fun and frolic , with all his wit and humor , with all his laughter and anecdotes , Lincoln , from his youth , was a man of deep feeling . We have it on the authority of the most reliable of his biographers , that he always associated with the memory of Anne Rutledge the poem which , in his hours of despondency , he so often repeated : - " Oh ! why should the spirit of mortal be proud* Like a swift fleeting meteor , a fast flying cloud , A flash of the lightning , a break of the wave , He passeth from life to his rest in the grave . " The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade , Be scattered around , and together be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low and the high , Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie . " I never read this beautiful poem , so full of the true philosophy of life , so suggestive of the rich promises of the hereafter , that I do not think of the great president . He first found it in the columns of a newspaper , cut it out , carried it in his pocket , and treasured it in his memory for many years without knowing who was its author . It would be pleasant to trace the years spent by Mr. Lincoln in the State Legislature , and to revert to some of the speeches and occasional addresses belonging to those years , which , in the light of his subsequent history , are strangely significant . In the early period of his legislative career he became acquainted with Stephen A. Douglas , while the latter was a school-teacher at Winchester . Douglas was a man of extraordinary powers , and one of the readiest of the American debaters of his time . As the years went on he became actively interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats in Illinois , while Lincoln became the standard-bearer of // the Whigs . When party platforms were promulgated , upon the eve of important contests , these two statesmen , by the unanimous consent of their supporters , were selected to debate the merits of their respective political creeds before the people . A series of joint discussions was arranged to take place in the various important towns of the State . The assemhlages were large , and were composed of men of all parties . The discussion opened with a speech of an hour , from one of the debaters ; the other replied in an address of an hour and a half ; a rej*inder of half an hour brought the discussion to a close . At the next meeting the order of speaking was reversed , and by this arrangement the " last word " was indulged in alternately by each debater . During the various joint discussions held between the eloquent political orators who were chosen to represent the Anti-Slavery and Democratic parties , it may fairly be asserted that Lincoln opposed , while Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . The former always felt that slavery was wrong , and in seeking a remedy for the existing evil he followed in the footprints of Henry Clay . He advocated gradual emancipation , with the consent of the people of the slave States , and at the expense of the General Government . In his great speech against the Kansas and Nebraska bill , he said , " Much as I hate slavery , I would consent to its extension rather than see the Union dissolved , just as I would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one . " The debates between Lincoln and Douglas , especially those of the year 1858 , were unquestionably the most important in American history . The speeches of Mr. Lincoln , as well as of the " Little Giant " who opposed him , were circulated and read throughout the Union , and did more than any other agency to create the public opinion which prepared the way for the overthrow of slavery . As another has said , " The speeches of John Quincy Adams and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendell Phillips were more vehement and impassioned ; Senators Seward , Hale , Trumbull , and Chase spoke from a more conspicuous forum ; but Lincoln 's were more philosophical , while as able and earnest as any , and his manner had a simplicity and directness , a clearness of statement and felicity of illustration , and his language a plainness and Anglo-Saxon strength , better adapted than any other to reach and influence the common people , - the mass of the voters . " From 1847 to March 4 , * Mr. Lincoln served a term in Congress , where he acted with his party in opposing the Mexican war . In 1855 he was a prominent candidate for the United States Senate , but was defeated . From the ruins of the old XVhig party and the acquisition of the Abolitionists , the Republican had been formed , and of this party , in Illinois , Mr. Lincoln became , in 1858 , the senatorial candidate . Again he was defeated , by his adversary Mr. Douglas . Lincoln felt aggrieved , for he had carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When questioned by a friend upon this delicate point , he said that he felt " like the boy that stumped his toe ,  --  it hurt him too much to laugh , and he was too big to cry . " In his speech at Springfield , with which the campaign of 1858 opened , Mr. Lincoln made the compromisers of his party tremble by enunciating a doctrine which , they claimed , provoked defeat . He said : " A house divided against itself can not stand . ' I believe this Government can not permanently endure half slave and half fr@e . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved ; I do not expect the house to fall ; but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will become all one thing or all the other ; either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it , and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in a course of ultimate extinction , or its advocates will push it forward till it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as new , North as well as South . " These were prophetic words ; and they were spoken by a man born in the slave State of Kentucky . It was the truth , the fearless truth , uttered in advance of even the acknowledged leader of the Republican party , Governor Seward , of New York . The simple assertion of that truth cost Lincoln a seat in the United States Senate ; but it set other men 's minds to thinking , and in i86o the PEOPLE , following the path made through the forest of error by a pioneer in the cause of truth , came to similar conclusions , and made " Honest Old Abe " Chief Magistrate of the republic . On the ioth of May , i86o , the Republican convention of Illinois met at Decatur , in Macon county , to nominate State officers and appoInt delegates to the National Presidential Convention . Decatur was not far from where Lincoln 's father had settled and worked a farm in 1830 , and where young Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Hanks had split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Lincoln was present , simply as an observer , at the convention . Scarcely had he taken his seat when General Oglesby arose , and remarked that an old Democrat of Macon county desired to make a contribution to the convention . Two old fence rails were then brought in , bearing the inscription : " Abraham Lincoln , the rail candidate for the Presidency in i86o . Two rails from a lot of three thousand , made in 1830 , by Thomas Hanks and Abe Lincoln , whose father was the first pioneer of Macon county . " The effect of this contrihution can well be imagined ; at once it became useless to talk in Illinois of any other man than Abraham Lincoln for President . On the i6th of May the National Republican Convention was called together in Chicago . The convention met in a large building called the " Wigwam , " which had been constructed specially for the occasion . The contest for the nomination lay between William H. Seward of New York and Abraham Lincoln of illinois . On the third ballot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a youth on that memorable // day , but I vividly recollect that I was standing , with other urchins , nearly opposite the " Wigwam , " and was startled when a man stationed on top of the building yelled out , " Fire : Lincoln is nominated ! " Then followed the roar of cannon and cheers upon cheers . When the news reached Mr. Lincoln he was chatting with some friends in the office of the " Sangamon Journal , " in Springfield . He read the telegram aloud , and then said : " There is a little woman down at our house who will like to hear this . I 'll go down and tell her . " The " little woman " was his wife , whom , as Mary Todd , he had won in 1842 , and he knew that she was more anxious that he should be President than he himself was . On the 7th of November , i86o , it was known throughout the country that Lincoln had been elected . From that very hour dates the conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , culminated in rebellion . It is painful now to revert to the events which marked its progress . There is not a man living to-day , I trust , that does not wish they could be blotted out from our history . While watching the course of these events Mr. Lincoln chanced one day to be talking with his friend , Newton Bateman , a highly respectable and Christian gentleman , and Superintendent of Public Instruction in Illinois . I can only quote a part of the interview , as furnished by Mr. Bateman himself : " I know there is a God , " said Lincoln ; " and he hates injustice and slavery . I see the storm coming . I know that his hand is in it . If he has a place and work for me , - and I think he has ,  --  I believe I am ready . I am nothing ; hut truth is everything . I know I am right , because I know that liberty is right ; for Christ teaches it ; and Christ is God . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , ' and Christ and reason say the same ; and they will find it so . " Douglas does n't care whether slavery is voted up or down ; but God cares , and humanity cares , and I care ; and with God 's help I shall not fail . I may not see the end , but it will come , and I shall be vindicated ; and these men will find that they have not read their Bible arigl*t . " We are told that , after a pause , he resumed : " Does it not appear strange that men can ignore the moral aspects of this contest ? A revelation could not make it plainer to me that slavery or the Government , must be destroyed . The future would be something awful , as I look at it , but for this rock on which I stand . " He alluded to the Testament which he held in his hand , and which his n*other- " to whom he owed all that he was , or hoped to be " - had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pathetic than the scene when , on the i *th of February , i86i , Abraham Lincoln bade a last farewell to his home of a quarter of a century . To his friends and neighbors he said , while grasping them by the hand , " I go to assume a task more difficult than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of Washington . He never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence , upon which // he at all times relied . I feel that I can not succeed without the same divine blessing which sustained him , and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support . " The profound religious feeling which pervades this farewell speech characterized him to the close of his life . All along the route Lincoln preached the gospel of confidence , conciliation , and peace . Notwithstanding the ominous signs of the times , he had such an abiding faith in the people as to believe that the guarantees of all their rights under the Constitution , of non-intervention with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance of a most friendly spirit on the part of the new President would calm the heated passion of the men of the South , would reclaim States already in secession , and would retain the rest of the cotton States under the banner of the Union . What a striking evidence of the lingering hope and of the tender heart of the President is afforded by his first inaugural address ! " In your hands , my dissatisfied fellow-country men , and not in mine , is the momentous issue of civil war . " The Government will not assail you . You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors ; you can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government , while I shall have the most solemn one , - to preserve , protect , and defend it . ' " I am loath to close . We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies . Though passion may have strained , it must not break , our bonds of affection . " The mystic chords of memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and hearth-stone all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . " Abraham Lincoln took the helm of government in more dangerous times and under more difficult and embarrassing circumstances than any of the fifteen presidents who preceded him . The ship of Union was built and launched and first commanded by Washington . " He knew what master laid her keel , what workmen wrought her ribs of steel , who made each mast , and sail , and rope , what anvils rang , what hammers heat , In what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of her hope. ** The men whom he chose as her first crew were those who had helped to form her model . During succeeding generations inefficient hands were occasionally shipped to take the place of worn-out members of the original crew . Often the vessel was put out of her course to serve the personal ends of this or that sailor , and ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John C. Calhoun , of South Carolina . Finally , a man ignorant in the science of astronomy and navigation , feeble alike in heart // and arm , became , nominally , commander , but really the cat's-paw , of his crew , at whose bidding the ship was steered . When Abraham Lincoln was called to the helm he found the once stanch , strong vessel in. a leaky , damaged condition , with her compasses deranged , her rudder broken , and the luminous stat ' by which Washington guided his course dimmed by a cloud of disunion and doubt . When the belching cannon opened upon Sumter , then it was that the ship of State was found to be all but stranded on the shoals , - Treason . We are all aware of the story of that struggle . We can never forget the story , for there is yet a " vacant chair , " that recalls it in many a home . The manner in which President Lincoln conducted the affairs of the government during that struggle forms an important chapter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday comes Easter ; after the day of dejection and doubt comes the day of recompense and rejoicing . To my mind there is that in the life-work of President Lincoln which itself consecrates every soldier 's grave , and makes the tenant of that grave more worthy of his sublime dying . It added honor to honor to have fallen , serving under such a commander . It was midsummer , i86z , and at a time when the whole North was depressed , that the President convened his cabinet to talk over the subjectmatter of the Emancipation Proclamation . On the zzd of September ensuing it was published to the world . It was the act of the President alone . It exhibited far-seeing sagacity , courage , independence , and statesmanship . The final proclamation was issued on the 1st of January , 1863 . On that day the President had been receiving calls , and for hours shaking hands . As the paper was brought to him by the Secretary of State to be signed , he said , " Mr. Seward , I have been shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed . If my name ever gets into history it will be for this act , and my whole soul is in it . If my hand trembles when I sign the proclamation those who examine the document hereafter will say , He hesitated . ' " Then , resting his arm a moment , he turned to the table , took up the pen , and slowly and firmly wrote , ABRAHAM LINCOLN . He smiled as , handing the paper to Mr. Seward , he said " That will do . " This was the pivotal act of his administration ; but this humane and just promise to liberate four millions of slaves , to wipe out a nation 's disgrace , was followed by the darkest and most doubtful days in the history of America . Grant , in the lowlands of Louisiana , was endeavoring , against obstacles , to open the Mississippi ; but , with all his energy , he accomplished nothing . McClellan 's habit of growling at the President had become intolerable , and I3urnside superseded him in command of the Army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Fredericksburg , and was repulsed with terrible disaster . Then the army broke camp for another campaign , the elements opposed , Burnside gave way to Hooker . The soldiers became disheartened , and thousands deserted to their homes in the North . The President 's proclamation was now // virtually a dead letter ; people looked upon it and characterized it as a joke . But there came at last a break in the clouds , and on Independence Day , 1863 , the star of liberty and union appeared upon the distant sky as a covenant that God had not forsaken the Prophet of the West ,  --  the Redeemer of the Slave . I can find no more fitting words to characterize Grant 's victory at Vickshurg than those which the young and brave McPherson used in his congratulatory address to the brave men who fought for the victory : - " The achievements of this hour will give a new meaning to this memorable day ; and Vicksburg will heighten the glory in the patriot 's heart , which kindles at the mention of Bunker Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking before you . The plaudits of an admiring world will hail you wherever you go . " Take it altogether it was perhaps the most brilliant operation of the war , and established the reputation of Grant as one of the greatest military leaders of any age . He , the last of the triumvirate , is passing away ; and , in this connection , no apology is needed in quoting the letter which the President wrote with his own hand , and transmitted to him , on receipt of the glorious tidings : - Mv DEAR GENERAL , - I do not remember that you and I ever met personally . I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country . I wish to say a word further . When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg I thought you should do what you finally did , - march the troops across the neck , run the batteries with the transports , and then go below ; and I never had any faith , except a general hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like could succeed . When you got below , and took Fort Gibson , Grand Gulf , and vicinity , I thought you should go down the river and join Gen. Banks ; and when you turned northward , east of the Big Black , I thought it was a mistake . I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right , and I was wrong . And recall now the never-to-be-forgotten scenes at Gettysburg . The Union army had been defeated at Chancellorsville , and Gen. Lee , having assumed the offensive , had been making the greatest preparations for striking a decisive blow . Already had he passed through Maryland ; he was now in Pennsylvania . But valiant men were there to meet and oppose . The fate of the day , the fate of the Confederacy , was staked upon the issue . I can not picture the battle ; but we all know the result , and how great was the rejoicing in the North when , on that 4th day of July , the tidings of the fall of Vicksburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the battle-field of Gettysburg was set apart as a restingplace for the heroes who fell on that bloody ground . In November of that year the ceremony of consecration took place . Edward Everett , the orator and the scholar , delivered the oration ; it was a polished specimen of his consummate skill . After him rose President Lincoln ,  --  " simple , rude , his care-worn face now lighted and glowing with intense // feeling . " He simply read the touching speech which is already placed among the classics of our language : - " Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . " Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so conceived and so dedicated , can long endure . We are met on a great battle-field of that war . We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place of those who here gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether fitting and proper that we should do this . " But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate , we can not consecrate , we can not hallow , this ground . The brave men , living and dead , who struggled here , have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract . The world will little note , nor long remember , what we say here ; but it can never forget what they did here . It is for us , the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on . It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us , that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion ; that we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain ; that the nation shall , under God , have a new birth of freedom , and that government of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish from the earth . " There have been but four iustances in history in which great deeds have been celebrated in words as immortal as themselves : the epitaph upon the dead Spartan band at Thermopyl* the words of Demosthenes on those who perished at Marathon ; the speech of Webster in memory of those who laid down their lives at Bunker Hill ; and these words of Lincoln on the hill at Gettysburg . As he closed , and while his listeners were still sobbing , he grasped the hand of Mr. Everett , and said , " I congratulate you on your success . " - ' ' Ah , " replied the orator , gracefully , " Mr. President , how gladly would I exchange all my hundred pages to have been the author of your twenty lines ! I forbear to dwell longer on the events of the war . The tide had turned , and the end was already foreseen . Notwithstanding that Mr. Lincoln had proved the righteousness of his course , a great many people in the North - and many even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second term . The disaffected nominated Gen. Fremont , upon the platform of the suppression of the Rebellion , the Monroe doctrine , and the election of President and Vice-President by the direct vote of the people , and for one term only . The Democratic party declared the war for the Union a failure , and very properly nominated McClellan . It required a long time for the General to make up his mind in regard to accepting the nomination ; and , in conversations upon the subject with a friend , Lincoln suggested that perhaps he might be // entrencAing . The election was held , and Lincoln received a majority greater than was ever before given to a candidate for the presidency . The people this time were like the Dutch farmer , - they believed that " it was not best to swap horses when crossing a stream . " On the 4th of March , 1865 , he delivered that memorable inaugural address which is truly accounted one of the ablest state papers to be found in the archives of America . It concludes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right , let us finish the work we are in , - to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow and his orphans , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . " Read and reread this whole address . Since the days of Christ 's Sermon on the Mount , where is the speech of ruler that can compare with it ? No other in American annals has so impressed the people . Said a distinguished statesman from New York , on the day of its delivery , " A century from to-day that inaugural will be read as one of the most sublime utterances ever spoken by man . Washington is the great man of the era of the Revolution . So will Lincoln be of this ; but Lincoln will reach the higher position in history . " Four years before , Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ; now , he was the faithful and beloved servant of the people . Then , he was ridiculed and caricatured ; and some persons even found fault with his dress , just as the British ambassador found fault with the dress of the author of the Declaration of Independence . The ambassador is forgotten , but Jefferson will live as long as a government of the people , by the people , and for the people , endures . While he lived Lincoln was shamefully abused by the people and press of the land of his forefathers ; and not until the shot was fired --  not until the blood of the just - the ransom of the slave - was spilled , did England throw off the cloak of prejudice , and acknowledge - This king of princes-peer , This rail-splitter , a true-born king of men . " It is well known that not all of Mr. Lincoln 's friends invariably harmonized with his views . Of the number of these Horace Greeley stood foremost , and undoubtedly caused the President great anxiety upon several occasions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook to do a thing , the whole country , believing in the honesty and purity of his motives , gave to him a willing ear . From the editorial sanctum of the " Tribune " many a sharp and soul-stirring letter went forth addressed to the executive of the nation . Mr. Lincoln read them , oftentimes replied to them , but very rarely heeded the counsel which they contained . When the President was struck down , Mr. Greeley , who differed so widely from him , mourned the loss of a very dear friend . Charles Sumner often differed from the President , and on the floor of the // 77 Senate Chamber frequently gave utterance to statements which carried grief into the White House . But Mr. Lincoln knew and understood Charles Sumner . An incident may here be recalled . The President was solicitous that his views , as embodied in an act then claiming the attention of Congress , should become law prior to the adjournment of that body on the 4th of March . Mr. Sumner opposed the bill , because he thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that State . Owing to the opposition of the Senator and a few of his friends the bill was defeated . Mr. Lincoln felt displeased , and the newspapers throughout the country published that the friendship which had so long existed between the two men was at an end . But Mr. Lincoln was not a man who would withdraw friendship on account of an honest difference of opinion . It was not he who made the mistake of urging the dismissal of Mr. Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . On the 4th of March Mr. Lincoln was reinaugurated ; on the evening of the 6th occurred the Inauguration Ball . Mr. Sumner had never attended one of these state occasions , and he did not purpose doing so at this time until he received , in the course of the afternoon , the following letter : - DEAR MR . SUMNER , - Unless you send me word to the contrary , I shall this evening call with my carriage at your house , to take you with me to the Inauguration Ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball-room , with Mrs. Lincoln leaning on his arm , and took his seat by the side of the President . The evening was pleasantly spent , and the newspapers at once discovered how great a blunder they had made . At length the curtain fell upon the bloody scenes of the war . Under the mighty blows of Grant and his lieutenants the Rebellion was crushed . On a bright day the President , accompanied by Mr. Sumner , entered the streets of Richmond , and witnessed the grateful tears of thousands of the race he had redeemed from bondage and disgrace . Having returned to Washington , he convened a cabinet council on the *4th of April . During the session his heart overflowed with kind and charitable thoughts towards the South , and towards those officers who had deserted the flag of their country in her trying hour he poured out a forgiving spirit . After that cabinet meeting he went to drive with Mrs. Lincoln , - they two were alone . " Mary , " said he , " we have had a hard time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is over , and , with God 's blessing , we may hope for four years of peace and happiness , and then we will go back to Illinois and pass the rest of our lives in quiet . We have laid by some money , and during this term we will try and save up more , but shall not have enough to support us . We will go back to Illinois , and I will open a law-office at Springfield or Chicago . and practise law , and at least do enough to help give us a livelihood . " Such were the dreams of // Abraham Lincoln the last day of his life . The whole world knows the remainder of the story , - of that terrible night at the theatre ; of that passing away in the early dawn of the morning ; of that sad and mournful passage from the Capitol to the grave at Oak Ridge Cemetery . It is painful to dwell upon it ; it makes the heart faint even to recall it . ABRAHAM LINCOLN needs no eulogy . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentioned with his as that of a peer , - the name of Washington . He was as pure , and just , and as patriotic as the Father of his Country . He was born of his time , a creature of the age of giants , a genius from the people , all the greater for his struggles , for he really did more than any man of his day to destroy caste and give courage to the lowly ; and therein he wrote the brightest pages of progress . The shaft that marks his silent resting-place , the books he read , the office he used , the strong body that covered his warm heart and wise purposes , were only the outer symhols to the higher gifts of his Creator . All gifts and graces are not found in one person . He is great in whom the good predominates . All persons are not born equal . Gifts are diversified ; but if ever a man had the " genius of greatness , " it was Abraham Lincoln . As all are eloquent in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both knew and did . A few words more . The President left a heart-broken widow , a woman whose intellect was shattered by one of the most awful shocks in human history . No mind can picture the agonies which she suffered , even till the day of her death , on July i6 , i8Sz . I make mention of her now , because , during her eventful life in Washington and afterwards , she was most cruelly treated by a portion of the press and people . I can conceive of nothing so unmanly , so devoid of every chivalric impulse , as the abuse of this poor , wounded , and bereft woman . But I am reminded of the splendid outburst of eloquence on the part of Edmund Burke , when , speaking of the heart-broken Queen of France , he said - " Little did I dream that I should live to see such disasters fall upon her in a nation of gallant men , - a nation of men of honor , cavaliers . I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult . But the age of chivalry is gone . "
