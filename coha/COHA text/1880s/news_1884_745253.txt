txt Mary Grote , whose mysterious disappearance from the home of Mr. Francis May has been reported in THE TIMES , was found this morning in one of the three large barns on the Bartow estate , which Mr. May has leased for a term of years . A son of Postmaster Scott saw a hand thrust through an opening in the side of the barn . In fright he ran to the May homestead , and Mr. May and his son went to the barn with several women who were about . Turning over the hay , they saw Mary in her blue calico dress , with eyes closed . She appeared dead . At that instant , a few minutes before noon , Justice Steve and Constable Shute , of New-Rochelle , drove up to the house . Without waiting to secure their horses they ran to the barn , after hearing the cries of the boys , and climbed a steep ladder into the mow . They at once saw that Mary was only feigning faintness . " Come now , Mary , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our questions . I am a Judge and you must obey . " This threat was too much for the poor girl . She opened her eyes and saw that the Justice had her by one arm and the constable by the other . " Leave me alone , " she said , " and I 'll get up . " She was left alone and she got up . She had been buried under half a ton of bay . She brushed the seeds out of her flowing black hair , skipped nimbly down the upright ladder with just a glimpse of a neatly buttoned hoot , and made straightway for the house . Not an hour before this THE TIMES 'S reporter had stood directly over the spot where Mary was found . " Here 's a soft place , " he said to Mr. May , who stood on a ladder , watching his treading operations . " That 's nothing , " said the farmer . " I turned that hay over myself . There 's nothing there . You do n't need any fork . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the reporter went on to other mows and other barns , never questioning Mr. May 's word . Better had he done so For while 50 men were searching the woods for Mary Grote Mr. May hunted woodchucks from his barnyard . He killed one . And when the weary searchers were called in , at 1 P. M. by the shrill blast of a horn telling that the lost had been found , Mr. May was there to greet them and to point proudly to the woodchuck and boast of having first seen missing Mary 's clothes through the salt meadow hay . Long before ; daylight this morning Mr. R. H. Bartow , of New-York , had the five men employed on his farm here up and stirring . All farm work was stopped , and before leaving for New-York , at 8 o'clock , Mr. Bartow told his men that they must search for Mary Grote until she was found . They did their work well . At 7 o'clock ? broad day then , but with the grass still wet  --  the searchers were joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen came from New Rochelle and as many more from White Plains . By this time the dew had vanished into thin ether and masculine Bartow had turned out , until 56 men were scouring hill and dale for Mary Grote . Brush heaps were overturned , fallen trees were lifted , hollow trunks were explored , stone heaps were overthrown and stone walls razed . Then , from bramble and brush the throng came out to learn that Mary Grote was alive and apparently well , though dumb as a post to all questions concerning her . " Mrs. May made a face at me , " she sullenly said to THE TIMES 'S reporter , " and I went away . " No question would she answer , nothing else would she say . She hid her rosy cheeks in her hands behind a bedstead post in the May homestead , and acted like a sullen child in need of a good sound spanking . And 45 out of the 50 searchers for the girl swore they 'd give it to her if they had the chance . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve took Mary 's affidavit that she had been away with no man and had had nothing to do with any man . Justice Steve was n't quite certain whether Mary was in a proper state of mind to make an affidavit , But he took the chances and took it . So , on the basis of the affidavit , interviews were exdluded from Mary excepting a privileged few . To the few Mary had nothing to say . There are a good many complications likely to occur from this peculiar case . Some of the townspeople clamor for the arrest of May , some for the arrest of his son , and some for the arrest of the red-headed hired man . Others think that the well-dressed New-Yorker mentioned yesterday has employed criminal means to rid himself of a prospective family . This young man , who is described as about 2.8 and good looking , called at the grocery store of Ernest Peters , on Third-avenue , in New York , last Wednesday , and inquired for Mary . He was sent to the house of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was told that she had gone to City Island . After Mary left Mrs. Donaldson . of East Seventy-firststreet. , as a nurse , two letters arrived for her in envelopes of the Windsor Hotel . It is safe to say that revelations will be made effectually breaking up the May family for some time to come . Bartow is in a ferment . A few think Mary hysterical and crazy . But the majority see the demon ' at the bottom of the well to which the girl has been drawn . Were she not under the care and threats of certain members of the household , they say , her story would soon be told . There were three divisions of to-day 's searching party , each independent of the other . The worst part of the country was taken by a detachment to which TEE TIMES 'S reporter was assigned . After they had been scrambling over rocks for an hour they were brought to a halt by a great ledge of rocks . There was a narrow opening ten feet from the ground , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole . The stones leading to the opening were well worn . The party had evidently run upon the home of the tramps . Squeezing themselves through the aperture , the party found themselves in a large cave . The rocky floor was strewn with old papers and straw . There was rough sleeping accommodation for a hundred men , and the place was alive with vermin . " I 've found it , " shouted a constable of the town . This is what I 've beenflooking for . Break this up and we 'll break up the tramps stopping in this town . Those little shanties are no good . This is the headquarters . " There was an iron skillet , a pot , and a tin coffee can in the cave beside a rude fireplace . In descending from the opening a passage through the bushes was readily discerned . Following it the whole searching party of ten , after a three minutes ' walk , found themselves between Bartow and Pelham Manor and on the track of the Harlem branch of the New-Haven Road . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town who came down the track to see what had been unearthed , " that you have found the rendezvous of tramps , starting from New-York. on their first night out . And , if God lets me live until next week , break up this den if I have to burn the whole section over . Two tramps were arrested at New-Itochelle today  --  one of them the man who tried to wash bloodstains from his clothes iu a saloon here last night . They were locked up . but on the officers learning that Miss Grote had been found , apparently , uninjured they were let go . A telephone message from New-Rochelle to-night- says that an aged woman living north of Pelham Manor is reported to have been outraged , and the tramps are being looked up again . Since the excitement in this place the 9-year-old daughter of a prominent townsman tells of . indignities to which she was subjected within sight of her home by some of the wandering fraternity . This increases the excitement , and all tramps will fare roughly if they dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
