AND ARTICLE 1. - MORAL EDUCATION IN PRISONS . THE great teachers of the race have always recognized the necessity of reaching the lowest and worst . When we bear in mind that the greatest teacher of all had occasion to say to the higher classes of society in his day , " The publicans and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you , " we need not be surprised at the fact that in our time also there are found , in this very class of the lowest and worst , some of the readiest to receive and practice moral and religious teaching . It can not be denied that for some years past there has been a decided movement upon the part of the lowest , and of the lower middle classes as well , to get out of the reach of the established order of moral and religious teachers . As a result of the modern spirit of Protestautism and individual liberty , many have protested themselves not only out of the orthodox churches , but also out of all church connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , and many individuals and families have abstained from attending church for lack of the apparently requisite style of dress or // 474 iikral Education in Prison8. culture . The mission chapels have suffered only in less degree from the same influences . They have failed in a large measure to touch bottom , to reach the lowest . Even were it otherwise , mission work can not ordinarily hold sinners of this class with a sufficiently firm grasp or long enough at a time , to get them once thoroughly cleansed and braced up . In many cases baptism needs to be more than a mere ceremony . Even immersion will not suffice to cleanse a man whose body has been steeped in whiskey and tobacco , and become demoralized by all manner of hygienic abuse . The hose needs to be applied externally . A cleansed and purged body is in such cases an essential prerequisite to a purified soul . For this class of criminals-by far the largest  --  the law must still be the " paidogogos , * ' the schoolmaster of St. Paul , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , but shall also hold the patient fast while the surgical and drastic remedies are being applied . Sinners of this sort must first be caught and confined . The physical temple must first be cleaned , swept , and garnished . They must first be freshened from the pickle of whiskey soak and licentiousness , by the enforced hermit life of prison , with its regular hours , plain and substantial diet , and above all steady and hard physical work . And then-what ? With the higher grade of criminals , clean of body and keen of mind , the question of preliminary moral treatment is attended with even greater difficulty . As an illustration of this class of criminals , the writer will select one from the range of his own acquaintance . A band of first class burglars had planned a bank burglary commensurate with their skill , but met with a course of bad luck which baulked their main scheme , and diverted them into a minor burglary less skillfully planned . Still pursued by their bad luck , a peculiar combination of circumstances caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added highway robbery and other offenses to their principal crime . Their attorney succeeded in getting all other indictments dismissed on a plea of guilty to the burglary . One of the most brilliant of the gang excited the admiration of their attorney . " How does it happen , " he asked this burglar 's wife , " that Charley , with // such splendid abilities , took up this sort of life , when he might make a fortune in a respectable calling ? " " Well , " said she , " I do n't know myself . The fact is , Charley always was a holy terror from the time he was a boy . " Charley sat by his attorney when sentence was pronounced-ten years to the Eastern Penitentiary of Pennsylvania . His only expression , omitting the flavoring of profanity , was : " Ten years on Cherry Hill . The safes will all get away from us , so we wo n't know a safe from a dry-goods box by that time . " It is not a problem difficult of solution whether " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place for that sort of a man . Nevertheless , with both of these two classes , the one represented by the man with a debauched body , the other by the man with a perverted , demoralized soul , one point seems clear . In each case , the man must be called to a halt in his career and be forcibly held in that position , before there is much use in preaching to him or in reasoning with him . As the one becomes physically cleaned up and cleared out , and the other is forced to reflect , there is a chance which is almost a certainty , that a new or changed career presents itself to his consideration . Do not think that when the convict first finds himself in his lonely cell , he is usually overwhelmed with remorse , or suffers the pangs of a guilty or accusing conscience . Would that it were so . His reformation would then begin at once with his imprisonment . Remorse and a reproving conscience are usually late phases , if iudeed they make a ser.ious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prisoner settles himself in his cell to commence the working out of his sentence , he only curses his hard luck , and if he contemplates a change of profession , it is in very much the same mood that comes over a broken down lawyer or clergyman , if so his case is hopeful . It may be , however , that only an intensified form of his old courses will be the subject of his meditations : that seven devils worse than the first will enter into his swept and garnished body ; that with sullen desperation and a more bitter malice , he will devise shrewder schemes of illegal crimes or legal immorality . Such a course is almost absolutely forced upon the halted culprit by the old-fashioned prison system . // On the other hand , the culprit in prison is wonderfully ready to become disgusted with the criminal course in which he has . made a failure , and to consider a change in his career , if only his training in prison can direct and encourage him into such meditations . The proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this article by his brief experience among prisoners , that there is no other class of sinners in whom a genuine hungering and thirsting after righteousness is so easily awakened . Many lines of crime do not necessarily involve more actual malice than is possible and is often practiced in legitimate business . So far as the mere emotion or impulse of the heart is concerned , the burglar in pursuing his business is liable to approach about as near to loving his neighbor as himself , as the banker in pursuing his business . Many crimes do not arise so much from deliberate , cruel inalace in motive or impulse as from moral heedlessness , a disregard of ultimate results . The consciousness of being helpful to his neighbor is ordinarily as pleasant to the criminal as to the devotee of legitimate business . Moreover , the imprisoned criminal , with a mind halted in its accustomed activites , more or less unoccupied , and seeking food for meditation , comes to the study of mutual helpfulness and of individual well-being , with a freshness and openness to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can seldom be found among men busied with the moral half-truths of conventional life , and well satisfied with their half practice thereof . Who that has come to middle life has not had experience with a fine young fellow who has got into a series of drunken sprees ? Such a man can and does give to himself better and stronger arguments against his course than any one else can . The hypothesis by which . his behavior can be more easily accounted for is the old-fashioned theory , that he is possessed of , or more accurately speaking , obsessed by a devil . The only practical treatment is to take physical hold of him ; confine , diet , work , and possibly medicate him ; and turn his mind by cheerful society and healthful reading out of its morbid inebriety , until he regains self-possession and self-control ; the treatment to be repeated as often as the symptoms recur , and // to be made permanent if necessary . Very similar is the state of the ordinary criminal , and he needs similar treatment . The Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest of problems , how to reach the low and depraved . The first condition of the problem is to get physical hold of them . Once , the Church practically did this by its own machinery . Men and women with pious aspirations , voluntarily sought the benefits of confinement within prison walls furnished by or in connection with Church organization . Here , they lived abstemiously , and worked hard as a religious service . Their righteousness worked its natural profitableness , and the profitableness , coming to be sought for its own sake , wrought the corruption which broke up the system . The Church has lost this machinery and never will regain it . But , behold , the State has begun to do this work better than the Church ever could . Here and now , the State has seized these sinners , has cleaned them up , is giving them the requisite physical diet and discipline , and is today calling to the invisible Church : We have cleared away the entrance , come in and feed these famished souls with the bread of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we be permitted to ask in ignorant surprise : " Lord , when saw we thee in prison and did not minister unto thee ? " For then shall he answer unto us. - The prison has its proper and legitimate function in society , and a very important one . The prison should be the " paidagof/08 " to the Church , the servant furnished by the State to lead the unruly candidates for education and training in righteousness , secured from truancies , to the school of discipline in which members of the invisible Church shall be teachers . Whether or not such teaching should be given in formal connection with some particular branch of the visible Church , about which so much noise is now being made , is a question of very trifling importance . As the possibilities of making the prison operate as a moral hospital , and training school , come to be fully appreciated , it will necessarily follow that the great mass of ordinary " drunks ' * and " disorderlies , " instead of being sent as now for short periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will receive the advantages of reformatory impris* onment , under the indeterminate sentence , which are now permitted only to the more serious offenders . Accordingly , on a little reflection , I soon found that the subject which I had chosen for this paper , " Moral Education of Criminals , " was limited by the nature of the problem to " Moral Education in Prisons . " The work of the moral teacher among this class of men must be that of education rather than mere instruction . The learning of moral maxims can never be a substitute for that temper of mind and sonl which the great modern teacher , Arnold of IRugby , designated by the phrase " moral thoughtfulness . " Moral maxims are serviceable at best , only to indicate the general direction . No man can walk morally in the wilderness of this life , until he carefully selects the particular path as well as the general direction , and becomes watchful of each footstep . IN o end of good advice may be given these men and they see nothing in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " flat , stale , and unprofitable . " The moral teacher must begin with these men by waking up and leading forth the dormant or merely potential activities , and his main work will be to guide and suggest the direction of the activities he has awakened and stimulated . The natural thirst must first be restored before men can be made to drink of the waters of life . I must beg leave to add one more proposition to the ijitroductory portion of this paper . Religion and morality are not to be contrasted or contra-distinguished as in any way opposing or conflicting with each other . They are separated by not chasm , nor even by so much as a clear dividing line . They shade into each other . The existence of either involves and implies the presence of the other . The whole subject of right living both in act and emotion , I prefer to include under the term religion . The ideal man of Horace , " n'tteger vitae , " of perfect , complete , whole life , must be religious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , morality is the effectuating in actual conduct of the religious emotions , and is therefore a subdivision of religion . In this sense of the term , it will be seen at once , that th' // study of morality calls for the keen , critical dissecting spirit ; - a spirit exactly the reverse of that iii which appeals are made directly to the religious emotions . The man who can do both equally well is exceedingly rare . As a clear headed business man lately said , " A business man ca n't be honest nowadays by relying solely on his good intentions . " The relations of life are so complicated and intricate , the ultimate results so difficult to anticipate , that it needs a clear head as well as a good heart to avoid causing cruel and severe injustice . The pulpit has confined itself almost solely to the culture of good intentions . You must make the springs pure before the stream can be clear ; " Cast the salt in the spring of the waters , " is the burden of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed than half-truth , but not the whole of the truth . Even so bold a thinker as the Rev. Newman Smyth , in beginning lately a series of sermons to working men upon the most vital moral problems of the day , feels called upon to apologize for " turning aside for a few Sabbaths from the ordinary ministry of the Word . " I wish the preachers throughout the land would prepare themselves for one sermon to business men , upon the proposition that every legitimate bargain naturally involves equivalent benefit to both parties , and that any other bargain is immoral . What a transformation would be effected , more indeed in the temper than in the methods of business men , if they could fully realize the truth that there is no charity , no method of helpfulness to their neighbors , equal to carrying on a legitimate busine&amp;s justly , justly not in the legal but in the absolute moral sense . But the temper of the pulpit is emotional not critical , and the occupants of the pulpit are in some respects especially unfitted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up this work , for fear they might teach something of religion also , and that would be contrary to the spirit of our institutions , and denominational jealousy would be in arms . Not even reading , to say nothing of studying , the Bible can be permitted in our schools . Where then shall this be attempted , if neither in the schools nor in the Church can the moral teacher find pupils and a school room for the culture of moral thoughtfulness , the study // of the ways and means of effectuating in actual conduct the love of God with all the heart and of one 's neighbor as one 's self ? Right in the very spot indeed where such teaching is most needed , in the prisons of the State ! Nowhere else is there such an opportunity for a man of moral enthusiasm , ballasted with brains , to get a leverage for raising up modern society . The prisons throughout the land are calling more loudly than Greenland 's icy mountains or India 's coral strands , for the work of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has received the education and training of prison life should go out as a missionary to the other members of his class , with steadier habits and a broader intelligence , restraining his fellows from reckless crimes and needless strikes in the laborer 's wars . The old theory that it needs a brute of a man to handle and train brutal men is passing away . The men in charge of our prisons are coining up nobly to their work . The main trouble now is , and from the nature of the problem always must be , to keep up the tone of the subordinate officers and employes . Every employc about a prison , from head Superintendent to scullion , should carry about with him the contagious atmosphere of sturdy moral integrity in the pursuit of an ideal better than his act . A class of mature men met for the study and discussion of practical ethics on the principles above indicated , would be a unique experiment anywhere , and most of all inside prison walls . About three years ago the writer of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prison known as the Elmira Reformatory . With only such preparation for ethical teaching as might come from a brief experience as a school teacher , and a miscellaneous law practice in a rural city , he accepted the call , bearing in mind the remark of an eminent lawyer that the legal profession tends to cultivate the perception of virtue though not the practice thereof , while the reverse is the tendency of the clerical profession . Let me undertake to give frankly a brief outline of the course of the experiment . The class at first consisted of about seventy young men from sixteen to thirty years of age , selected from the brightest // minds out of a body of criminals numbering nearly six hundred . A majority of them had enjoyed from one to three years ' high school training in the Reformatory , especially iu Political Economy under my professional brother , our County Judge , in Physics under the Professor of that department in the Elmira Female College , and in English History and Civil Government under the Principal of the Elmira Free Academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set to work dryly , but cheerily and heartily , to discuss on a low plane , the most comfortable methods of living . At the outset , I ignored all authority , the Bible included , and took up the problem of life as though for the first time , my favorite and frequently recurring illustration being the analogy of individuals in society to locomotives on a demoralized railroad , all wild-catting , and frequently colliding and wrecking . Bodily comfort and physical health quickly brought on the general topic of temperance . Upon the special application of temperance to stimulants and narcotics , with a reckless indulgence in intellectual honesty , I gave a fair exposition of the argument for temperance as opposed to total abstinence . My pupils had hitherto listened with dubious interest , but now began to scent rank heresy . The Superintendent sat nervously watching for me to fall over the edge of the precipice along which I was treading . I had at first , on commencing , attempted to force discussion by calling up members of the class and asking questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , however , the discussion needed no urging . I was rebuked by the men themselves for encouraging intemperance and we had some very forcible total abstinence lectures from members of the class . I took my castigations meekly and con* ceded that total abstinence was possibly the only true rule for any one , and was certainly the only safe rule for very many . By this time my pupils had decided that their teacher was not smart nor particularly good . They could not see how they were to pass the examination required of them . The class became decidedly unpopular and was known throughout the institution as the class in " Practical Rascality . " In my instructions the transition naturally followed from physical health to the health and diseases of the soul . But // here I was met by a spirit of skepticism , of which the following extract from a note sent up to me was one of the manifestations : " Dear Sir : I think that the man who said last Sunday that he knew he had a soul , made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as he is about the matter , and I would like to be convinced of the fact . " Strange to say the proposition that man has a soul troubled me for several Sundays , in spite of the assistance of the orthodox majority of the class . I finally clinched the proposition as follows : " If I called you a fool you would say I insulted you . Then there is something of you besides body , and this something can be happy or suffering , healthy or diseased . Let us call this something whatever it is , soul , without regard to whether or not it continues to exist after the death of the body . " The leader of the skepticals , a bright young burglar about eighteen years old , said to me privately as we were walking out of the class room , " Well I see that in the sense in which you use the word soul , man has a soul , but whether man has a soul in the religious sense or not , I do n't know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out about it . " What he finally made out about it is indicated by his contribution about a year afterward to " The Summary , " the Reformatory newspaper , written from the depth of his heart , as allegorical of his own hard struggle with himself , as follows : " GOD AND THE ROBIN . " " Early in the morning , long before the lazy cock crows , you may hear the robin singing his welcome to the sun . He has been watching through the darkness for the first rays of coming day and as they appear he pours forth the melody as an expression of his joy . All is quiet till his music rends the air , and as you listen you are inspired with thoughts of Him who made the robin and you . Perhaps the sweet song is a prayer of thanks to God for sheltering them from the dangers of the night . Do they know of God ? Who can tell ? Perhaps He is the cause of what we in our ignorance call instinct . Once as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a house near the sea . It had a lawn in front on which was a robin hopping in search of food for her young . But as she hopped about , the sky seemed to grow darker . I knew that a storm was approaching , and when it came I saw the robin cling to the tree for shelter . But the wind was fierce and it tore her from the branch , and in spite of all her efforts it bore her away out over the ocean , farther and farther from the land , till at last when its energy was spent , its // fury gone , it left her on the ocean with no land in sight to guide her to her home . And as she flew she thought of her little ones at home , and of her mate . She thought she was flying to them but every little effort was taking her farther away though she knew it not . When at last she began to tire , she looked at the restless waters , but they offered her no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her say : " 0 where shall I rest my weary wing ? " But in the murmuring of the ocean she heard no reply , so she could but fly on , till darkness came , when utterly exhausted , she fell upon the cruel waves and died . And He who made her will receive her when the course of life is past . Can not the little robin find in that house of many mansions a place to rest her weary wing ? Is heaven made for man alone ? Are not these little creatures who never offend God , but worship him with the purity and happiness of their little hearts entitled to the joys of the hereafter ? Who can doubt it ? " The topic of revenge was quickly reached in discussing the diseases of the souL A recklessly honest discussion of the utility of revenge again put the Superintendent on tenter-hooks . This again was rank heresy and was more strenuously resented by the class . Revenge was what brought me here , said some members frankly . I presented the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogues of Plato , with running comments , elaborating the proposition that doing injustice is a greater misfortune than suffering injustice . I was quite satisfied with my argument but the leader of the skeptics was not . He sent me the following note : " I have only attended up till now two lectures , and therefore do not know what may have been said in the other three . But in the lecture on the 24th I think you go a little out of the line . You say that if a man from pure cussedness strikes you , it is better to let him alone . Reason , because a man in doing so hurts what we have agreed to call his soul , and if he continued to hurt it in such a way he will find in the end that he has hurt himself more than you . That is hardly Practical Morality . ' That which is unnatural can hardly be called practical . Revenge is not only the gratification of a desire but also a mode of protection . All our legal punishments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . A fine country we would have if the government were to let men go on doing all the wrong they pleased , consoling themselves by the knowledge that the men were injuring themselves more than any body else . To show you that revenge is instinctive and a natural protection : a man strikes you one blow and your impulse is. to strike him two , so as to let him see that it does not pay to strike you and to make him , from impulses of fear , quit . Therefore revenge in such a case is a natural protection , the impulses of which are instinctive // and so universal that they must contain some good . Further on you say that a man in striking you has only hurt the flesh . Let us see . Suppose he has struck you on the cheek . It hurts . The organic matter has been bruised . But is that all ? What makes your hands close and your teeth come together ? Ah , then another source of feeling has been touched and let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been aroused by a strain or a jar and by a continuation of blows and consequently by a continuation of strains and jars , the feeling at last gets toughened , hardened and dies out , and you become one of those poor wretches with whom we often meet , to whom a blow is nothing while a kind word is a mortal sting . Look at yourself then and see if the man who struck you is not the better off . Besides what kind of forgiveness do you call that , where you allow a man to strike you when you believe that by so doing the man will in time pay dearly for his action . You would have the world think you turn to him the left cheek , while in your heart you expect your pound of flesh . Please excuse my freedom and look upon me as your attentive and respectful scholar . " I frankly acknowledged to the class the superiority of my pupil 's moral reasoning . We continued the readings from Socrates on punishment as a remedy for diseases of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be punished as he would to a surgeon when wounded , and should do the same for his friends and relatives , was a new strange doctrine ; andthe professionally orthodox could not tell which side to take . The only trouble with the discussion now was to control it . Half a dozen hands would be up at once waiting for the leader 's nod , and even the Superintendent could not always keep his seat . We were progressing with quietly increasing interest for several weeks on such topics , when a dispute which had arisen between two men as to whether a certain expression constituted swearing , was referred to the class . I tried to explain the value of religious reverence . But however indifferent they might be to attacks upon their theories of morality , their religion they were ready to fight for . The Hebrews felt insulted by the Roman Catholics and vice versa , and so on through all the variations even to the Agnostics . The discussion got away from me , and but for the presence of the prison " paidagogos " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Stanislaus . The Superintendent deemed it prudent to prohibit the first grade men from continuing the discussion at their meals . The next two Sundays I occupied the floor mainly // myself , on the rcttioncde of religious controversy . Thereafter only a hint was necessary to stop the symptoms of a religious riot . But the repression of the debating society spirit , and of the argumentuin ad kominem , was constantly being called for . These were the only points on which the momentum of the original membership did not keep the new men , who had been added to the class , in order . The attendance gradually increased to about two hundred . The popularity of the class was now established , as might be inferred from the following note received by the Superintendent in the fourth month of our experiment , given verbatim : " Gen'l Sup't. : Please helow me to attend the Lectures on Practicel Morality Sunday fornoon . I gess I can pas examination . I would much like it , as I think Morality is my very weekest point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incognita of business morality , with unaffected ignorance hunting for some standard of right and wrong whereby to test the morality of business transactions . I took positions confidently and abandoned them freely . Some called me a socialist and communist , but they soon found that names did not trouble me in my search after substance ; that I was desirous only to follow my intellect wherever it might lead , wholly regardless of my landing place . So great was my faith that the truth will bear the keenest investigation without damage to the truth or the investigator . Finally we all plunged together into the unstable waters of doubt and inquiry , but after a time we all came slowly scrambling out again onto the solid ground of New Testament doctrine . The suggestions from the class were of wonderful assistance to me in my own pursuit of the truth . Indeed I doubt if anywhere a club could have been formed capable of discussing this special line of topics with such freedom from conventional pre-judgment --  -- -such unguardedness of expression , with such genuineness and sincerity . Their strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , held their instructor down to the ground , and often took the nonsense out of his idealistic theories . I must skip a long period without telling how I came to read selected passages from the Apology , Crito , and Phaedo , // giving the dramatic story of the trial , imprisonment , and death of Socrates . I would not voluntarily have gone on to undertake the difficult and delicate task of comparing the life and teachings of Socrates and Jesus , but the class forced me into it . It would have done any one good to hear Jews and Agnostics joining with the rest of the class in literally and sincerely praising Jesus as they had formerly been praising Moses and Socrates . All symptoms of the old religious war had disappeared . A discussion of the fundamental propositions of religion naturally followed and could not be avoided . I confined the discussion as closely as possible to the points in which the principal religions agree , and strange to say the only fundamental beliefs which do not admit of critical intellectual treatment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once questioned . It was strong confirmation of my faith , that men so disposed to question everything , so readily accepted my assumption of these fundamental truths . Some utterances of the class sounded almost blasphemous , but were not repressed , as free utterance seemed like proper relief to a festered sore , and the speaker thereof was after all ready to reverently consider the doctrine he had denounced . One speaker raised the point that a man can only reverence but not love God . The following contribution in " The . Summary " the next Sunday , from a very young member in the third grade , clo&amp;ed the discussion of that topic . " LOVE . " " The love that prompts embrace and tender sign ; That resteth on desire of human joys , And doth not bear the test of time , but cloys , Partaketh not , nor comes of the divine . T is but attraction course of human clay ; Its aim that man to man should e'er be kind . But , there 's a love life 's traveler does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . T is that which draws the hearts of noble men To hearts of some grand , heaven-ordained ones Whose words they read , though forms they may not see : T is that which thrills the human spirit when It views the love of him who made the suns And worlds that roll in wondrous harmony. ** // ( The writing of the above sonnet was suggested by the remark in the Casuistry Class last Sunday , that although reverence and respect may be felt , it is impossible for the human soul to feel any Love toward God . This I have attempted to show to be false. -F . J. D. ) One of the questions for examination at the close of the religions discussions , was the difference in the teachings of Socrates and Jesus as to God 's love of men . Whatever else the class failed on , every man answered this question , with abundant variations of language , substantially as follows : Socrates taught that the God loves and rewards those who honor and obey Him , but Jesus taught that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for the poor downtrodden , miserable children who seem to be good for nothing . I will give one more specimen of prison labor which appeared in " The Summary " from the pen of the poet above quoted , now risen to the second grade . " AN IMAGINARY CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO MEMBERS OF THE CASTJI5TRY cLAss . " " Did you not agree last Sunday with the member of our class who said that life in prison is a state of slavery ? " " No I did not . In fact , I am astonished at your question . I rather think it is not a state of slavery . " " That is a very curious belief . " " It may appear to be ; but 1 think it can be proved to be logical . You say that imprisonment for wrong-doing is slavery ; but what is slavery ? " " I should define it to be the involuntary subjection of one person to the will of another . " " But , can not a person be a slave to passion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " " Then your definition is obviously incorrect . I would define slavery as a state in which one 's actions are regulated by some power over which he has no control . Would you agree with me ? " " Well , I think I would . " " Very well . Having agreed upon a definition of slavery , we will discuss whether life in prison is slavery-Now , let me ask , why are men sent to prison ? " " Usually for violating the law . " " Well , do you believe that men steal , for instance , voluntarily ? " " Undoubtedly . " " Your tone is rather confident ; so , I dare say you can tell me why men steal ? " // " In order to get certain articles that will enable them to live more comfortably , or which they desire to have . " " That is , you mean that they have certain feelings , such as laziness , love of gain , etc. , which they wish to gratify ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had not these feelings he would not steal ? " " I think not . ' " Then these feelings regulate his conduct in stealing ? " " It seems * " But you agreed that he whose conduct is regulated by some power other than his own free will is a slave . " " Well I am afraid you have caught me again . " " But do you admit it ? " " I do . " " Then he who prevents this man from stealing is emancipating him , not enslaving him ? " " I see you are right . " qwq right . Do you agree with me ? " " I do . " " Then , do you not think that the truly righteous man , be he in prison or out , is free ? Do you not see , that a man who does right , even though he lose fortune and life by doing so , is freer than the one who allows his conduct to be regulated by fear , malice , or other passions ? Remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with chains , and that he may be an abject slave and be clothed in purple ; " My very practical friend , upon whom I had been practicing with the foregoing portion of this paper , here inquired : " Well , after you have got all through with your moral and intellectual bear dance , what is there in these men to show it ? What is the final outcome of sharpening the wits of such men with your high-toned discussions ? " I answered : " However it may be with religion , there is no such thing as a sudden conversion to morality . Morality means firmly set habits acquired by long practice and severe discipline . Men can quickly recover from sudden and sharp attacks ; but it is not in human nature to resist the effect of a steady pound , pound , pound , without any let-up . Men can not be kept steadily thinking , with a genuine interest , on better and higher themes , with reference to better ends , without acquiring better habits of thought . " // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor in my morning class when we were discussing the fundamental questions of religion . We were all doing our best , feebly struggling with great questions beyond our abilities . I went in the afternoon to hear au address from him . Never did I hear noble thoughts couched in so noble language , delivered with such solemn eloquence . He seemed to cover the whole field of essential religion , and yet without a word or color of thought to check the unrestrained admiration of Hebrew , IRoman Catholic , Protestant , and Agnostic alike . That was a model of the true system of ethico-religious education : the sharpening of the critical faculties over questions of practical conduct in the morning , the solemn appeal to the religious emotions in the evening , with the leaders of both exercises present and taking part in both . And as I looked into the faces of those two hundred young men , with the sympathy which can not but come from working side by side in the same pursuits , and saw their brightening and moistening eyes , and watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their quick apprehension of fine intellectual distinctions and solemn spiritual truths ,  --  condemned felons every one ,  --  yet men whom I have learned to love-I said to myself , This is evidence of things hoped for ; here must be the substance of things not seen .
