txt There is no doubt that the weather on the North Atlantic has been very severe this year , and that to some extent the accidents that have occurred to the transatlantic steamers have been due to the weather . The Notting Hill was not , however , lost through stress of weather . She was crushed by the ice because her Captain  --  either of his own will or in consequence of the orders given him by his owners  --  chose to keep as far north as the parallel of 46 ? . The Captain who crosses the Banks in the neighborhood of this parallel after the polar ice has begun to drift southward does so at the risk of collision  --  a risk which no amount of care can certainly guard against . Had the Notting Hill kept as far south as 42 ? she would almost certainly have met no ice , and the length of her passage would have been increased only a few hours . The season has arrived when to take the northerly passage is to invite collision with ice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule that from the 1st of February to the 1st of July a vessel that crosses the Banks north of 42 ' forfeits her insurance in case of disaster that can not be proved to be in no way due to ice . Several steamers have broken their shafts this Winter , notably two of the ships of the favorite White Star ' Line . To a certain extent the weather was the cause of these accidents , for it . is improbable that the shafts would have been broken had the sea been perfectly smooth . At the same time , it is proper to ask why the shafts gave way . The public is not informed whether the broken shafts were new or old . If they were new , no blame can be attached to the managers of the White Star Line , but if the shafts we 're as old as the steamers to which they belonged , it was not strange that they were broken . The life of a steamer 's shaft is reckoned to be about nine years . In that time the metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used without being passed through the furnace . If the White Star shafts were nine years old it was time to expect them to give way in case of a heavy strain , and it would be a misuse of language to call such an occurrence an accident .
