txt The gas companies appear to have been worsted in the Legislature . At the beginning of the sessionthe - purpose of the Brooklyn companies was to prevent any reduction of their present rate , which is $2 a thousand , and the Consolidated Gas Company of this city was ready to promote heartily any legislation that would enable it to nullify last year 's law , which cut down the rate in New-York to $1 25 . It was known , of course , that a bill openly raising that reduced rate could not even be reported , and . therefore it was proposed that the desired change should be made in a devious way by means of a bill establishing a gas commission . The legislative proceedings with reference to this subject have served to disclose the real attitude of several Senators and Representatives toward the people and the gas companies . Senator GRISWOLD introduced a bill reducing the rate in Brooklyn to $1 50 . In committee this bill was strenuously opposed by the companies , and the specified rate was raised to $1 60 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who finally , however , voted for the measure  --  the bill was passed . Then Mr. ERWIN introduced in the Assembly a commission bill closely resembling one which the Consolidated Gas Company is said to have asked another representative to put in . Mr. WORTH had a commission bill pending in the Senate . These two bills were designed to permit the declaration of 10 per cent . dividends on watered stock . By the Worth bill such dividends were allowed on " authorized capital , " and by the Erwin bill on " stock lawfully issued . " It is held that the enactment of the Erwin bill would operate to nullify the law fixing the maximum rate in this city at $1 25 . It provides that companies shall furnish gas " at a reasonable rate , " to be fixed annually by the board for each locality , and that all acts inconsistent with this provision shall be repealed . Assemblyman GRAHAM had a bill reducing the Brooklyn rate to $1 25 , but he endeavored to withdraw it when he saw that it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , which was plainly the only reduction bill- that could pass both houses , was withheld from the Assembly for five weeks by Mr. MCCARTHY 'S Cities Committee . At last it was forced out , and with it the Graham bill . These , with ERWIN 'S Commission bill , were taken iip in Committee of the Whole . The Commission bill was pushed forward . It was supported by Mr. ERWIN and . vigorously opposed . by Mr. HAMILTON , Mr. GREENE , Mr. MARTIN , and others who saw what the effect of its passage would . be . Before the close of the first evening 's debate Mr. IVES induced . the committee to amend . it by attaching a provision that the rate to be fixed by the commission in this city should . not exceed $1 25 , while in Brooklyn it should not exceed $1 60 . At the next session Mr. MCCARTHY , who professed. to support the Graham bill for Brooklyn  --  a bill that could not become a law ? appeared as a defender , in and out of season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real position . Ignoring the fact that the Ives amendment had been adopted , he pleaded.that the proposed commission should not be deprived of power to fix rates in this city and Brooklyn . The drift of his argument clearly showed . that it was the purpose of the Erwin bill to nullify the legislation of last year concerning gas rates in New-York . But the Ives amendment was not cut out . Then the committee was induced by Mr. and Mr. KRUSE to amend the Erwin provision relating to watered stock so as to provide that the dividends must be'restricted to capital actually invested . This was a severe blow to the bill , and upon Mr. HAMILTON 'S motion the whole of the obnoxious section was stricken out . The three bills having been progressed and taken out of committee , Mr. MCCARTHY appeared as the advocate of the Graham bill . a hopeless measure , evidently desiring to retard the progress of the Griswold. bill . But Mr. KRUSE turned the light on this scheme , and the Graham bill , with its author 's consent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to one . Then the Griswold. bill , which appears to be the only measure that promises any relief to Brooklyn consumers , was ordered . to a third reading . The Erwin bill , in a mutilated condition , is in the same stage . The passage of the Griswold bill by the Assembly will send it to the Governor . It will be an easy matter then to send the Graham bill to the Senate and to hold . that body responsible for its defeat . It is plain that the friends of the gas companies tried to befog and mislead the Assembly in order that the only reduction bill that could become a law might be killed and that a bill endangering or even repealing the gas legislation of last year for this city might be pushed through and sent to the Senate . It will not be difficult for the people of New-York and Brooklyn to point out the men - who have been unfaithful to their trust as well as those by whose efforts the schemes of the gas companies have thus far been thwarted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
