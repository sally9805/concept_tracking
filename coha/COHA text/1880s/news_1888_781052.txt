txt The big drop of prespiration Which hung quivering on the left ear of the Ship News tele-graph operator at the Battery yesterday morning , as he took from the wire the names of the incoming tramp steamers , dropped with a thud as " Etruria off Fire Island , 9 A. M. , " ticked ' sharply off . Not one of the most sanguine old Battery salts . who are continually arranging changes of the fastest passages on record , expected the Cunarder before the afternoon , and all were soon happy in the knowledge that the - record from Queenstown. to New-York had received a terrible smashing . The Etruria reached the bar at 10:45. and by 4 o'clock had her passengers landed . Her exact time from Queenstown to Sandy Hook was 6 days , 1 hour and 55 minutes . The record of the Etruria Is a moat remark . able one . She tog not only beaten the fastest previous record for the passage , but she has beaten the best previous single day 's run , and made the great average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exact average is 470 knuts per day , and 19.6 knots per hour . She left Queenstown at 1:25 o'clock Sunday afternoon . At first it did not appear as if the elements would favor even an ordinary trip . On the second day out a fresh gale was blowing from the West , and the sea was choppy . at times coming over the bow . In fact , as one of the officers put it , " it was as nasty weather as a man 's worst enemy could wish him to be outin . " About this time Capt . Cook . who is affectionately spoken of as " our little man , " did not have great hopes of a fast run . Capt . Cook is a perfectly capable officer , and he does what is best for his ship and Passengers without regard to record-smashing . There was only one thing to do  --  slow down . For two hours the engines were run at reduced speed . Then the rough weather moderated and the vessel went ahead again full speed , in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , the Umbria , at 6 days , 4 hours , and 42 minutes . The start had been bad , ' however , and in the first-two days only 913 knots had been made . On the third day out the Etruria began to do her telling work , and the next day she did remarkably well , though making only five knots above the average of the entire trip . ' Friday , however , she let herself loose and kielted ? up her heels at a tremendously lively rate . On this day , and on this day only , she went ahead under both steam and sail . A fresh breeze was blowing and every advantage was taken of it . The day 's run was 503 knotg , which is a long way ahead of any previous single day 's run either of the Etruria or of any other transatlantic steamship . The daily runs were as follows : May 28 , 455 ; 29. 458 ; 30 , 496 ; 31 , 485 ; June 1 , 503 ; June 2 , 457 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave of his 271 cabin passengers at the Cunard pier few of them realized what a strain the plucky commander had undergone during the last three days of the voyage . For 1,200-odd relies the Etruria had made her way through fog , not of the denest sort , but thick enough to make the greatest care necessary , , and Capt . Cook had been on the bridge almost constantly . He felt perfectly rewarded for all his lost sleep , however , in the thought that be had wrested the record from the Umbria and Capt . MoMiokan . The Umbria had held the record from Queenstown to New-York since May , 1887 , and at one time held both eastward and westward . records , but the former was captured by the Etruria a few weeks ago . Before the Umbria came to the front the Etruria had been at the head of the list since August , 1885 , and every . one knew that Capt . Cook had kept his eye longingly and determinedly on first place . The 6 days 1 hour and 55 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago Were looked on as remarkably fast tripe . look like very slow ones . Up to nearly1875 , 10 or even 11 days was not consideredo slow . passage from ' Queenstown to New-York , and even the .0unard Linodid not ' do much better than that : The rivalry began , and that and the great improvement in models and machinery that in a great degree grew out of it caused a. rapid lowering of the - time consumed in crossing . the Atlantic . The ocean-traveling public and the ocean shippers of course chose the best record steamers for their uses , and rivalry , improvement , and the demands of the public together kept bringing the record down . The Guion Line steamship Arizona began , in 1881 , to make a rush for the head of the line of fast transatlantic steamers , and in October made the trip from New-York to Queenstown in 7 days 7 hours and 23 minutes , which was better than had previously been done , The Guion Line was not wholly satisfied with the Arizona , however , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , was satisfied that he could build a steamship that would beat her . The Alaska was then built by the Guion Line , and she , as Sir William Pearce announced she would do , broke all previous records . In May , 1882. she steamed from New-York to Queenstown in 6 days 21 hours and 46 minutes , beating all eastward records . In the same month she made the westward trip in 7 days 4 hours and 10 minutes , which was in much shorter time than it had been made before . In June of the same year she beat her own eastward record , making it in 6 days 21 hours and 10 minutes , and also lowered her previous westward record , making it 7 days 1 hour and 50 minutes . In September , 1883 , she made the westward record 6 days 21 hours and 40 minutes , and the next year lowered it by 5 hours and 2 minutes . By the time she made the last good record , however , she had ceased to be the fastest transatlantio steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , built by the same company , and for the same line . The Oregon made her first trip in 1883 , and , as rapidly as the Alaska had done , began to come to the front . In September , 1884 , she made the time to Queenstown. 6 days 11 hours and 9 minutes , and soon after reduced the Queenstown to New-York record to 6 days 10 hours and 10 minutes , which she beat in the same month by 48 minutes . The Oregon 's record-breaking did not run much into 1885 , and before she sank , in 1886 , she had given up her place at the head . The Cunarder Etruria hit out at the record in 1885 , and lowered it LOS days 5 hours 31 minutes , and since that date the race or first place has been confined to the Cunard Line . It is likely , however , that the near future will see some lively competition . The Inman Line has its new steamship , the City of New-York , launched , and she will make ter first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The Guion Line has begun preparations for a. new steamer , which Sir William Pearce boldly declares will make the passage in five days . When these new steamers are finished the Cunard . Ininan , and Galen Lines will strain every nerve , the first to . keep and the others to break the record . Steamships are sometimes " cranky . " and do not come up . to what is expected of them , or , having made a few fast passages , never make as good time again . The steamship America is an instance of this , she having ' beaten the record at one time , but never afterward coming to the front , although she has always . made good passages . Thus the Cunard people . while they hold the record , propose to wait and see what the'new steamships really do before making preparations for vessels of their own to do better than those they already have .
