txt The Tariff Commission bill was again taken up this afternoon , when Mr. Van Wyck made a speech against it and Mr. Brown spoke at length in favor of it . Mr. Brown 's remarks were listened to with interest , for the reason that toward the close he concurred almost entirely with the sentiments expressed a day or two ago by Mr. Miller , of New-York , when he declared that the South would soon discover the necessity of sending Representatives to Cougress who would protect her industries . Mr. Brown believes that , as the country or the Government needs about P300.000,000 income , and will get about $100,000,000 from internal revenue , that it must get the $200,000,000 additional by a tariff . Admitting the tariff to be unjust , he would have it amended , and believes that the proposition of Mr. Morrill to collect information by e commission provides a good method for securing the knowledge necessary to enable Congress to act intelligently . A good deal had been said in the discussion of the bill about the Democratic platforni and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they should enter into the discussion In that way . " The Democratic Party , of which I am proud to be a member , " said the Senator , would not in the next campaign insert in its platform a plank of tariff for revenue only . He believed it would speak for a tariff for revenue with incidental protection . There were districts now represented by Democrats in which he believed it would be impossible for Democrats to elect their men if they stood upon a free trade platform . This would be the case not only in his State , but also in South Carolina and Louisiana , where rice-growers and sugargrowers would insist upon protection . Then there were wool-raisers who would not patiently listen to a proposition to reduce the tariff . Again , he said that there were districts both South and North which the Democrats could not carry on a platform of tariff for revenue only . He also believed there were districts in the West which the Republicans would find it difficult to carry on a protection platform merely for protection 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes in this matter , but would keep to the medium line . The sooner the matter was eliminated from politics the better it would be for the country . In his opinion the subject was a great and grave one , and ought not to be discussed in a partisan spirit . hen the proposition to admit a part of Dakota Territory as a State was made early in the session it was expected that it would be opposed by the Democrats . That opposition has been already manifested by a report in the House by four Democratic members of the Committee on Territories . In the Senate today Mr. Vest rose to ask that the bill reported B week ago by Mr. Saunders , Chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories , be recommitted , giving as a reason for his request the excuse that illness and consequent absence had prevented him from making a minority report . The Democratic side took the alarm which Mr. Vest had sounded , and Mr. Garland and Mr. Butler , his associates on the committee , joined their requests to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was any opposition to the bill , and said that it had not been manifesed in committee . He also suggested that if the only object of the gentlemen who had spoken was to make a minority report they could do that without going to the trouble of returning the bill to the committee . The favorable report acccmpanying the bill set forth the conditions , geographical , political , and material , of the proposed new State as answering to the requirements of a Territory seeking admission to the Union of States . The Territory was found to be wealthy and increasing in wealth , with 1,152 miles of railroad In operation , with property assessed at $16 , - 600,000 , with 4 national and 44 private banks , many weekly and daily newspapers , high schools , with finebuildings , and a bonded debt of $90,000 in 5-20 6 per cent , bonds , selling at 3 per cent . premium . As some doubt existed in the minds of the majority of the committee as to whether the population is large enough to justify the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition precedent to admission a census . and lett in blank the lines of the bill specifying the number of inhabitants to be named as necessary to entitle it to a place as a State . The day after this report was made Mr. Hale filed a protest , said to have come from holders of bonds issued by Yankton County , against the admission of the Territory as a State . According to the protest Yankton County in 1872 issued $200,000 in bonds in aid of the Dakota Southern Railroad , by authority of Congress and a Note of , the people of the county , and afterward , in 1881 , by act of the Legislature of the Territory , virtually repudiated the indebtedness by enacting a proposition to settle with t . e bondholders at 50 cents on the dollar . The petitioners fear that if the authority of Congress over the Territory is withdrawn they will be deprived of their overdue unpaid interest , now amounting to more than $150,000 , upon $ : - .0,000 of which judgments have been obtained against the county . The principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , Eugland. which holds $89,000 , and persons in Maine , New-Hampshire , Pennsylvania , Ohio , New-York , Kansas , Illinois , and Toronto . The New-York holders are in Buffalo , Utica , and Lockport . Mr. Hale , joining with the Democrats in the demand for a recommittal of the bill , stirred up Mr. Plumb , of Kansas , who suggested that if the Committe on Territories were going into the business of ascertaining whether the financial condition of cities , towns , or counties was to be taken as determining in any way the fitness of States to enjoy State relations it would be well to ascertain why Elizabeth and Rahway , N. J. , had repudiated or failed to fulfill their obligations , and to say what the effect of their failures should be upon the standing of New-Jersey . He intimated that there might be other States into the condition of which the committee could look with profit , Mr. Saunders , having protested for some time against the motion to recommit , at last permitted the motion to be adopted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the matter of the repudiation of bonds by Yankton County will be considered . , The Senate to-day passed a bill giving to Albert H. Emery , of New-York , $225,000 to pay him for the time and money expended by him in constructing the great testing machine in the Watertown Arsenal . A similar bill has been reported in the House , fixing the sum at $200,000 . The claim is admitted by all to be a just one , and the great excellence and value of the machine have been repeatedly shown by eminent engineers , scientific associations , and officers of the Government . The actual cost of the machine exceeded the money appropriated by Congress by about $100,000 . ' The President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers has declared that the construction of the machine was one of the greatest pieces of engineering work over done . The machine tests the strength of a cable for the East River bridge and that of a horse hair with equal accuracy , and by crushing iron columns or egg-shells reveals the sustaining power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tag Tistits . Efforts have been made from year to year to satisfy this claim by including . the money in one of the general appropriation bills , . but the estimate has been excluded on technical grounds , while the justice of the claim was admitted . The favorable consideration of the claim was urged upon Congress by President Hayes and the Secretary of War . Mr. Emery hopes to get a return for the money he has expended before the end of the present session .
