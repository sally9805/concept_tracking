She is sitting at right of table sewing a patch on a coat , already well patched in different shades ; rocking the cradle with one foot .

Looking towards the cradle Poor baby ! How can its mother give it food , when she gets hardly enough to keep her own soul and body together ? H-s  --  h ! Sings to the baby There ! Finishing her work That looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best coat ! I 've patched and mended it so that there is very little of the original coat left . She lays the coat over a chair up R.C.

She has commissioned me to say to you that she will gladly provide for yourself and infant and will give you remunerative employment in her own household . Whitworth Lawrence . " There are a hundred other women as near starvation as I am , among the workmen 's wives . Returning note to her bosom The rich Mr. Whitworth Lawrence takes a peculiar interest in my welfare ? Runs to cradle R. , kneels and rocks the cradle H  --  s  --  h ! So hungry , poor little darling  --  Drops her face into her hands weeping over the cradle . A knock at the door L.C. Come in .

She looks in the basket , shows its emptiness ; walks sadly to table ; sits That 's all I could find , Rho . There 's lots of that in the market  --  piles of it . Cook it any way you like , Rho ; and warm it over for breakfast . Broil it . Rho . Rhoda Oh , Rudolph ! The baby will turn her little head to me in vain . It will die  --  it will die . Dropping her head upon the table Rud . Rudolph Wiegand Babies are sent from Heaven , they say . I wonder what they were thinking of , up there  --  when they sent off that one to such a place as this . The shipping clerk must have made a wrong entry . It would have been so much better for her , if she 'd stayed there and waited for us . Heigh-ho ! I 'm afraid they 've discovered the mistake  --  and ordered her back . He walks down L. Takes chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . It falls over . He picks it up Rho , our furniture is getting out of repair . It needs varnishing  --  and  --  and so forth . It ought to be upholstered , too . I wonder whether we 'd better have plain satin or brocatelle . He puts back chair ; tries to hang hat on a nail L. It falls to the floor Oh !  --  I forgot . I used that nail to mend the baby 's cradle with . He takes the piece of broken glass from the looking-glass frame Rho , we ought to purchase a new pier glass ! This one has ceased to be an ornament to our drawing-room . Returns glass . He turns , walks R. Stops C. and looks at Rhoda , who remains with her head upon table That woman would adorn the mansion of a millionaire . Plenty of women can do that . She adorns the home of a poor man . Very  --  few  --  women  --  can  --  do  --  that . He throws his arms over his head and turns upstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience Rho  --  Turning We 'll have to get some new French plate for our conservatory . He moves down near her ; looks at her a moment She 's thinking of the baby . The baby will be thinking of her , in a few minutes . Then they 'll both be miserable . Moves to cradle H-u-s-h ! There 's a smile on the baby 's face . She 's dreaming of the place she came from . I wonder if she sees the messengers coming for her . Looks around Perhaps they 're here , now , waiting for her . Rhoda rises and walks L. where she stands with back half to the audience in an attitude of sorrow . Rudolph raises the child 's coverlet How that woman has worked to keep things together . That coverlet is embroidered all over  --  with gold . She 's an accomplished woman  --  Rho is . Heigh-ho . He lays back the coverlet ; turns ; walks toward Rhoda , stops , looks away She 's trying to keep back the tears , for my sake . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . There are more heroines in this world than there are books to tell about them ; and their husbands never know it . He returns to chair at table , R.C. He sits , in a dejected way , leaning back . As he stretches out his leg the table-leg falls . He picks it up hurriedly and looks over to cradle H-u-s-h . Rho , I 've been thinking of getting a chattel mortgage on the furniture . Rises One of the banks might lend us a basket of cold victuals on that security . Rho . Rhoda C oming C. Rudolph ! Moves to him You  --  You have been drinking again , Rudy . Rud . Rudolph Wiegand Guiltily I  --  I did take just a drop or two of whiskey , Rho . Rho . Rhoda Oh  --  Rudy ! Rud . Rudolph Wiegand I  --  I met Bill Overdeck as I was coming in  --  Rho .

Judge Merrybone will also propose to me this evening . The widow of a United States senator  --  with thirty thousand dollars a year  --  can predict a proposal with as much accuracy as an astronomer can predict an eclipse or the transit of Venus . The only question is  --  which shall be the eclipse  --  and which the transit of Venus ? The late senator asked me , one day , whether I should ever marry again in case he departed this life . " Senator , " said I , " I have n't the remotest idea . " " Widows generally do marry , " said he . " Senator , " said I , " they do . " Resumes the picking Metcalfe  --  Merrybone .

Only last night , a weary and broken form stood at my bedside , ragged , forlorn , prematurely old ; I dreamed that it was my husband . It seemed like reality . For aught I know , he may be a wanderer upon the face of the earth . I am miserable , Nellie  --  miserable ! Mrs. D. Mrs. Nellie Dashwood There , my dear !  --  You must n't believe in ghosts .

And when I was coming home , I  --  I  --  I met Geoffrey  --  under the beeches . Geoffrey was out for a walk before breakfast , too . Geoffrey has  --  he  --  he has happened to take a walk every morning before breakfast  --  for the last four weeks  --  at just the same time that I take my walk . That 's the way the accident happened , mamma . Geoffrey and I sat down under the beeches and we ate what I had in the basket ourselves . Rho .
