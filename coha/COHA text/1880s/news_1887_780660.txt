txt Shortly after 7 o'clock this morning it was discovered that the jewelry store of G. W. Fairchild , on Main-street , had been entered by burglars and that the safe in which most of the valuables were contained had been despoiled . The value of the booty , consisting of diamonds , watches , and other valuables , secured by the thieves is about $15,000 , not including a number of gold watches left in the place forrepair . The thieves took only the most valuable articles , leaving behind , as if in contempt , a ten-dollar Confederate bill and an old sledgehammer with a broken handle .

A number of gaslights are left burning in the store all night , but , to secure themselves from observation , the thieves hung in front a screen made up of white cloth taken from the showcases and folds of black cambric - which they had brought themselves and left behind . The safe was forced open by the use of wedges , a sledge hammer and jimmies . The sledge hammer was also left behind . It has a broken handle , and looks as if it might have been taken from a junk shop . The police have no clue to the , thieves , although the scene of the robbery is patroled by a regular officer and two private watchmen . How the cracksmen could have operated on the main thoroughfare of the City without detection by some of these officials is the present conundrum.
