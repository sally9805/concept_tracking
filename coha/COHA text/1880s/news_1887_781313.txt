txt The conference at Meeker between Gov . Adams . Gen. Crook Indian Agent Byrnes , and others is over . Gov Adams agrees that the stock captured from the Utes shall be returned as far as possible , and Gen. Crook says he will urge upon the Government the necessity of indemnifying the Utes for the stock that can not be recovered . This arrangement Agent Byrnes says will be satisfactory to the Utes . Gen. Crook also agrees to station two companies of regulars on the Colorado line of the reservation to prevent any Utos from coming into the State . A home guard company , to be under military direction , will also be organized at Meeker . Tho Governor , Congressman Symes , and other members of his party will leave Meeker to-night for home . Gen. Crook expects to make a visit to the agency before ho returns East . The conferenve between Gon . Crook and Gov . Adams , which lasted all day , ended at night in a mass meeting of citizens . The statements made at the conference by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis , pro-duced a decided sensation , as their story of Thursday 's battle and the circumstances leading up to it was utterly at variance with the reports previously returned at Meeker . At the mass meeting at night it was openly charged that either the army officers were deliberately falsifying or they were not acquainted with the truth . The statements of Agent Byrnes , Lieut . Bennett , and Interpreter Curtis wore all to the effect that the Utes were surprised while pre-paring breakfast , and their only loss was one boy killed , who was trampled to death , and one girl and two bucks wounded . These statements were made in the presence of several men who took part in the battle , and they unhesitatingly pronounced them false , as they had each personally seen from three to five bodies of Utes on the battlefield . Late in the afternood a company of troops arrived in Meeker with seventy odd of the captured Indian ponies , and , as if intended to disprove the statement of the army officials , the men brought with them two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found who would acknowledge that ho had personally removed . the scalps , but that they were trophies of the recent battle could not be doubted . Even the army officials were convinced of their mistake . They saki that the Indians certainly did not know of their lose , and when they did find it out it would Iced to more engagements . Agent Byrnes further states that the Indians , when attacked , thought they were on their reservation . Said he : " The eastern boundary line of the reservation has never been definitely established . I have asked for a survey and that it be established . I have secured actetachment to work on tho survey . I have also asked for a detachment to stay there until such lino was definitely settled and defined . I could not well leave to attend to the work /cried . I have had the census to take , quarterly reports to make out , and the annuities to disburse . I have not been dilatory in my work , and have given a bond in tho sum of $40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful perform ance of my duty . Only last Saturday I paid out the last of the annuities at the Odray Agency . t finished paying them ' their annuities only last Saturday . I distributed $17,000 , all in silver ? bright new silver dollars . " I had learned that the Sheriff 's party was chasing them in Colorado and I wanted to keep as many of them at home as possible , so I counted out the money to them a aollar at a time to consume as much time as possible . I thought the money would hold then , and I believe it did . They got their blankets full of money . The Indians claim they have lost 400 horses , 2,000 sheep , and some goats . These they want returned , and ' I believe It they are not returned there will be an uprising . If the stock is returned I believe the Indians will keep their promise and stay on the reservation . We controlled them this time but they thought they had groat loss of life to avenge . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but we got theta to return borne and they now want their stock . There are not enough troops at the agency or near it to contest them if they choose to go on the warpath . They say that they are not mad and do not want to fight . "
