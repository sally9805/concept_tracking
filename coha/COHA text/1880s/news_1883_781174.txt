txt The calling of the case of Frank James in the Criminal Court here to-day was the occasion for the gather-ing of a largo crewd of curiosity-seekers around the Court-house , and when the case was taken up at 2 P. M. the court-room was literally lammed . The prisoner appeared dressed in a neat business suit . He seemed quite collected and very calmly bore the scrutiny of the large crowds . He was under indictment for the murder of a Chicago detective named Witcher , near Kearney , in 1874 , and also for participation in the Independence ( Mo. ) bank robbery in 1878 . When the cases were called The Prosecuting Attorney arose and said that on account of the great length of time which had elapsed since the crimes were committed he had found It impossible to secure evidence sufficient to warrant the State in going to trial , and the State would theretore dismiss both oases . Exclamations of surprise were heard In the court-room , a buzz of excitement was manifested , and the prisoner coolly shifted his position and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prosecuting Attorney , " I will present an indictment against Frank James for participating In the Blue Cut train robbery of Sent . 7 , 1881 , " which he proceeded to do . The prisoner was arraigned , and entered a plea of " not guilty , " and his case was then set for next May . His counsel applied for ball , and the court fixed the amount at 53,500 . The prisoner was then removed to the jail at Independence . Ho declares that he was not in this part of the country when the Blue Cut robbery was committed , and consequently feels little apprehension concerning punishment in this county . He will probably give bail to-morrow .
