txt It is time that the finding of bottles containing accounts of alleged shipwrecks should be made a crime punishable by law . The offense is not only frequent , but it is growing more and more frequent , and the only way to check it is by sternly punishing every bottle-finder . The belief that sea Captains , when in positions of imminent peril , abandon the care of their vessels in order to write descriptive articles for publication in bottles is one of the curious delusions of the human mind . The first sea Captain to whom tradition ascribes this practice was CHRISTOPEMB COLUMBUS , whose unjustifiable discovery , of the West India Islands has so often been described by unthinking persons as an excusable and even meritorious achievement . We are told that on his way home during his first voyage COLUMBUS met with a terrific cyclone in the neighborhood of the Azores . Instead of overhauling his " Maury 's Sailing Directions , " and then running out of the cyclone by bringing the wind on his starboard quarter , COLUMBUS is said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full account of his voyage and his American discoveries in two volumes , royal octavo . The manuscript of this voluminous work he incased in wax , and inclosed the water-proof bundle thus made in : an oyster keg , ? which he committed to the ' waves , with the expectation that if his vessel should be lost the publication of his " Voyages and Discoveries , " in keg form ? with wax - binding  --  would perpetuate his memory and afford his son grounds for an application to the Spanish Government for hack pay and a pension . This story has ; been unhesitatingly believed for centuries , , in spite of its intrinsic improbability . CoIAMBUS had no opportunity , while the tern'pest was raging , to write his memoirs . His time , during that critical period was fully occupied in persuading his cowardly sailors with belaying-pins and encouraging them with handspikes to do their duty . If he ; really went below and passed a few weeks in writing for oyster kegs , he was unfit to command his ship , incapable Of crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made any discoveries and probably never existed . Nobody ever picked up on the sea-shore any oyster keg containing the complete autobiographical works of CIMISTOPHER CoLMINA , for the reason that in those days the exquisite humor of finding records of missing vessels had never been discovered . Moreover , COLUMBUS and his ship ultimately came safe to land , and all interest in his keg publications naturally ceased . Ever since that time , however , the theory that ship Captains are . IA the habit of throwing overboard bottles containing important information has been firmly believed . Most people imagine that when a ship is in danger the Captain calls out : " Steward Bring me pen , ink , and paper , and a large bottle of ale , and do n't forget to bring my writingdesk and a stick of sealing-wax and a candle and matches , and bear a hand , will you , and be blanked to you . " Thereupon the steward obeys the order , and the Captain . seating himself , writes as follows : " Lat. so and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking , and expect that before very long we shall be in collision with an iceberg , besides being run down by an unknown steamer . Heaven have mercy on us . James Smith , Captain of ship Nonesuch . " Uncorking the bottle and emptying its contents down the nearest throat , the Captain places his able and eloquent production in the bottle and throws it overboard , after which the vessel immediately sinks , and all on board perish miserably . Six months afterward a halfdozen of that bottle are picked up at various Summer watering-places along the American coast , and the public is thereby convinced that the bottle-finders deserve even a worse fate than the practical jokers who point unloaded fire-arms at their sisters , or the still more wretched humorists who shamelessly ask , " What , never ? " or reply to unoffending victims , " Hardly ever . " Of course , the real truth of the matter is that no sea Captain ever did or ever will devote his time to casting postal bottles on the surface of the ocean . If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a wanton idiot of himself by such conduct , and if his ship is in danger , he has something to do of more importance than contributing to bottle literature . Besides , the sea Captain knows that even if he should throw a thrilling , picturesque , and truthful bottle dispatch overboard no one would ever find it . LThe chance that it would be picked up by a civilized human being would be even less than the chance that a ten-dollar bill inclosed in a letter and deposited in an American Post Office would ever reach its destination . The bottles picked up at the sea-shore are , without exception , unauthorized publications , and no better than literary  --  or , rather , illiterary  --  forgeries , and hence their finders and authors deserve to be taught the error of their ways . There has recently been invented a dispatch-boat which may possibly come into use and prove to be of real service . It is a small toy boat , about two feet long , containing an air-tight chamber , in which a Captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposithis " Notes of Ocean Travel , with Observations on his Impending Ship-wreck . " When thrown overboard this little boat will sail gayly away , and must , in the nature of things , ultimately arrive somewhere . Its white sail can readily be seen from the deck of a passing vessel , and when circumstances permit it will , of course , be picked up . The sea-side humorists will not attempt to imitate it , for while an empty bottle costs nothing , a dispatch-boat must be built to order and at considerable expense . When such a boat is actually found , even at Coney Island or Long Branch , the presumption that it has really been launched from a sinking ship will be very strong . When we consider how constantly the modern overloaded freight steam-ships are missing , it is clear that the time for the use of these newly invented dispatch-boats has fully come . Had COLUMBUS had one of them , and could he have contented himself with writing a few " stickfuls " concerning his voyage , he might have launched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final discovery by some intelligent man which could not have attended his long and heavy oyster-keg publication .
