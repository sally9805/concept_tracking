txt A story is told here to-day of the capture of a schooner a few miles down the river yesterday by a lunatic named Edmund Sherrell and its subsequent recapture by Capt . Guild and his crew . Sberrell is a man who , although of decidedly unsound mind , has been considered harmless and is allowed to run at large . Yesterday the schooner Emma F. , a tasty-tooking craft , was brought close to a small dock at the lower part of this county , and the Captain and all the crew but one man jumped ashore and ran up to a small variety store to get some tobacco and other articles , Intending to return in a very few minutes . Sherrell , it is said , was sitting on the bank of the river close by , and as soon as the men had disappeared from sight he jumped on board the schooner , unfastened the ropes which tied her to the dock , and pushed away . Charles Duff , the man who had been left on board , was in tape cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , closed the cabin door and fastened it securely . He then took the helm and guided the vessel out into the stream , where she received wind enough to carry her alone ' at a rapid rate . When the men came out of the store and down to the water to board ' their vessel they saw her pretty well down stream and were sorely perDexed . The lunatic In the meantime , not being much of a sailor , became evidently startled at the progress he was making and began lowering his sail , bringing the boat almost to a standstill in the stream . The Captain and his crew , accompanied by an officer , started off in a rowboat and reached the schooner , when Sherrell was taken in charge . The lunatic said he had started off for a trip to Europe , intending to return the next day .
