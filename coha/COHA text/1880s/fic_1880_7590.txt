Bierce , Ambrose , 1842-1914 ? : The winds of heaven trample down the pines from " The winds of heaven trample down the pines " ( 1880 ) The winds of heaven trample down the pines , Or creep in lazy tides along the lea ; Leap the wild waters from the smitten rock , Or crawl with childish babble to the sea ; But why the tempests out of heaven blow , Or what the purpose of the seaward flow , No man hath known , and none shall ever know . Why seek to know ? To follow Nature up Against the current to her source , why care ? Vain is the toil ; he 's wisest still who knows All science is but formulated prayer  --  Prayer for the warm winds and the quickening rain , Prayer for sharp sickle and for laboring wain , To gather from the planted past the grain .  --  A. G. Bierce.
