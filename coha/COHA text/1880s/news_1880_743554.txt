txt The application for a pension made by Robert Hanna , of South Carolina , and filed in the Pension Bureau a month or two ago , has attracted much attention because Hanna served through the war in the rebel Army . This application has been regarded as the only one of its kind . This is a mistake , for many rebel soldiers and representatives of rebel soldiers have taken the necessary steps to procure pensions from the Government against which they fought . It is not known that these applications have been filed in the Pension Bureau , but there is reason to believe that hundreds of them have been placed in the hands of pension agents in this city . Mr. George E. Lemon , one of the most prominent of the pension agents of Washington , declared to the correspondent of THE TIMES to-day that he had received about 150 applications within the last four or five years from rebel soldiers or their heirs .

Mr. Lemon looked at his files and in a few minutes found two or three of these applications , which may be regarded as specimens of the lot . Davison Abram Miller applied July 27 , 1876 , for Mr. Lemon 's aid in procuring for him a pension . His letter declares that he was a volunteer in the Fiftv-fifth North Carolina Regiment , his officers baying been Capt . Van Teague , Col. Conley , Gen. Davis , and Brig. - Gen. Heath . He says : " 1 send this to you to see if there is any chance for a pension , of which I am in great need . " applications were made also by Mrs. Celia Hubbard , of Patrick County , Vat whose husband , William Hubbard , enhsted in Company D , Fifty-first Virginia Regiment , as a private , in March , 1862 . He died in the service , May 30 , 1863 , leaving five children . To the question whether she had ever aided or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " This question was one of a list forwarded to her , which included one which asked if her husband was in the Northern army . It was not until this list was returned that the real nature of the application became known to the agent . A similar application was made by Mrs. Frances Hubbard , of Patrick County , Va. , whose husband enlisted in the Fifty . first Virginia Regiment , Floye 's brigade , in August.I1862 , and died in the service , leaving six children . She asserted that she had hot aided or abetted the rebellion . Mrs. Sarah C. Boyd , also of Patrick County . Va. , applies on account of her husband , Heron Boyd , who enlisted in March , 1862 , in Company F , . Eighteenth Virginia Regiment , and died in 1874 .
