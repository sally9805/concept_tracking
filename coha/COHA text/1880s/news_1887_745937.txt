txt All Sunday night a terrible storm of wind and snow swept over Lake Erie , and during the whole of it two men were out on the ice which covers the lake , suffering the torments of cold and hunger and engaged in a struggle for life . A German named John Gerner and an Irishman named Brinter started at 5:30 o'clock Sunday morning on a fishing trip . They went up the lake some fifteen miles , the weather being cold and clear when they started . They went out much further than was necessary , and as they passed along they went over hundreds of cakes of ice , many of which overlapped one another , though apparently they were frozen together . After being out some time , and having caught considerable fish , Gerner urged his companion to return , calling his attention to an approaching storm and the fact that the regular fishermen had gone in . Brinter would not go , however . and it was not long before the storm descended upon them . It was only after much difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . The ice was breaking up in all directions , and the poor fellows had to try nearly every cake before daring to trust themselves on it . They were soon chilled to the bone , and so hungry that even raw fish was palatable . The sled , tools , and fish had finally to be abandoned . Brinters ' mind began to wander after the struggle for life had been kept up several hours , and he kept constantly complaining that his wife would give him nothing to eat . At times the wind forced them to lie down on the ice and then they were blown along on their stomachs like paper before the wind . Both men by the time they reached the outskirts of the city , were nearly dead , and it was 22 hours after they left homebefore they again reached shelter . Gerner 's feet were badly frozen , but he is able to be around now , though Brinter is still confined to his bed .
