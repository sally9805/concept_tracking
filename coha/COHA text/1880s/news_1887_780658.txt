txt Dr. McGlynn 's statement in yesterday 's TIMES about the friendship of Archbishop Corrigan to Mr. Blaine and his efforts in aid of his election in 1884 naturally created a great deal of excitement among menet all classes , and the politicians of both parties found it a fruitful subject for discussion . It is a striking comInentary both on the reputation of Dr. McGlynn for truthfulness and on the reputation of Mr. Blaine for intrigue that no ' one at all informed about the history of the last Presidential campaign ventured to deny Dr. McGlynn 's statements . Many politicians narrated incidents and circumstances which illustrated and corroborated Dr. Mcalisein 's statements . But the most . important historical contribution was made by a Catholic gentleman , perhaps the closest friend that Dr. McGlynn has ; a man who bas been intimate with him all his life and possesses his utmost confidence . For obvious reasons his name is withueld , but his story is an interesting tale of the polities of the Catholic hierarchy of sew-York during the past quarter of a century . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TRIES the merest skeleton of the actions of - archbishop Corrigan and John Kelly during the campaign of ' S &L; His failure to give incidents Is not because ho does not have them to give , but from a reluctance which we all can understand . I know . I think , all that he knows , far during many years he has been in the habit of telling me his experiences from time to tim as they occurred . I know the hatred which Dr. McGlynn 's earnest advocacy of Mr. Cleveland 's election excited , both in the archiepiscopal residence and in Tammany Hall . Dr. McGlynn has Often talked with me about it , and about the nn-American policy which the heads of the Catholic . Church in New-York were pursuing . Just how Mr. Elaine made his arrangements with the Archbishop and . with Tammany Hall , of course I do n't know , but an arrangement was made early in the campaign . Perhaps Patrick Ford , of the Irish . World , was the go-between . Perhaps not , though . Some otherman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tile Blaine crowd early in the campaign , and changed all at once from a red-hot Democrat to a red-hot Blaineite . He was expected to have great influence on the Irish vote , especially the laboring Irish . It was just this class of voters , however , that Dr. McGlynn was powerful with , and his speeches and personal influence led thousands of them in the Democratic ranks , thus counteracting " Pat " Ford 's work , and making the moneat spent upon him of little avail , " " Were any efforts made to silence Dr. McGlynn during the campaign I " " Not in the theological sense . They did not dare to discipline him ecclesiastically for speaking for Cleveland , though they would have liked to . But Tammany Hall pretended to be loyal for Cleveland and so did the palace . Not daring to show their hand ' for Blame and act openly , means were quietly adopted for ascertaining ' whether Dr. 3IcGlyun would not keep still , and do and say nothing . They knew his influence with the common people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth when he engages in the support of a cause , and he spoke and canvassed for Cleveland till the end . His ardent and eloquent advocacy of Mr. Cleveland was laid up ' against him for future use . " " Dr. McGlynn says that Archbishop Corrigan admitted to him that he was opposed to Mr. Cleveland 's election . " " Yes ; Dr. 3IcGlynn told me that soon after he had the conversation with the Archbishop . And I can tell you a curious piece of cheek ' on the part of his Grace . Mr. Clevelana , after the eleclion , expressed to Dr. McGlynn in the most cordial manner his sense of the valuable assistance he had rendered him . Tho Archbishop knew of this , and notwithstanding the fact that he had told Dr. McGlynn that lie wanted Mr. Cleveland defeated he asked him to use his influence in behalf of a friend who wished to be appointed to an important office . " " Was there any special reason which made the Archbishop dislike Mr. Cleveland 7 " " Yes . He disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic House of Refuge and for the Catholic Protectory . Dr. McGlynn sustained him in these vetoes. taking the ground he always had , that sectarian schools should not be helped by the Commonwealth . But the priests of the archdio-cese and of the Catholic dioceses in the State were told to work against Mr. Cleveland on account of these vetoes , and they " In confirmation of the attitude of hostility of Sohn Kelly and Tammany Hall to Mr. Cleveland I can give you a story told me by my friend , exSenator Ecelesine . He left Tammany Hall , when John Kelly ' bolted ' against Lucius Robinson 's nomination in 1877 , and went over to Irving Hall . Still he kept up his old friendly relations - with most of the members of Tammany Hall , and , in fact , acted with them occasionally in polities . Re told me that , in the morning of election day in 1884 , he took a walk , and , living near Tammany Hail , he soon came in front of it . It was raining . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come In out of the rain . He was taken into a private room , where Johu Kelly was seated at a table and a number of the leaders of Tammany stood or sat near him . To my amazement , ' said Senator Ecelesine , at his elbow sat Tom Grady , and they were engaged in an earnest whispering , which continued for several minutes , and then Tom went away , looking as though he was engaged in Important business . ' To fully appreciate the significance of this it should be remembered that Tom Grady had left Tammany Hall with a great flourish of trumpets early in the campaign , upon the pretense that he could not countenance the official adherence of that organization to Mr. Cleveland ; had stumped the State for Gen. Butler , and had bedaubed Mr. Cleveland with all the abuse of when his slanderous tongue was capable . Yet this man , who was a deserter from the Democratic camp and ' a traitor to Tammany Hall  --  if that organization stood by its professions ? was in private consultation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently on the most friendly terms with him . Senator Eccleslue saki that lie was astonished at what he saw in that room , and that he left fully convinced . that John Kelly and his friends were enemies of Cleveland . " Have you any more incidents which you can relate V ' " Yes plenty more ; but I prefer to say something now about Archbishop Corrigan 's attitude toward Mr. Elaine during the conileg campaign , assuming , of course , that Mr. Blaine will be a Candidate for the Presidency , which is note very violent assumption , you will admit . This statement of the Archbishop 's attitude Comes from his Grace 's own lips , and was told by Mrs. James G. Elaine , Jr. , to whom he said it . She , you remember , was Miss Nevins , the granddaughter of au old Democratic statesman of Ohio , Samuel Medary . She is a Catholic . Just before their wedding , accompanied by Father Ducey , she and young Mr. Blaine went to the palace and applied to the Archbishop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Archbishop hesitated about granting the dispensation , and made various objections of a trivial nature , all of which the young lady , who is very bright and well informed . met and answered . At length he said to Mr. Blaine : 6 You al/Qui:I CC.22Aider nareinliv the atran 1.7rtainh you wish to take , for it may imperil the chances of your illustrious father in the campaign of 1888 . ' Miss Nevins understood him to mean that if his son married a Catholic girl the Protestants might take offense and vote against Mr. Blaine . The young couple made no reply to this , and the Archbishop continued : Your father is one of the most eminent , if not the most eminent , man in the country , and you should consider how this action of yours may affect his interests . ' Miss Nevins fired up at this and replied to the Archbishop : ' Then your objection to our marriage is a mere political possibility . You fear that the marriage of two young people , who love one another dearly , ' will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of somebody else . That is a strange objection . ' The Archbishop colored at this onslaught , which was probably made with a good deal of vigor , as Mrs. Blaine possesses great force of character , and she felt outraged by the lack of consideration for her position and her womanly feelings which the Archbishop evinced . If you will not give us your permission to marry , ' said she , know enough of theology to be aware that our marriage , if not celebrated according to the rites of our church , will be perfectly valid , no matter by whom performed , and we shall be married either with or without your permission ' " The Archbishop left the subject of Mr. Blaine 's political fortunes and raised some legal objections about the marriage of minors , Ric . Father Ducey , who had staid in another room , was called in , and he and the Archbishop discussed them . Finally the Archbishop yielded and gave Father Ducey verbal permission to celebrate the marriage . " Still the Archbishop appeared anxious and afraid that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's political prospects . Just as they were going away he repeated substantially what he had said when the interview began and added : ' Now , do n't make any trouble for me . ' " " Did Dr. McGlynn ever say anything to you about the political course of the Catnolio hierarchy which is not brought out in the interview with him published in THE TIMES of yesterday 7 " Dear me , yes . He has again and again regretted its constant interference with political affairs , and always , as he said , against American progress and freedom . This persistent action of the hierarchy was alLthe more painful to Dr. McGlynn because lie believed it to be contrary to the creed and teaching of the Roman Catholic Church . Dr. McGlynn once told me how he was shocked by an expression which he heard fall from Archbishop afeCloskey 's lips during the days when the assaults of THE TIMES upon the Tweed ring had aroused the public indignation and made it certain that it Tweed and Sweeny and Connolly and me rest escaped with the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells of Sing Sing they would be lucky . " A number of Catholic clergymen were at the Archbishop 's  --  he had not then been made a Cardinal  --  when one of them denounced Tweed and his pals for their rasealities , when the Archbishop interrupted him : ' You should not talk that way . Whatever they may have done every Catholic priest should remember that they are our friends . " Dr. McGlynn told me that this remark of Archbishop McCloskey made him sick at heart . It caused him to see that the Catholic hierarchy , iu this diocese at least , acted on the theory that , no matter how wrongful an act might be , if it aggrandized the power of the priesthood it was to be palliated ; if not , condoned . The annual appeals of that horse leech . ' the Catholic Protectory  --  I use Dr. McGlynn 's own epithet  --  and of other Catholic institutions to the Legislature used to make Dr. McGlynn very indignant . He often spoke to me about them , and said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to irresponsible persons to use in private institutious at their own untrammeled will . He knew that his championship of the public school system made him bitter enemies at the archiepiscopal court , as he always called it , but that did not deter him . He always believed that public schools were American , and would not be hostile to the Roman Catholic faith , while he believed that parochial schools are detrimental to the true faith and un-American in their principle . " To put it briefly , Dr. McGlynn for many years has been in a position where he has been able to know a great deal about the inside of politics and Roman Catholic ecclesiastical affairs . He has reluctantly come to believe by the evidence of his senses that the course of the rulers of the Catholic Church was contrary to true Catholicity . He has seen them screenlug and emu-using  --  at least not condemning  --  the gravest sinners against society , like the robbers of the Tweed ring , if the robbers had helped the church to get money and power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one party and privately doing everything to aid him , while publicly they professed , and so did their lay allies , to be for his opponent . All these things have made him lose faith in the rulers of the church , and he has determined henceforth to preach what he feels to be the true doctrines of Catholicity uncontrolled by the hierarchy on a platform of his own .
