txt The scene in the vicinity of the City Hall yesterday was an extraordinary one . From 6 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock this morning the people of the city and people from without the city passed in an unbroken and ever-moving line beside the bier of Gen. GRANT and took their last look of the morta. clay once animated by that heroic spirit . Not less than 125,000 persons passed through the City Hall during the nineteen hours in which the body was exposed to view . Adding to these the number admitted on Wednesday evening , and the very much larger number who will pass by the catafalque today , a total of considerably over a quarter of a million of persons is reached . Upon such an occasion there is a deep significance in numbers . It has been said that in his lifetime Gen. GRANT was seen by a greater number of persons than any other man of his time . Considering his great and long continued prominence in this country , and the unparalleled cordiality of his welcoming in other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of his activity and conspicuousness may be accepted as a true one ; and there is much in such a way of reckoning a man 's greatness that speaks of his nearness to the people and of their wish to do him honor . And now that the great soldier is about to be committed to his tomb the desire to look upon his face moves tens and hundreds of thousands of his countrymen to stand patiently in the long line surrounding the City Hall waiting their turn for a brief moment beside his bier . It is an impressive farewell to earth . It is such a passage to the grave as with his natural shrinking from public display Gen. GRANT , perhaps , would scarcely have desired , and with his modest estimate of his own place in the Nation 's life such as he certainly could not have foreseen . But it is a fitting and worthy lying in state for the hero and leader of a great people . It is a grateful proof of the patriotism of the city chosen for his resting place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
