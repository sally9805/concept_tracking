txt Who will be the Republican Party 's candidate for President four years from now ? It is hardly time to think seriously about that yet , but it is a matter to be determined this Fall ... If JAMES G. BLAINE is elected the party will never nominate an honest man again . " To insist upon honesty and a clean record as qualifications of the candidate would obviously be idle after such an exhibition of the indifference of the American.people to those matters as the election of Mr. BLAINE would furnish . Very likely Mr. BLAINE himself would be a candidate for renomination , and if . he aspired to that honor it is pretty safe to say that he would get it . The iofficial channels in which he could . be useful to himself . in providing the right kind of delegates for the National Convention would be innumerable , and they would all be made to serve his purpose . But if not Mr-BLAINE , then some other man of the Blaine kind would be named . The jobbers and plunderers and thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Each one of them has a hundred times the personal interest in politics that , the honest citizen has . They live upon . the Government , and it is vitally : important that ; no ; holierthanAhou sentiment in Government circles should chill their patriotic ardor and turn them from their country 's service into the less agreeable and less profitable vocations of shoplifting , sneakthieving , and bunko . To these or other similar fields of private endeavor they would at once be relegated by the election of a President with old-fashioned notions about public honesty , and with such views of the dignity of his office as would forbid him to prostitute it for his own gain or for the enrichment of his friends . There are a great many of these public parasites in this country , and the Republican Party , by reason of its long possession of executive control , has a disproportionate share of them in its ranks . They are all politicians , and they are influential  --  very influential . These men are hoping for Mr. BLAINE 'S election and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall and buried forever out of sight of the American people they will be working for his re-election four years hence ; or should he conclude to betake himself again to historical pursuits they will be found solidly arrayed in support of some other statesman equally favorable to their corrupt designs . The active , interested support of men of the Elkins stripe is of great value to a candidate who seeks an election on the plan laid down by Mr. BLAINE 'S managers . They have a natural aptitude for politics . They know where the rich stores of " soap " lie and how to tap them , and in the effective distribution of that potent campaign tonic they have no equals . Should the American people be so careless of their honor this year as to give Mr. BLAINE a majority of the Electoral votes , the tribe of public plunderers will be very much more audacious in : 1888. than they are now . If it should be the good fortune of Senators HAWLEY and HOAR , of ex-Gov . Lorici- and Mr. LODGE , of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to the Republican Convention they would have very little to say about the choice of candidates , and they might find the company a little too rank even for their very tolerant political tastes . The question for such Republicans as those-we have named to consider is how long it will be possible or wise to smother their consciences and throw away their convictions , as they are doing at present . Republicans who opposed BLAINE 'S nomination , but have given him a reluctant support , say it is the party , not the man , who commands their fealty . But they are helping to destroy the . Republican Party . not to save it . Four years of an Administration tainted and poisoned with such scandals and corruptions as always and everywhere have followed JAMES G. BLAINE would make an end of the party , body and soul . The only alternative is to make an end of BLAINE . The regeneration of the party would then be easy of accomplishment.                 @ @ @ @
