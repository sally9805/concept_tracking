M* DEAR MR . FIELD : WITH great pleasure I have read your second Letter , in which you seem to admit that men may differ even about religion without being responsible for that difference ; that every man has the right to read the bible for himself , state freely the conclusion at which he arrives , and that it is not only his privilege , but his duty to speak the truth ; that Christians can hardly be happy in heaven , while those they loved on earth are suffering with the lost ; that it is not a crime to investigate , to think , to reason , to observe , and to be governed by evidence ; that credulity is not 6 virtue , and that the open mouth of ignorant wonder is not the only entrance to Paradise ; that belief is not necessary to salvation , and that no man can justly be made to suffer eternal pain for having expressed an intellectual conviction . You seem to admit that no man can justly be held responsible for his thoughts ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe or disbelieve without an effort of the will . I congratulate you upon the advance that you have made . You not only admit that we have the right to think , but that we have the right to express our honest thoughts . You admit that the Christian world no longer believes in the faggot , the dungeon , and the thumb-screw . Has the Christian world outgrown its God ? Has man become more merciful than his maker ? If man will not torture his fellow-man on account of a difference of opinion , will a God of infinite love torture one of his children for what is called the sin of unbelief ? Has man outgrown the Inquisition , and will God forever be the warden of a penitentiary ? The walls of the old dungeons have fallen , and light now visits the cell where brave men perished in darkness . Is Jehovah to keep the cells of perdition in repair forever , and are his children to be the eternal prisoners ? It seems hard for you to appreciate the mental condition of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , who thinks of them all as myths and phantoms born of the imagination , characters in the religions fictions of the race . To you it probably seems strange that a man should think far more of Jupiter than of Jehovah . Regarding them both as creations of the mind , I choose between them , and I prefer the God of the Greeks , on the same principle that I prefer Portia to Jago ; and yet I regard them , one and all , as children of the imagination , as phantoms born of human fears and human hopes . Surely nothing was further from my mind than to hurt the feelings of any one by speaking of the Presbyterian God . I simply intended to speak of the God of the Presbyterians . Certainly the God of the Presbyterian is not the God of the Catholic , nor is he the God of the Mohammedan or llindoo . He is a special creation suited only te certain minds . These minds have naturally come together , and they form what we call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two churches can by any possibility have precisely the same God ; neither can any two human beings conceive of precisely the same Deity . In every man 's God there is , to say the least , a part of that man . The lower the man , the lower his conception of God . The higher the man , the grander his Deity must be . The savage who adorns his body with a belt from which hang the scalps of enemies slain in battle , has no conception of a loving , of a forgiving God ; his God , of necessity , must be as revengeful , as heartless , as infamous as the God of John Calvin . You do not exactly appreciate my feeling . I do not hate Presbyterians ; I hate Presbyterianism . I hate with all my heart the creed of that church , and I most-heartily despise the God described in the Confession of Faith . But some of the best friends I have in the world are afflicted with the mental malady known as Presbyterianism . They are the victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of their fellowmen are doomed to suffer eternal torment , to the end that their Creator may be eternally glorified . I have said many times , and I say again , that I do not despise a man because he has the rheumatism I despise the rheumatism because it has a man . But I do insist that the Presbyterians have assumed to appropriate to themselves their Supreme Being , and that they have claimed , and that they do claim , to be the " special objects of // his favor . " They do claim to be the very elect , and they do insist that God looks upon them as the objects of his special care . They do claim that the light of Nature , without the torch of the Presbyterian creed , is insufficient to guide any soul to the gate of heaven . They do insist that even those who never heard of Christ , or never heard of the God of the Presbyterians , will be eternally lost ; and they not only claim this , but that their fate will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only so , but they insist that the morality of an unbeliever is displeasing to God , and that the love of an unconverted mother for her helpless child is nothing less than sin . When I meet a man who really believes the Presbyterian creed , I think of the Laocoon . I feel as though looking upon a human being helpless in the coils of an immense and poisonous serpent . But I congratulate you with all my heart that you have repudiated this infamous , this savage creed ; that you now admit that reason was given us to be exercised ; that God will not torture any man for entertaining an honest doubt , and that in the world to come " every man will be judged according to the deeds done in the body . " Let me quote your exact language : " I believe that in the future world every man will be judged according to the deeds done in the body . " Do you not see that you have bidden farewell to the Presbyterian church ? In that sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficacy of the blood of Jesus Christ , and you have denied the necessity of belief . If we are to be judged by the deeds done in the body , that is the end of the Presbyterian scheme of salvation . I sincerely congratulate you for having repudiated the savagery of Calvinism . It also gave me great pleasure to find that you have thrown away , with a kind of glad shudder , that infamy of infamies , the dogma of eternal pain . I have denounced that inhuman belief ; I have denounced every creed that had coiled within it that viper ; I have denounced every man who preached it , the book that contains it , and with all my heart the God who threatens it ; and at last I have the happiness of seeing the editor of the New York Evangelist admit that devout Christians do not believe that lie , and quote with approbation the words of a minister of the Church of England to the effect that all men will be finally recovered and made happy . // Do you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this star , that sheds light on every grave , found in your bible ? Did Christ have in his mind the shining truth that all the children of men will at last be filled with joy , when he nttered these comforting words " Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels " ? Do you find in this flame the bud of hope , or the flower of promise ? You suggest that it is possible that " the incurably bad will be annihilated , " and you say that such a fate can have no terrors for me , as I look upon annihilation as the common lot of all . Let us examine this position . Why should a God of infinite wisdom create men and women whom he knew would be " incurably bad " ? What would you say of a mechanic who was forced to destroy his own productions on the ground that they were " incurably bad " ? Would you say that he was an infinitely wise mechanic ? Does infinite justice annihilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ignorant doctor , bury his mistakes ? Besides , what right have you to say that " I look upon annihilation as the common lot of all " ? Was there any such thought in my Reply ? Do you find it in any published words of mine ? Do you find anything in what I have written tending to show that I believe in annihilation ? Is it not true that I say now , and that I have always said , that I do not know ? Does a lack of knowledge as to the fate of the human soul imply a belief in annihilation ? Does it not equally imply a belief in immortality ? You have been-at least until recently  --  a believer in the in* spiration of the bible and in the truth of its every word . What do you say to the following : " For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see that the inspired writer is not satisfied with admitting that he does not know . " As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away ; so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more . " Was it not cruel for an inspired man to attack a sacred belief ? You seem surprised that I should speak of the doctrine of eternal pain as " the black thunder-cloud that darkens all the horizon , casting its mighty shadows over the life that now is and that which is to come . " If that doctrine be true , what else is there worthy of engaging the attention of the human mind ? It // is the blackness that extinguishes every star . It is the abyss in which every hope must perish . It leaves a universe without justice and without mercy  --  a future without one ray of light , and a present with nothing but fear . It makes heaven an impossibility , God an infinite monster , and man an eternal victim . Nothing can redeem a religion in which this dogma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Furies . But you have abandoned this infamy , and you have admitted that we are to be judged according to the deeds done in the body . Nothing can be nearer self-evident than the fact that a finite being can not commit an infinite sin ; neither can a finite being do an infinitely good deed . That is to say , no one can deserve for any act eternal pain , and no one for any deed can deserve eternal joy . If we are to be judged by the deeds done in the body , the old orthodox hell and heaven both become impossible . So too , you have recognized the great and splendid truth that sin can not be predicated of an intellectual conviction . This is the first great step toward the liberty of soul . You admit that there is no morality and no immorality in belief-that is to say , in the simple operation of the mind in weighing evidence , in observing facts , and in drawing conclusions . You admit that these things are without sin and without guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been religious persecution  --  the Inquisition could not have been built , and the idea of eternal pain never could have polluted the human heart . You have been driven to the passions for the purpose of finding what you are pleased to call " sin** and " responsibility " ; and you say , speaking of a human being , " but if he is warped by passion so that he can not see . things truly , then is he responsible . " One would suppose that the use of the word " cannot* ' is inconsistent with the idea of responsibility . What is passion ? There are certain desires , swift , thrilling , that quicken the action of the heart-desires that fill the brain with blood , with fire and flame-desires that bear the same relation to judgment that storms and waves bear to the compass on a ship . Is passion necessarily produced ? Is there an adequate cause for every effect ? Can you by any possibility think of an effect without a cause , and can you by any possibility think of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a cause that is not an effect ? Is not the history of real civilization the slow and gradual emancipation of the intellect , // of the judgment , from the mastery of passion ? Is not that man civilized whose reason sits the crowned monarch of his brain-whose passions are his servants ? Who knows the strength of the temptation to another ? Who knows how little has been resisted by those who stand , how much has been resisted by those who fall ? Who knows whether the victor or the victim made the bravest and the most gallant fight ? In judging of our fellow-men we must take into consideration the circumstances of ancestry , of race , of nationality , of employment , of opportunity , of education , and of the thousand influences that tend to mold or mar the character of man . Such a view is the mother of charity , and makes the God of the Presbyterians impossible . At last you have seen the impossibility of forgiveness . That ; is to say , you perceive that after forgiveness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still live . You recognize the lack of philosophy in that doctrine . You still believe in what you call " the forgiveness of sins , " but you admit that forgiveness can not reverse the course of nature , and can not prevent the operation of natural law . You also admit that if a man lives after death , he preserves his personal identity , his memory , and that the consequences of his actions will follow him through all the eternal years . You admit that consequences are immortal . After making this admission , of what use is the old idea of the forgiveness of sins ? How can the criminal be washed clean and pure in the blood of another ? In spite of this forgiveness , in spite of this blood , you have taken the ground that consequences , like the dogs of Act*eon , follow even a Presbyterian , even one of the elect , within the heavenly gates . If you wish to be logical , you must also admit that the consequences of good deeds , like winged angels , follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had the courage of your convictions , and you have said that we are to be judged according to the deeds done in the body . By that judgment I am willing to abide . But , whether willing or not , I must abide , because there is no power , no God that can step between me and the consequences of my acts . I wish no heaven that I have not earned , no happiness to which I am not entitled . I do not wish to become an immortal pauper ; neither am I willing to extend unworthy hands for alms . My dear Mr. Field , you have outgrown your creed-as every // Presbyterian must who grows at all . You are far better than the spirit of the Old Testament ; far better , in my judgment , even than the spirit of the New . The creed that you have left behind , that you have repudiated , teaches that a man may be guilty of every crime-that he may have driven his wife to insanity , that his example may have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that yet , at the eleventh hour , he may , by what is called " repentance , " be washed absolutely pure by the blood of another and receive and wear upon his brow the laurels of eternal peace . Not only so , but that creed has taught that this wretch in heaven could look back on the poor earth and see the wife , whom he swore to love and cherish , in the mad-house , surrounded by imaginary serpents , struggling in the darkness of night , made insane by his heartlessness-that creed has taught and teaches that he could look back and see his children in prison cells , or on the scaffold with the noose about their necks , and that these visions would not bring a shade of sadness to his redeemed and happy face . It is this doctrine , it is this dogma-so bestial , so savage as to beggar all the languages of men-that I have denounced . All the words of hatred , loathing , and contempt , found in all the dialects and tongues of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my loathing of this creed . You say that it is impossible for you not to believe in the existence of God . With this statement I find no fault . Your mind is so that a belief in the existence of a Supreme Being gives satisfaction and content . Of course , you are entitled to no credit for this belief , as you ought not to be rewarded for believing that which you can not help believing ; neither should I be punished for failing to believe that which I can not believe . You believe because you see in the world around you such an adaptation of means to ends that you are satisfied there is design . I admit that when Robinson Crusoe saw in the sand the print of a human foot , like and yet unlike his own , he was justified in drawing the conclusion that a human being had been there . The inference was drawn from his own experience , and was within the scope of his own mind . But I do not agree with you that he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only sufficient evidence upon which to found a belief . He did not know the footsteps of all animals ; he could not have known thal no animal except man could have made that footprint . In order to have // known that it was the foot of man , he must have known that no other animal was capable of making it , and he must have known that no other being had produced in the sand the likeness of this human foot . You see what you call evidences of intelligence in the universe , and you draw the conclusion that there must be an infinite intelligence . Your conclusion is far wider than your premise . Let us suppose , as Mr. Hume supposed , that there is a pair of scales , one end of which is in darkness , and you find that a pound weight , or a ten-pound weight , placed upon that end of the scale in the light is raised ; have you the right to say that theie is an infinite weight on the end in darkness , or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the end in darkness to raise the weight on the end in light ? It is illogical to say , because of the existence of this earth and of what you can see in and about it , that there must be an infinite intelligence . You do not know that even the creation of this world , and of all planets discovered , required an infinite power , or infinite wisdom . I admit that it is impossible for me to look at a watch and draw the inference that there was no design in its construction , or that it only happened . I could not regard it as a product of some freak of nature , neither could I imagine that its various parts were brought together and set in motion by chance . I am not a believer in chance . But there is a vast difference between what man has made and the materials of which he has constructed the things he has made . You find a watch , and you say that it exhibits , or shows design . You insist that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , that it is too wonderful not to have been constructed . You then find the watchmaker , and you say with regard to him that he too must have had a designer , for he is more wonderful than the watch . In imagination you go from the watchmaker to the being you call God , and you say he designed the watchmaker , but he himself was not designed because he is too wonderful to have been designed . And yet in the c*se of the watch and of the watchmaker , it was the wonder that suggested design , while in the case of the maker of the watchmaker the wonder denied a designer . IDo you not see that this argument devours itself ? If wonder suggests a designer , can it go on increasing until it denies that which it suggested ? // You must remember , too , that the argument of design is applicable to all . You are not at liberty to stop at sunrise and sunset and growing corn and all that adds to the happiness of man ; you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merciful God designed the fangs of serpents , the machinery by which the poison is distilled , the ducts by which it is carried to the fang , and that the same intelligence impressed this serpent with a desire to deposit this deadly virus in the flesh of man . You must believe that an infinitely wise God so constructed this world , that iii the process of cooling , earthquakes would be caused-earthquakes that devour and overwhelm cities and states . Do you see any design in the volcano that sends its rivers of lava over the fields and the homes of men ? Do you really think that a perfectly good being designed the invisible parasites that infest the air , that inhabit the water , and that finally attack and destroy the health and life of man ? Do you see the same design in cancers that you do in wheat and corn ? Did God invent tumors for the brain ? Was it his ingenuity that so designed the human race that millions of people should be born deaf and dumb , that millions should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain the seeds of insanity ? Did he cultivate those seeds ? Do you see any design in this ? Man calls that good which increases his happiness , and that evil which gives him pain . In the olden time , back of the good he placed a God ; back of the evil a devil ; but now the orthodox world is driven to admit that the God is the author of all . For my part , I see no goodness in the pestilence-no mercy in the bolt that leaps from the cloud and leaves the mark of death on the breast of a loving mother . I see no generosity in famine , no goodness in disease , no mercy in want and agony . And yet you say that the being who created parasites that live only by inflicting pain  --  the being responsible for all the sufferings of mankind-you say that he has " a tenderness compared to which all human love is faint and cold . " Yet according to the doctrine of the orthodox world , this being of infinite love and tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast majority of the human race to blindly grope their way to endless pain . You insist that a knowledge of God  --  a belief in God-is the foundation of social order ; and yet this God of infinite tenderness has left for thousands and thousands of years nearly all of // his children without a revelation . Why should infinite goodness leave the existence of God in doubt ? Why should he see millions in savagery destroying the lives of each other , eating the flesh of each other , and keep his existence a secret from man ? Why did he allow the savages to depend on sunrise and sunset and clouds ? Why did he leave this great truth to a few half-crazed prophets , or to a cruel , heartless , and ignorant church ? The sentence " There is a God " could have been imprinted on every blade of grass , on every leaf , on every star . An infinite God has no excuse for leaving his children in doubt and darkness . There is still another point . You know that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that for countless generations they knelt by coiled serpents , believing those serpents to be Gods . Why did the real God secrete himself and allow his poor , ignoraut , savage children to imagine that he was a beast , a serpent ? Why did this God allow mothers to sacrifice their babes ? Why did he not emerge from the darkness ? Why did he not say to the poor mother , " Do not sacrifice your babe ; keep it in your arms ; press it to your bosom ; let it be the solace of your declining years . I take no delight in the death of children ; I am not what you suppose me to be ; I am not a beast ; I am not a serpent ; I am full of love and kindness and mercy , and I want my children to be happy in this world " ? Did the God who allowed a mother to sacrifice her babe through the mistaken idea that he , the God , demanded the sacrifice , feel a tenderness toward that mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold " ? Would a good father allow some of his children to kill others of his children to please him ? There is still another question . Why should God , a being of infinite tenderness , leave the question of immortality in doubt ? How is it that there is nothing in the Old Testament on this subject ? Why is it that he who made all the constellations did not put in his heaven the star of hope ? How do you account for the fact that you do not find in the Old Testament , from the first mistake in Genesis to the last curse in Malachi , a funeral service ? Is it not strange that some one in the Old Testament did not stand by an open grave of father or mother and say : " We shall meet again ? " Was it because the divinely inspired men did not know ? You taunt me by saying that I know no more of the immortality of the soul than Cicero knew . I admit it . I know no more // than the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , nothing . Is it not , however , a curious fact that there is less belief in the immortality of the soul in Christian countries than in heathen lands-4hat the belief in immortality in an orthodox church is faint , and cold , and speculative , compared with that belief in India , in China , or in the Pacific Isles ? Compare the belief in immortality in America , of Christians , with that of the followers of Mohammed . Do not Christians weep above their dead ? Does a belief in immortality keep back their tears ? After all , the promises are so far away , and the dead are so near  --  the echoes of words said to have been spoken more than eighteen centuries ago are lost in the sounds of the clods that fall on the coffin . And yet , compared with the orthodox hell , compared with the prisonhouse of God , how ecstatic is the grave  --  the grave without a sigh , without a tear , without a dream , without a fear . Compared with the immortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be nothing-how much better than to be a convict forever . To be unconscious dust-how much better than to be a heartless angel . There is not , there never has been , there never will be , any consolation in orthodox Christianity . It offers no consolation to any good and loving man . I prefer the consolation of Nature , the consolation of hope , the consolation springing from human affection . I prefer the simple desire to live and love forever . Of course , it would be a consolation to know that we have an " Almighty Friend " in heaven ; but an Almighty Friend who cares nothing for us , who allows us to be stricken by his lightning , frozen by his winter , starved by his famine , and at last imprisoned in his hell , is a friend I do not care to have . I remember " the poor slave mother who sat alone in her cabin , having been robbed of her children ; " and , my dear Mr. Field , I also remember that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred scriptures . I remember that while the mother wept , the robbers , some of whom were Christians , read this : " Buy of the heathen round about , and they shall be your bondmen and bondwomeu forever . " I remember , too , that the robbers read : " Servanls be obedient unto your masters " ; and they said this passage is the only message from the heart of God to the scarred back of the slave . I re // member this , and I remember , also , that the poor slave mother upon her knees in wild and wailing accents called on the " Almighty Friend , " and I remember that her prayer was never heard , and that her sobs died in the negligent air . You a*k me whether I would " rob this poor woman of such a friend ? " My answer is this : I would give her liberty ; I would break her chains . But let me ask you , did an " Almighty Friend " see the woman he loved " with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , " and the woman who loved him , robbed of her children ? What was the " Almighty Friend " worth to her ? She preferred her babe . How could the " Almighty Friend " see his poor children pursued by hounds-his children whose only crime was the love of liberty-how could he see that , and take sides with the hounds ? Do you believe that the " Almighty Friend " then governed the world ? Do you really think that he " Bade the slave-ship speed from coast to coast , Fanned by the wings of the Holy Ghost I " Do you believe that the " Almighty Friend " saw all of the tragedies that were enacted in the jungles of Africa-that he watched the wretched slave-ships , saw the miseries of the middle passage , heard the blows of all the whips , saw all the streams of blood , all the agonized facbs of women , all the tears that were shed ? Do you believe that he saw and knew all these things , and that he , the " Almighty Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save ? You persist , however , in endeavoring to account for the miseries of the world by taking the ground that happiness is not the end of life . You say that " the real end of life is character , and that no discipline can be too severe which leads us to suffer and be strong . " Upon this subject you use the following language " If you could have your way you would make everybody happy ; there would be no more poverty , and no more sickness or pain . " And this , you say , is " a child 's picture , hardly worthy of a stalwart man . " Let me read you another " child 's picture , " which you will find in the twenty-first chapter of Revelation , supposed to have been written by St. John , the Divine : " And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , behold the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his // people , and God himself shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes , and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain . " If you visited some woman living in a tenement , supporting by her poor labor a little family  --  a poor woman on the edge of famine , sewing , it may be , her eyes blinded by tears-would you tell her that " the world is not a play-ground in which men are to be petted and indulged like children ? " Would you tell her that to think of a world without poverty , without tears , without pain , is a " child 's picture ? " If she asked you for a little assistance , would you refuse it on the ground that by being helped she might lose character ? Would you tell her " God does not wish to have you happy ; happiness is a very foolish end ; character is what you want , and God has put you here with these helpless , starving babes , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may suffer and be strong . I would help you gladly , but I do not wish to defeat the plans of your Almighty Friend ? " You can reason one way , but you would act the other . I agree with you that work is good , that struggle is essential ; that men are made manly by contending with each other and with the forces of nature ; but there is a point beyond which struggle does not make character ; there is a point at which struggle becomes failure . Can you conceive of an " Almighty Friend " deforming his children because he loves them ? Did he allow the innocent to languish in dungeons because he was their friend ? Did he allow the noble to perish upon the scaffold , the great and the self-denying to be burned at the stake , because he had the power to save ? Was he restrained by love ? Did this " Almighty Friend** allow millions of his children to be enslaved to the end that " the splendor of virtue might have a dark background " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of the greatest elevation of character and in the end of the highest enjoyment . " Do you not then see that your " Almighty Friend " has been unjust to the happy-that he is cruel to those whom we call the fortunatethat he is indifferent to the men who do not suffer-that he leaves all the happy and prosperous and joyous without character , and that in the end , according to your doctrine , they are the losers ? But , after all , there is no need of arguing this questioii // further . There is one fact that destroys forever your theoryand that is the fact that millions upon millions die in infancy . Where do they get " elevation of character ? " What opportunity is given to them to " suffer and be strong ? " Let us admit that we do not know . Let us say that the mysteries of life , of good and evil , of joy and pain , have.never been explained . Is character of no importance in heaven ? How is it possible for angels , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer and be strong ? " Do you not see that , according to your philosophy , only the damned can grow great-only the lost can become sublime ? You do not seem to understand what I say with regard to what I call the higher philosophy . When that philosophy is accepted , of course there will be good in the world , there will be evil , there will still be right and wrong . What is good ? That which tends to the happiness of sentient beings . What is evil ? That which tends to the misery , or tends to lessen the happiness of sentient beings . What is right ? The best thing to be done under the circumstances-that is to say , the thing that will increase or preserve the happiness of man . What is wrong ? That which tends to the misery of man . What you call liberty , choice , morality , responsibility , have nothing whatever to do with this . There is no difference between necessity and liberty . He who is free , acts from choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean by liberty is freedom from personal dictation-we do not wish to be controlled by the will of others .

It may have the right to destroy the life of one dangerous to the community ; but what has freedom to do with this ? Do you kill the poisonous serpent because he knew better than to bite ? Do you chain a wild beast because he is morally responsible ? Do you not think that the criminal deserves the pity of the virtuous ? I was looking forward to the time when the individual might feel justified-when the convict who had worn the garment of disgrace might know and feel that he had acted as he must . There is an old Hindoo prayer to which I call your attention : " Have mercy , God , upon the vicious ; Thou hast already had mercy upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible that we may find that everything has been necessarily prodnced ? This , of course , would end in the justification of men . Is not that a desirable thing ? Is it not possible that intelligence may at last raise the human race to that sublime and philosophic height ? You insist , however , that this is Calvinism . I take it for granted that you understand Calvinism  --  but let me tell you what it is . Calvinism asserts that man does as he must , and that , notwithstanding this fact , he is responsible for what he does-that is to say , for what he is compelled to do-that is to say , for what God does with him ; and that , for doing that which he must , an infinite God , who compelled him to do it , is justified in punishing the man in eternal fire ; this , not because the man ought to be damned , but simply for the glory of God . Starting from the same declaration , that man does as he must , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact justification for every individual . And yet you see no difference between my doctrine and Calvinism . You insist that damnation and justification are substantially the same ; and yet the difference is as great as human language can express . You call the justification of all the world " the Gospel of Despair , " and the damnation of nearly all the human race the " Consolation of Religion . " After all , my dear friend , do you not see that when you come to speak of that which is really good , you are compelled to describe your ideal human being ? It is the human in Christ , and only the human , that you by any possibility can understand . You speak of one who was born among the poor , who went about doing good , who sympathized with those who suffered . You have described , not only one , but many millions of the human race .

You have clad one being in all the virtues of the race , in all the attributes of gentleness , patience , goodness , and love , and yet that being , according to the New Testament , had to his character another side . True , he said , " Come unto me and I will give you rest ; " but what did he say to those who failed to come ? You pour out // your whole heart in thankfulness to this one man who suffered for the right , while I thank not only this one , but all the rest . My heart goes out to all the great , the self-denying and the good ,  --  to the founders of nations , singers of songs , builders of homes ; to the inventors , to the artists who have filled the world with beauty , to the composers of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers of mirth , to honest men , and to all the loving mothers of the race . Compare , for one moment , all that the Saviour did , all the pain and suffering that he relieved ,  --  compare all this with the discovery of ana*sthetics . Compare your prophets with the inventors , your Apostles with the Keplers , the llumboldts and the Darwins . I belong to the great church that holds the world within its starlit aisles ; that claims the great and good of every race and clime ; that finds with joy the grain of gold in every creed , and floods with light and love the germs of good in every soul . Most men are provincial , narrow , one sided , only partially developed . In a new country we often see a little patch of land , a clearing in which the pioneer has built his cabin . This little clearing is just large enough to support a family , and the remainder of the farm is still forest , in which snakes crawl and wild beasts occasionally crouch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a little clearing , a little patch , just large enough to practice medicine with , or sell goods , or practice law , or preach with , or to do some kind of business , sufficient to obtain bread and food and shelter for a family , while all the rest of the brain is covered with primeval forest , in which lie coiled the serpents of superstition and from which spring the wild beasts of orthodox religion . Neither in the interest of truth , nor for the benefit of man , is it necessary to assert what we do not know . No cause is great enough to demand a sacrifice of candor . The mysteries of life and death , of good and evil , have never yet been solved . I combat those only who , knowing nothing of the future , prophesy an eternity of pain-those only who sow the seeds of fear in the hearts of men-those only who poison all the springs of life , and seat a skeleton at every feast . Let us banish the shriveled bags of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joy . ROBERT G. hTGERSOLL.
