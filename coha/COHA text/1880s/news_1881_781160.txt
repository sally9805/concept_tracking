txt The Daily Village Record to-day publishes a long and carefully written communication , which is known to have been prepared by a gentleman intimately related to the Hon. Wayne MacVeagh , and which defends the course of the latter in resigning the Attorney-Generalship . The Record says that while it has no information that the letter has been prepared with Mr. MacVeagh 's knowledge or at his request , it can say that it comes from one closely connected with him , and that it may be presumed to reflect his views . The letter , alluding to the request of President Arthur that ho should continue in the Attorney-Generalship , says : " Mr. MacVeagh declined to comply with the request . He had the intelligence to perceive that his retention of office merely to attend to the prosecution of the star route cases would place him in ' an anomalous position both as to the Government and to the country . He would have been a component part of an Administration with which he was not in accord on an important point of public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . Ho would , besides , be furnished with subordinates not of his own choice , who , knowing his relations with the President , would entertain but little respect for his authority . In conducting the prosecutions he would be regarded as acting as the representative of the Garfield Administraticn , allowed by the courtesy of the existing Government to carry out a measure which it had not originated , and for which it desired to avoid all responsibility . In such case the influence of the Administration would not favor the nrosecution . This consideration was highly important , and especially as the trials were to be had in Washington , where the Government for the time being has much to do with the formation of public opinion . * * * If Proficient Arthur had been disposed to adopt the prosecutions , there was no reason why they should not have been conducted by a proper representative of his own Administration . Mr. MacVeagh had no special fitness for such work , and all the information he possessed relative to the robberies might have been communicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say that the course taken by the President was taken for the purpose of favoring the star route thieves . What he wished , no doubt , was to escape a disagreeable duty and to avoid all responsibility on the subject , without considering how the public interest would be affected . The benefit which would accrue to the star route thieves was probably an incident which he did not contemplate , But they contemplated it if lie did not . " By resigning and quitting the office Mr. MacVeagh has compelled the appointment of a new Attorney-General , on whom will devolve the duty of deciding what is to be done in the star route cases . The responsibility will thus be put on the shoulders of the proper officers . The Administration must then show its hand , and the country will see what it is . The prosecution of the thieves will not be einbarrassecl by other difficulties than those which properly belong to the subject , and the Government will stand face to face with the culprits in their proper relations . * * * Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it  --  was to resign , and to compel the new Administration to appoint an AttorneyGeneral of its own selection , for whose official proceedings it would be responsible . The prosecution then , if proceeded with , becomes a measure of the present Government , and if not proceeded with the country will understand the reason . "
