ON AMERICAN COMMERCE OF AN ANGLOCONTINENTAL WAR . By J. Russell Soley . JHE next general European war , if it ever comes , will find the United States something more than an interested spectator . It is not , indeed , likely that this country will find it necessary , as it did during its first experience as a neutral , to fight both belligerents , in succession , in order to protect its rights ; nor will it suffer from such a varied and comprehensive catalogue of belligerent outrages as was visited upon it at that early period of its existence . But in its character of a commercial neutral , with an immense export trade , it is sure to find itself a mark for encroachments and aggressions . It can , therefore , do no harm to reflect a little on the conditions under which this old problem is to be revived , and the possible methods of its solution . The questions that will arise will present no peculiar difficulty unless Great Britain is at war . In a war between the continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they will be so localized as to cause little interruption of American trade . Maritime sources of supply and routes of transportation will be replaced by continental supplies and transportation . Questions and controversies will no doubt arise , but they are not likely to affect seriously the course of our commercial exchanges . Moreover , if Great Britain is neutral , she will cast a moral influence on the side of neutral immunities , and of that influence the United States will , to some extent , reap the benefits . With Great Britain in the war , however , the conditions under which neutrals will find themselves in relation to the contestants will be completely altered . Naval operations , so far from being subordinate , will leap at once into VOL . VI. - 57 the foremost place in the struggle . The sea is England 's true fighting elementher favorite field of operations for attack , her necessary field of operations for defence . Her strong point is in her fleet ; her vulnerable points are her coasts , her commerce , her colonies , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and routes of transportation can not be shifted from the sea to the land . Imports must come , and exports must go , as always , by water , for the ocean is here the only frontier . Instead of being a champion of neutral immunities against continental encroachments , she will become an encroacher ; and although , for reasons that we shall presently see , she will hardly resume her old platform of extreme belligerent rights , yet in the unwarrantable extension of restrictions on neutral commerce the foremost commercial power in the world will not be far behind her neighbors . The maintenance of commercial superiority , which has been one of the chief aims of England 's policy for centuries back , has never been lost sight of in Englai$ 's wars . Of course , in the struggle for mercantile ascendancy the belligerent 's preoccupation is the neutral 's opportunity . The laws of maritime capture , as formulated-it might be said , created-by Sir William Scott , in the English Admiralty Court , between 1798 and 1810 , and the executive Orders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were calculated to reduce to a minimum the advantages that neutrals might derive from this opportunity . Belligerent capture , as directed against neutrals , instead of being confined to its legitimate province of a means of preventing certain forms of assistance from reaching the enemy , became a legalized instrument for demolishing and driving out of the field the ordinary enterprise of commercial competitors . For a hundred years , from the // adoption of the Rule of 1756 to the Declaration of 1856 , Great Britain , in the matter of belligerent encroachment , was the worst offender . Other states followed her lead , but not to the same extent or from the same motives . At the end of this period came her first distinct movement in abandonment of her traditional policy , when she assented to the principle of " free ships , free goods "  --  a concession which is rarely mentioned by English publicists without regret , and which has not yet stood the test of a war , with England as one of the parties . Not only with respect to neutrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defender of maritime capture . Without her support the right to capture enemy 's private property at sea would long ago have been abolished . The tenacity with which she has clung to it , in opposition to the strongly marked tendencies of the United States and all the great continental powers , indicates that in her opinion her gains from it more than counterbalance her losses . Lu other words , England profits more from the destruction of her rival 's commerce than she suffers from his attacks upon her own . In the old days the balance in this profit-and-loss account was not struck by setting off merely the vessels and cargoes captured on one side or the other ; the comparative results reached far deeper than that . The value of actual captures on both sides might be precisely eq*mal , but a loss which , in the total of the British mercantile marine , would be hardly sensible , meant annihilation to its weaker competitor . Such is undeniably the theory upon which British policy has been based . Whether it has taken sufficient account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much more favorable to the destruction of commerce than formerly . The Alabama showed how easy it is to attack commerce , how difficult to defend it . There was apparently no limit to the devastation she could accomplish , except the number of enemy 's sail to be found in her cruising grounds . With a dozen Alabamas turned loose on both sides in a maritime war to-day , it would seem that the heaviest loser would be not the state that furnished the smaller armed fleet , but the state that had the larger unarmed fleet-in short , that which supplied the greater number of victims . Doubtless the element of protective strength would count for something , but it is not the only element . In the material struggle between the offensive and the defensive , between guns and armored vessels , calculations of vulnerability are based not only on the strength of the target but on the extent of exposed surface . In a warfare of commerce-destroyers , the larger exposed surface would be on the side of the larger mercantile marine . The historical attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that she has made of war as a check upon competition , are keenly appreciated by the trading communities of the Continent and by the governments which they enrich and influence . However necessary England 's naval strength may be to the balance of power , and whatever combinations or alliances the intricacies of European politics may lead continental governments to make , there are few of them that would contemplate otherwise than with lively satisfaction the reduced proportions of this colossus of maritime traffic . In her next war , those whom fate throws against her will deal the heaviest blows they can at this overgrown monster , and will use every advantage that law or precedent can suggest to strike its vulnerable points . Unfortunately for neutrals , the arena where this contest takes place is their own natural and immemorial highway , and in the interchange of blows they will run serious and frequent risk of damage . There will be plenty of lively sparring , and they must either keep out of the way or be prepared now and then to take up the cudgels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy is not to be expected ; on the contrary , they may reasonably do all in their power to extend their enterprise in all directions which are closed to the combatants . They have not brought on the war ; it is not their quarrel ; and their sphere of commercial action must be absolutely unrestricted except by the recognized prohibitions and penalties on breach of blockade , // carrying contraband , and engaging in the service of a belligerent . The socalled rule of 1756 , designed avowedly not to injure an enemy , but to prevent a neutral from engaging in fields of enterprise opened by the war , and other analogous doctrines , born of the spirit of maritime monopoly , can no longer be tolerated by any self-respecting neutral who is strong enough to resist . Xt is therefore well for neutrals to consider beforehand what form belligerent encroachment is likely to take , and what means must be provided to resist it . The weakness of England 's position lies not only in the size of her exposed merchant fleet but in the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially for supplies of provisions . Only one-third of her wheat-supply is grown at home . As with wheat so with all other articles of food consumption . During the year 1887 the United Kingdom imported staple articles of food to the value of ? 118,000,000 , including live animals and meat , butter , cheese , and eggs , wheat and flour , grain , hops , and sugar , and fruits and vegetables . Of these the perishable articles amounted to over ? 44,000,000 , considerably more than one-third . Of food articles not included in this statement , there were imported also 180,000,000 pounds of tea , 30 ,  - -  000,000 pounds of coffee , 15,000,000 pounds of cocoa , 13,000,000 gallons of wine , and 34,000,000 gallons of spirits . It will be noticed that , excluding these last articles imported-some of them very essential articles  --  the average importation of food into the United Kingdom goes on at the rate of about $50,000,000 monthly , or $12,000,000 per week . All this enormous supply of food is waterborne . Consider for a moment what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . We will endeavor to avoid all speculative and sensational elenients and look at the essential and inevitable features of the situation . The practice was adopted in the Crimean War , and has been more or less followed since , of allowing enemy 's vessels at sea or in foreign ports , on the outbreak of war , a reasonable time-six weeks or thereabout  --  to return home . Whether this amiable suspension of belligerent rights during the period when they are most capable of effective employment will continue when English commerce is the prize in view , is a question . The elements of warlike attack and defence are now calculated with such businesslike precision , the actual struggle is so short and sharp , and the importance of an early initiative is so generally recognized that the concession is not likely to be made in a war where commercedestroying takes any prominent place . The war might be over before a commerce-destroying blow could be struck . The maritime war having fairly begun , either with or without a temporary truce for the benefit of vessels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sixty per cent . of the commerce of the world , will look to the Navy for protection . The coasting trade may be thrown out of consideration . It is not indispensable to the well-being of the community , and it will be prosecuted under such risks as the enemy 's fleets may be able to subject it to . The really important trade is that between ports in the United Kingdom and foreign or colonial ports , directed from or to a small centre , and extending all over the world . Finally , there is an immense trade of the colonies themselves , and a considerable quantity of shipping engaged for the most part in trade between foreign ports . No navy existing or conceivable could protect such a merchant marine as this . Nevertheless , some attempt will be made to afford protection . The merchant fleet consists of three classes , the fast steamers , the slow steamers , and the sailing vessels . The first are employed in the trade where , either from the perishable nature of the cargoes or the activity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third , where the goods are destined for a waiting market , in which time counts for little . Of these three classes , the sailing vessels will disappear at once . Nothing can be done for them , and they can do nothing for themselves . They must either be sold or laid up until the war is over . The slow steamers may perhaps be partly protected by the old-fashioned method of convoy ; but the disadvantages which // this clumsy process entails , in delays , in circumscribed routes , and inflexible times of sailing , in the bunching of victims , and in other ways , are so great that the remedy will be nearly as bad as the evil it seeks to cure . Anyone who believes that a belligerent 's commerce can be protected in that fashion has only to read the conclusions of Captain Philip Colomb , in his recent paper on this subject in the Journal of the Royal United Service Institution  --  a paper full of valuable ideas and suggestions . Finally , for the fast steamers , convoy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend entirely on their speed , supplemented , perhaps , by a few rapid-firing guns . Something may be done , of course , by guarding permanently the voies maritimes , as the French call them ; but it requires a large navy to patrol the earth , even on its maritime highways , and nothing less will meet the demands of British commerce . The possibilities of naval protection being at the best somewhat meagre , how is the war to affect the most important part of this trade , namely , the foreign trade of the British Islands ? Unlike the foreign trade to United States ports , the largest portion of it-seventy-two per cent. - is carried on in native vessels . In 1885 the daily average of clearances of British ships from the home ports for foreign trade was 48 steamers , averaging over 1,100 tons each , and 11 sailing vessels , averaging over 800 tons each , or 59 in alL Doubling this number , to include arrivals , we find that over 800 vessels a week are arriving and departing at the insular ports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of war make all these 800 vessels liable to capture or destruction , with their British cargoes . All of them must be insured . It is easy to conceive what an immediate advance would take place in the rates for war risks , an advance that would certainly not be diminished by the report at the Exchange of a dozen or so of captures during the first week of the war . A dozen captures would be a very small proportion out of 800 vessels , much smaller , indeed , than would be likely to fall to a fairly active enemy , with such a rich booty within his reach . But a dozen would be enough . Coinmerce is timidly sensitive . On the average mind the effect of apprehension is usually greater than that of realization ; on the commercial mind it is always so . Freights would advance with insurance , and prices would follow closely on freights . The process would not need to go very far before it would stop importation in English bottoms . It is an inexorable law that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular class , or a particular nationality , rise beyond a certain figure , those vessels are driven out of the trade . They can not be run at a loss , and must inevitably be sold out to whoever can make them profitable . The effect of the captures made by the Confederate cruisers is a familiar illustration of the working of this law . These cruisers destroyed altogether about 175 vessels , almost all of them sailing vessels , and many of them of no great value . The result was the transfer of over 700 American vessels to the British flag , and the loss of a carrying trade which has never been recovered . In the case of Great Britain the transfer would be hastened by one circumstance which was absent in that of the United States . With the latter it was purely a mercantile question ; the ships were sold because it did not pay to keep them . There was no question of obtaining foreign supplies , because the United States were to all intents self-sustaining . In the case of England it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of securing the necessaries of life for the population . The deprivation of the food-supply for a month , or even for a fortnight , when food is arriving at the rate of $12,000,000 worth a week to meet their absolute necessities , would produce a famine immediately . Modern wars are sudden , and in such a matter as the provision of a permanent food-supply for a population of 40,000 ,  - -  000 , no government , however well prepared for war , can make a satisfactory arrangement . It may maintain a certain reserve of the least perishable materials , providing for their gradual consumption and renewal ; but the difficulties in the way of carrying out such a plan on any extensive scale would be insuperable . At the outbreak of hostilities , the princi // pal part of the food-supply-all , that is , that was included in British cargoes on board of British ships-would be subject to seizure . Under the rule of the Declaration of Paris , that free ships make free goods , the same cargoes in neutral vessels would be free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral owners . It becomes an interesting question to what neutrals this trade would go ; in other words , who would buy the British vessels . This is easily answered . It would go to those states that have capital to invest , and whose laws admit foreignbuilt vessels totheirregistry . The United States would , of course , be excluded on the latter ground . No American citizen can obtain an American register for a vessel built abroad ; and though he can acquire such a vessel , and carry the American flag thereon , he can not bring her to a home port with a cargo . Even if he chose to buy a vessel under these conditions , and employ her in trade between foreign ports , her status in time of war , without a register , with no paper , indeed , but an authenticated bill of sale , would be so unsatisfactory that few Americans would be willing to invest money on these conditions . The carrying trade of England would , therefore , go to Belgium , to Holland , to Denmark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be neutral , and none of which prescribe any conditions for vessels of foreign construction , except , as in Holland , a small tax upon nationalization . Whatever may be the merits of our navigation laws under ordinary circumstances , and however necessary they may be to protect the ship-builders and the iron and steel interests in this country from foreign competitioft , it must be confessed that , in such a contingency as we are now supposing , they would be a perfectly unjustifiable barrier to American enterprise . It is said that in such a state of things they would be suspended . Very likely : but when ? A matter of this kind is not a thing of weeks and months ; it is a thing of days and hours . Suppose that the favorable moment should arise when Congress was not in session . The opportunity would be gone long before Congress met ; by the time it had passed an enabling act the acquisition of this trade by the Swedes , the Dutch , the Belgians , and the Italians would be a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , an extremely shortsighted policy to leave such a restriction in the statutes without a provision for executive suspension upon such an opportunity as we are now considering . It would be well worth the expense and inconvenience of an extra session to pass such an act alone ; but the trouble is that before Congress was convened the occasion would have passed into the hands of those who were ready to avail themselves of it at the critical moment . As to the ship-builders and the iron and steel men , they would , if they were wise , be the first to call for it in such a contingency . The repairs of the new American merchant fleet would give them a better market and more occupation than the construction of all that the existing demand calls for ; while the gradual replacement of such a fleet , once in possession of the lines of traffic , would open out an unlimited expansion of these branches of American industry . Let it not be supposed that we are indulging in any speculative visions about the future of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its transfer to the western hemisphere . It is recognized that all these problems , when worked out in practice , are subject to contingent and hypothetical factors , the true value of which can not be ascertained by any theoretical formulas . Perhaps the rate of insurance will not go so high as to make British ship-owning an impossibility ; perhaps the government , as has been seriously proposed , may assume the war risk , not directly , but by paying a certain indemnity for vessels captured , in lieu of *furnishing protection ; perhaps it may even succeed in protecting efficiently with its fleet the 800 vessels that are arriving and departing each week at its ports . Perhaps , for that matter , Great Britain may never engage in another war . Still , it is not to be denied that the probabilities are the other way . Nor must it be imagined that we , as a nation , are looking eagerly for this opportunity of despoiling the ancestral shipyards . No right-minded American can view a serious calamity to England // otherwise than as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apart from sentiment , the ties of blood and language , and all such considerations , which are , perhaps , stronger now than ever , Americans can never lose sight of the fact that England stands to-day in European politics for the same idea of constitutional liberty that they themselves believe in-which , indeed , they inherited from her , and which is markedly different from that which prevails in France , and still more from that of Germany . Nevertheless , greatly as we should deplore such a misfortune to England as the loss of her fair share in the carrying trade , we can not forget that under the present distribution she has about sixty per cent . of the whole , while the United States has about six ; that of our own carrying trade , to and out of American ports , fourteen per cent . goes in American , and eighty-six per cent . in foreign ships ; and , finally , that of the 42,000 foreign vessels that enter or clear each year in the United States , and swallow up this eighty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain . And all this while vast amounts of American capital seeking profitable investment are cut out from the great returns of this form of business enterprise , for which the country is peculiarly fitted , both by its physical configuration and by the tastes and habits of its people . Finally , it is right and proper that we should remember , not vindictively or sentimentally , but as a community of business men , that the sudden falling off in the percentage of our foreign trade carried on by American vessels ( from sixty-six per cent . in 1860 to twenty-seven per cent . in 1865 ) , and the contemporaneous impulse to the dev*lopment of the carrying trade of Great Britain , were directly derived from the depredations on American commerce of four or five vessels built in British shipyards , cleared with British papers from British customhouses in the face of American protests , armed with British guns , manned in great part by British crews , and enabled to prosecute their voyages of devastation by the hospitalities which they received in British ports . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nen tral flags would be unnecessary , since the rule that neutral goods in an enemy 's ship are free from confiscation , which was confirmed by the Declaration of Paris , would insure the safety of cargoes provided they retained their neutral ownership while in transit . But apart from the question of proving the neutral ownership of goods that are in transit to an enemy consignee , which is often a difficult thing to do , it must be remembered that , though the neutral owner may get the value of his goods from the captoi* the loss of the supply to the enemy consumer , which , after all , is the main question for England , will not thereby be obviated . The captured vessel will be taken into the port of the captor and condemned ; her cargo will be sold and the proceeds paid over to its neutral owner . The main thing with Great Britain , however , is not to secure the owner of the cargo against loss , but to get the cargo into the country , and this she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove neutral ownership , as long as the vehicle that carries it is British . It is , therefore , safe to say that no cargoes , whether of provisions or anything else , to whomsoever belonging , laden in British vessels , can reach British territory if the enemy can capture the vessel . Even with the relief that would come in time by drawing on neutral ships for the carrying trade in provisions , there would be a period when scarcity would be seriously felt , when the prices of bread and flour and meat would go up to a point beyond the purchasing capacity of large masses of the population . The normal consumption of imported products goes on at the rate of $12,000-000 worth a week . Suppose that by interruptions or delays or captures , or all causes combined , one-fourth of this should fail in a given week , before any new arrangements could be perfected . The supply on hand is in process of distribution to the consumers , a large part of it being a very recent supply ; for , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the totaL Prices would rise , relief committees would be organized , the government 's exchequer and the purses of the wealthy would be drawn upon to supplement // the insufficient purchasing power of the masses . But how would it be in the next week , when one-fourth of the regular supply was actually stopped , when the distributors themselves did not have it ? Forty millions of hungry mouths , men , women , and children , the rich and poor , are alike waiting to be fed . The result might not be starvation , but it would be an apprehension of it that would go far toward producing a panic . At this stage the neutral carrier steps in with his blessed immunities , and relieves the pressure . The continental enemies of England , whoever they maybe , who have seen a fair prospect of touching her in her most sensitive point , her food-supply , find themselves balked in their purpose . So they set about some method of making the neutral trade liable to capture . There is one legitimate *way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained against an enemy 's port makes all trade with that port illegal , whatever its flag or nationality . But this is a contingency that may fairly be left out of the calculation . The light squadrons and swift cruisers of England 's enemies may hover about her ports , their heavy squadrons may even for a brief period blockade one or two of them ; but anything like a naval investment of the British Islands is an impossibility , imless on the extremely remote chance that the whole fleet of English battleships should undergo a second Trafalgar , with the position of the parties reversed . There remains only one method of affixing an illegal character to neutral trade in provisions with England , and that is by declaring them contraband of war . This is not an absolutely unheard-of thing . The general definition of contraband includes under that term articles of warlike use in transit to an enemy . Now there are few articles that are employed exclusively in war ; even rifles and gunpowder have their peaceful uses , although these uses are rather subordinate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed extensively and generally in the arts of peace find a more or less subsidiary employment in war . The term contraband is therefore applied in general to those articles whose usual , ordinary , and principal application is to warlike purposes ; namely , arms and munitions of war . These are known as absolute contraband , because they are always prohibited . A pretty general agreement has been reached to include also materials for ship-building in the manufactured state , and horses . Those articles which are of use both in peace and war are called conditional contraband , or contraband " according to circumstances . " With these the general rule is that they are liable to capture when the circumstances show a clear presumption that they wrn be put to warlike use ; and various tests have been applied to determine when this presumption is created . Thus , raw materials are regarded more leniently than manufactured articles ; destination for an ordinary commercial port than for a port of naval outfit , and so on . All the tests , however , look directly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no doubt that provisions may become contraband . They are unquestionably so when consigned directly to an enemy 's army or fleet for its consumption . They have also been so considered when consigned to a port of naval equipment . The English Admiralty Court has condemned in this way flour and ship 's biscuit , butter and cheese , salted fish , rice , wine , and other articles of food . In all these cases the presumption , more or less wellfounded , of direct employment in warlike operations was the express ground of condemnation . The capture of provisions thus limited is perhaps not open to serious objections , but it will not answer the purpose of belligerents in the case we are now dealing with . The capture of an occasional shipload of food bound for a dockyard port would never create a famine in England . Only by making all provisions contraband will it be possible so to break up neutral trade as to create a marked failure in the supply . Unfortunately there are some precedents for this , and , still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating and enforcing them . During the wars of the French Revolution and the First Empire many arbi // trary and illegal acts were done by both belligerents in reference to neutral trade , and none were more arbitrary and illegal than those relating to provisions . The way was led by France . In 1793 , soon after the outbreak of the war , the National Convention issued a decree declaring provisions on board neutral vessels bound for any enemy 's port subject to pre-emption . This action was expressly stated to be in consequence of certain illegal acts of British cruisers , the merits of which can not now be decided , but which were probably seized upon as a pretext . The decree was calculated to work as little hardship as possible to neutrals , as the owner of the confiscated provisions was to receive full payment at the price in the original port of destination , and the carrier was to receive not only freight but an indemnity for detention . The British Government immediately retaliated by issuing instructions to its cruisers of a similar tenor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it went much further than this . In a Declaratory Memorial sent about the same time to the court of Denmark , which was neutral , it explained its attitude in reference to provisions , especially as affecting Danish commerce therein , on the following extraordinary grounds : 1 . France , having no recognized government , can give none of the usual guarantees that the neutrality of Denmark is not misused to the prejudice of Great Britain . 2 . The corn - trade of France has passed into the hands of the Executive Council and of the different municipalities . It is therefore no longer a private trade in which the individuals of other nations partake. 3 . France having armed its whole laboring class , want of provisions will ensue , and hence the prevention of their importation will assist in bringing France to terms . It will be noticed that in this final reason the fundamental principle of the law of contraband , which is conditioned on warlike use , is thrown to the winds , and the broad ground is taken that where the capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ured . It is not the necessities of the army , but of the non-combatant population at which the memorial strikes . This point , as well as the others raised in the memorial , was answered by Count Bernstorff , the Danish Minister of State , in one of the soundest and most lucid state papers ever written , which strips every shred of justification from the pretensions advanced by the belligerents in respect to contraband provisions . The United States , as an interested neutral , also took strong ground against the doctrine . As soon as he received news of the instructions , Jefferson wrote a despatch to Pinckney , then Minister at London , in which , after declaring that the law of contraband referred to implements of war , he went on to say : " We see a practice begun to which no time , no circumstances prescribe any limits , and which strikes at the root of our agriculture , that branch of industry which gives food , clothing , and comfort to the great mass of the inhabitants of these States . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our produce , all the ports of the earth except her own and those of her friends , she may shut up these also , and so confine us within our own limits . No nation can subscribe to such pretensions ; no nation can agree , at the mere will or interest of another , to have its peaceable industry suspended , and its citizens reduced to idleness and want . The loss of our produce , if destined for foreign markets , or that loss which would result from an arbitrary restraint of our markets , is a tax too serious for us to acquiesce in . It is not enough for a nation to say : We and our friends will buy your produce . ' We have a right to answer that it suits us better to sell to their enemies as well as their friends . Our ships do not go to France to return empty . They go to exchange the surplus of one produce , which we can spare , for surpluses of other kinds which they can spare and we want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our *mind than Great Britain or her friends . We have a right to judge for ourselves what market best suits us , and they have none to forbid us the enjoyment of the necessaries and comforts which we may obtain from any other independent country . " // Notwithstanding the American protests , which Jefferson so clearly and forcibly expressed , when Jay came to negotiate his treaty , in 1794 , he found it impossible to secure from Great Britain a renunciation of the doctrine . The instructions were revoked , however , and the treaty declared that whenever any doubtful articles which had become contraband under the existing law of nations should for that reason be seized , the neutral owners and vessels concerned should receive full compensation . By this vague compromise neither state receded from its principle , and the main question remained exactly where it was before . No sooner was the treaty concluded than the government issued an Order in Council , substantially to the same effect as the previous instructions . Randolph and Pickering , the successors of Jefferson , reuewed their protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If , " Randolph asked , " by a circuit of construction , food can be universally ranked among military engines , what article , to which human comfort of any kind can be traced , may not be registered as contraband ? " But he asked in vain . The British doctrine , as it was now fairly considered , was put in successful practice . The only test known to the law was discarded , and the necessaries of life for the whole population were declared contraband and captured , confessedly for the sole reason that they were necessaries ; in other words , that there was a prospect of starving out the enemy . Neutral trade pursued only such paths as Great Britain chose to designate , and those who suffered from seizure were compelled to wait for satisfaction until it was finally awarded by the Mixed Commission of Claims . From all this it appears that , on the question of provisions , England has an exceedingly awkward record . Even as late as 1854 the Attorney-General , speaking for the government in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . France , on the other hand , since her first lapse  --  and it must be remembered that at this time nearly all rules of international law were disregarded by the Revolutionary Government-has been the foremost advocate of a restricted list of contraband . Curiously enough , the last few years have witnessed a complete reversal of the position of both the great powers on this question . France , the principal opponent of the extension of contraband , has become its advocate , while Great Britain has led all Europe in combating the French attitude . During the hostilities between France and China , in 1884-85 , the French Government , in a circular dated February 20 , 1885 , announced its intention of regarding rice conveyed by neutral vessels to Chinese ports as contraband of war . The order was subsequently limited to rice destined for ports north of Canton . The object of the declaration was really to prevent the transportation of rice from Southern China to the Northern provinces , there being no adequate inland means of transportation , and so cut off the food-supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rice was to be used for victualling a military or naval force ; and the French Government , in its second circular ( of February 21st ) , took the broad ground that , " by the side of those articles included from their very nature under contraband of war , such as arms and munitions , there are others the trade in which may be incidentally prohibited in time of war , by reason of their usefulness to the belligerents . " The governments of Austria-Hungary , Germany , the Netherjands , Portugal , and Spain either assented in terms or made no objection to the French announcement . The Italian Government reserved the question of principle . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sweden and*Norway called attention to the fact that the declarations of the governments in those countries had not included provisions under contraband of war . The Danish Government declared that it could not recognize any right in a belligerent to regard provisions as contraband , but as Danish commerce was very little affected by the decree the government would acquiesce in the measure as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole , little active opposition seems to have come from the continental states . The British Foreign Office , however , I // lost no time in taking issue with the French Government on the question of its dangerous doctrine . In reply to the circular Earl Granville declared that Her Majesty 's Government could not admit that provisions in general could be treated as contraband . Under particular . circumstances they might acquire such a character , as , for instance , if they should be consigned directly to the fleet of a belligerent , or to a port where such a fleet might be lying , or if facts existed raising the presumption that they were about to be employed in victualling the fleet of the enemy . In such a case they might be seized as contraband , on the ground that they would enable warlike operations to be carried on . A strong protest was therefore made against the French announcement , as it contained no such qualification in regard to the destination of the rice , but applied the contrabai*id character to all consignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion that followed the French made skilful use of English precedents , and the British did their best to reply . No conclusion was reached , nor , indeed , was any agreement attempted . The question was never tested in the French prize-courts , no captures having been made under the order . In fact , the whole proceeding bears somewhat the appearance of a theoretical proposition put forth by the French Government , not so much with reference to the struggle then in progress in China as to a much more serious struggle that might come later in Europe . As a " feeler 's of European public opinion it met with considerable success . The United States Government did not make any comment upon the declaration , although perhaps its interest in the matter was quite as vital as that of any of the European powers . Its importance was clearly pointed out in an admirable despatch written from Berlin , while the discussion was in progress , by our Minister , Mr. John A. Kasson . He says : " We are neutrals in European wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European war produces an increased demand for these supplies from neutral countries . The French doctrine declares them contraband , not only when destined directly for military consumption , but when going , in the ordinary course of trade , as food for the civil population of the belligerent government . If food can be thus excluded and captured , still more can clothing , the instruments of industry , and all less vital supplies be cut off on the ground that they tend to support the efforts of the belligerent nation . Indeed , the real principle involved goes to this extent , that everything the want of which will increase the distress of the civil population of the belligerent country may be declared contraband of war . The entire trade of neutrals with belligerents may thus be destroyed , irrespective of an effective blockade of ports . War itself would become more fatal to neutral states than to belligerent interests . " The rule of feudal times , the starvation of beleaguered and fortified towns , might be extended to an entire population of an open country . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might equally be claimed that all the peaceful men of arms-bearing age*ould be deported , because otherwise they might be added to the military forces of the country . " The United States and other countries have hitherto refused to recognize coed as contraband of war , indispensable as it is to the equipment of war steam cruisers , because its chief use is for peaceful objects . But this French doctrine goes far beyond that . " Althoughthe Franco-Chinese War is ended , there is always danger that this precedent will be again adopted in the heat of another war , unless resisted by energetic protests in the interest of neutral trade and of humanity itself . " There is no doubt , as Mr. Kasson well says , of the danger that the French circular will be drawn into a precedent , if , indeed , it was not put forth for that very purpose . Nor is there any doubt of its overwhelming importance to America . Take the wheat trade alone . The surplus product of wheat all over the world , that exported by surplus-producing countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is below the needs of consumption , is about two hundred and fifty million bushels . The surplus producers , or exporters , are the United States , Russia , India , Canada , Australia , Chili , the Argentine Republic , Turkey , the Danube States , Persia , and Egypt . The United States heads the list with a surplus of one hundred and four million bushels . The states where there is a deficiency in the product , and which consequently import wheat , are Great Britain , France , Belgium , Holland , Switzerland , Italy , Spain , Portugal , China , the West Indies , and some of the Central and South American states . Great Britain heads the list with an annual deficiency of one // hundred and thirty-six million bushels , and she is the only great power that can not get a supply overland . The states not mentioned may be assumed to supply their wants , and no more . It therefore appears that the United States is the largest producer and Great Britain the largest consumer of the two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is estimated that sixty per cent . of England 's want is supplied from the United States , and eighty per cent . of our surplus goes to supply it . The application of the doctrine of contraband to provisions bound for England , by an enemy strong enough to put his doctrines in practice-and there are several powers equal to that task-means the collapse of our foreign wheat market . What must the United States do to avert such a catastrophe ' ? The Government will of course protest , but not to much purpose . When belligerents are spurred on by the demands of a socalled " military necessity , " the clamor of neutrals falls upon deaf ears , unless the neutrals are powerful enough to compel attention . It is a common mistake with Americans to suppose that their country is one of these powerful states . As far as available instruments are concerned , we are absolutely helpless . To be of any effect in such a case , the force must be actual and visible , and ready for immediate use . The absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy has dwindled counts for nothing in the preservation and vindication of neutral rights while war is in progress . Politicians , business men , and voters may take that fact for what it is worth to them individually , but they can not deny that it is a fact . The great statesmen who directed our affairs at the close of the last century and the beginning of this , shaped the mould in which the law of neutrality was cast for all time , and the service they rendered by the force of their character , their fair-mindedness , and their intelligence , although representing a state in its infancy , is recognized by publicists the world over . Yet in respect to the controversies then at issue , to the rights of individual Americans which were set at naught by unscrupulous belligerents , they could accomplish little or nothing . Why ? Simpl*y because year after year they adhered to their policy of unarmed neutrality , as it may be called , until they were finally driven to fighting . With the United States to-day there need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of armed neutrality-if it brings its fleet up to the old normal standard of from eighty to one hundred vessels of war . But so long as its sea-coast cities and its immense maritime interests remain unprotected as at present , its population , its area , its credit , its wealth , and all other elements of potential strength , will serve but little purpose in securing a respectful hearing from belligerent aggressors . With a fleet of reasonable size , it may convoy its transatlantic trade , and thus protect it , not from legitimate search , but from an illegitimate extension of the rights of capture . It may also , if the worst comes to the worst , declare reprisals against an offending state  --  a perfectly proper form of coercion . But , so far from needing to exercise coercion , it would never reach even the point of threatening if it had an efficient fleet of one hundred vessels . In the absence of such a force , threats would be but empty bravado ; with the force in sight , they may remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , menace is the force itself . There is no need to point the moral of this discussion . He who runs may read . The Atlantic and Pacific seaboards , especially in recent years , have been moderately alive to our naval necessities ; but in the centre of the country , that which from the force of habit we call the West , there has always been noticeable a certain absence of enthusiasm in this direction . The old fable of the belly and the members is as applicable to modern states as it was to the early Roman commonwealth , but its lesson remains unheeded . That part of the organism is notoriously sensitive , but not , as a rule , to impressions that are localized in the extremities . The threatened collapse , however , of the foreign market for wheat and beef and pork would produce an internal disturbance that would require powerful remedies . Let those who are interested take warning in time .
