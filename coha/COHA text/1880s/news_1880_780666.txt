txt A question has been raised between the Treasury and the national banks as to the amount of United States interest-bearing bonds which the banks shall maintain on deposit with the Treasurer of the United States to secure the circulating notes of the banks . Section 16 of the act of 1864 , known as the National Bank act , provides that every banking association , preliminary to the beginning of banking business , shall transfer and deliver to the Treasurer of the United States , registered interest-bearing bonds of the United States to an amount not less than $30,000 , nor less than one-third of the capital stock paid in , which bonds shall be deposited with the Treasurer , and by him safely kept in his office until the same shall be otherwise dispOsed of in pursuance of the provisions of the National Bank act . No banking association can be formed with less than $50,000 capita , and under the sixteenth section of the National Bank act , associations organized with the minimum amount of capital have been required to maintain on deposit with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $30,000 . The act of June 20 , 1874 , which is amendatory of the National Bank act , contains a provision by which national banks may retire their circulating notes and withdraw their bonds . Section 4 of that act provides that any banking association desiring to withdraw its circulating notes , in whole of in part , may , upon the deposit of lawful money with the Treasurer of the United States , in sums not less than $9,000 , take up the bonds which such association has on deposit with the Treasurer as security for its circulating notes , which bonds shall be assigned to the bank , and the outstanding notes of such bank making such deposit of legal-tender notes to the amount of such notes thus deposited shall be redeemed at the Treasury and destroyed ; " provided that the amount of bonds on deposit for circulation shall not be reduced below $50,000 . " Recently , some banks , for the purpose doubtless of realizing the premium commanded by the bonds , have applied for the surrender of their 4 per cents in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeem a like amount of their own notes . An application of this kind was received last week from a NewYork City bank , whose capital is $450,000 . This bank tendered $400,000 in United States notes , and requested the surrender of that amount of bonds . The Treasurer holds that under section 16 of the National Bank act , all banking associations must maintain on deposit , to secure circulation , bonds amounting  --  to at least one-third of their capital stock , except in the ease of banks whose capital stock is less than $100,000 , when the amount on deposit must be at least $30,000 . He decided , therefore , that the bank in question could only be furnished with the bonds deposited in excess of $150,000 , unless it would permanently reduce its capital stock . The Controller of the Currency takes issue with the Treasurer , and holds that under the amendatory act of 1874 banks are entitled to the return of their bonds upon depositing the equivalent in United States notes for the redemption of their own circulating notes , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases his decision is to that extent modifiea by the amendatory act . The Treasurer , on the other hand , holds that the amendatory act contains no repealing clause , and that therefore the requirements of the National Bank act remain in lull force and effect . The question has been referred to the Attorney-6 eneral for decision .
