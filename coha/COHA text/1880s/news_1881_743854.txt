txt People who make their income from profits derived from contracts with the Government will learn with alarm that Postmaster-General JAMES is determined to conduct the affairs of his department on business principles . This is by no means a novel statement from the head of the postal service ; it has been made by other Postmasters-General . But up to the present time no administration of that branch of the public service has impressed anybody with the idea that there was much earnestness in the proclamation . Postmaster-General JAMES , however , not only proposes to conduct the affairs of the postal service on business principles , but he has begun to show how this is to be done . In the first place , he abolished the present system of carrying empty mail-bags for the benefit of contractors . By reductions in the cost of the carrying of the mails he has already effected a saving of $800,000 ; and he has not yet laid down his pruning-knife . When the savings by an honest and intelligent administration of affairs are all reckoned up , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States will very nearly pay for its own maintenance . The only branch of the public service which undertakes to perform for the individual citizen a certain work for which money is demanded by way of compensation , is the carrying of the mails . Other departments of the Government , as the lighthouse service , for example , perform a certain gratuitous service , or , as is the case with some branches of the Treasury , they exact a fee , in the nature of a direct tax , on the transactions of business men . The Post Office Department is the common carrier of the people . From carrying letters and newspapers , this service has gradually grown into something very much like a vast express company . Under the present postal regulations , articles of merchandise which formerly could only be sent by express , at a considerable cost and under great risks , are now quickly transported to the most remote points in the Republic safely and without loss . The money order system has largely taken the place of the old system of foreign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted . And to such an extent has the postal service become the ready servant of the people that there is an increasing demand that it shall include banks for savings and telegraphy in its functions . That an agency so fa ? - reaching in its scope , so thoroughly equipped , and so admirably suited to meet the wants of the whole people , should be self-sustaining seems reasonable on its face . But there are difficulties in the way of placing the postal service on a basis such as that on which a private corporation is conducted . An express company which , after many years of trial , should fail to pay expenses , would wind up its affairs and go out cf business . The United States Post Office Department not only continues to do business at a loss , but during some periods it has steadily increased its annual losses . It is not to be expected that , even under the best possible management , a Governmental institution which carries letters and packages , at uniform rates , into the moist sparsely settled , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , can be made to show profits like those of an express company . Possibly , it will be a long time before the profitable business of carrying the mails in the thickly settled States will be so increased that the surplus revenue will make up for the deficiencies caused by the costly maintenance of a mail service in parts of the country where settlements are few and far between . But that time will surely come , although it will never come until the Post Office Department is managed on business principles . The developments made in THE TIMES , from week to week , exhibit one of the causes of the failure of the Post Office Department to pay its own cost of maintenance . As we have already shown , the present Postmaster-General has cut off so many of the useless routes ( presumably dishonestly run ) that he has effected an annual saving of $800,000 . This handsome sum has heretofore been charged to the account of loss . It now goes over to the other side of the ledger . Other leaks will be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks will be made impossible . When all this is done , the postal service will be nearer than ever to paying its own expenses . The great majority of men who make contracts to furnish the Government with supplies , or with labor and service , seem to think that they are entitled to a far treater profit than they would expect from any contract with private corporations or individuals . To have a Government contract is , in the popular estimation , " a sure thing " for a handsome profit on the investment .. This idea , consideratly exaggerated , made the star route frauds possible and feasible . The business head of the Post Office Department has made a beginning in the right direction . He has broken up a dishonest system . Possibly , no such abuses exist in other departments of the Government . But the example of the PostmasterGeneral is worthy of imitation . It will be a sorry day for adventurers and speculators when all the departments of the Government are conducted on business principles .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
