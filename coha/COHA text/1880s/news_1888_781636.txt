txt The Republicans who think that they can make a winning fight this Fall on a platform of protection " imagine vain things , " as they will see if they will read carefully the speech delivered in the House by the Hon. KNIITE NELSON of Minnesota on the general question of the tariff . Mr. NELSON had introduced a bill for the reduction of the tariff , putting on the free list sugar , molasses , rice , salt , coal , wood and lumber , manila , jute , sisal grass , and twine . This is not a radical free-trade measure , but it is absolutely in conflict with the principle and theory of protection as these are usually held . The repeal of the taxes on salt , lumber , coal , and jute go to the very essence of tariff protection . If these may with safety or profit be abolished , there is no good reason for keeping the tax on wool or on anything placed on the free list bythe Ways and Means bill . But it is not simply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. NELSON believes the Northwest wants ; it is the sensible and straightforward arguments by which he sustains ; his proposition and assails the foundation on which rests the whole presen t tariff system . He holds that the surplus must be reduced by reducing taxation ; that the repeal of the tax on liquors is not worthy of consideration ; that the repeal of the tobacco tax can only be considered as a concession or compromise ; . that " this notion that tobacco is one of the necessaries of life " is " the offspring of a fertile brain under high political stress " ; ? that therefore the real field for reduction is in the tariff . He favors not a purely revenue tariff , but a n low tariff " that " will fairly cover the difference in the cost of production here and abroad , be it in labor , raw material , or interest on capital . " Anything beyond this " breeds monopolies and works injury both to the consumer and . the laboring man . " The test is , does the tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that a high tariff benefits the laborer . High wages in this country have been produced by the excess of demand for labor over the available supply . This has been caused mainly by the great area of cheap and fertile land open to settlement in this country . The tendency has been to secure wages for all equal to the amount to be gained from such land . The farfners themselves are not protected at all by the tariff , and the price of their products is fixed abroad . They are brought into competition with lower-priced labor than any manufacturer , yet they pay high wages , and in the main make money . That is proof in our own land that high wages do not depend on the tariff . If we look abroad we find that wages are much higher in free-trade England than under protection in Germany , Austria , France , and . Belgium . If there were no such country as the United States . says Mr. NELSON , " you would have the , strongest kind of argument in favor of free-trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of wages . " This really knocks the underpinning from beneath . ' the hole protective tariff as an economic system .. Mr. NELSON leaves as little for it to stand upon " from the point of view of politics .
