GOUVERNEUR MORRIS . GOUVERNEUR MORRIS is by no means so well known to the present generation as he ought to be . Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he has not been and is not justly appreciated . If , however , we turn to M. Tame 's great work on the French Revolution , we find that he relies on Morris as one of the best and most penetrating observers of that great struggle , and places him at the head of the small group of men like Arthur Young , Malouet , and Mallet du Pan , who alone were able to record clear and dispassionate judgments in that dizzy time , for the benefit of posterity . The comments of Mr. Morris , thus rescued from his biography and brought before a wide public by M. Tame , already have attracted attention elsewhere , and a recent article in Macmillan 's Magazine shows how striking his criticisms and narrative really are . Such a prophet should never be without honor in his own country , and now that he is winning admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refresh our own memories in regard to him . It is not to be wondered at that M. Tame and others find so much that is admirable in Gouverneur Morris , for in him many high qualities met in a rare combination . A man of the world and of society , a wit , philosopher , and fine gentleman , he was also a bold and ar dent patriot , an able and most practical statesman , a distinguished lawyer , and a successful manager of large business affairs . He played a conspicuous part among the many eminent men of his day , but in one respect he differs from them all . He had a sharp wit , a strong sense of humor , and a capacity for amusing satire which are to be seen in all his writings . If we except Franklin , who was of an earlier generation , Gouverneur Morris holds in this respect a lonely preiiminence among his friends and contemporaries . The great men of our revolutionary and constitutional period were , it must be confessed , judging from their letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a moment when we can laugh at them , but Morris is the only one of them all with whom we laugh or smile in sympathy . This is enough of itself to make us hold him in remembrance , but he was far more than merely an amusing companion or a writer of clever letters . He was born in 1752 , a cadet in a. family which had been distinguished for two or three generations in the colonies , not only for public service and high of .. fice , but for certain quaint eccentricities and for unusual acuteness in discussion and power in argument . A bright boy at college , fond of Shakespeare , and a. maker of rhymes and verses , he graduated with honor , and delivered a Coinmencement // oration on Wit and Beauty . A little later , on taking his degree of A. M. , he pronounced a discourse on Love , and both these boyish productions displayed , despite their florid style , a command of language and a vigorous imagination which were destined to stand their author in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , only some ? 2000 , and he had his way to make in the world ; but his was not a nature to be discouraged , and he faced the future cheerfully and boldly . He often said in after life that in his intercourse with other men he had never experienced the sensation of fear , inferiority , or awkwardness . Armed with this easy self-confidence , he applied himself fearlessly to the task of winning success . He studied law , wrote at the age of eighteen against the popular plan of issuing bills of credit ( an early evidence of his financial talents ) and in 1771 was duly admitted to the bar . He was soon in active practice , and as the times grew more stirring solemnly declared that he disliked politics . His natural humor made him laugh at both parties , and his Tory connections , soon to become a thorn in his side , led him to favor a union with England and the concession to Parliament of the right to regulate trade . But with all his sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow-men , Morris was no Gallio . The ministerial side was impossible to a young , generous , ardent spirit , and in 1775 he was a member of the Provincial Congress of New York , when he at once took a leading part in organizing resistance and preparing for war . He advocated a continental cuic rency , and his report on that subject was sent to Congress . He served on all the loading committees , and in 1776 made ii speech for independent government which was replete with sarcasm and full df ability . From a letter of that time we Learn how strongly he felt then , and how completely the early carelessness Gouverneur Morris . April , and merriment had vanished in the face of stern events . He writes to his mother : - " What may be the event of the present war it is not in man to determine . Great revolutions of empire are seldom achieved without much human calamity ; but the worst which can happen is to fall on the last bleak mountain of America , and he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , is happier than his conqueror , more beloved by mankind , more applauded by his own heart . " The spirit of the man was equal to his words . He took a leading part in framing the constitution of New York , and even then , in the din of war , strove to insert a clause abolishing slavery . He served on the Council of Safety , which held control until the new government was set in motion , and his energy , zeal , and organizing power were felt in all directions . No one was more active than he in sustaining the army and doing all in his power to assist our generals , especially Schuyler , who seemed to Morris , as to many others , both then and since , to be the victim of injustice . He strongly believed , in fact , that a campaign of obstruction was best for us , and he felt from the outset that in this way the English expedition from Canada could be most surely ruined . Even on so grave a subject , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly arguing as to the campaign against Burgoyne he writes : - " I am also told that the Indians are determined to take up the hatchet for us . If this be true , it would be infinitely better to wear away the enemy 's army by a scrupulous and polite attention , than to violate the rules of decorum and the laws of hospitality by making an attack upon strangers in our own country . " In 1778 he was promoted to a seat in the Continental Congress , and although only twenty-six years old he came forward then with the same ease as on the // smaller stage of New York . This was chiefly due , of course , to his ability , but also in part to his astonishing capacity for rapid and effective work . He was on the committee to visit Washington at Valley Forge ; he urged the plan of provision for the officers of the army ; he drew reports on the condition of the Union , on a plan for a treasury board and for a medical department . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formed a warm friendship with Washington which continued unabated through life . In the miserable cabals against the general , Morris made determined war upon the schemers , and his indignation breaks out sharply in a letter to Washington - " You have enemies . It is happy for you that you have . A man of sentiment has not so much honor , as the vulgar suppose , in resigning life and fortune for the service of his country . He does not value them as highly as the vulgar do . Would he give the highest evidence , let him sacrifice his feelings . In the history of last winter , posterity will do you justice . " Political and personal conflicts , however , did not turn him frotii his labors . From his busy pen came the report on Lord North 's conciliatory bills , an address on the treaties with France , a sketch of the negotiations with the commissioners , a draft of instructions for Franklin , a pamphlet on our finances to be presented to the French court , and finally , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These manifold and eminent services did not , apparently , satisfy his constituents . Unjust prejudices and suspicions on account of his Tory relatives , so strong that he did not dare even to visit his mother when critically ill , and charges that lie neglected the local interests of New York , especially in regard to Vermont , prevailed against him , and he was not r&amp;lected when his term expired . He thereupon moved to Philadel phia , to practice his profession , write upon finance , and attack the dangerous and futile legal-tender and maximum laws . Just after his retirement from Congress , and while thus engaged , he was thrown from his phaeton and severely injured . By the rash advice of his surgeon his leg was amputated , a severe trial to an active , energetic man ; but he bore his misfortune with the cheerful philosophy which was always his most marked characteristic , and jested about it even in the midst of his suffering . He was visited by one of those consoling friends of the kind familiar to every one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation , and the check which it would be to dangerous pleasures and dissipations . When he had concluded Mr. Morris said , " My good sir , you argue the matter so handsomely , and point out so clearly the advantages of being without legs , that I am almost tempted to . part with another . " To another sympathizer he said , " Oh , sir , the loss is much less than you imagine ; I shall doubtless be a steadier man with one leg than with two . " The plain wooden leg with which he supplied his grievous and painful loss was , if tradition may be believed , once used to good purpose by his ready wit . In the stormy time in Paris , when Terror ruled , and not even a foreign minister was safe , Morris 's chariot was one day stopped by an angry mob , and immediate violence was threatened . Morris thrust out his wooden leg , and cried , " I am an American ! See what I suffered in the war for liberty and independence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic suffering , and drew their victim home in triumph instead of hanging him to a lamp-post . Great as the misfortune was , however , it did not diminish Morris 's energy , or depress his spirits . When his friend Robert Morris was appointed to the charge of our disordered finances , he took the position of assistant secretary , 436 // and contributed largely to the work which did so much to save the American cause . He also , in addition to his heavy public duties , carried on a large law practice , both in the courts and before the legislature , where he made one of his most brilliant and in its day famous speeches , concluding with an apostrophe to William Penn , which moved his hearers to tears , - a feat that seems hardly compatible with the theme . During all this period , too , he wrote much for the press , and took an active part in politics . He drew a report on coinage , and published a pamphlet on our trade with the French XVest Indies . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wishes of France , and in season and out of season advocated the claims of the army . Like all friends of the soldiers at that time , he was accused of being a monarchist , - a singularly unjust charge against a man whose first maxim was that government must conform to the habits and character of the people , and who greatly feared an attempt to introduce monarchy , " because it did not consist with our taste and temper . " At the same time , like all the ablest and strongest men in that period of feebleness and solution , he worked ardently for a better and stronger union . In 1784 he wrote to Jay : " A national spirit is the natural result of national existence ; and although some of the present generation may feel colonial opposition of opinion , yet this generation will die away and give place to a race of Americans . " In the same spirit , and in almost his first speech in the constitutional convention to which he was chosen as a delegate from Pennsylvania , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared - " I come here as a representative of America . I flatter myself that I come here in some degree as a representative of the whole human race ; for the whole human race will be affected by the proceedings of this convention . I wish gentlemen to extend their views beyond the present moment of time , - beyond the narrow limits of place from which they derive their political origin . " Again he said , with " something like prophetic strain , " " This country must be united . if persuasion does not unite it , the sword will . " No man did better work in the great task of forming the Constitution than Morris , and from his hand came the final draft , rounded and polished , which embodied the principles forged slowly in weeks of debate . He of course belonged to the party which favored a vigorous central government . He opposed bitterly equality of votes in the Senate , and sought to weaken the rights of the States . He wished a President for life elected by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed , should be represented , and the suffrage conferred only on freeholders ; maintaining , also , that persons of foreign birth should be ineligible to office . What few others then perceived his keen mind detected , that the South was determined to secure a majority and rule at all hazards , and he fought fiercely against slave representation . Slavery , however , aroused his enmity on much broader grounds than those of political power . He had already striven for abolition in the New York convention , and he renewed the struggle on the national field . On moving to insert the word " free " before " inhabitants " he made a speech of great force and eloquence , beginning : - " Much will depend on this point . I will never concur in upholding domestic slavery . It is a nefarious institution . It is the curse of heaven on the States where it prevails . " Nothing shows the breadth of view , the far-reaching vision , and the generous spirit of the man better than his relentless and outspoken resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near to utter ruin and dissolution . // After all was over he expressed in a letter to a friend in France his opinion of the great work on which he had been engaged , and it would be difficult to find a juster estimate in the year 1788 of the Constitution , then struggling for an opportunity to live , than this of Morris , with its characteristic touch of satire . He writes - " You will long ere this have seen the Constitution proposed for the United States . This paper has been the subject of infinite investigation , disputation , and declamation . While some have boasted it as a work from Heaven , others have given it a less righteous origin . I have many reasons to believe that it was the work of plain , honest men , and such I think it will appear . Faulty it must be , for what is perfect ? But if adopted , experience will I believe , show that its faults are just the reverse of what they are supposed to be . " Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certain business interests , little thinking of the long absence from home that was before him , or of the great events in which he was to be an actor and which he was to describe so vividly in the diary then begun . He arrived in Paris on the 3d of February , 1789 , and the first two persons he visited were Jefferson and Lafayette . Of the latter , of whom he was very fond , lie curtly says , " Lafayette is full of politics ; he appears to be too republican for the genius of his country . " At the very outset he had doubts and suspicions as to the soundness and wisdom of the revolutionary party , and these feelings and opinions strengthened constantly during his long residence in the country . A day or two after his arrival he dined with Lafayette , who showed him a draft of the famous declaration of rights . " I gave him my opinions , " Mr. Morris writes in his diary , " and suggested several amendments tending to soften the high-colored expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are produced . " A few weeks later we find him writing to Washington in* the same strain , his sense of humor thoroughly aroused by the queer antics of the enthusiastic amateurs in government-making who then swarmed and talked everywhere in Paris . " Everything , " he says , " is Tz l'Anglais , and a desire to imitate the English prevails alike in the cut of a coat and the form of a constitution . " Before a month had expired Mr. Morris had become a social success , thanks to his wit , ability , and engaging manners . Every day brought an invitation to the salon of some fashionable woman , or to the dinner table of some statesman or philosopher . Full accounts , apparently , are given in the diary of all these entertainments , but Mr. Sparks seems to have thought them below the dignity of history , for he has favored us with only one or two extracts , and as a rule has confined his selections to politics . The observations on public affairs are penetrating and valuable in the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men and women of the world , of the more private side of daily life , are most charming and interesting . The characteristic vein of subdued satire , the keenness of observation , the effective style of these passages , are extremely attractive , and they can not hut cause the greatest regret that we should not have them entire . There is no other journal , diary , or correspondence of that period left by any of our public men which at all compares with this in its amusing , light , and humorous touch . From the slender selections ' of Mr. Sparks let us take this - " March 3d . Monsieur le Comte de Nenni does me the honor of a visit , and detains me till three o'clock . I then set off in great haste to dine with the Comtesse de B. , on an invitation of a week 's standing . Arrive at about a quarter past three , and find in the drawing-room // some dirty linen and no fire . While a waiting-woman takes away one , a valet lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of ashes give no great expectation of heat . By the smoke , however , all doubts are removed respecting the existence of fire . To expel the smoke a window is opened , and , the day being cold , I have the benefit of as fresh air as can reasonably be expected in so large a city . " Towards four o'clock the guests begin to assemble , and I begin to expect that , as Madame is a poetess , I shall have the honor to dine with that exalted part of the species who devote themselves to the Muses . In effect , the gentlemen begin to compliment their respective works , and as regular hours can not be expected in a house where the mistress is occupied more with the intellectual than the material world , I have a delightful prospect of a continuance of the scene . Towards five Madame steps in to announce dinner , and the hungry poets advance to the charge . As they bring good appetites they have certainly reason to praise the feast , and I console myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall escape an indigestion . A very narrow escape , too , for some rancid butter , of which the cook had been liberal , puts me in bodily fear . If the repast is not abundant , we have at least the consolation that there is no lack of conversation . Not being perfectly master of the language , most of the jests escaped me . As for the rest of the company , each being employed either in saying a good thing or in studying one to say , it is no wonder if he can not find time to applaud that of his neighbor . They all agree that we live in an age alike deficient in justice and in taste . Each finds in the fate of his own works numerous instances to justify this assertion . They tell me , to my great surprise , that the public now condemn theatrical compositions before they have heard the first recital . And to remove my doubts the Countess is so kind as to assure me that this rash decision has been made on one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " The statement as to the condemnation of theatrical works smacks of the soil . In the words " to my great surprise " we catch the peculiar vein of American humor which delights in a solemn appearance of ignorant and innocent belief in some preposterous assertion . It is close kin to the broader form of today as exemplified by Mark Twain weeping at the grave of Adam , which the Saturday Review declared was a ridiculous affectation of sentiment . March 25th Mr. Morris is at the house of his old and true friend of the RevoLtion , Madame de Chastellux . There he meets the Duchess of Orleans , and forms a friendship which is to prove very warm , very faithful , and of great service to the Duchess and her son , the citizen king of the future . Two days later he goes to dine with the Neckers in company with his friend the Mar*chal de Castries . Here too he begins a lifelong friendship with both his host and the daughter of the house , Madame de StaiA , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended it . His first impressions of M. INecker are worth quoting for their shrewd correctness : " A little before dinner , Monsieur enters . He has the look and manner of the counting-house , and , being dressed in embroidered velvet , he contrasts strongly with his habiliments . His bow , his address , say , I am the man . ' Our company is one half Academicians . The Duchess of Biron , formerly Lauzun , is one . I observe that M. Necker seems occupied by ideas which rather distress him . Ho can not , I think , stay in office half an hour unless the nation insist on keeping him there . He is now much harassed , and Madame receives continually m6-mob-es from different people ; so that // she seems as much occupied as he is . If he is really a very great man I am deceived ; and yet this is a rash judgment . If he is not a laborious man I am also deceived . " While he was thus watching and weighing the men and women whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying with deep attention the momentous political development going on about him . May 4th , the day before the opening of the States-General , he witnessed the procession at Versailles . The Queen was received with hostile silence , and Mr. Morris writes most characteristically , " I can not help feeling the mortification which the poor Queen meets with , for I see only the woman , and it seems unmanly to treat a woman with unkindness . " He was present at the opening of the StatesGeneral , and has left a very striking and picturesque description of that great event , unfortunately too long for quotation . He followed the operations of that famous body with close scrutiny , and found little in their doings to encourage him as to the prospects of France . We catch a glimpse here of another famous American , who was equally interested in the fortunes of the French people , but who looked upon the advancing revolution with feelings and opinions very different from those of Mr. Morris . " June 3d . Go to Mr. Jefferson 's . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything being done to purpose by the States-General . This comes from having sanguine expectations of a downright republican form of government . The literary people here , observing the abuses of their monarchical form , imagine that everything must go better in proportion as it recedes from the present establishments , and in their closets they make men exactly suited to their systems ; but unluckily they are such men as exist nowhere else , and least of all in France . " He had still other occupations , as am pears by the next entry , with its jest at his own expense - " June 5th . Go to M. Houdon 's . He has been waiting for me a long time . I stand for his statue of General Washington , being the humble employment of a manikin . This is literally taking the advice of St. Paul to be all things to all men . " June 6th , he supped with Madame Flahaut , where he met a certain very celebrated person , whom he gauged with his usual penetrating accuracy : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an intimate friend of Madame Flahaut , appears to me a sly , cool , cunning , ambitious , and malicious man . I know not why conclusions so disadvantageous to him are formed in my mind ; but so it is , and I can not help it . " This quick judgment which Mr. Morris here sets down when Talleyrand was still comparatively unknown does not differ very widely from that of posterity half a century after the death of that eminent statesman and divine . It is one of many instances of a foresight and insight amounting almost to a gift of prophecy which made Mr. Morris 's political predictions most wonderful in their correctness . Let us take a few more extracts from the diary : - " June 23d . At dinner I sit next to M. de Lafayette , who tells me that I injure the cause , for . that my sentiments are continually quoted against the good party . I seize this opportunity to tell him that I am opposed to the democracy from regard to liberty ; that I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop them if I could ; that their views respecting this nation are totally inconsistent with the materials of which it is composed ; and that the worst thing which could happen would be to grant their wishes . He tells me that he is sensible that his party are mad , and tells them so , but is not the less determined to die with them . I tell hint 1886. 489 // that I think it would be quite as well to bring them to their senses and live with them . " It is plain that he concealed nothing from Lafayette , no matter how distasteful his advice might prove . He writes in the same way to Washington , ten days later - " Our American example has done them good , but , like all novelties , liberty runs away with their discretion , if they have any . They want an American constitution , with the exception of a King instead of a President , without reflecting that they have not American citizens to support that constitution . " When he penned this sentence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day of the taking of the Bastile , after describing that event and the manner in which he heard of it , Mr. Morris writes , with a turn at the end which is curiously modern , " Yesterday it was the fashion at Versailles not to believe that there were any disturbances at Paris . I presume that this day 's transaction will induce a conviction that all is not perfectly quiet . " After the fall of the Bastile there was a lull , and the attempts at constitution-making and reform went On again after a fashion . September 26th , Mr. Morris was at the National Assembly , whither , indeed , he went frequently , and after listening to the report of the Minister of Finance lie remarks , " At the close , however , of the report there is a feebleness which they are not , perhaps , fully aware of , or perhaps it was unavoidable . They appeal to patriotism for aid ; but they should in money matters apply only to interest . They should never acknowledge such want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So annoyed and troubled was he by the errors which he saw committed that , as events hurried rapidly forward , he strove , of course in vain , to mend matters by appealing to his intimate friends in behalf of wiser measures . October 16th , he wrote to Lafayette an admirable letter of counsel and advice . He said that the constitution would not work , and that the National Assembly would soon fall into contempt . Under these circumstances , the only thing to be done was to strengthen the executive , and he urges Lafayette to see that good and able men go into the council , but advises Lafayette himself to remain outside . The reasons for this advice are then set forth with great vigor and shrewdness . One can not help thinking , as one reads these wise but futile words , what a pity it was that among the French statesmen there were not a few like Morris . Much might have been sayed if there had been , but nothing is so empty as the " ifs " of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been no chance for centuries to breed them , or even to make them possible . Mr. Morris was now called away by public duties of his own . He was requested by Washington to go to England as a secret agent of our government , and endeavor to reopen diplomatic relations and settle various outstanding and threatening differences with that country . To London he accordingly went in February , 1790 , and there he spent seven or eight months in fruitless conversations with the Duke of Leeds and Mr. Pitt about western posts , the fulfillment of treaties , the compensation for negroes , British debts , and impressment . On the last subject he said , with a concise wit which ought to have made the saying more famous than it is , " I believe , my lord , that this is the only instance in which we are not treated as aliens . " Whether this keen-edged remark penetrated the thick skull of the noble duke to whom it was addressed does not appear . At all events , the mission was a failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in dealing with the United States , were determined to injure // us so far as they could , and make us enemies instead of friends , if it were possible to do so , - a policy which has borne lasting fruit , and which England does not now delight in quite so much as of yore . It is pretty obvious that Mr. Morris was not to their taste , despite his wit and good manners . He was a man of perfect courage and patriotism , and could be neither bullied nor cajoled . His brother , Staats Long Morris , was a general in the British army and the husband of the Duchess of Gordon , - a fact which implied respectability to the English mind , and made it difficult for them to snub a person who , according to their notions , was so well connected . Worst of all , he was a man of great ability and wide information , intellectually superior to any minister he met , except Mr. Pitt , and therefore he was an awkward subject to trample on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so far successful that they gave him much trouble at home . He was charged with consorting with Fox and the opposition , which was not true , and with revealing his purposes to Luzerne , the French minister , which was true , and sprang from Mr. Morris 's sentiment of grathude to France , ill rewarded , and in great measure cured , by Luzerne 's betrayal of his confidence . He found time , however , in the midst of his vain efforts , to observe his English friends , and the following extract from a letter to Washington shows that the ludicrous side in the lives of the various distinguished personages whom he met did not escape him . On September 18 , 1790 , he writes of Pitt : " Observe that he is rather the Queen 's man than the King 's , and that since his majesty 's illness she has been of great consequence . This depends in part on a medical reason . To prevent the relapse of persons who have been mad they must be kept in constant awe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King gave the matter in charge to his royal consort , who performs that , like every other part of her conjugal duty , with singular zeal and perseverance. ** Fruitless wranglings and disobliging treatment , although they could not disturb his good-humor , nevertheless tired him sadly , and he turned his eyes ever more wistfully to the exciting scenes in France . He shows this in a letter to a friend in Paris , in which , too , he makes one of his many correct predictions , and also reveals his knowledge of his own failing in the direction of a dangerous frankness . " A cautious man , " he says , " should therefore give only sibylline predictions , if indeed he should hazard any . But I am not a cautious man . I therefore give it as my opinion that they will issue the paper currency , and substitute thereby depreciation in the place of bankruptcy , or , rather , suspension . " Soon after he departed for the Continent , made a brief tour in Germany , and in November reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old haunts , the club , and there , as he says , met his friend De Moustier , who was engaged in making a constitution , and was , " as usual , on the high ropes of royal prerogative . " He soon saw that things were going to pieces very rapidly , and after several visits finally got an opportunity to tell Lafayette so , and renew his former advice to rally about the throne and try to gain some stability ; expressing at the same time unbounded contempt for " the thing called a constitution . " He also urged the restoration of the nobility , at which poor Lafayette flinched , and said he would like two chambers , as in America . " I tell him that an American constitution will not do for this country ; that every country must have a constitution suited to its circumstances , and the state of Ftance requires a higher - toned government than that of England . " All this was very true but very unpalatable , espe // cially to Lafayette , and the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the old friendship really remained as warm as ever , and when Lafayette became a prisoner no one worked harder for his liberation than Mr. Morris . Although the tremendous events in the midst of which he was now plunged absorbed his thoughts , we still get here and there glimpses of the gay society in which he found himself , and which was soon to be extinguished in the dark torrent of revolution . January 19 , 1791 , he writes : " Visit Madame de Chastellux , and go with her to dine with the Duchess of Orleans . Her royal highness is ruined ; that is , she is reduced from 450,000 to 200,000 livres per annum . She tells me that she can not give any good dinners ; but if I will come and fast with her , she will be glad to see me . " January 25th , he dined with Madame de Sta*A , and heard the Abbi Siey*s " descant with much self-sufficiency on government . " Four dais later he went out to Choisy with Madame de Chastelmx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think soundly , " a compliment paid by Mr. Morris to but few of his French friends . There is something very striking and most interesting in these little pictures of daily existence , which went on much as usual , although the roar of revolution was even then sounding in men 's ears . Philosophers speculated and fine ladies jested , although the world was in convulsion ; and so they continued to do until it was all drowned in the Terror , from which arose , after brief interval , another society , as light-hearted and brilliant , if not so well born , as its predecessor . We can mark , however , the tremendous changes in progress around him in the extracts from the diary . The social pictures grow fewer , the tone is graver , there are more interviews with statesmen and fewer chats with ladies of rank , while the reflections concern the welfare of state and nation rather than the foibles or graces of men and women . April 4th came the funeral of Mirabeau , with some observations in the diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still weightier matters then pressing upon his mind . August 26th he notes in his diary , " Dine with Madame de StaM , who requests me to show her the m6moire I have prepared for the King . " The next day he says , " Dine with M. de Montmorin . After dinner retire into his closet and read to him the plan I have prepared of a discourse for the King . He is startled at it . Says it is too forcible ; that the temper of the people will not bear it . " Mr. Morris 's talents and the force of his arguments on the state of public affairs had attracted general attention , and in their agony of doubt court and ministry turned to him for aid . The result was the draft for a royal speech , which the King liked but was prevented by his ministers from using , a mimoire on the state of France , notes for a constitution , and some other similar papers which are given by Mr. Sparks . These documents are very able and bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had any effect may well be doubted , but there can be no question that it was the sanest , most vigorous , and best defined of the multitude offered to poor , hesitating Louis , and its adoption could certainly have done no harm . In the midst of these disinterested and somewhat perilous pursuits we find him writing to Robert Morris ( October 10 , 1791 ) , and describing a scene at the theatre when the people cheered the King and Queen . " Now , my dear friend , " he adds , " this is the very same people who , when the King was brought back from his excursion , whipped a democratical duchess of my acquaintance because they heard only the last part of what she said , which was , Ii ne faut pas dire , // Vive le Roi . ' She had the good sense to desire the gentleman who was with her to leave her . Whipping is , you know , an operation which a lady would rather undergo among strangers than before her acquaintance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on further than he anticipated . Indeed , his attitude as an adviser of the ministry caused outbreaks against him on the part of the opposi. tion . De Warville said in his newspaper that Morris , on one of his periodical visits to England upon business , was sent to thwart Talleyrand , - an accusation which Mr. Morris met with a public denial . His doings , however , were not fortunate , in view of the responsibility about to be placed upon him ; for while he was away on this very visit to England , in the early months of 1792 , he received the news of his*appointment as minister to France . Morris was not without enemies . At home , his contempt and dislike for the methods of the French Revolution were only too well known , and his confirmation was strongly opposed in the Senate . His good friend the President with much delicacy explained to him the ground of the opposition , and in this way pointed out to Morris the failings which threatened his success . The idea of your political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which your lively and brilliant imagination displays itself allows too little time for deliberation and correction , and is the primary cause of those sallies which too often offend , and of that ridicule of character which begets enmity not easy to be forgotten , but which might easily be avoided if it were under the control of more caution and prudence . " If it had been known in America just how deeply Mr. Morris had plunged into French politics , it may be doubted whether Washington even would have nominated him as minister . As it turned out , no better choice could have been made , yet at the moment Mr. Morris was involved in affairs which no foreign minister ought even to have known . He probably felt that his efforts to save order and government by means of the monarchy were hopeless , but they had drawn him on into the much more dangerous path of personal sympathy for the King and Queen , and thence to attempts to preserve their lives , at least . The King was unable to adopt Mr. Morris ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice confided in M. de Monciel , one of his ministers , and this gentleman and Mr. Morris arranged an elaborate yet practicable scheme for the escape of the royal family . After a short time the King sent Mr. Morris 547,000 livres to carry out the plan , and wished also to make him the depositary of his papers . Mr. Morris accepted the first trust , and declined the latter . The large sum of money seems to indicate the King 's preference for the plan of Mr. Morris , in whom he had great confidence , yet there were half a dozen other schemes on foot at the same time . De Molleville had one ; Mr. Crawford , sent over by the British government , had another ; Marie Antoinette 's Swedish friend , Count Fersen , had a third ; and there were probably many more . One plan interfered with another . That of Morris and Monciel was ripe for execution , and still the King doubted and delayed . While he was hesitating , the 10th of August came , the Swiss guard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was present at the Tuileries on that memorable day , and went thenc* to the house of the minister of the United States . On entering he found Mr. Morris surrounded by the old Count d'Estain* and many other persons of distinction , who had fought side by side with us in our war for independence . Silence reigned , interrupted only by the weeping of the women and children . As the visitor was about to retire , Mr. Morris took him // aside , and said , " I have no doubt , sir , but there are persons on the watch , who would find fault with my conduct as minister in receiving and protecting these people ; but I call on you to witness the declaration which I now make , and that is that they were not invited to my house , but came of their own accord . Whether my house will be a protection to them , or to me , God only knows , but I will not turn them out of it , let what will happen to me . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is more or less indebted , and it would be inhuman to force them into the hands of these assassins , had they no such claim upon me . " Whatever the faults of Mr. Morris , or whatever criticism may be made upon him , no American even now can read these words , uttered at such a moment , without feeling his pulse beat quicker , and without rejoicing that a man of such high and generous spirit so fitly represented his country in an hour of trial and peril . To suppose , because Mr. Morris had the sympathy of a gallant man for the King and Queen in their danger and distress , and also thea profound distrust and contempt as an able and practical statesman for the follies and madness of those who were trying to carry on the French Revolution , that he therefore was a lover of royalty and aristocracy and titles would be a great injustice . How far removed he really was from such weak prejudices is shown by an incident many years later . At Vienna , where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scions of Austrian nobility in regard to Lafayette , these precious individuals abused the fallen and imprisoned leader ferociously , and Mr. Morris of course came to his defense . His commentary shows how much he despised the people who might have saved France and failed . " Indeed , the conversation of these gentlemen , who have the virtue and good fortune of their grandfathers to recommend them , leads me almost to forget the crimes of the French Revolution ; and often the unforgiving temper and sanguinary wishes which they exhibit make me almost believe that the assertion of their enemies is true , namely , that it is success alone which has determined on whose side should be crimes and on whose the misery . In the same vein and about the same time he said of the illustrious personage who afterwards became Louis XVIII . that " in his opinion he had nothing to do but to try to get shot , thereby redeeming by valor the foregone follies of his conduct . " He was sorry for the King and Queen , he disliked and distrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French royalty and nobility , for " they turned like cravens and fled . " The two years which followed his appointment as minister form one of the most brilliant chapters in the diplomatic history of the United States . On the day he left Paris , after having turned everything over to his successor Mr. Monroe , Mr. Morris writes in his diary ( October 12 , 1794 ) , " I have the consolation to have made no sacrifice either of personal or national dignity , and I believe I should have obtained everything if the American government had refused to recall me. " 1 This brief statement is as true as it is moderate . INo foreign minister ever faced such difficulties and dangers as Mr. Morris did at this time , for the simple reason that there has been in modern times but one Reign of Terror , and Mr. Morris was the only representative of a foreign government who did not ask for his passports and withdraw . He not only remained at his post , but he handled the affair of our debt most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our government had demanded the recall of this to ask in turn for the recall of Morris , whom Genet , and the French rulers took advantage of they both feared and disliked . // demanded to accelerate our payments , but firmly declining to go further or to be imposed U*OU in any way . He carried on a continual battle with the decrees militating against our commerce , met every difficulty that arose at the threshold , protested against every outrage on our rights , and was on the point of getting reparation when the French government obtained his recall . If these duties had been performed in ordinary times they would have been sufficiently difficult , but to deal with any diplomatic questions in the hurly-burly of the French Revolution seems an almost impossible feat . Mr. Morris , on account of his well-known views , was not liked by the successive ministries or committees , each of whom was more extreme and violent than its predecessor . ro oppose them was about as safe as playing with a hungry tiger , but our minister never flinched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once , he was arrested in the street because he did not have his card of citizenship , and his death or murder was at one time currently reported in Europe and America . His life was , in truth , in constant danger . When all other ministers departed lie stayed , an example worthily followed by another American minister when France was last beset with " malice domestic and foreign levy . " When subjected to these various outrages he never failed to take a high tone , demand his passport , and obtain a more or less surly apology . So he held out , doing his duty and protecting his countrymen and his country 's interests . He was , in fact , just the man for the place and time . A sympathizer like Monroe at that period would have been ensnared and made a tool of , and would have thus involved us in all the network of French complications , as indeed he afterwards succeeded in doing to a certain extent . Almost any other man of Morris 's own party would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defiant attitude . Morris , however , while too strongly opposed to the Revolution to be beguiled , by his utter fearlessness and ready wit combined with a certain dash and gallantry was carried through triumphantly . The diary became too dangerous , and was stopped for the time ; but before this occurred there are a few entries and somo extracts from letters which must be quoted , to show how wonderfully he penetrated the conditions of the *truggle , and how clearly he understood its true character . On May 14 , 1792 , he wrote to Washington - " You know that I do , from the bottom of my heart , wish well to this country , and will therefore easily judge what I have felt in seeing them long since in the high road to despotism. ** And again in June he wrote - " It is notorious that the great mass of the French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present order of things than to prevent the return of the ancient oppressions , and of course would more readily submit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits were found in those noble legal and clerical corps by which the people were alternately oppressed and insulted . " Here is the true view of the French Revolution : that it was a struggle not for political rights , but for equality before the law , for the abolition of privileges , and for good government . Morris was almost if not quite alone , at that time , in this opinion , and it has been reserved to the most recent modern investigation to bring out and insist upon this all-important truth . July 2d he says in his diary , " Monciel and Bremond call on me . The French , says Monciel , are , I am afraid , too rotten for a free government . I tell him that the experiment may , nevertheless , be tried , and despotism still remain as a last resort . " August 22d he wrote to Jefferson of Lafayette 's flight : " Thus his circle is completed . He has spent his fortune // on a revolution , and is now crushed by the wheel which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " October 18 , 1793 , he writes to Washington : " But whatever may be the lot of France in remote futurity , and putting aside the military events , it seems evident that she must soon be governed by a single despot . Whether she will pass to that point through the medium of a triumvirate or other small body of men seems as yet undetermined . I think it most probable that she will . " If we consider that the Directory did not come until two years later , the consulate or triumvirate four years after that , and then in the process of evolution the Empire and the single despot in 1804 , it must be admitted that this is an extraordinary example of political foresight . Morris saw that a despotism existed ; in common with many others he perceived that it would probably be concentrated in a single individual ; but who else in 1793 announced that the single despot would come in the precise manner in which it actually happened ? He made many other predictions , and was rarely wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his friends , but there is space to mention only one other instance . Many years afterward , when watching from across the Atlantic with intense interest the Russian campaign , he predicted that Napoleon would begin his retreat from Moscow on October 21st . On October 19th the retreat actually began . These things were of course not due to mere chance , and to M. Necker ( May 22 , 1798 ) , who had recalled one of his predictions since become true , Mr. Morris gives undoubtedly the secret of his remarkable foresight . " It is not , " he says , " difficult to prophesy in such a case . If we are to judge of the conduct of a man in a given situation , it would be hazardous to pronounce upon it , since the character of each individual is governed by the peculiarity of his mind and the im pression made upon him by the circumstances in which he is placed . But where the mass is concerned we have but to observe the instinct of the animal , and we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine he was also governed by a theory which guided him through all his public life and largely explains his success . He says in a letter to Carmichael : - " The true object of a great statesman is to give to any particular nation the kind of laws which is suitable to them , and the best constitution which they are capable of . " No better rule was ever laid down , and if it were more observed men would make fewer disastrous failures in government and constitutions . After leaving France , Mr. Morris traveled for six years on the Continent and in England , studying men and manners , enjoying society , and making everywhere firm friends among the most distinguished men and women of the time . At last in 1799 he returned to America , and as he supposed to private life and the practice of his profession . He was elected , however , almost at once Senator from New York , and rei*ntered public life just as the Federalist party , to which he belonged , was driven from power , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equality of votes received by Jefferson and Burr Mr. Morris took the only sound view , that it was right to have Jefferson chosen . He says in his driest way : - " Not meaning to enter into intrigues , I have merely expressed the opinion that , since it was evidently the intention of our fellow-citizens to make Mr. Jefferson their President , it seems proper to fulfill that intention . " A little later he writes to Hamilton : " I have more at the request of others than from my ' own mere motion suggested certain considerations not quite unworthy of attention ; but it is dangerous // to be impartial in politics . You who are temperate in drinking have never perhaps noticed the awkward situation of a man who continues sober after the company are drunk . " Again , he writes to Livingston : " I greatly disapproved , and openly disapproved , the attempt to choose Mr. Burr . Many of my friends thought differently . I saw they would be disappointed , and therefore looked on with perfect composure . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing which should put us out of humor . " Despite his philosophy , however , he made a most eloquent and desperate resistance to the repeal of the judiciary act , which he always considered little less than a death-blow to the Constitution . He could be impartial at times and he supported the acquisition of Louisiana , but at heart he was a strong partisan . We can see this in what he says of Jefferson . " It is the fashion , " he writes in 1803 , " with those discontented creatures called Federalists , to say that our President is not a Christian ; yet they must acknowledge that , in true Christian meekness , when smiiten on one cheek he turns the other , and by his late appointment of Monroe has taken special care that a stone which the builders rejected should become the first of the corner . These are his works ; and for his faith , it is not as a grain of mustard , but the full size of a pumpkin , so that while men of mustard-seed faith can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He believes , for instance , in the perfectibility of man , the wisdom of mobs , and moderation of Jacobins . He believes in payment of debts by diminution of revenue , in defense of territory by reduction of armies , and in vindication of rights by the appointment of ambassadors . " Again , he writes to Dayton : " That our administration is too feeble is , I believe , too true . What you say of their chief is curious . When he told you we have the choice of enemies , he stated a fact applicable at all times to all countries , since any blundering blockhead can make a war ; but when he acknowledged that we have not a choice of friends , he pronounced the surest satire on himself , since this misfortune can only be attributed to a series of false and foolish measures . " Strong and even extreme as he was in his Federalism , he nevertheless was not despondent , like so many of his party friends , and declined to despair of the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in 1803 , " a counter-current in human affairs , which opposes alike both good and evil . Thus the good we hope is seldom obtained , and the evil we fear is rarely realized . Like the forked , featherless bipeds which have preceded them , our posterity will be shaken into the political form which shall be most suitable to their physical and moral state . They will he born , procreate , and die , like the rest of creation , while here and there some accomplished scoundrels , rare nantes in gurgite vasto , will give their names to periods of history . " He seems to have sighed but little for the delights of Europe , where he had passed so many years . To his friend Parish , who had urged him to come to England , he writes in 1801 : - " Recollect that a tedious morning , a great dinner , a boozy afternoon , and dull evening make the sum total of English life . It is admirable for young men who shoot , hunt , drink ; but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Were I to give you a rendezvous in Europe , it should be on the Continent . " He traveled extensively , however , in his own country , and , not content with the exercise of his profession , gave his best thought and work to schemes of public improvement . As early as 1777 Mr. Morris had set forth the idea of // connecting the great lakes with the Hudson . This project he never forgot , and after his return he renewed his efforts , and devoted the last years of his life and all his eloquence before the legislature to its promotion . Thus engaged , his life flowed peacefully along . He married in 1809 , most happily , and not long afterwards , in a letter to his friend Madame de Damas , he gives us a glirnps* of himself and his home life that displays admirably the happy disposition , cheerful philosophy , and keen intellect which made their possessor so successful and so contented . " My health , " he writes , " is excellent , saving a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can walk three leagues , if the weather be pleasant and the road not rough . My employment is to labor for myself a little , for others more ; to receive much company , and forget half those who come . I think of public affairs a little , play a little , read a little , and sleep a good deal . With good air , a good cook , fine water and wine , a good constitution , and a clear conscience I descend towards the grave full of gratitude to the Giver of all good . " There is nothing to add but the inevitable statement of the end . He died after a brief illness , in 1816 , without suffering , and cheerful to the last . The man who made the final draft of the Constitution of the United States* and who first suggested the Erie Canal needs no other monuments . But his brilliant intellect and long arid distinguished public career are too little known . We have but to read his diaries and letters to appreciate him at his true valno both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to be said . Among many fine qualities of heart and mind , nothing does him more honor than his strong , unswerving patriotism and ardent belief in his country . This sketch can not end more fitly than with another prediction , made in 1801 , which has not . only been fulfilled , but which shows the spirit which animated its author throughout his life : - " The proudest empire in Europe is but a bauble compared to what America* will he , must be , in the course of two centuries , perhaps of one l If , with a calm retrospect to the progress made within forty years , we stand on the firm ground of calculation , warranted by experience , and look forward to the end of a similar period , imagination shrinks from the magnitude of rational deduction .
