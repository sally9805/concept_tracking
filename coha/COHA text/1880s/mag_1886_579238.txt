MEMORIES OF LONDON . THIRTY-FIVE years ago , like many a wiser moth before and after me , I set my face for London . What I knew of it was what any American boy of English descent knows : " London cries , " Dick Whittington , something of the town 's history and as much of its geography , and the young Queen , - she seemed young always , because as a child I remember hearing of the Prin*ess Victoria and her coronation . But to me there was a more potent attraction than even old London . I had been reading and re-reading with enthusiasm that first volume of Modern Painters . I had in a weak and blind way begun the study of art in a country town , where there was no instruction and very little help , and the glowing eulogies of Turner , the splendid fallacies and witching rhetoric of the Graduate of Oxford , had woven a spell around me which left me with one overruling purpose in life , - to go to London , see the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Dick Whittington was scarcely more naive , if more fortunate . I had sold a picture for thirty dollars , and decided to go to London and stay as long as it lasted ! I had never been away from home . I knew little more than a child of the value of money , bad never paid for a lodging or a dinner , and thirty dollars , I calculated , would keep me six weeks . I had all the unquestioning faith of utter ignorance of the highways or byways of the world . I would follow the sun when he was visible , and the moon when he was not , and determined , without taking counsel of any one , what was to be done . The question of a passage troubled me no more than it did the Israelites fleeing from Pharaoh . I felt that I should get across , and the proverbial New York merchant was my deus ex machina . Thomas Tileston offered me a passage on one of his liners to Liverpool , and the old Garrick , splendid sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wafted me across . The captain took kindly to me , and eased my obligations to the hotel-keeper in Liverpool , so that I got to London with half of my thirty dollars in my pocket . I had left New York at the end of December ; the Hudson was filled with floating ice , the Jersey hills were covered with snow . I found the shores of England green , and the fields like ours in early spring . I arrived at Euston // Square late in the afternoon of a mild and smoky day of January , a third-class passenger , with my luggage , a tiny leather valise , under my arm , which , with a Spanish cloak , was all my impedimenta ; and fearful of further expense and of pillaging landlords if I trusted my three sovereigns to their sheltering roofs , I bought a two-penny loaf and walked the streets all night . I had a letter of introduction from G. P. Putnam , the publisher , to his correspondent Thomas Delf , and , inquiring my way across London to his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my valise when he came in the morning . He directed me to a quiet lodging-house in Bouverie Street , kept by an honest landlady , and I installed myself in a bedroom , which was also to he my studio , at six shillings a week , including the cooking of my breakfast . In the years which have since passed I have many times returned to London , and am as familiar with it as a Londoner born , so that to find a new thing in it would indeed surprise me ; but there come now and then days , or rather moments , in the winter , when the smoke settles down and fils the streets with its dusky veil and shadowless mystery , when the yellow sky even at noon of a *quiet day hardly allows a red sun to be seen at odd moments , and when both unite with the pungent odors of the coal smoke to recall this first visit , and I can not describe the witchery and delight of that dreamy and weird recollection , which is like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my very life . I write from a new home in a quarter of the great city which at the time in question was the country . We speak of the rapid changes in our American cities , but nothing like the changes of London can exist with us . Growth is not a change of this kind . Paris alone , in certain respects , can show such metamorphoses as London . But on the whole , Paris , as I saw it at this first visit to the Old World , was more like the Paris one sees now than was London of 1850 like the London of to-day . The mere question of growth is a minor matter . London was not the metropolis of the world iu 1850 , and now it is . Then it was only a huger provincial town . The Londoner in general measured nothing but himself , and nobody came to London for anything but hardware , good walking-boots , saddles , etc. ; now it is the entrep6t of the civilized world . The World 's Fair of 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the common arrival of ocean steamers , rare at the time I am writing of , have changed the entire character of London life and business and the tone of its society . It is not merely in the fact that 48,000 houses were built in the capital in the last year , or that you find colonies of French , Italians , Russians , Greeks in it , but that the houses are no longer what they were , inside or out , and thus the foreigner is an assimilated ingredient in its philosophy . All this has come since 1850 . Sitting by my coal fire , which flames ruddily and flickeringly , and fills the room with the smoky aroma all know who have once been in any English city , the meditation my subject provokes runs to melancholy and a regret , sentimental certainly , but pathetic , for the days when this veiled sunshine and pungent atmosphere first became familiar to me . I shut my senses close to go back , as only old men can , when the new fact fades and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bungler has badly painted a new one . Between my quarter , which was then a straggling hamlet and is now a continuous part of London , and London itself there was then a wide stretch of green fields and kitchen gardens . The whole quarter of South Kensington , Earl 's Court , Baron 's Court , and Raven 's Court has grown up and continued London to // Hammersmith ; but there was a green expanse with hawthorn hedges , where one heard the lark and rook , and saw far away the faint blue of the hills of Norwood , Clapham , and Wandsworth , where now , as far as the towers of the Crystal Palace , is an almost unbroken mass of houses . With very few exceptions the men I then knew are gone ; and when I walk out , as I used to , by the road that runs still from Brompton to Hammersmith , the stately houses that line the streets are little more than tombstones to me . Amongst the very few letters I had to people in London was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of the Art Journal , who gave me another to a now dead and forgotten landscape painter , J. B. Pyne , one of the most consummate of his craft that England has produced , and who lived within a pistol shot of the site of my present residence , on what was a country road ; and every Sunday afternoon I walked from my lodgings to his house , measuring the distance by the milestones as I went along , six miles , of which half were amongst the fields . lie used to keep in baronial style a place at his din*ner-table for every corner , and there one met a society wholly devoted to art . Pyne was an admirable talker , and few men whom I have met had larger ideas of his art , or greater generosity in imparting his instruction to learners . As an artist he was never popular : his art was far too refined and averse from the qualities that catch the uneducated eye . He had not great genius , but a talent which came near it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries except Turner , of whom be was an ardent admirer and to a certain extent a follower . There was in his art a certain dash of the artificial , and a limitation in method of treatment which is invariably the concomitant of talent when unaccompanied by genius . Talent alone , be it great or little , runs in grooves , betrays its identity in every movement , is always recognizable . Talent with imagination - that is , real creative power , the capacity to make new things and find new paths - is genius . Though Pyne 's talent ran always in a groove , it was a large and noble one , and it is safe , I think , to predict that his pictures will , when another century is half gone , rank amongst the very best his generation has left . He was too much led by theory , but this is a common defect of talent when coupled with intellect only , which makes overmuch account of the instruction that cost it so great labor ; while genius , aware that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar inspiration , does not plume itself on the lower excellences . Pyne had caught from Turner the greater landscape motives , the appreciation of light and space , which , with a subtle feeling for the harmony and play of color and grace in his composition , allied him more closely in style to the great master than to any other contemporary , and to careless observers caused him to be esteemed a mere imitator of Turner , which he was very far from being . His executive power was very great , and , being proud of it , he was sometimes ostentatious of it ; but he never , like some of his most successful con temporaries , descended to tricks of execution or vulgar bravura . He sometimes painted imitations of the great landscape masters , partly as studies and partly as tours de force , and , being accustomed to travel in his own groove , he proceeded very well in any other painter 's when once he got into it . I have no doubt that some of Pyne 's recollections of Turner 's pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for original Turners when their centennial comes round ; and as he was more careful in the method of painting and painted with fewer alterations than Turner , it is possible that these imitations will then be so much better preserved that they will be taken for the best ex // amples of the great painter 's manner . Pyne told me of his having painted a picture in the manner of Ruysdael which , though sold as an imitation , was finally established as by the master himself ; and one day , having received an invitation from one of the leading dealers to see a new Ruysdael , he was not a little surprised to find his own work . He at once undeceived the dealer by only removing a little paint in one corner and discovering his signature , which he had concealed there for this contingency . Notwithstanding the disclosure , the picture was sold as a Ruysdael , but to whom Pyne could not learn . Of all the English landscape painters whose work I have known , except Turner , Pyne was the most productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no repentirs and no labor lost , enabled him , as he used to express it , to keep a picture manufactory . Yet nothing was ever slighted . Pictures were often in hand for two or three years ; and so studious was he of their permanence that he made careful account of the effect of time on his pigments , although in their finished state they might have a raw look which age , he said , would cure . He used to say that the men who wanted their pictures to appear at their best when they were first seen had to pay the penalty in their future estimation , but he preferred that his should be at their best for future times . With all his methodical way of picture-making , he never fell off in his sincerity and conscientious care for the quality of his pictures . In a letter from him from the Italian lakes , written in 1852 , I find a passage which betrays something both of the good and evil of his manner of studying nature , which he commonly did with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it too much twaddle if I state to you my present method of procedure . First of all , then , I am vastly assisted in my present Af*mories of London . May , undertaking by having with me my wife and two friends . One of them , a gentleman of six feet , and not weighing more than eleven stone , is the best hunter-down of the picturesque in landscape of any one I ever knew . The other assists in devoting himself to outline details and close studies of any portion that may be worth the time . This , you can readily imagine , enables me to make an untrammeled but elaborate colored drawing of the subject under effect , as , should I lose anything of locality or character in selecting a treatment which , to a great extent , may preclude both the one and the other , I am enabled in any future work to fall back upon my friend 's outlines , which are superb for fidelity and character , and the colored studies . This , you will say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , but I see no other mode equally efficient , and fancy that it will be productive of results . " At the time I am writing of , Ruskin 's influence on public taste was almost supreme , and the men whose works he praised had an undue share of popularity . Pyne was never in favor with him ; probably , to a great extent , because he never would waste time in elaborating foregrounds , though for delicacy of painting in his distances , and for absolute fidelity in actual views , nobody in England has ever approached him , and , with very few exceptions , he has never been equaled in the making up of his picture , which , without being imaginative , was always agreeable . Other reasons for Ruskin 's not liking him were , perhaps , his emulation of Turner 's most characteristic qualities , which would not be grateful to one who insisted that Turner was the only artist who had them , and the animosity between Pyne and Harding , who was Ruskin 's drawing-master , and very largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed the most contemptuous silence with regard to Pyne 's work , and this , // with the hostility of the Royal Academy , kept the appreciation of his art within a small circle ; but there he was held at his full value , which is , in my own opinion , that of one of the greatest of landscape painters . What is most singular in regard to his work is that no pictures of their epoch come so rarely to the hammer . To the hospitality of Mr. Hall I owe nearly all my earliest knowledge of London art and artists . He gave me a letter to Harding , a burly , solid , and typical Englishman , full of common sense , and utterly destitute of imagination or poetic feeling . He had a surprising facility of execution , whether in oil or water-color , a thorough feeling for the pictorial in nature ; and his work was , on the whole , as prosaic and antipathetical as painting could be . As one of the leaders in the movement towards naturalism , which destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting , and ushered in that of realism more or less complete , he holds his place . To Mr. Hall I owe also the acquaintance of Creswick , facile painter of glade and grove , of brook and hedgerow ; too facile , indeed , and flimsy , with a pretty perception of the poetry of sun and shade , yet too fond of tricks of the brush and the suggestive result of little labor . He , too , was a genuine Englishman , hospitable , cordial . His work had much of the charm of free nature to me then ; it is now so many years since I saw the marks of his brush that I am disposed to wonder how much of the old admiration I should feel in seeing it again . Hall introduced me to many of the lesser magnates of the palette also , and I owe to him many pleasant memories of old London . I think the last time I saw him was at the private view of one of the exhibitions , with his critic preparing the annual dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " scourge this fellow well " for him . But critics of that calibre were then of small account when Ruskin spoke . To Leslie - our American painter we thought him - I had a letter from Durand , then president of our Academy . A thoughtful , refined , gentlemanly personage , distinguished and reserved in a quite English way , was Leslie . I saw him in his studio , and , ceremony done , he gave me , on leaving , a card to see Mr. Holford 's collection of old masters , and there our acquaintance ended . I imagine that American patriotic admiration had wearied him . To Holford 's I went with Glass , a hearty , friendly compatriot , always glad to be of any use to Americans . He was then painting his celebrated picture of the Duke of Wellington going to the Horse-Guards , the last portrait of the Iron Duke , which proved a little fortune to him , bringing him , with ephemeral fame , many commissions . To him I owe a glimpse of Wellington , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many lonely days had been mine in my six months in London ; for my slender remnant of the scanty provision of pounds sterling had been increased by fifty more , sent me by a brother when he found with what a little purse I had provoked fortune . And with this I held on until high summer , and went home in August . One of the kindest of my London friends was Wehnert , an Englishman of German descent , pupil of Paul Delaroche , and an illustrator of extraordinary facility , whose illustrations of Grimm 's household tales may survive in the memory of many ; and his Prisoner of Gisors , engraved by the Art Union of London , a powerful romantic work , will be known to more as one of the most notable works of that epoch . In those days , when we had no great luminary in popular art like Millais , and sensations for the great public were rare , the Prisoner of Gisors was a great success . It was painted entirely in two days . Wehnert was a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work was over , to take a block home with him , and complete a design in the evening . His brain could not support the demands he made on it , and he paid in an early death , his intellect as well as his physical strength all gone , the penalty for his mental excesses ; an instance of how the world often gets the least result from its best material . Wehnert had technical powers of a very high order which the public never called for , and which his narrow circumstances left him no leisure to apply gratuitously , as he would gladly have done . He was but one of the many examples which acquaintance with the inner life of the artist race uncovers to us , of genius buried under daily wants . In his general knowledge of art in its highest forms I have never known an English artist his equal . His life hid a sad romance , the story of which he carried to his grave . In pursuit of the principal object of my journey , I spent most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not in nature what Ruskin 's encomiums had led me to anticipate , had , especially the water-colors of the middle period , a powerful fascination for me . I hunted them out in every collection or dealers ' stock in which they appeared ; the most constantly visited amongst them being the gallery of Mr. Griffiths , Turners own dealer , to whom he sent all the pictures which he wished to sell , reserving for his gallery in Queen Anne Street the major part , which even then he intended for the nation , and which , with others , are now in the National Gallery . Griffiths was a worshiper of Turner 's art , and seeing my enthusiasm he made me welcome always , and told me of anything of Turner 's momentarily visible ; so that in my residence in London I probably saw more of the artist 's work than the generality of his English admirers had seen . His delight in any genuine appreciation of the master was charming , and it seemed as if he regarded himself as born to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , and he attributed his success to Turner 's patronage and advice never to buy a picture to sell again , but to make it an invariable rule to sell on commission , and only really good pictures . He used to tell me with great reserve and a diplomatic manner , as if Turner were only to be spoken of by stealth , many anecdotes of his life . James Lenox , of New York , had , he related , a great desire to purchase the Old T*m*raire , and offered Turner for it ? 5000 , which the artist refused , when Lenox offered him a blank check , which he as decidedly pushed back . Several of his countrymen , who had subscribed a sum of ? 5000 to purchase several of the pictures in his own gallery for the national collection , hc as decisively refused , adding , however , " But the nation shall have them , all the same . " Griffiths said to me that he would not hesitate to offer , if it were not futile , ? 100,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered avaricious ; and Wehuert , who had once lived in a house adjoining his , told me that he sometimes came home with a single herring for his dinner , and cooked it himself . Of course I was desirous to meet the great man face to face , and speak to him , but even Griffiths did not venture to give me an introduction . Turner 's nominal residence was in Queen Anne Street , where he was never to be found except by appointment on business , his real residence being an obscure and dingy house in Chelsea , which only his most intimate associates knew , and where he would not be visited . Where and when he painted his pictures at that time no one seemed to know , but they were so far completed on the varnishing days of the Academy that they were said to come in only sketched out , and were often entirely changed on those days . His rapidity of execution was something unequaled in the records of // modern art , and few of the old masters , even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary , and Creswick told me a very characteristic case of it . Creswick had sent to the Academy exhibition a sea-side picture - a waste of sandy shore , the surf coming in with a sea-wind and rain , and , amidst the sedge , a horse .. Something was wrong with the horse , but no one at the moment could tell , and it was finally decided to ask Turner to come in and criticise it . Creswick found him in one of the galleries at work on his picture . He had only passed through the room where the Creswick hung , and apparently without looking at anything in it ; but when Creswick asked him to come and tell him what was the matter with his picture , he replied , " Turn him round , " which was the solution of the puzzle ; for the painter had never noticed that a horse always stands with his tail to a rainstorm . As I was overlooking some drawings by Turner at Griffiths , one day , a tall , spare , blonde gentleman entered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a little conversation with Griffiths , came over , and began to talk of them to me in a manner that showed his great familiarity with them and Turner 's work in general . When he left I asked Griffiths who he was , and he replied , with a look of great glee at the surprise in store for me , " Ah ! that s the Oxford Graduate . " I was surprised , for the Boanerges pungency of the Modern Painters had given me a very different ideal of Ruskin , whose manner was as quiet and undogmatic as that of a well-bred woman . Nothing could be less like the savage and withering criticisms I had read in his book than the gentle , questioning manner of discussion which was the man 's real habit . This was the beginning of a long friendship , which lasted , with not infrequent correspondence , for twenty years . I received an invitation to visit him in his charming home at Denmark Hill , where from the drawingroom windows one could then look out on the Surrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superb collection of Turner drawings . He is still , and may he long be , of the living and here , " di lo non ragionam . " One day I got a long note from Griffiths , saying that Turner was coming to the gallery on business the next morning , and that if I could arrive some time before the hour appointed for his visit I might stay in and see him ; but he was very much annoyed at having people come there when he did . I was there , of course , early , and as it was understood that when Turner was expected no one should be admitted just previously , I was alone in the gallery with Griffiths , when the porter ushered in a very little man , with an old-fashioned black coat and tall hat , slightly corpulent , carrying himself curiously erect , as if he were determined not to lose a fraction of an inch of his diminutive stature , with his brows thrown forward , a clear , bright eye , and a snappish gleam in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eagle . He was not in good humor , evidently , and Griffiths saw it , but he had determined to give me a pleasure I had longed for even at the risk of disturbing Turner 's temper . So he bearded the lion , calling me up and introducing me as a young American artist who had come to England to study his pictures , and would be glad , before leaving , to take him by the hand . I naturally stepped forward and put out my hand , at which Turner , with a malicious air , put his hand behind him , looking me squarely in the eyes . Confused and entirely disconcerted at the rudeness , I turned away , and went back to the pictures , paying no more attention to Turner . When I looked at him again he held out his hand , smiling , and with a hearty hand-shake we made acquaintance , talking of his pictures , and // especially of those of a period of which Mr. Lenox had bought a fine example . " Ah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish they were all put in a blunderbuss and fired away . " He would say nothing of painting or of his preferences amongst his works , and on the whole his manner was one of extreme modesty in speaking of himself or them . Finally Griffiths , and not Turner , reminded me that " Mr. Turner had business to transact , " whereupon the artist gave me another cordial hand-shake and good-by , and begged me , if I came to England again , to come and see him . But his manner of discourse was so laconic that I had some hesitation in so interpreting his words , which , literally as I can transcribe them , were thus : *nod , looking me pleasantly in the face ) " Well - come to England again " ( nod , nod , another hand-shake , nod ) . When I saw Griffiths , next day , he seemed overjoyed at my reception by the master . He had never , he said , known him to treat but one man so cordially as he had me , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came in , was in a furious temper , and fully expected him to insult me , and was immensely surprised and delighted at the turn things took . I was to leave London in a few days for America . If the interview and invitation had but been earlier I might have seen the old painter where few men have seen him , at home . He was dead before I came back to England again . The year I was in London was the last in which his works were in the Academy exhibition , and I saw them fresh from the retouching of varnishing day , vague , luminous , splendid in color , space , and air . I have seen them since , mere wrecks , the lights gone black , the shadows chilled , the transparent color grown opaque and dead , and in the whaling subjects , the composition scarcely recognizable . He refused to sell them even from the exhibition , though offered $6000 for the four small canvases . Pictures which had left the Academy unsold he declined to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old T6nn4raire , he replied , " You might have bought it from the 4cademy for ? 250 , and would n't , and you ca n't have it now . " One is not surprised that the public was indifferent to such pictures as Caligula 's Bridge , and others of its class , for even Ruskin never understood their merits , and called them " nonsense pictures ; " but that the superb Crossing the Brook and Old T*m*raire should have gone out of the exhibition unsold is stupefying , and would be incredible were it not that Watts 's pictures , the only work of the day in England worthy the same regard as Turner 's , are treated as Turner 's were fifty years ago , - reverenced by the wise and sympathetic few , and absolutely ignored by the picture buyers , even by the dealers , just as his great contemporary , iVIillet , was in France . As for Turner 's most advanced pictures they could not have been appreciated by any considerable public , and it is improbable that they ever will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Apollo Seizing the Python , the grandest , me judice , of all his compositions , though of his middle period , is blackened , cracked , and more obscured than a picture of the fifteenth century . Most of the oil pictures are injured , some quite ruined , while the water-colors are rarely much changed except for a certain character of age which comes to watercolor . But Turner was a water-color painter ; he never learned properly to use oils . He was forever experimenting , and it is only by chance that a picture was painted in so solid a manner as to have preserved its best qualities to our time ; so that the best of the oil pictures do not , and probably when finished did not , suffice to give a complete estimate of the art of Turner . Of his intellectual power and imaginative intensity we can only get an adequate idea by // the Apollo , the Hesperides , and the compositions of that class , and of these not one remains so little changed as to give us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get even of the pictures of Titian ; while the full knowledge of his power as a colorist can even now only be obtained from his watercolors of about 1840 to 1850 , - for his art made continual progress while his faculties were unimpaired . Turner was certainly one of the most remarkable examples of the contradictions of human nature on record . iNot only do his parsimony and munificence , his outrageous bearishness and the attachment he inspired in some of his friends , stand in strong contrast , but the intellectual elevation and extraordinary sense of beauty and refinement in his works is in inexplicable antagonism with the gross and almost incredible sensuality and brutality of the man . The reconciliation of his life and works will be an eternal puzzle for the philosopher and student of iesthetics . If there were any relation between art and life , certainly in the case of Turner , whose artistic powers were the most lofty and intense as well as the most inTdividual the history of art can point to , we might hope to see the reflex of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man we have , unfortunately , almost no data . The only considerable correspondence he ever had was with the person known as Mrs. Booth , who was his housekeeper and mistress , and the letters were lost to us by the stupid and unfortunate threat of one of the artist 's executors to take them from her by process of law , if she did not give them up , on which she at once threw them into the fire . Turner appeared so strong and cleareyed when I saw him , there was such a vivacity in his movements , his eye flashed so as he looked from Griffiths to me when I was introduced , like an eagle at two assailants , that death seemed years removed . Certainly the vigor of his execution in his last pictures , the curious audacity with which he turned accidents of the material into details , was not inferior , in the power shown , to any kind of his work . But in the year following he died - like Titian , not too soon to show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as to leave us to lament the cessation of an unique art before it had done its best and begun to show symptoms of decay . Not his eye nor his hand , but his purpose , had come to its decline , and his latest work shows a want of serious iutention which is not visible in the work of 1840 . I am glad to have seen the old man and touched the most magic-working hand of my time , if not of all time . Virgilium vidi tantum , but even that glimpse was something to cherish in my memories of old London . The Londoner of that day was in general a rude and ill-mannered cub , of whichever sex . The Englishman of breeding and travel was then , as now , the first of his kind , the most courteous and chivalric of Aryans ; but the average John Bull and his wife and children had seen little of foreigners and thought every departure from English ways and appurtenances a violation of the mutual obligations of a related humanity . It was prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English homestayer had no knowledge of the manners or apparel of the stranger , and hardly admitted him within his gates . My Spanish cloak , shelter in many a winter 's storm at home , was the signal when I went out in London for a running fire of jeers and gibes , and , with a blue cloth cap in place of the imperative stove-pipe hat of those days in England , made me sufficiently conscious that I was a stranger in the land . " Hi , Bill ! " sings out one of the younger roughs , " here goes King Edward ! " at which Bill was in the habit of responding , " Lii ! hi ! " with a derisory yell from all the accompanying embryo // ruffians . Various and numerous were the salutations of this unkempt world as I came and went ; and as I had a custom of dining in Whitechapel Saturday and Fulham Sunday , I saw the longest dimension of London every week , and tried the temper of the citizen in his various wards with frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one went the further one got from anything resembling sweetness and light . There were sections where I dared not venture , for the swarming insolence of the juvenility on the sidewalk brought up the windows of the densely populated alleys , and this led to demonstrations which may have been jocular , but were more likely to become larcenous , and which quickly ended my explorations . I asked a policeman one day which was the most dangerous quarter of London , and he replied , " Oh , for a policeman Leman Street , " and he mentioned in particular a narrow street , the name of which I have forgotten , and which has now disappeared . I tried it on a bright spring day , but beat a retreat in less time than I had expected , even with the policeman 's warning . The vixenish and rtiffianly faces that saluted me from the windows , and some of which followed their gibes into the street so quickly as to indicate the intention of putting acts in the forefront , led me to prefer the more spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles of the playful youth did me no harm , and their guying was quite as innocuous ; but the sudden emergence of various indurated-looking individuals where no man was before visible , and the jocular salutations they made me , such as , " Hi , Frenchy ! " and " I say , guv'ner , ca n't ye give us a shillin ' ? " or , I d like to drink yer ealth , sir , " said in a very confident and familiar way , with similar bits of information , proved to me that there was no wisdom to be got there that would not cost more than it was worth to me . The old Seven Dials was a den of filth and drunkenness , and in some of the narrow streets which radiated from it or crossed the main avenues , like a huge spider web , it was uncomfortable as well as unsafe to go at midday , unless accompanied by a policeman ; indeed , the whole region between there and Soho was grewsome to pass through . And not always was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite amusement of the population , and woe to the curious man who went staring about and betraying a newness to the place . Great cities quicken the wits of their denizens , and of the lower classes the lower wits . They twig the foreigner or the provincial by the wag of his head , even if he speak not , and recognize the unhabituated by his curious look at the windows as he passes by . The saying of the Yorkshire man , when seeing a stranger pass through his village , - " A stranger ! eave arf a brick at him , " - has become a standing joke , but it is probably only a survival of the manner in which the eighteenth-century Briton regarded all foreigners , and which is still seen in the contempt of the lower classes for everything foreign , and the overweening sense which even some of the better classes entertain of a definite and demonstrable superiority to all the world beside . Now they are used to beards and mustaches and foreign fashions of dress , but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear - disparaging and insulting remarks from people of the middle classes when a person appeared invested with a noticeable peculiarity ; and these things were said as one would make comments on the cattle or horses that passed by , as if the speakers could not possibly entertain the idea that they could be offensive to the objects of them . The lady whose family I visited at Whitechapel had some occasional knowledge of Americans , and one day , offering to introduce an Eng // lish friend who was going out to America to an American lady who was to be a passenger on the same ship , was surprised at the offer being declined . When she persisted in urging it , the English emigrant lady replied , " But you know it is useless , as I can not speak a word of American . " The great Exhibition broke down this Chinese wall , and to a certain degree made the English people understand that a foreigner did not come into the country merely to be insulted and to make fun for the superior nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to go too far . I remember a story of secession times which was told me by a Western bishop of the American Episcopal Church , who came on a mission , Seward regnante , to endeavor to influence the public opinion in England through churchmen , and accordingly urged all the well-known considerations on one of his fellow bishops of the English Church , who , after hearing them all , replied , " But , my dear brother , Providence evidently intended you to be different nations , for it put the Isthmus of Darien between , you ; " and this was after the war had been for some time occupying the eager attention of En gland . I was frequently asked where I had learned English , and whether there were many people in America as white as I was ; and the post-office refused point blank to send my letters to San Francisco via New York , as the San Francisco mails went by way of South America at double the American postage . A well-kuown landscape painter , still living , was discoursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonish me , " Would *you believe that the Thames is from mouth to source above one hundred and fifty miles long ? " " Why , my dear fellow , " I replied , " we have rivers in America long enough to wind round the whole of England and leave enough to tie a good big bowknot . " He looked at me in silent stupefaction for a moment , and then said , " Well , I know you to be a truth-telling man , Stillman , or I should pronounce that what we call an American. * When I left they were just beginning the construction of the World 's Fair building , the preparation and cause of a new era for England . Now it is hard to find a familiar object which has not been converted at least to some new use . The underground railway has undermined the city , and the " American railways " with their horse-cars , so vehemently abused and refused by London for years , traverse all the suburbs . The picturesque river-side London , so full of suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the entire aspect of the river , and every year new green fields are buried in bricks and mortar , and the London fog grows denser and the winter more grim . I have been many times in London since that first visit , and every time I return I recall the strangeness of the life to me as I walked down Holborn , carrying my little leather valise , and how , as I passed through St. Paul 's churchyard , a cockney fellow , going the opposite way with two girls , his friends , and seeing that I was a foreigner , thought to make game of me , English fashion . So , begging me pompously to give him the honor of carrying my valise , and dancing around me in buffoonish entreaty , the girls and he laughed in excruciating merriment , until , I making no reply , but waiting to see the end , they tired . Leaving his hold of my valise the fellow turned to go his way , all the people round laughing too , when , as he committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step after him , and succeeded in somewhat accelerating his leisurely pace . Never turning his head again , the bystanders laughing , and he not , this time , he went straight through the churchyard into Cheapside . I might now walk Cheapside itself in Mohawk costume , // and be only wondered at as an advertisement . Yesterday I walked along a splendid avenue cut through the old dense mass of dingy and crowded tenements of Soho and Seven Dials , one of two crossing in this section . The entire bank of the Thames is changed , but the little penny steamers still run up and down as they used to , the same primitive barges with engines ; the captain still stands on the bridge and calls to the boy at the scuttle , and he again down to the engineer , " Ease her , stop her , back her , " and " Go ahead , " again , as if no call were known . It is curious , this obstinate resistance to all change not forced on the Englishman by competition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds a monopoly of carrying pas* sengers on the river , and till that monopoly is broken we shall go up and down Father Thames , as in 1850 , on a boat without a shelter for.passengers when it rains , and which would not be used in New York harbor for a tug . One must have been here an entire generation to measure conservative England 's prog. ress . Eppur si muove - the ice has broken up , and all England is in motion . W. . J.
