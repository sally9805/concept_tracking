tions of society . We state in generals what he states in particulars ; for he does not shrink from that hard part of his task which consists in specifying the means that people should take to help themselves . He differs from many other philosophers , who have taught us of late , in prescribing work , and a great deal of it , for all classes as the prime agent in the purification of public and private morals . He has very little to say about the amusement of the people , and much about their edification , - about giving them good reading and good preaching ; no doubt he thinks they may be trusted to take all the play they need . He does nothing new , perhaps , in prescribing this regimen for the poor , but he is refreshing in suggesting it for the rich also : he would not have stupid and idle rich people any more than ignorant paupers , and would doubtless think the one class as mischievous as the other . More than once during the magazine publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their author . The phrase probably recommended itself to his critics by its cheapness ; certainly nothing could be more inexact , unless pessimism consists in the recognition of needlessly deplorable conditions , and the expression of a belief that the sufferers have the cure in their own hands . If it is pessimism to show the rich what excellent types of character exist among workingmen and their wives , and to teach the poor how a capitalist may be necessarily their friend , by all means let us have nothing but pessimism hereafter . We shall come to a better conception of each other , and learn to bear and forbear through that desperate doctrine . The essays really most discouraging are those on The Nationals and Sincere Demagogy , from which it appears that those who do most of our voting are not ready to do our thinking to advantage . Yet they are not so much corrupted as stupefied by the leaders who repeat to their credulity the thrice - exploded delusions of the past concerning the inherent virtue and wisdom of the people , the injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital ; who preach their rights and say nothing of their duties . rJ ? these studies are discouraging , because they show us how low the capacity of the masses - the public-schooled masses - still is for right thinking . The writer does not deny their capacity , and perhaps even his distrust of their intelligence may seem refuted just now , when returning prosperity has put us all in good humor with one another , and every one has am parently come to a clearer perception of things . But very possibly he might insist that this was a transitory and illusory appearance ; and that the supine acquiescence of those who confide in it was material for a still more discouraging paper than any he had yet written . THE CONTRIBUTORS ' CLUB . // I print the note just as it was written , for one or two reasons : ( 1 . ) It flatters a superstition of mine that a person may learn to excel in only such details of an art as take a particularly strong hold upon his native predilections or instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine that whilst all the details of that art may be of equal importance he can not be made to feel that it is so . Possibly he may he made to see it , through argument and illustration ; but that will be of small value to him except he feel it , also . Culture would be able to make him feel it by and by , no doubt , but never very sharply , I think . Now I have certain instincts , and I wholly lack certain others . ( Is that " wholly " in the right place ? ) For instance , I am dead to adverbs ; they can not excite me . To misplace an adverb is a thing which I am able to do with frozen indifference ; it can never give me a pang . But when my young lady puts no point after " Mr. ; " when she begins " adverb , " " verb , " and " particle " with the small letter , and aggrandizes " Infinitive " with a capital ; and when she puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am troubled ; and when she begins a sentence with a small letter I even suffer . Or I suffer , even , - I do not know which it is ; but she will , because the adverb is in her line , whereas only those minor matters are in mine . Mark these prophetic words : though this young lady 's grammar be as the drifted snow for purity , she will never , never , never learn to punctuate while she lives ; this is her demon , the adverb is mine . I thank her , honestly and kindly , for her lesson , but I know thoroughly well that I shall never be able to get it into my head . Mind , I do not say I shall not be able to make it stay there ; I say and mean that I am not capable of getting it into my head . There are subtleties which I can not master at all , - they confuse me , they mean absolutely nothing to me , - and this adverb plague is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of grammar , I suppose . I have never seen a book which had no grammatical defects in it . This leads me to believe that all people have my infirmity , and are afflicted with an inborn inability to feel or mind certain sorts of grammatical particularities . There are people who were not born to spell ; these can never be taught to spell correctly . The enviable ones among them are those who do not take the trouble to care whether they spell well or not , - though in truth these latter are absurdly scarce . I have been a correct speller , always ; but it is a low accomplishment , and not a thing to be vain of . Why should one take pride in spelling a word rightly when he knows he is spelling it wrongly ? Though is the right way to spell " though , " but it is not the right way to spell it . Do I make myself un-derstood ? Some people were not born to punctuate ; these can not learn the art . They can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain to its niceties , for these must be felt ; they can not be reasoned out . Cast-iron rules will not answer , here , any way ; what is one man s comma is another man 's colon . One man ca n't punctuate another man 's manuscript any more than one person can make the gestures for another person 's speech . What is known as " dialect " writing looks simple and easy , but it is not . It is exceedingly difficult ; it has rarely been done well . A man not born to write dialect can not learn how to write it correctly . It is a gift . Mr. Harte can write a delightful story ; he can reproduce Californian scenery so that you see it before you , and hear the sounds and smell the fragrances and feel the influences that go with it and belong to it ; he can describe the miner and the gambler perfectly , - as to gait and look and garb ; but no human being , living or dead , ever had experience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Harte 's originality is not questioned ; but if it ever shall be , the caviler will have to keep his hands off that dialect , for that is original . Mind , I am not objecting to its use ; I am not saying its inaccuracy is a fatal blemish . No , it is Mr. Harte 's adverb ; let him do as he pleases with it ; he can no more mend it than I can mine ; neither will any but Boston Girls ever be likely to find us out . Yes , there are things which we can not learn , and there is no use in fretting about it . I can not learn adverbs ; and what is more I wo n't . If I try to seat a person at my right hand , I have no trouble , provided I am facing north at the time ; but if I am facing south , I get him on my left , sure . As this thing was born in me , and can not be educated out of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gentleman picked me up , last week , and brought me home in his buggy ; he drove past the door , and as he approached the circular turn I saw he meant to go around to the left ; I was on his left , - that is , I think I was , but I have got it all mixed up a , ain in my head ; at any rate , I halted him , and asked him to go round the circle the other way . He backed his horse a length or two , put his helm down and " slewed " him to the right , then " came ahead on him , " and made the trip . As I got out at the door , he looked puzzled , and asked why I had particularly wanted to pass to the right around the circle . I said , " Because that would bring me next the door coming back , and I would n't have to crowd past your knees . " Lie came near laughing his store teeth out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right or to the left in going around the circle ; either would bring me back to the house on the side the door was on , since I was on the opposite side when I first approached the circle . I regarded this as false . He was willing to illustrate : so he drove me down to the gate and into the street , turned and drove back past the house , moved leftward around the circle , and brought me back to the door ; and as sure as I am sitting here I was on the side next the door . I did not believe he could do it again , but he did . He did it eleven times hand running . Was I convinced ? No . I was not capable of being convinced - all through . My sight and intellect ( to call it by that name ) were convinced , but not my feeling . It is simply another case of adverb . It is a piece of dead - corpsy knowledge , which is of no use to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it . The fact is , as the poet has said , we are all fools . The difference is simply in the degree . The mercury in some of the fool-thermometers stands at ten , fifteen , twenty , thirty , and so on ; in some it gets up to seventy-five ; in some it soars to ninety-nine . I never examine mine , - take no interest in it . iNow as to " rose up . " That strikes me as quite a good form ; I will use it some more , - that is , when I speak of a person , and wish to signify the full upright position . If I mean less , I will qualify , by saying he rose partly up . It is a form that will answer for the moon sometimes , too . I think it is Bingen on the Rhine who says - " The pale moon rose up slowly , and calmly she looked down , On the red sands , " etc . But tautology can not scare me , any way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a mild form of it can limber up even printed matter without doing it serious damage . Some folks are so afraid of a little repetition that they make their meaning vague , when they could just as well make it clear , if only their ogre were out of the way . Talking of Unlearnable Things , would it be genteel , would it be polite , to ask members of this Club to confess what freightage of this sort they carry ? Some // of the revelations would be curious and instructive , I think . I am acquainted with one member of it who has never been able to learn nine times eight ; he always says , " Nine times seven are sixty-three , " - then counts the rest on his fingers . He is at home in the balance of the multiplication-table . I am acquainted with another member , who , although he has known for many years that when Monday is the first of the month the following Monday will be the eighth , has never been able to feel the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts on his lingers , to make sure . I have known people who could spell all words correctly but one . They never could get the upper hand of that one ; yet as a rule it was some simple , common affair , such as a cat could spell , if a cat could spell at all . I have a friend who has kept his razors in the top drawer and his strop in the bottom drawer for years ; when he wants his razors , he always pulls out the bottom drawer - and swears . Change ? Could one imagine he never thought of that ? He did change ; he has changed a dozen times . It did n't do any good ; his afflicted mind was able to keep up with the changes and make the proper mistake every time . I knew a man - - What are we going to do about finding healthy , natural , improving , but interesting books for young people ? They are so few that if any of the Club can recommend one it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift to a young girl , I took up a certain publication the other day , and when I had read it through laid it down with a sigh of despair : first , for the dishonest reviewers who had recommended it ; next , for the deluded " party " who wrote it . It was in the mode of autobiography , and the heroine , beside being the most insufferable prig possible to manufacture , calmly records all her own Christian graces , her vast superiority to the rest of women , her exquisite beauty and lovely manners , with a coolness that is refreshing to the critical mind , but calculated to afford the worst example for other girls to follow . Precocity , piety , and propriety are the natural breath of this fair being 's existence ; she falls in love , is disappointed , and chronicles it all with a minute vivisection impossible to a modest girl , or a well-bred one . She is inveigled into society , and goes through its ordeal preaching perpetually ; she is beguiled to the opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't like it , and behaving like a lady , she rushes out into the city street , beholds - of course - her beloved passing at the right moment , chases him a long way ( Qu. : Where were the Philadelphia police ? ) , and at last reaches him and gets ho me safely . She survives housework , sick - nursing , poverty , the moral care of a whole village , several spasms of mental agony , and arrives at the age of thirty more beautiful than ever ( oh , how does she do it ? ) , to have her sister die opportunely and leave the man of the maiden 's heart free to marry again . This man - as ineffable a prig , by the way , as his " soul-mate " - comes to the rescue , offers himself at breakfast , marries her the next day , and , having bought her any amount of lovely clothes , carries her off to Europe . Now this book is readable : the author has a nice taste in millinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen eye for natural beauty and a complicated love story always has charms for youth . It is possible , too - indeed probable - that this author has never seen gentlemen and gentlewomen , and naturally can not depict them ; but was it therefore needful to apotheosize furious self-conceit and rampant Pharisaism ? Can not a girl be religious and lovely without telling it all abroad , and snipping and sniffing at her neighbors continuously ? It is really quite as bad as if it were wicked , and calculated to do more harm . Who is // there that will " fall to , " as the fathers used to say , and write us some good , simple , agreeable books for girls or boys , - books in which religion is lived , not talked about , and heroines are not prigs or angels , but real mortal girls ? - Last autumn I visited France , partly with the intention of seeing the country , and partly with a desire to look up certain rather near relatives who resided in Brittany and had corresponded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found my French kindred all very attractive and hospitable ; among them was a gentleman of advanced years who had acquired a fair position in the world of letters . He was a tremendously provincial old gentleman , but on occasions when we discussed together the manners and customs of my native country M. Pierre M had it in his power keenly to amuse me by many of his earnest and well-meant questions . A month or two after my return to New York , I received a manuscript tale of American life from M. M s pen , which he courteously requested me to translate and publish on these shores . My kinsman declared that he had drawn the local coloring of his story half from books and half from general hearsay regarding the society of which it treated . He seemed immensely sure of its exact fidelity to existing facts . The following fragmentary translation , made by myself , will serve as an example of the work - " Some years ago , a young American gentleman , who was by profession a carpenter , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , with an expression of profound disappointment on his manly , handsome face . The name of this gentleman was George Jones . His dress was what in Europe would have been called somewhat shabby , but it was necessary that he should appear during the day-time in clothes whose texture would resist the wear and tear of his arduous manual occupation . He was not rich , and of course this fact stood against him ; but the liberal social laws of his country nevertheless permitted him to occupy a good position among people far his superiors in worldly wealth , since he was known to he sober , honest , and of painstaking industry . " To-day , as we have said , he was not at work , and indeed he seemed in no mood for anything save gloomy meditations . The most luxurious and spacious private hotels of which Canal Street can boast surrounded him on every side . Sumptuous carriages were constantly passing , and occasionally the occupants of these would bow to him with friendly recognition , while the young carpenter lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly ascended the high flight of stone stairs which led to the main entrance of one very imposing hotel . He then rang the bell , and his summons was soon answered by a large negress in a picturesque turban of red and yellow silk , with massive gold earrings . Instead of requesting to see the master or mistress of the house , he boldly asked for a young unmarried lady , whom he mentioned as Miss Louisiana . ' The servant at once replied that Miss Louisiana was at home , and led the visitor through a spacious hall , where a marble fountain was playing , whose base was curiously adorned with has-relief sculptures taken from scenes in the history of California and other American provinces . From this hall Jones was conducted into a broad saloon , furnished in many gaudy colors , and hung with paintings whose subjects , all more ambitious than their execution , were extremely patriotic in character . One picture dealt with the famous assassination of President Jeremiah Lincoln in the loge of a theatre at Maryland , Delaware . Another showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , while a third exhibited General Washington , surrounded by his favorite marshals , crossing // the ice-blocked Mississippi in the midst of January . " Jones did not wait long in this finely embellished apartment . A young lady presently entered , and extended toward him both hands in delighted welcome , while her visitor stole a kiss from her smiling , upraised lips . The lady was Miss Louisiana Smith . She did not look more than eighteen years old , and was dressed with great richness . You saw at once that her well-cut garments were of foreign importation . In person she was slender and graceful , and though her figure lacked the rounded symmetry of our own countrywomen , her face was fresh and blooming to a delicious degree . " My dear Louisiana , ' said George Jones , when the lovers had seated themselves , I have called to tell you that I can no longer endure this suspense . You know , my dearest , the custom of our country . When , after a sufficient number of private visits upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage , and she has decided that he is the man of her choice , it is her duty to acquaint her parents with this fact , and to ask that they will sanction her betrothal . As you possess but a single parent , tell me , my love , whether you have yet informed your father that we desire to marry. * " I have spoken to my father , ' replied Louisiana , in fond yet melancholy tones , and he answered me rather sternly , George , that he desired to see you when you next called here . ' " Your father is at home now ? ' " Yes . He will appear presently . I tremble for the result of the interview . I greatly fear that he will oppose our marriage . ' " Shortly afterward Mr. Jonathan S. Smith entered the room . He was a tleman not much over forty years old ; for it is well known that in America marriages are made at a very early age by both sexes . He was dressed with prosperous nicety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weather , and his coarse hands indicated that they had seen active work . Mr. Smith 's early youth had been passed as a daily laborer , but by diligence and perseverance he had amassed a small sum which he had afterwards invested in railroad stocks , ultimately reaping a golden harvest from this lucky step . He now controlled a railroad which extended from the neighboring State of Maine to a portion of Southern America known as Chili . In Chili , where the climate is delightfully genial , Mr. Smith owned a fine estate , to which , during the winter season , he often made brief trips . In common with many Northerners , he was fond of visiting these salubrious latitudes . " Mr. Smith now greeted Jones with a demeanor of marked coldness . A few moments after he had seated himself , however , the gaudy - turbaned negress whom we have before seen appeared with refreshments , consisting of dried maize and a liquor called De Bourbon Whiskie , of which himself , his daughter , and his guest partook with an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed , Mr. Smith addressed Louisiana 's suitor in tones of solemn decision . " My daughter has told me , ' he said , that you have made her a proposition of marriage . But I can not consent to any such arrangement . I have recently received a proposal for Louisiana 's hand from Mr. Powhatan L. Brown . ' " Powliatan Brown ! exclaimed Jones . Why , he s over fifty years old ! ' " Mr. Smith slightly frowned . He is more suited as a match for my daughter , ' was the immediate reply , than any one else in New York . He owns the Massachusetts and Sacramento railroad , besides being descended from one of our oldest Indian families . The mar riage contract is to be signed to-morrow // 1880. like Contributors ' Club . I am sorry to inform you of this fact , sir , but it is my painful duty . ' " Jones rose to his feet , with an indignant flush on his honest face . And yet this is called a country , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to exist 1 ' " He soon afterward took an agitated departure from the house , leaving Lou-* isiana in hysterical tears . But he felt certain that their last meeting had not yet arrived ; nor was he mistaken . He received a note that same evening from Miss Smith , in which she avowed her desire to meet him , between the hours of ten and eleven , on a beautiful esplanade jutting into the waters of the Hudson River , and known as the Battery . This intention on Louisiana*s part by no means shocked Jones ; for it is the custom of the most elegant and refined American ladies to walk the streets of their native cities at all hours of the day and night , wholly unattended , running no danger of insult , on such occasions , from those whom they chance to encounter . " Jones of course appeared at the place of rendezvous . One of those sudden and well - known changes in the American climate had recently sprung up , and as the lovers met face to face each shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sweeping across the river straight from the icy regions of Labrador and British America . " I shall never become the wife of Powhatan IL . Brown ! ' exclaimed Louisiana , in passionate tones , after her lover had greeted her . I would far rather appeal , dear George , to the Congress of my country against this unfatherly piece of tyranny ! And I shall certainly do so , unless you are willing that I elope with you this very night and become your wife at once ! " The story now grows even more wonderful , though perhaps less pungently interesting to any resident of New York who may read it for its photographic realism in the description of local metropolitan life . The lovers are secretly married that same night , and soon afterward take voyage on a sailing vessel for Cuba , where , after " a delightful trip of two days " ( ! ) , they prepare to spend the honeymoon . Here a most remarkable circumstance occurs . At Havana they fall in with an " elderly Indian lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady originally belonged to one of the " semi-civilized Utah tribes , " but with the exception of a feather head-dress and a quaint bead necklace she shows no traces of barbaric origin . Becoming greatly attached to Louisiana , she tells Jones 's young bride the story of her previous life . The result is a perfect bomb-shell of discovery for both George and Louisiana ! Their new friend was wooed and won , years ago , by a gentleman who had visited the remote settlement where she dwelt . After their marriage , the happy pair lived for several years in various portions of the country , and at length her husband wearied of her and shamelessly deserted her . She bore with the injustice , however , and refrained from exposing it among her husband 's relatives in New York . Assuming her family name , she had ever since been known as " Mrs. Iroquois " ( ! ) , and had lived a restless , wandering life , being possessed of a sufficient inheritance to support herself in moderate comfort . Mrs. Iroquois still loves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being reclaimed as his wife . At the end of her mournful narration , this ill-fated lady confides to Louisiana the name of her heartless spouse . He is none other than Powhatan IL . Brown ! A letter is immediately forwarded to Mr. Jonathan S. Smith , who extends a gracious pardon to his daughter and his new son-in-law , on learning these facts concerning the man whom he had so tyrannically commanded Louisiana to // marry . The happy couple return to New York , and are received by Mr. Smith with open arms . Brown 's unprincipled behavior is exposed , and he is forthwith socially disgraced . This unique tale now ends with the following delicious paragraph - " Mr. Smith soon afterward issued cards for a grand soirie in honor of his reconciliation with George and Louisiana . The mansion in Canal Street was made the scene of splendid festivity . The rooms were thronged with smiling guests , among whom were the president of the republic and many distinguished deputies from surrounding departments . All the wealthiest shop - keepers and speculators were present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wept tears of joy , as he watched his wife move here and there amid the brilliant assemblage , on this eventful and commemorative evening . Louisiana was the centre of a congratulatory group of friends , and George himself was frequently embraced with effusion by many of his fellow-craftsmen , to whom Mr. Smith had graciously extended invitations . The company was of a sort which America alone could have gathered together . Here the banker was found in conference with the wineseller , the tailor in close companionship with the bishop or cure . And as for George and Louisiana , it would be difficult to say whether the future of bride or bridegroom was more envied by those who had met to wish them joy on their altered fortunes . " - What a curious likeness there is between people and the numeral Arabic figures . I know some one whom 7 represents to my mind far better than his photograph , and a woman who recalls 2 to my consciousness ; 3 is a child with an unchild-like character , well known to me also ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't an idea why this is thus , but I should like any one else s ideas on the subject , much . - As an exper:enced Yankee , to the manner born , I can throw light on the use of " likely " as a term of praise in the rustic dialect of New England forty or fifty years ago . It came home vividly to my small-boyhood in hearing my own father ( who had died young ) eulogized among mine honest neighbors as " the likeliest that ever was raised . " I took their meaning perfectly at once , from the proper sense of the word , that is probable ( future ) ; whence , promising . That the latter was their intent , in this absolute use of the word , is evident from the fact that they applied it almost , if not quite , always to beimgs with a future implied . A likely girl , a likely calf , etc. , were stereotyped phrases of commendation . A likely woman or cow came in with vague transition , by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman would have been a solecism or a pleasantry. - Are " gents " who wear " pants " really sinners above all the Galileans ? They are cordially hated , it is plain , by certain writers ; but this hatred commonly manifests itself in intellectual spasms , and spasms are so apt to be irrational and unnecessary that they do not prove much . When a word presents itself as a plain abridgment of an unquestioned older form , comes into wide commercial and colloquial use , is not innately vulgar , and does not violate any recognized law of word-making , why need one shudder at its introduction into literature ? Language was made for man , not man for language ; and philology and spelling reform will strive in vain for the introduction of " reforms " whose usefulness and convenience can not be made evident to the mass of those who write and read the language for practical purposes ; but serviceable and reasonable modifications will be made in the future , as they have been made in the past , without reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing would induce us , for // instance , to restore the silent letters which have been dropped already , and doubtless we shall go on dropping other useless characters . iNo one now writes to day or to morrow , and few people write some thing or some body ; instead , we use to-day , to-morrow , something , somebody , and that we shall eventually come to use today and tomorrow is clear from the increasing frequency with which those forms are even now seen in carefully conducted journals . This process of combining and condensing has taken place in many words . Similar in character is the suppression of the period signifying abbreviation . Per cent is now common , and such forms as Kr , Dr , and Rev are receiving the sanction of use by writers who can not be accused of either ignorance or carelessness . A poet may safely , even creditably , call a gentleman a " gentle . " " Gent . " is a satisfactory term for genealogical purposes ; why may we not go a step further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " draw it so mild " about Young Mrs. Jardine , and how dare you call it a " truly feminine book ? " Do you think any woman of even ordinary sense would not abhor that nauseous and sloppy fellow who is the hero , or despise the female prig he marries ? The book is like a dish of boiled greens , or a suet pudding , - slippery , tasteless , sweetish , and unwholesome . There is not a lady in its pages , nor yet a man , and the sickly sentiment , the weakness , the general idiocy of the whole atmosphere , makes one fairly angry at a criticism that only " Damns with faint praise . " - I too must try for the epigram , in a converse sort of way - Mind your own business , and you quickly find You ye all the business that you well can mind . - It seems to me that the word gent , which is criticised by a contributor to the March Atlantic , has two distinct applications . One is its use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other its characterization of a particular class of men . However much we may regret to see " the line old name of gentleman " ruthlessly razeed , it is the fate of all words that prove too long for the rapid requirements pf business . These having long ago abbreviated cabriolet into cab and caravan into van , it is no wonder that in the increased mercantile value of time and breath the gentleman should dwindle into the gent . Doubtless the average shop-keeper does not realize the violence which such a change does to the significance of words and the sensitiveness of the lover of English undefiled . But business is business , and word-clipping may be essential to success in it , in these hurried days . Mr. Bartlett , in his Dictionary of Americanisms , gives gent as an abbreviation of gentleman , but it has been reserved for the Slang Dictionary to define its precise position in the scale of descent . Gent is said by this authority to be " a contraction of gentleman in more senses than one , - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , who vulgarizes the prevailing fashion . " As the gent is thus a product and representative of certain social conditions , there is a certain fitness in the word which characterizes him . Being only a nominal part of a gentleman , it is well to have his name bear witness to that fact . Language , even in its corruptions , thus becomes the guardian and vehicle of truth . Lord Campbell , in his little book on Shakspeare 's Legal Acquirements , calls lay gents " all except lawyers . " Unless the chancellor intended , in this use of the word , to abbreviate the gentleman , or to rival the humor of the comic Blackstone , he must have had a strange misconception of the nature of the superiority of the legal fraternity to the rest of mankind . A witticism of Count d ' Orsay illustrates the significance of the word gent // better than some graver expositions . The story is that he and Tom Allen went to dine at the house of a Hebrew millionaire , and on their arrival overheard one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gents are come . " " Gents ! " echoed Allen . " What a wretched low fellow ! It 's only worthy a public-house . " " I beg your pardon , " replied the count , " it is quite correct . The man is a Jew . He means to say the Gentiles have arrived ; gent is short for Gentile . " his few d'esprit , as the narrator wickedly calls it , had truth as well as wit , for Gentile , from the Latin gens , has the same origin as gentleman . The word gent formerly did duty as an adjective , old English writers using it to express the softer qualities of the female sex . A " lady gent , " instead of being a lady 's man or coxcomb , was an elegant or gentle lady . Doubtless , an element of softness is associated with gent as a noun , bu.t , being connected with the head rather than the heart , the perpetuation of the quality can hardly be considered desirable . - There is a reward of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must mention it . Let me give an illustration : A boy was at work in a lumber mill in the backwoods . Two other boys were his comrades . At night it was their amusement , in the shanty where they had their rations , to read the magazines . A Mooseliend Journal , 1-Jave we a Bourbon among us ? and Bartleby the Scrivener were just out then . These and other articles were read with that interest , curiosity , and wonder which they are calculated to inspire in youthful minds . The men who could write such articles were regarded with a degree of respect which belongs properly to beings who are above our common humanity . The inspiration of these readings and the influence of the articles were felt by others who borrowed the magazines . The history of the various writers and their peculiarities were inquired into by the boys . It came to be the prevailing ambition to excel in literature . There were in this particular instance some queer things done in the way of writing stories , essays , and poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the seeds of true culture were none the less sown , and have sprung up , and are now bearing fruit to some extent in that neighborhood and elsewhere . And now in respect to the particular kind of reward which I have in mind : the boy in the lumber camp or shanty first mentioned made his way to college , and then to a good business , continuing all the while as a recreation to write for the newspapers and minor periodicals ; and at last , in middle life , he reached the glory of some four or five sketches in the leading literary magazine of his time and country . When he was first admitted to the pages which he had from boyhood regarded with such profound respect , his reward , I venture to say , was , in kind , the greatest that literary success ever confers . His own immediate and intense satisfaction was a part of the benefit . The skill he had gained with his pen was a grace and ornament and crown to his business life . This crown may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be lightly regarded by those who know the value of the combination of business and literature here set forth . In looking over the index of a leading literary magazine for a dozen years , many names will be found of those who have written three or four articles , - and that is all we know about them . The articles are good and worthy of the place given them . It is , I think , safe to say that the real rewards of literature have been gained by the unknown persons who are the authors of these articles . Each of them probably seemed to himself to walk upon the atmosphere for a week or two when first accepted ; each of them had a following of personal friends , and perhaps relatives , who valued the authorship of these articles very highly . // 1880 . The Contributors ' Club . The boy above mentioned , who received his first literary impulse from hearing the magazines read in the lumber shanty , is one of the " unknowns ; " but his business acquaintances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is the author of a few simple sketches which reached so high a place as the brightest success of his life . Years of hard and prosperous work in an hon*-orable calling are overlooked , or taken as a matter of course , while this trifling literary success is regarded as somehow a remarkable achievement . On visiting his college , after an absence of years , he found that the college officers and his old friends returning on Commencement Day knew nothing of his business life , but were well aware of the sketches , and congratulated him upon their success . The amusing side of this friendly following was seen when a comrade of the old magazine days in the lumber shanty sincerely hesitated to claim acquaintance with one who had " grown so great " with his pen . There may be literary people who will scoff at these things ; but I am persuaded that those who bear the really great names in letters will always look with kind and tender interest upon these little reputations of which I am writing . Doubtless the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their literary labor was inspired with a grand enthusiasm . I think they fondly remember the freedom of being an " unknown . " To be chained to a reputation may have some disadvantages . Those who give their lives to literary labor realize that they are paying a large price for something , whatever it is . Success as well as failure has its drawbacks if literature is made a profession . Only last week Fenimore Cooper 's son was telling me that his father 's interest in novel-writing had ceased long before he ceased to write novels . He had adopted that work as his calling , and continued it simply because it was his business , and perhaps because it was expected of him . He would probably have preferred other work . I think a pretty good case is made out by these facts in support of the claim that the little reputations in literature confer the greater amount , and perhaps an equal degree , of happiness . Of course we , " the unknowns , " would be quite willing at any time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change the fact that our present reward is very great , - and there are so many of us that our felicity in the aggregate probably exceeds that of the great writers . - To mention dreams seems to threaten the Club reader with the garrulous relation of visions more or less common to all experience , and consequently more or less uninteresting to all ; but I have no dreams to narrate which I fancy at all remarkable ; only an inquiry to make , to which I should be glad of an answer . Whether there be any answer to be given , even by those who have studied the phenomena of dreaming , is , however , quite doubtful . The question is simply , What causes the recurrence of a certain kind of dream during a period , it may be , of some years , to the exclusion of almost every other form of dreaming , more especially when there is nothing in the circumstances of the dreamer 's life to impres* this particular shape upon his " unconscious cerebration , " which I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether this recurrence of a special style of dream for a long time is a common experieuce or not ; I have never heard any one mention it as a familiar one ; but it is a noticeable characteristic of my own dreaming habits . I seldom dream pleasantly , and as*far as I can remember my bad dreams have been mostly confined to some three or four forms of disagreeability ; one form prevailing for a term of years , to be succeeded by another form which seemed to drive out the earlier from possession of // the brain . The first vision I can recall was not strictly that of dreaming , but the remarkable thing was its continual recurrence . As a child , living in a place where I was subjected to malarial influences , I had occasional attacks of fever and ague , when I vi*as always " lightheaded . " In that condition I invariably suffered in a way impossible to describe further than by saying that I shrank in horror from the inevitable oncoming of a vast , impalpable something that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enormous airy billows . I used to flee to my parents for refuge from this airy nothing , and vainly try to tell them what it was like . I was interested to find , long after , in Kinglake 's Eothen an account of an almost precisely similar vision of horror he became familiar with during the delirium of a fever . I doubt if any one not acquainted with the experience would make much out of the author 's attempt to describe something too vague to be well describable . IBut I have sometimes thought my vision and Kinglake 's would have been congenial material for De Quincey 's imagination to work upon , its very vagueness leaving him free to dilate the theme to the most wondrous and terrific proportions . In childhood , the dream that nightly disturbed me was a quite commonplace one , - the apparition of a tall , whiteclothed figure encountered suddenly at the turning of long corridors , the glimpse of whose shadowy shape at a distance thrilled me with ghostly terror . This figure , having predominated in my dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period the tormentors of my repose were the more palpable , but none the less alarming , shapes of armed men , who , sometimes heralded by martial noises , sometimes approaching with awful , silent tread , passed in procession to the house where I was concealed , prone upon the floor or crouched cowering in corners , in the frenzied endeavor to keep out of the range of sight of the windows through which the death shot was to strike me . Since the departure of these threatening personages who for so long had made the night a veritable reign of terror , the troubles I have undergone have been of a more every-day sort , the pressure and perversity of circumstance ; but worse than any such practical difficulties could possibly be in actual life , because of the absence of the reasoning faculty , the judgment which with the trouble often points the way of escape . In the dream , too , there is always that mixture of the improbable and unnatural which sometimes relieves , but quite as often complicates , the situation of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad trains which are so oddly constructed and conducted as to place me in most distressing and perilous positions ; they move in extraordinary ways , cause unforeseen and unprovided-for emergencies , and perplex me continually by their behavior . I also go through a great deal in preparing for these journeys , - trunks waiting to be packed , while I search in vain for the contents that should fill them , etc . These three types of dream have been the prominent ones with me since childhood ; and not until one form of distress was become long familiar to me did it pass away for another to take its room . The first two evidently had no relation to experience , and were not suggested by anything in the daily course of events . With regard to the present-prevailing dream , my actual travels have been neither so extensive nor so adventurous as to account for the dream travels . I am curious to know whether this recurrence of the same dream , or the same class of dream , for long periods is a common experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
