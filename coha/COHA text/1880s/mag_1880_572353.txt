WINTERING ON AI*TNA . MORE years ago than I now like to remember , I had my first sight of JEtna . It was from the sea , as we coasted the Sicilian shores on our way to Messina , and I recall how unlike other mountains it looked , rising as it did from a base which seemed to spread over all visible Sicily , till the eye was led up a steeper and steeper ascent to a summit that was lightly touched with snow in the upper sky . The strangeness was partly in the way the slopes were covered with what seemed little volcanoes , which studded the great mass they rose from so thickly that one grew tired of counting them . No mountain has ever so impressed me since , and I looked back at it , regretting to leave it unvisit ed , but hoping to return and study it at leisure . As fate willed , it was unseen by me for many a year after , until , unexpectedly , I lately found myself occupied with a scientific errand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with . Al*tna as my destination . I should have been there in October , and it was now Decen*ber , but in spite of my haste to get on the mountain before the snows covered it , I stopped at Taormina , half-way to Catania ( whence the ascent was to be made ) , to view lEtna from the north . Taormina is built on the southern slope of a spur projecting into the Mediterranean , whose northern ridge , rising a thousand feet above 88 // the sea , is crowned by the ruins of a Grecian theatre . The stream of pleasure travel seems to pass by this wonderfQl coast , so that comparatively few tourists see the shores of Sicily , except from the steamer which takes them to Athens or Alexandria ; but if the reader is among those few , he may remember the view from these ruins at sunrise as one of which the earth can not furnish many . He will remember , perhaps , rising long before daybreak for a solitary climb through steep lanes , half seeing , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started into dim sight spectral figures with outstretched arms , resolved , as he drew nearer , into some overleaning cactus , vaguely outlined overhead against the starry sky . Mounting higher , one comes out from between the overshadowing walls into the moonlight , the waning moon , a crescent in the east , " holding the old moon in her arms , " while , when higher yet , the columns of the ancient proscenium stand out against a faint glow that shows where the sun is yet to rise ; till , passing by these , climbing and groping up the stone benches which once held tiers of spectators , one takes a solitary seat at the summit . Below , the last lights are still twinkling on the coast , but beyond and over the columns , all along the south , rises a dark something , which might be a hundred yards away , but is A*tna , and twenty miles distant . As the dawn grows brighter the outlook extends north and east to Italy , and as the sun makes ready to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further away , and takes on distinctness as it recedes , until we make out the whole form of ? tna , with the outline of the crater and of the snow fields about its summit . These distant snows suddenly changed their gray to a rose pink as they caught the light of the sun before it had risen to me ; but of all that was seen when it came out of the ocean I was most concerned with the mountain itself , which can be viewed better here , as a whole , than from any nearer point . The coast line on the left preserves the level to the eye , but except for this , so wide is the base of Etna that it fills the whole southern landscape , which seems to be tilted upward till its horizon ends in the sky . I could see from here how almost incomparably larger the immense volcano appears than Vesuvius ; and the actual difference is in fact enormous , the height of A*tna being ( if we disregard the terminal cone of each ) nearly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its Italian neighbor . The entire mountain in all its substance is lava , which has built itself up in eruptions ; but from this point the successive zones of vegetation are visible which in the course of ages have in part occupied its surface . Extending to perhaps a fifth of the whole actual height before me ( but covering a great deal more of the foreground in appearance ) is the cultivated region , dotted with villages , which shine out from a background of what we know must be vineyards and olives . The second zone is barren , and in sharp contrast with the former . It rises to perhaps two thirds of the whole height , and its broad masses of gray are patched with moss-like spots hardly distinguishable in color , but which are really forests of oak and chestnut . All above this rose what even from my distant station could be recognized as naked black deserts , streaked here and there with snow , while above this was the terminal cone , snow covered at the time I saw it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin vapor . The railway south of Taormina runs along the coast ( and is carried through cuttings on old lava streams , which here flowed down to the sea ) until it reaches Catania , a city which , as every one knows , is not only built on lava , but which has been cut through and through by lava streams , and shaken down by earthquakes in recent times , // and which lives from day to day at the mercy of its terrible neighbor . The city wears an air of freshness unusual in Europe , for it has been almost wholly rebuilt since the last destruction in the seventeenth century , and with its handsome streets , bright , clean stone fa√ßades , and the bustle of its hundred thousand inhabitants , it seems to belong less to the Old World than to the New . But if new in some respects , it is old in other ways . That faith in the supernatural which is dying out so rapidly elsewhere in Europe - and nowhere more rapidly than in Italy - is lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the place is an outlet of those very infernal regions whose existence some deny , whence come rivers of fire which run through your streets and carry your houses away as water does grains of sand , not to speak of earthquakes which shake the stone walls down on you without warning when you are asleep ; death in sudden forms , for thousands at once , and against which thousands are powerless as one , has come from there before , and will again at some unknown moment , and is an ever-impending terror , against which science is unavailing and man 's strength impotent . Only if the reader has had the fortune or misfortune to experience an earthquake can he know that sense of utter helplessness , that distrust of every accustomed stay , mental and material , when the solid frame of earth is shaken ; for there comes with this earthshake a belief that the order of nature itself is going from under us , and that neither in the moral nor physical world is there anything left to stand on . This may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so ) , but after one brief personal experience I am disposed to confess a doubt whether my reasoned faith in the order and harmony of the universe would last through another ; whether , that is , it would not irrationally yield for a little - let us say while the tremor lasted - to an overwhelming need of something to cling to . At any rate , there is a good deal in Mr. Buckle 's theories , and I do n't wonder that these dwellers on the great volcano trust nature less and the supernatural more ; more than people in the West End of London , for instance , where two or three earthquakes would probably help more to restore old ways of thought in the public Mr. Mallock addresses than the same number of his cleverest essays . The very street carts of Catania are painted in the liveliest colors with devotional subjects . Profane ones sometimes intrude , it is true , but more often we have martyrdoms of the saints , the holy souls in purgatory , or the sufferings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to edification and as calling for a great deal of red and yellow in the flames . The long Strada Etnea , which points straight at the mountain , was gay with these carts when I started , one December day , for the ascent . I had been recommended to lodge during my stay at Nicolosi , the highest village on the mountain ; but beside that it was not high enough for my purpose , I had found it on a previous exploration so uninviting that I had decided on making my quarters in the uninhabited region several hours ' journey further up , where on the property of the Duke of Alva is a mule shed , which from the neighborhood of some chestnut-trees has received the fine-sounding name of Casa del Bosco ; and this was my fiuial destination . I had received contradictory accounts as to the safety of this region , most of them agreeing that , though bandits were a very real danger in Western Sicily , the eastern part of the island was safe . Mr. Marsh , our minister at Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in the desert region unprotected , and his kindness had procured me official recommendations from Rome to the local authorities ; the final advice I received at the consulate being // to accept the guard which would be offered as a courtesy , and to dismiss it if it seemed superfluous . It was to meet me at Nicolosi , to which the carriage road was now climbing with many zigzags . It passes in sight of the place where the great lava stream of two centuries ago turned aside at the intercession of St. Agatha , and a little higher up we drew sensibly near to the Monte Rossi , whence the terrible destruction flowed . They are now two peacefullooking hills above Nicolosi , the terminal village ; where all roads end , all cultivation ceases , and where begins that uninhabited waste , covering an area of something like two hundred square miles , which Etna lifts into the cold upper air from out of the centre of a densely populous and fertile region on the warm slopes below . The day was growing gloomy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine rain . Here I found Giuseppe , at once guide , philosopher , and cook , whom I had engaged during my stay at Casa del Bosco ; and here the mayor or syndic of the town appeared with the soldiers , and made me an address in Italian ( which I unfortunately do not understand ) , and to which I replied , as best I could , in French ( which , I have been sorry to learn since , he does not speak a word of ) . These formalities settled , I mounted a most ungainly mule , and preceded by a train of others , bearing instruments and provisions , with Joseph and two aids leading and two soldiers following , under the admiring gaze of the whole population of Nicolosi , disappeared from their sight , in the mist . The ascent was at first slow and regular , and the feet of our animals sunk deep in powdery lava dust , as we crawled upward . At a dilapidated shrine , whose mildewed saint and half-effaced frescoes represented the last outpost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path was strewn thick with lava lumps , through which the mules picked their way with steady steps . The horizon rose as we ascended , and through occasional openings in the mist we saw it slowly climbing the sides of the Monte Rossi , and finally surmounting them ; but one more volcanic cone , and then another , appeared above us , and was successively overtopped by the stillmounting horizon line , which we still seemed to carry with us , till thicker mist and coming twilight shut out all but the immediate foreground . This consisted of ridges of lava , old streams , which , like glaciers and rivers , rise highest in the middle , but which have cooled so long ago that they have had time to become partly broken . Great masses have fallen off , here and there , from some of the later and harder rivers , each of which has its history of ravage and its name . All these are known to Joseph , who beguiles the way by opening the stores of a wonderful memory , and telling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in former years . Among these I particularly remember her majesty Queen Victoria and the Empress EugSnie , both of whom , Joseph assures me , he personally attended in their ascent of Etna over this very path ; but in spite of the interest such associations ought to attach to it , it grows more and more weary , and the climb has seemed interminable an hour ago , when , with the last twilight of our day , we scramble up the bed of one final lava ravine , and reach Casa del Bosco . It consists , as I had found on a previous visit , of three rooms ( without windows ) , in one of which the horses and mules were stabled ( and made night hideous by their fighting and screaming ) ; on the other side the guard was bestowed ; while in the middle of the floor of the central apartment , which I reserved for myself , Joseph kindled a charcoal fire , over which I tried ineffectually to get warm or dry , till I got a headache which sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments of the room , which consisted of several rather curious printed prayers against earthquakes , stuck up on the lava walls , and one engraving in which the Blessed Virgin was represented as trampling upon an ugly beant with seven heads , which were marked with the names of the seven deadly sins , except that the Catanian artist had characteristically labeled the biggest head , on which the Virgin 's foot was treading , " Al*tna . " So guarded , I lay down , after supper , in the driest corner , and went to sleep to the sound of the rain dripping on the floor , - not uncomfortably ; thinking of a house on the other side of the Atlantic , where certain people would be gathered round the dinner-table , for this was Christmas Day . The next morning brought snow , which did not stay on the ground , but turned to more rain , and I had little to do but to watch the guard eat my macaroni and drink my wine , which latter was done without the help of bottle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps twelve gallons ) high in the air , and letting the contents fall into the open mouth . One or two men , armed with carbines and mounted on horses which seemed to tread with the security of mountain goats , made their appearance during the day , to inquire after my welfare and to drink my health . Joseph calls them forest guards of the Duke of Alva , in whose mule shed I am living on sufferance . There are twenty-four of them , it seems , patrolling the various deserts and forests of the mountain , and an indefinite number may be expected to find Casa del Bosco on their way so long as it holds wine , macaroni , and a simple stranger . These gloomy reflections were aided by a report from Joseph that the barrel was already nearly empty , and that it would certainly be necessary to send down for more wine the next day . Believing that it was at any rate a debatable question whether the brigands , if they came , might not be less expensive than my defenders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to the syndic , thanking him for their services . At night , however , two new ones appeared through the rain to replace them , bringing a message from the syndic to the effect that he was only acting under orders from the prefect of Catania , who had concerned himself in the matter , and who was the person to address . The third morning broke bright and calm ; the rain and mist that walled us in were gone , and as I opened the door my first glance fell through the exquisite transparency of the air , on what seemed to be an adjacent pool , with its water slowly rippling as from a gentle breeze . There was an instant of wonder how I could have passed it unseen , even in the twilight ; when a second look showed that the pond had no further shore , and I saw with a startled sense of strangeness that I was looking at the Mediterranean , in this direction over twenty miles away . The ripples , or ocean waves rather , crawled over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found I was in fact witnessing a phenomenon rare enough to have had its visibility called in question altogether . I did not see it again during my stay , but its visibility appears to depend on the united conditions of a previous easterly gale rolling a swell upon the coast and a clear sunrise filling the valleys between the waves with shadow , and marking their long moving crests with light . The coast was seen for a great distance to the south , a part of ancient Syracuse being visible , while between the foot of the mountain and the sea stretched a great plain with a river running through it . INear the bottom of the mountain the plain rose into steep foothills crowned with villages , whose white square houses on the lava soil looked like dice thrown upon the top of some black pedestals , and among which the // outlines of more than one medheval castle grew afterwards discernible through the telescope . When I try now to recall what struck me most at first , I seem to re-gather the impression that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vastness of the slope of the mountain , beside which Vesuvius , with its railroad and shoals of tourists , is a parlor volcano . Here all is lonely . Below is one volcanic cone upon another ; all around are ridges of black lava . Just behind the hut , on a higher ridge , a pile of snow seems near enough to gather a snow-ball in and bring it back before it melts , but it is eight hours ' journey above us ; and a faint smoke ascending from what looks like a little depression in the summit of the snow heap helps one to realize that it is the terminal cone of . Al*tna , further above our heads than we are above the Mediterranean down there . After looking a while , till the real dimensions of the scene were partly comprehended , I turned to my work . A little later I was disturbed in it by voices , sounding very near and distinct , though no one was visible . I looked for some time in vain for the speakers , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found by measurement ) of over half a mile from me . The voices of the two , in apparently ordinary conversation , continued to reach me , till I asked myself whether I had been gifted of a sudden like Fine-Ear . I think it was this which first drew my attention to the phenomenal stillness of the place , devoid as it is of animal life and deserted of man . This was the only time I remember hearing a human voice except from the visitors to the hut . Here were no tourists , Murray or Baedeker in hand , to invade the quiet ; no song of a wayfaring peasant , no lowing of cattle ; none of that faint , multitudinous hum of insect notes that make an all-pervading something in our own fields , which is hardiy recognized as sound , and yet is 48 not silence . Its entire absence hero shows that one may never have known what real silence is like . When the wind was still , the ear seemed to ache for a sound , and I should almost hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , for instance , I was startled at my work out-of-doors by a noise like that of a fanning close to my ear . I looked round and finally up , discovering its origin in the flapping of the wings of two crows at a great height overhead , every motion of the wings seeming to be repeated at the very ear . This fourth day my diary records that two more soldiers arrived , and that the second barrel began to run low . I sat down and wrote a letter to the prefect , commending the admirable good order of the country under his charge , as rendering the services of the military superfluous , and suggesting their withdrawal . This was sent down by Joseph , who was instructed to deliver it , if possible , to the prefect , in that dignitary 's own person , and to make sure of an answer ; and in the afternoon I started out for a walk . Monte Vittori , one of the innumerable volcanic cones which lay apparently close at hand , was my objective point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was nearly an hour of climbing over the chaotic lava masses , through and across fissures in the old fields , down which later lava streams had flowed , and hardened in falls that made precipices to clamber up , before I reached its foot . In the latter part of the way , I became conscious that I was under the surveillance of a soldier from the hut , who was trying to keep me in sight from a distance without being seen . His orders must have been strict indeed to take him out from his comfortable idleness to a climb ( which every Italian detests ) , and I pushed on , thinking he would give me up and go back . Finally I lost sight of him , and after another half hour of desperate struggle on its smooth , yielding slopes I reached the summit of Monte Vittori . Wintering on ZEtna. // Casa del Bosco had disappeared ; the great white cone above was just us far , or just as near , as ever , and the only new prospect was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian had disappeared also , and convinced that I had beaten him I slid down , reaching in two minutes ' descent the foot I had been thirty in climbing from . After a rest here , turning for one last look at the summit , I saw a figure emerge from the other side above the crest . It was my soldier ! The next day it was the same thing , and I found myself under unobtrusive but constant guardianship when I went a hundred yards from the hut . In the evening Joseph returned , bringing a message to the effect that the prefect was desirous of taking the extremest care of my safety , as a thing precious to him , and that to this end he sent two more soldiers , making four en permanence and six during half the time ! There was nothing for it but resignation and another barrel ; but I then and there issued orders for the regulation of my household , giving Joseph , my majordomo , to understand that the hospitality to wandering forest-guards must have its limits ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine per diem , and no more ; and that no one was hereafter privileged to drink from the barrel except myself . Each day after this passed uneventfully . I was busied with my work , and after it took a ramble for exercise ; after that a solitary dinner , and when the night was cloudy went to bed to pass the time . I recollect views in some of my climbs which exceeded in lonely wildness and strangeness anything else I ever saw on the earth , but strongly resembled certain prospects the moon offers to the student of her surface , when , armed with a powerful telescope , he is transported to the awful solitudes of that dead , alien world . Just such a purely lunar landscape I have often looked at below me on Etna : the long rifts filled with little craters , the loneliness and the silence helping the illusion , till after a time , during which no bee hummed , or fly buzzed , or sight or sound of life appeared at my lonely perch , it was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unearthly . Even at the hut , except for the duke 's guards , who rode up occasionally , there were not many signs that men still lived on the earth . I should except , though , the passage of a muleteer and three mules , in the early dawn , on their way up to the snow-fields ; they came down toward twilight , laden with what looked like packages of dried leaves and straw , in which the snow was bundled , and would keep till it reached Catania the next day , and was sent on thence to Agosta . This was the ice supply not only for Catania , with its hundred thousand inhabitants , but for the towns along the eastern coast , to all of which not only in the winter , but in the torrid heats of their spring , the great white summit of Etna hangs like a cloud in the upper air , tantalizing them with its suggestions of delicious cold . The snow at this time , though it occasionally fell at the Casa , never remained long on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above for their load . The only animals I ever saw besides were sheep in the nearer valleys below , up to which they had been driven for pasturage ; but wolves were plenty , and left their tracks each night in the lava sand by the hut , close to which , ap parently , lay their highway to the food in the valleys below . They are cowardly if alone , but when united in packs and starving it goes badly with the solitary shepherd who meets them in their raids through these places , from which they retreat before daybreak to the still more desert solitudes above . One day , when some leisure had been earned , I started with Joseph at midday for a walk . Our object was to ascend to the base of the snow-fields , and // to enable me to judge for myself how far the ascent to the actual summit would be practicable at another time . We left , after an hour 's walk , most of the scattered chestnut-trees behind us , and then climbed , for hours more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a region almost utterly bare of vegetation , without bringing the great terminal cone much nearer ; we finally reached the source of the snow supply , and then a plateau , whence we could see , over the western shoulder of Etna , a prospect limited only , I think , by the island ; and a wonderful view of mountains it was ! Not in the Alps nor in the " Rockys " have I seen a region more rugged or more savagely desolate than the interior of modern Sicily ; though it is this barren land which was once called " the granary of Europe . " Only to the south and east we saw signs of towns and cities . Fifteen miles away , as the crow flies , in something which looked like a tuft of spear-grass , we recognized the masts of the huddled shipping in the little harbor of Catania . The coast line extended beyond the promontory that bounded it at our lower station , and beyond still another on the south we could catch the glitter of the sunshine on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far below us the snow lay in what looked like patches in the wrinkles of the hills ; but some of them we had passed over , and knew them to be snowfields sheltered in the ravines from the sun . Above us the snow stretched unbroken , but immediately around us it had melted on the powdery black lava , which showed wolf-tracks everywhere . There was no vegetation , except , at rare intervals , a tuft of what looked like the softest grass , springing unexpectedly out of the volcanic soil , and inviting one to a seat , - treacherously , for the " grass " is ifiled with fine thorns as delicate and sharp as cambric needles . The plant is called , according to Joseph , " the Holy Spirit , " and the wolves ( still according to Joseph ) eat it , rather than starve ; but this I found it hard to believe . In spite of the snow-fields , I resolved to attempt the ascent to the cone the next fair day , and after lingering to the last minute it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the approaching sunset , and , making our best speed downward while daylight lasted , we finally groped our way to the Casa , which we reached after dark . Tired of the monotony of succeeding days of rain , I started for an expedition to the Valde Bove , a huge depression in the eastern side of the mountain , flanked by almost precipitous walls some thousands of feet in height . Two of the soldiers accompanied me as an escort , and were changed below at every station . Their presence was not unwelcome when we reached , in a dark night , strange quarters in an unprepossessing neighborhood . Here my sleeping-room was guarded efficiently by my military friends , who lay down outside the chamber door on some straw , and slept there all night , as I did too , with a not unpleasant sense of security . This was all very well , but next day , after being turned back by a violent snow-storm from the entrance to the Valde Bove , I resolved to have one day of civilization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I knew there was a hotel kept for the benefit of foreigners , and where , presumably , a bath and other long-missed luxuries were to be had . As we descended , the snow was left behind us . The way was through almost continuous vineyards and villages , and in the latter I grew aware that I was an object of lively interest and curiosity from my escort ; popular opinion , as well as I could make out , being divided as to whether I was some very eminent personage indeed , with a military guard , or a. captured brigand under the conduct of the gendarmes . To the latter theory my general appearance - I had slept in my clothes for two nights-lent , I was painfully conscious , but too much plausibil // ity , and at the first station we reached I stopped , and in what fragmentary Italian I could muster explained to the officer on duty that I was going down into a town of twenty thousand inhabitants , in which the presence of my defenders , although a highly considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively necessary , and was in fact an honor of which I was undeserving . My polite friend answered , however , that it was none too much for a person of my merit , and that , besides , he had strict orders ; and I resigned myself to seeing a fresh detail of men provided , with which I entered Aci Reale , causing an amount of public interest and discussion which few tourists can flatter themselves with having aroused there . To all this , at last , I grew case-hardened , riding through the villages indifferent to the admiration I was the cause of , and finally set out to climb to my hermitage again . Here it was too evident the halcyon days were gone , and that my expedition to the summit was a thing not to be thought of till another season . As we ascended we encountered snow when but a little way above Nicolosi , and had to dismount and struggle through it , till , wet and weary , we got back to my hut once more , toward which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , adopt almost every word of what another solitary remarked on a similar occasion : " I can not express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old hutch and lie down in my bed . This little wandering journey , without settled place of abode , had been so unpleasant to me that my own house , as I called it to myself , was a perfect settlement , and it rendered everything about me so comfortable that I resolved I would never go a great way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the Island , " said Robinson Crusoe . Here , however , day after day went by in dull monotony ; the snow fell thicker than ever , and it was plain that work Wintering on Alitna . July , was over for the winter . I waited on for a few hours of sunshine and starlight to complete my observations , and beguiled the days as well as I could ; but they seemed long , and not having kept a tally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusoe did , I almost lost count of the time . Once the silence was broken by the sound of fardistant , deep-voiced bells , coming up from the remote Piano di Catania , hidden in the perpetual mist ( and hence Joseph and I conjectured that this day was a Sunday ) , and once the clouds rolled away below , and while the snow still fell from a leaden sky overhead , the sunlight for a few minutes streamed up , reflected from the green bright plains where it was still shining . Twice mule trains came up to me , bringing into my snow and fog tokens that the sun had been shining somewhere , in the shape of newly picked ruddy-golden mandarins and other fruits , along with wine and more substantial things for my men , - my men they were , up here , though down below they perhaps considered me their man . They were all civility and obedience , poor fellows , in everything not touching their orders to see personally that I came to no harm , and I used to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard duty , with nothing to do save to lie on straw , talk , and play cards , eat infinite sausage and macaroni , and drink , alas , not unlimited wine , - but still each man his daily three bottles , - with plenty of sleep , these stormy days were , I imagine , happy days to them . I remember the last time that the sun shone ; the clouds opened just as it had set to us , and before its rays had left the summit of the mountain . The light climbed fast , till it lay rosy for a few seconds on the snowy cone . Then this turned to an ashy gray , as the light lingered for a moment more on the smoke which rose above it , and then all went out . This is the last I remember of the sunshine on ? tna , and it came no more // till it was time to go ; and I packed up my instruments , saw them loaded on the mules , locked the door of the hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and waded through the snow which hid Casa del Bosco when I turned for a last look at it . A twenty minutes ' descent carried us down to where the snow was beginning to melt as it fell , and here the mules were mounted again , and we kept on them till in about three hours we saw the houses of Nicolosi , where the mules were left . My coming was unexpected , and no carriage was to be had , and I walked on attended by two of my ever constant guard , whom it was impossible to shake off . At last a carriage presented itself in the road , and calling to the driver my destination in Catania I got in , leaving the soldiers to take care of themselves . They were equal to the occasion , however , and mounted the carriage , where their uniforms and the presence of a passenger inside , whom they were supposed to be guarding , excited even more than the usual attention . I turned for one final look at 2Etna . We were driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain and wrapped all its vast bulk in gray , except the villages about its base through which we had come . I was recalled by the shouts of delight and interest with which my equipage was greeted as it rattled through the more crowded streets . Carriages were drawn up to see what must have been imagined a political prisoner of distinction go by , and shrill Italian screams , which I interpreted to mean , " They ye got him ! " heralded the coming wonder ; and happy were they who could look into the carriage windows as we drove up to the consulate . Here , borrowing in part the words of another , I will only say , " As I never happened to stand in a position of greater dignity , I deem it a stratagem of sage policy here to close these sketches , leaving myself still in so heroic au attitude . " S. P. Langley .
