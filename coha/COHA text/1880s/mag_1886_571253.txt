ARTICLE 1. - THE IDEAL SCIIOLAR. * M* theme is the Ideal Scholar . In treating of it I propose to answer such questions as these : What is it to be a scholar in the broad acceptation of the term , especially in the times in which we live ? What are the characteristic features of the type of manhood which this ideal implies ? What are the sub , jective conditions of success in the scholar 's inward habits , his peculiar training , his self-command , his enthusiasm , docility , and diligence ? What are the outward appliances and external circumstances that are equally essential , as the control of his time , exemption from sordid cares , from bodily ailments , and destructive habits ? Again , what spheres of interest or activity are essential to the conception of the scholar in these days of divided and subdivided labor , of minute observation , and limited attention , when a single sphere of erudition or a single science is deemed wide enough for the most aspiring and industrious ? Shall anything like a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , in what shall it consist ? What are the studies and aims which it should propose , and how far may this ideal be realized ? It might seem at first thought that the appellation of scholar has less significance at the present time than formerly , for the reason that the diffusiow of intelligence can no longer be specially limited to a few . All the world , it is said , now goes to school , consequently , all the world are equally scholars . It is mere assumption for any one man to call himself a scholar by eminence on the ground of any special study , or any particular amount or quality of knowledge . There was a time when learning was the profession of the few , and was supposed to impart to its possessor a mysterious power over nature , or privilege with kings , or mastery over demons , or priestly favor with God . The scholar in the old time stood forth in the strongest relief from among the common herd , and bade them hear his voice and follow his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally instructed . * This paper was read in the Hall of Phillips Academy , at Exeter , N. H. April 27 , 1886. // Certainly all sit in critical judgment on their teachers and listen , while the man who would presume to address or instruct them must beg a hearing with his hat in his hand . We accept these suggestions for all they are worth , while we insist that the devotion of the life to the acquisition of knowledge and the guidance and instruction of others requires and trains men of a marked and peculiar type . This type is none the less significant and important in these days when knowledge is universal than it was when the teacher was a necromancer , the scribe was the pliant or treacherous servant of his sovereign , and the priest was either a hypocrite or a bigot before God . We contend that the existence of a community of men more or less educated themselves , supposes and demands another class of men whose culture is wider and more profound , both special and general , whose sharpened wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at hand to examine and to judge , to help and to hinder the aspirants after elementary knowledge , and to diffuse truth of every sort among those who are capable of understanding their words . In other words , for the very reason that knowledge is more thorough , more varied , and widely diffused , it follows that we need and must produce a class of men who deserve to be called scholars by eminence , and who require a broad and thorough training . We contend for the old-fashioned significance of the product and the education which produces it . It does not follow that the word college stands for the same idea when we speak of Harvard College or a Business College , or that a University has the same import with a High School , because in the German language it is often so called , or that a man becomes a scholar by pursuing a specialty for a few months even under the ablest teachers and side by side with those who are scholars indeed . We assume at the outset that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a long road on which a boy enters who is marked out for scholarship , especially in these days when to be a scholar must mean so much , and when to master a single branch of knowledge engrosses and exhausts a lifetime . While it is true that now and then an individual enters this career in later youth or in early manhood and makes a brilliant success , seeming with a stride to overtake and distance those who have been years in the race , it is usually true that those who begin very early find in this a special advantage . This is not alone nor // chiefly because they add years to their time as time , but because the early years of life are golden in respect to the special activities which they require , and the peculiar acquisitions which they make possible . In childhood , if it is normal , the memory of words and dates works as easily as breathing . Facts simply as facts write their records upon the passive brain as swiftly as they pass . Whatever we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under this law nature provides for the accumulation of those materials which will subsequently be needed , when time is cheap and labor ought to be play , and each day is a brief eternity of being , and each experience of life leaves its sharp-cut stamp upon the memory-furnishing the creative phantasy with exhaustless materials to work upon and manipulate whefi reason shall come to the front . If these early opportunities for special gains are not used they can never be replaced . Memory and fancy are insensibly displaced by judgment and thought . The radiant dawn with its varied and roseate hues insensibly fades away before the steady light of the sober day . It is desirable to begin the scholar 's life early for another reason . Even were it not true that certain activities and achievements can be better achieved in the early years , there would be reason enough in the fact that there is so much work to be done , why we can not begin too soon if we begin wisely . We also assume that success in the scholar 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings and purposes , on the one hand , and the machinery and the materials of action , as the intellectual powers and achievements , on the other . Both of these are in part the gifts of nature ; in respect to the strength of the one , and the reach and penetration of the other . The two act and react on one another in the entire course of the scholar 's training . It is hard to say which is the more important from the beginning to the end , but it is clear that both claim to be considered as elements which give character to the product . With these premisings our subject divides itself into the two leading heads of the teachers and the studies of the Ideal Scholar , using both in the largest and most liberal sense , and considering both as addressing the springs of action as truly as they instruct the pure intellect . We begin with the scholar 's teachers ; the first and most important of which are those which are furnished by the home . We // do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations a stock of impulses and powers which represent the past , and which pass into our life under the mysterious law which we name heredity . As we awake to conscious life we are surrounded by an atmosphere of influence and teachings which seem to give that set to our aims , and that direction to our activities , which becomes the nucleus of our individual life and from which all the web of this subsequent life is developed into a separate personality . Every Ideal Scholar should have a home to which he can trace more or fewer of those strong impulses which have made him to be what he is , and in which he has gained the definite convictions that are the deep foundations of his intellectual life . It now and then happens that some street Arab 01. homeless orphan stumbles upon a scholar 's career and wins a scholar 's renown . Whenever this occurs it is because nature somehow supplies an exception which by its manifest import proves the rule to be true-strangely furnishing some substitute for a father 's wisdom or a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal Scholar has a normal home , and finds in that home more or fewer of the controlling impulses and guidance which enter into his subsequent life . The scholar 's ideal home may not be a home of leisure or ease , or what is commonly called culture , but it must be pervaded by high aims , by a just estimate of knowledge as possessing an intrinsic dignity and worth when compared with shows and shams of any kind , and of the value of truth and honor as contrasted with trickery and finesse . The inmates of the home may none of them be technically educated in book inowledge . They may he neither profound in science nor versed in literature , and yet they may cherish profound convictions of the value of both as the condition of the highest manhood . To this is usually added the conviction that a well cultured mind and an enlightened character are better securities for what is called success in life than any other advantages . It is from homes like these that scholars usually proceed , not necessarily poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the highest aims , and sustained by the enthusiasm of moral self-respect and just ambitions . If they are also endowed with wealth and refined by art and ease , they are yet more ennobled by just conceptions of the worth of character and usefulness as the best accomplishments which wealth can buy or culture can adorn . // There is many a homely or dilapidated house in New England that is pointed out as the early home of one who was distinguished in his youth as the scholar of his hamlet or village , who subsequently won a noble name by some form of learned or active usefulness of which a scholar 's habits were the necessary foundation . If you ask what there was in that home which made him great , you will find that everything was there which was required for this end  --  the noble aims which were kindled in his mind by father or mother or other inmate , and the teachings or habits which were inculcated as essential to their realization . It was not that the parents were themselves scholars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books might have been few , their reading scanty , their acquaintance with men and science limited . Some books they had , always the Book of books with the poetry and pathos , the eloquence and philosophy , which it is ever ready to impart to the responsive soul , and in addition Milton and Cowper , or , mayhap Shakespeare in well-thumbed volumes , or Baxter or Watts . In these volumes the fervent father or the imaginative mother found many striking thoughts and burning words concerning this life and the next , and the aims and inspiration that are befitting . to both , which one or both had contrived to impart to the docile son-waking once for all the glowing ideals which guided and warmed his subsequent life . 1f you require an example , read the story of Daniel Webster 's youth , and as you visit his early home and call to mind what thoughts were awakened in his mind under the shadows of the dark forest by the teachings of his father and mother , which he cherished with grateful reverence through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain home of Theodore Parker in historic Lexington , or the home more refined of William Channing near the resounding beach of the twice historic Newport , or ponder the story of Thomas Carlyle and of his lifelong idolatry of his father and mother and the filial reverence which he cherished for both to the end of his life , plain and in a sense uncultured as they were . Remember how there was nothing the latter valued so much in the midst of his London life as the oatmeal from the old home , the walls of which were laid by his father 's hands , and this not so much for the oatmeal as for the inspiration of his mother , and the solid sense of the father , which it so distinctly revived . Read the lives of Emerson and Hawthorne , and you will find that the secret impulses of the life of // both are found in the homes of each and was in each case marked and unique , in both cases unmistakable and strong . Recall to your minds the many splendid examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will find the same old story continually repeated , that whenever there have been notable achievements in the world of thought these may usually be traced to some inspiring incitement that has been kindled in the nursery or by the fireside . From the home we pass to the school as the place where our Ideal Scholar encounters formal instruction and comes in contact with the professional teacher . We employ here no conventional terms , but include in the school every form of task-work which is assigned to the scholar as a preparation for his active life , beginning with the most informal lessons which the family furnishes and ending with the final thesis with which he justifies his title to teach a fellow-man in a public career . We include in the discipline of the school those easy lessons which are softened by a mother 's indulgence , and the hard and dry tasks which are imposed by the merciless master . They are all alike  --  the daily recitations for which we are compelled to prepare , the fearful examinations for which there is no escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws out into a lengthened torture-they are all alike in this , that they require the achievement of some task which ordinarily involves lab6r against a specified time of trial and test . Whatever this task may be it is all the same in principle and aim , and that is , the enforcement of some mental activity for a definite achievement , whether it is an effort of memory , of discrimination , of reasoning , or some form of creative power . The school implies a teacher , and a teacher it is presumed knows more and can think better than his pupils , and should never release his pupil till he equals or surpasses himself . One office of the teacher is to assign some form of activity to his pupil , giving him all the aid that is consistent with this rule-usually an activity which involves effort and often some duty which is to be done against a fixed time , for the simple reason that it is by making such definite efforts that the pupil gains acquisition , alertness , discrimination , self-control , and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rigor , it should ever be remembered , indeed it should be inscribed in letters of bronze over schools of every kind , If you give up tasks you might as well dis // rnzss the school . This is equally true whether the school is a kindergarten or a university . It is true indeed that the tasks prescribed in the kindergarten differ from those prescribed in the university , but both are tasks , albeit the first are set to music and the second are attended by no music except the moans of reluctant nature or of the exasperated will . We may allow to the scholar a choice between his tasks so far as he knows his own powers or purposes or has a right to consult them . We simply insist that when they are set or assumed they must be enforced , and that the logic which justifies the teacher in constraining the pupil to achieve any task , may also justify him in assigning and enforcing a fixed curriculum as the basis and condition of what men call scholarship . Of what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirm the right and duty in general , which indeed no man will deny . And yet so much is said in these days against the principle of constraint and compulsion in both school and university life , so much is urged in favor of freedom and choice that I may be excused for dwelling for a moment on what seems to me the essence and ideal of life at school . Let us then for a moment shake ourselves clear of all associations with the rod or the dungeon , and form to ourselves the most roseate images of the means of enforcement . Then let us ask and seek to answer the question , Why should the schoolma'am or the college professor assume to prescribe and enforce our lessons at all ? Why not leave both the selection and the acquisition , to the fancy or the choice of the pupil ? Simply , we reply , because the world of life for which the school professes to prepare abounds in tasks , and unless the school anticipates the discipline the best preparation for life can not be achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clergyman , and the man of business , nay , even the teacher himself , meets and is confronted by his daily lessons . Even the gentleman who sets his own tasks can only pass the time which he desires to kill by making engagements even if he does not fulfill them , and even he , should he go too far in remissness , will be visited with summary disgrace . It is true we are not marked for our failures in life after the fashion of the school , but the marks arc deeper and more lasting and often incapable of erasure . If we lift our thoughts above the sense-world , are we not taught by nature and conscience that life itself is a series of duties assigned to each of us under the " great taskmaster 's eye . " // I find the same conception of the relation of school discipline to the activities of life expressed by the brother of the founder of this school in the fundamental constitution of the sister academy when he describes its object to be " to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that he not only had a clear insight into the end of schooling of every sort , but also discerned that the most important thing which we learn at school is not t*reek or Latin or Algebra or Geometry , but how to meet the duties of life promptly , thoroughly , and satisfactorily-life in his view being a series of tasks which if we face them resolutely and faithfully will at last become our play . We may say what we will about compulsory study and compulsory attendance and compulsory preparation . We may succeed in driving tasks out of our schools and colleges , but we can not succeed in driving them out of life . It were a pity to choose to forego them in the days of youth , for it will be all the more difficult to meet them later . The teacher , one or many , does not make the school , nor do his lessons or his example furnish the scholar 's entire ideal . Sometimes , indeed , by the breadth of his acquisitions and the force of his character he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they bless him while he lives and honor his name when he is dead . But even then he does not exhaust or hinder the inspirations which came from another source . You send your son to the schoolmaster , says Emerson , but it is his schoolfellow who teaches him . Much as this seems to signify , its meaning and truth grows upon us the more we think of its breadth of imporL It is at the school that the pupil makes his first personal and definite acquaintance with the great world without the household . Before school time begins the world within those limits had been molded so gradually with his growing consciousness as to seem a part of himself and almost to blend with the earth and sky . But so soon as the boy enters the school and definitely faces his kind , say a dozen or more , with looks of wonder or sympathy or defiance , there gradually dawns upon his awakened mind the knowledge of what public sentiment may signify with its smiles and its frowns , of the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its claims of property , and all the manifold experiences in miniature which social manhood is forced to make for itself and out of which emerges the boy 's first conceptions of law and government , of his duties and his rights . Gradually the world of one 's schoolfellows becomes the most important world , // often the only human world that the growing boy cares for in his years of " storm and stress . " Between the class-room and the playground it is the only world with which he has much to do or greatly cares for ; whether he dreams or is awake . For within its limits , he finds ample material for his loves and hates , his plans and achievements , and upon its varied occupations he lavishes all the resources of his never exhausted youth . Within this luxuriant field of the fermenting common life of every school and college there spring up and grow together the golden wheat and the poisonous weed , noble resolves and hateful passions , generous aims and vile conspiracies , common movements which kindle and fan the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maddened crowd . If the social tide sets strongly in the right direction the voice of the community is the voice of God ; if it moves strongly toward evil its temporary triumphs only prepare the way for a disastrous and conspicuous defeat . The educating force of these influences with our Ideal Scholar is sufficiently obvious . It is not alone the teacher , nor the textbooks , nor the manifold other appliances which make or mar the best development , but most of all it is the common social life with which the scholar is surrounded that silently shapes and energizes his inner being . Within this charmed circle those school and college friendships are formed which so often become friendships for life . It usually happens , it always happens if the spirit is of finer mould , that some single companion is sooner or later found who becomes the other self . With common tasks and common aims each finds in the other the complement of himself , as each reflects the other 's tastes or supplies his defects . One school or college friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common purposes or ardently following common studies have sometimes done more for one another 's scholarly achievements than an army of learned professors or the costliest outfit of books or apparatus . Not that the latter may not for many purposes be indispensable , but that the former are always fraught with elemental fire . The great schools of England and her greater universities have done immensely more for the scholarship of England or rather for the scholars of England , by the intense and pervasive common life which they have sustained than by every other provision for culture and inspiration . If you do not believe this , read with intelligence the scores , or as I should say , the hundreds of the strik // ng biographies which we have of England 's great men who had a university training . Two school friends whose hearts early beat in unison , a half score of inmates of the same college at Oxford or Cambridge , a group of like-minded fellows in the common room , have not only kindled in their own souls a zeal for learning , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glowing track . Much as these social bonds are needed in England among those who call themselves scholars , in this country they are needed more . it is for this reason that we deprecate any weakening of the personal element in teachers and the tendency to substitute lectures and written examinations for the lively question and answer in which man meets man with open face and loosened tongue . For this reason we mourn over the tendency to abandon or disintegrate the old college class , with those sympathies and antipathies through the quadriennial course which gave the student such opportunities in experience with one another as are impossible in almost any other conceivable situation in life . If the new fashion shall prevail it will come to pass that within what was once a royal dining hall arranged for a common repast we shall be summoned to take our intellectual nutriment a la carte in little and changing squads and consequently know little and care less for the few with whom we chance to associate for a month . With thoughts of the common life , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common 8pOrts at school or college and their influence upon the scholar 's ideal , aye , and upon his achievements , as also upon his manners , his tastes , and his character . This- subject is likely to be more rather than less important for the time to come . Athletics in all their forms are everywhere an established interest . Contests of every kind between individuals and classes and schools and colleges occur as regularly as the recitations , and are often more numerously attended , especially when the latter are optional . In respect to this subject the following questions naturally suggest themselves : What place should athletics hold in our Ideal of the training of the scholar ? Should they be systematically taught and the practice of them be universally enforced ? Should contests in strength and skill be permitted under prudent direction ? Should such contests be allowed between the representatives of different in-stitutions ? To these questions only the briefest answers can be given // with reasons as brief . To the first of these questions the answer is easy . Athletics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each is supposed to enter into the ideal knowledge which is presumed of every scholar . The obvious conditions of health and corporal well-being ought to be familiar to every educated boy and girl . The practice of both ought to be enforced during the earlier years of the scholar 's life , because these are the plastic and glowing years , and the muscular and organic life is then receptive of every physical habit on which vigor depends , or through which weakness and disease may sap or destroy the energies of life . They should be encouraged later , but enforced no longer than the tastes and preferences accept with pleasure the assigned activities of the drill room , for the reason that by many the gymnastics of the independent walk , the adventurous climb , the solitary row , and the unnamed delights of the summer and even of the winter landscape are greatly preferred . The subject of trials of athletic skill and strength especially between different schools presents especial difficulties . We can not do justice to such a subject here . At first the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strength and skill , with all the restraints upon hostile passions which experience teaches and which the generous impulses of strenuous youth are ready to accept . And yet on the other hand , the elaborate arrangements for the season , the recurring excitements attendant upon each reported contest , the thought and feeling ; and time and money , which are expended upon the betting , and the jealousies and envyings which are incident to the theory and practice of these contests , must give ns pause before we pronounce them an unmitigated blessing . But yet even on this unfavorable side we find some good , as in the restraint of the grosser indulgencies of appetite and passion , in the enforcement of gentlemanly ways , in the conduct of programs and treaties , and now and then in the noble behavior of the field . Some of our best athletes become the best lawyers and clergymen and physicians . Some of them take the high honors , and among their high ambitions to excel do not forget the highest of all . For these reasons , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ambition from the scholar 's ideal . Thus far we have spoken of the teaching and training of* the home and of the school in which the agency of parents and // teachers and schoolmates is conspicuous . We have omitted the most important of all , viz : the teaching and training which each man bestows upon himself We may not forget that for the ideal scholar this is the most efficient traiiilng which any man can possibly receive , and that without this all other teaching and discipline must fail of their best effect . Parents and the home circle may inculcate and inspire , teachers may assign the most judicious tasks and enforce them most wisely . Schoolmates may be troops of angels that would bear the pupil up to God by steps of duty and wings of faith , and yet if the scholar does not become his own efficient and inspiring teacher , the ideal conditions of a scholar 's career are not fulfilled , and the genuine scholar is not produced . Hence we say emphatically , every scholar is his own best teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this function for himself . The most efficient schooling to which he can possibly be subjected is that to which he subjects himself . There comes to every schoolboy who makes of himself a man , early or later , on a sudden or more gradually , the discovery that for what he is to become , he is chiefly responsible to himself . It is of little consequence how he reaches this conviction , whether it breaks upon him with startling abruptness , as in a vision , or whether it is gradually reached as the darkness of midnight is replaced by the dawn . Its voice is distinct and clear : Henceforth you must be your own teacher and master combined . To this voice the response is equally clear and strong , I must and I will . Sooner or later the questions follow : What then will you become , and how ? If the answer concerns intellectual achievement , according to its breadth and fullness such will be the man , *provided only that industry and self-control hold him to his work . To such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes to himself . Every oversight in his daily lesson is noticed by himself with greater rigor than by the sternest of teachers . Whatever labor and attention can accomplish is freely lavished upon his work , and sooner or later his work shows the result in his quickened intellect , his enlarged acquisitions , his exacter knowledge , and the completed mastery of his powers , to whatever service they are applied . With this increased self-reliance there is increased self-distrust . With augmented energy of purpose , there is a deepened conviction that he needs help and guidance from others , that his own fancies and convictions require the correction of other men 's judgment , and the light of other men 's knowledge . This is the natural result of that deepened simplicity // of purpose which comes from a deepened sense of responsibility to one 's self . Hence it is no paradox to say that self-distrust may be increased in proportion to one 's self-reliance ; that the most thorough scholar who is the most thorough because he is the most self-reliant , is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most suspicious of himself . The ranks of the noblest scholars are crowded with men of this type-men of the rarest candor coupled with the strongest convictions , men witha martyr 's meekness , yet ready for the martyr 's fire , men as unlike as possible to the intellectual bullies with whom they are sometimes confounded . When the scholar is fully awake to his obligations to himself and is competent to judge of the studies which will best meet his future wants , he is competent to select his studies for himself , and he is not before . Certainly not without the strenuous advice of older men . How soon this state may be attained by this or that individual we need not decide . Now and then there is a scholar who shows in his youth tastes so decided and capacities so strong as to leave no room for any question except the one-sided inquiry whether his one-sidedness does not need to be corrected by the very studies which he does not fancy . But conceding that such a case is exceptional , we are forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some serious sense of self-responsibility has been evoked and with it the necessity that the liberty of choice will not be abused , but will be intelligently and earnestly used . But we pass a second time over the embers of this burning question with hasty tread . Thus far have we been occupied with the teachers of the Ideal Scholar under the designation of the home , the school , and himself . We have conceived the school to include the college and university as the necessary conditions of his training . In other words , we have assumed that his training was to be a public education , that is , an education prosecuted under the stimulus of an active social life . For the reasons which have been already suggested , we have not contrasted a public with a private education for the simple reason that the last is possible for only a very few , and that for these few it should be supplemented by the collisions and enticements of the school , and the stimulants and exhilarants of the university . These last should never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes or the exceptionally wealthy , // more or less of the school life is recognized , as the essential completion of an - education which will fit them to deal with their fellow-men . Leaving the teachers , let us pass to their teaching-in other words , to the studies which are essential to the scholar 's ideal . We naturally begin with language , inasmuch as all education , even that of nature , begins with the mastery over words and speech . There are not a few in these days who forget this truth , or recognizing it as a fact , are disposed to rebel against the lessons which it suggests , or to reverse the position in which words have stood in respect to facts . Their lusty cry is , give us things : confront us with facts . Nature meets us at every turn with living realities . Words are of use only as they acquaint us with nature , so far and so far only as they teach us to observe , or as they record what others have seen or proved , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure words are a great convenience . They give a man a thousand eyes in place of two . They dispense with his traveling over unmeasured distances , and his mining in dark and gloomy depths , or flying along trackless spaces . But all these other services were better dispensed with under the pressing calls of nature as she bids us confer with herself directly and alone . As against all these plausible and urgent reasons , we urge the incontestable truth , explain or not as we may , that in point of fact and under the guidance and impulse of nature herself the intellectual culture of man begins with the mastery of his mother tongue , and this not as a means to what lies beyond , but through the processes themselves by which this mastery is achieved-in learning to speak with the articulating organs and to interpret by the eye the symbols of uttered speech . How or why it should be we may not explain . That the combined activities of the mental and vocal elements of the unseen thought and the seen or uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development of the human intelligence , we know to be a fact . Let two children begin with equal promise . Let speech and the physical capacity for spoken language be denied to the one , or simply disused , and let the other be trained to speak and read , and the disparity in the intellectual development of the two will speedily be enormous . Nothing will remove this disparity except the study of language , which the loosened tongue , or the interpreting eye make possible . Let these be given and the powers expand under the varied and quickening stimulants which come through language alone . // To a certain extent and for a certain length of time the study of language is indispensible as the medium of culture of every kind in whatever form culture may be desired , simply , if for no other reason , because it confronts the man with the countless relations of things and of thought which would be unobserved or forgotten were they not fixed by words and thus made the peculiar and permanent possession of the mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man denies , that the mastery of one language at least is essential to awaken , to instruct , and to inform the infant mind . Even the extremest physicist who would fain confine his faith to the hardest kind of material facts , would neither dodge nor forget the truth that it is not facts , but the relations of facts , which makes science , *and that these relations must be symbolized in words . Even he will concede that the education of the student of nature must begin with the mastery of the mother tongue . Again , the mastery of language is not only necessary if we would acquire , but equally that we may be able to communicate to others . To impart with clearness and facility and method and interest , the teacher must be the master of his instrument , and to be the master of an instrument so subtle as language , requires art and skill , and art and skill carries us back to science . But here it may be asked , why for all these purposes does not the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser to master the capacities of a single instrument rather than divide your energies between two or three ? Why study any other than English except for the reason that French and German can tell you facts that the English does not disclose ? Or if you study a language for the sake of the language , to gain some peculiar discipline , why not study English in a philological and critical way - as Old English and Middle English or Modern English , and let all the others go except as reporters of facts and instruments of information ? Especially , why insist on the Greek in these days of expanding science and multiplied letters , w hen the English literature spreads out its riches , at once the labor and the luxury of a lifetime , in their boundless profusion ? The challenge is fair . The answer to it is ready . First of all , experience has decided that a language other than your own can be used to greater advantage for all those purposes for which you study language at all . In other words , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it // reflected in German or Greek than by looking at it directly in the face and comparing it by standards taken from itself alone . As you judge a familiar landscape to greater advantage in respect to form or color or other features , when you see it reflected in a mirror , so is it with a scholar 's facilities for estimating his mothertongue . The child and the man who have had no special training find it almost as difficult to criticise their mother-tongue as to criticise the mother whom they unreflectingly love and admire . But so soon as they have been schooled to do this with another language than their own , they come back to their own with new eyes and new standards . No a priori reasoning or dogmatic assertions can set aside facts like these . Ex*ery scholar who deserves the name mu* accept them as axiomatic truths . rro assert that it can not be so and shall not be so for the next generation , because we can not see why it should be so , is to fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why not use German in place of Greek ? What gives to Greek this unchallenged preeminence among the thousand tongues that have been used by man ? Is not the German as articulated in its paradigms , as refined in its structure , as profound in thought *s is the Greek ? Is not Gmthe a better model for the modern scholar than even Plato , or Homer , or Sophokles ? When I am posed with these questions I have one answer . The Greeks possessed one quality in language and diction , in sentiment and reasoning , and that is the gift of perpetual , exuberant youth . The freshness of life 's morning was always with them . In their poetry , their oratory , their philosophy*and their drama , clearness , directness , pathos , earnestness , frankness , and consummate beauty are always dominant . This . youth enabled them to produce a literature which should have the exalted function of training the scholars of humanity for all the generations . This function they will continue to exercise in spite of the confident predictions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made trial of this training remain unshaken . We may not forget that the host of these witnesses is enormous , extending through many generations . The position of Greece as the teacher of Rome and the schoolmaster of civilized Christendom was not an accident , but was founded on the conviction that comes from trial . No man who has thoroughly availed himself of this culture and in any proper sense put it to the proof , has regretted the time or the labor which it has involved . // Every man who has gone far enough in his Greek to read Plato , and Homer , and Demosthenes with moderate facility will testify that by his mastery of Greek he has gained more than he has lost in time in the facility for his other linguistic studies , provided the normal period for a scholar 's curriculum were allowed him . We premised early in our argument that a scholar 's training requires some amplitude of time . It were idle to forget that time is essential to success in every enterprise . We do not contend , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the mastery of one , and yet we do contend in all sobriety , that if one be modern and the other be classical , that the one will so aid the other that the mastery of both shall not require double the time demanded fo* one alone . That the Ideal Scholar of the present day should be the easy master of more or fewer of the modern languages may be assumed without discussion or argument . At what time the study of the latter shall begin must depend upon circumstances which are beyond the control of many scholars . That it is desirable that this study should begin very early in life is obvious to every competent judge . That much valuable time is likely to be wasted if it is not thus used is equally clear . During these early years time seems so abundant as to be inexhaustible and hence it is often lavishly thrown away . When the memory moves with spontaneous ease and holds fast its gains without , effort , then is the time to connect the acquisition of one or two modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies are conjoined with moderate energy and skill , the light which is reflected from the one to the other will stimulate curiosity and incite to thought . As upon the naiive study of the mother and foreign tongue there is superinduced that reflective study of both which we call grammar , the one enlivens the other , and grammar itself is lifted above the " Serbonian bog " of abstract metaphysics into which whole armies of jubilant youth have been sunk . Or at least the stepping stones of this morass will have been made more obvious by the play and counter-play of their mutually reflected lights . When a boy thus favored enters upon the school he will have made enormous gains if he rightly uses these advantages . Alas it too often happens that the boy thus distinguished is sated with his intellectual gains . He finds his school work so easy that the habit of severe and dogged effort is never acquired , or at least , not matured . The reflective and discriminating period // of his school life is wasted or dawdled away for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to the severer drills of classical lessons his previous training has given him facility enough to render him independent of the hardest work . His facile memory ' or disciplined wit serves as substitutes for reflective thought . The foundation was of the best , but the superstructure became frail and flimsy . This comes of that simple unfaithfulness to which there are many splendid exceptions . It depends largely on the highest schools of learning to decide whether a high ambition for thorough work and classical learning shall animate the schools below , and whether or not the boys who are especially favored with opportunities for early culture , especially in the languages , shall gain that classical facility which is easily within their reach and submit to that grammatical c*xactness and copious reading which are the surest foundations for a correct and facile English style . Should the universities cease to require some decent mastery of Greek and Latin as a condition of their highest honors , should they by example or dogma fail to stimulate and impart those higher attainments in both these languages which modern facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those youths who enjoy special facilities in childhood for linguistic studies will choose what they will fancy is an easier path to scholastic honors . If , on the other hand , the sentiment expressed by the university teaching and action should set strongly and positively in the opposite direction , we have every reason to believe that the spirit which is in the heart of our most cultivated youth will make itself manifest in splendid fruitB of classical and literary enthusiasm . These questions concerning the study of language suggest another topic , viz the study of literature , particularly the familiar acquaintance with English literature as essential to the Ideal Scholar . Whatever opinions may be held with respect to the relative claims of the classical and modern languages , all men agree in holding that the cultivated scholar , and in these days the cultivated gentleman , should be familiar with the priceless treasures of English literature and find in them a constant stimulant and delight . The Ideal Scholar is no dry philologue who is preoccupied with forms and facts , with dates and names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily borne upwards upon the pinions of eloquence and song , and whose cultivated taste has been disciplined by the perfection of // diction in prose or verse . If our critical learning fails to stimulate and train the imagination to this sensitive and enlightened sympathy with literature it may fail of its most important service . Cnlture in this direction is not in the strictest sense of the term scholastic in the conditions of its growth . Much has been expected of late from scholastic tasks and exercises in creating and directing a taste for English literature . With this view careful studies in Anglo-Saxon and Early English have been introduced into English schools . After the same theory special critical studies of our great English writers have been prepared for the same class of scholars . Some good results have been achieved , but much less than has been expected . The explanation of the failure of efforts like these has already been hinted at in the general truth , that we study our native language and literature most effectually , other things being equal , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But while we contend for this truth , we as earnestly contend that the Ideal Scholar can not begin too early to be familiar with the best English writers , and that what he reads and the manner in which he reads are of the utmost consequence to his culture and his success in life . The taste for reading , in the special sense of the phrase , is variable as to the time and character of its development . To some it comes in early childhood , needing to be carefully directed and often to be rigorously repressed . To others it comes discouragingly late , even when the intellect is strong and bright . It supposes some positive individual activity of thought or feeling on the part of the young reader , something nobler than the mechanical response of the passive imagination , some active recognition of a likeness between the pictures or thoughts of the books which we read and the memories and reflections of the reader . Such a revelation comes when a boy reads passively in a poem or a novel , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page some past experience of his own , some familiar landscape , some character such as he has met before , some living picture of the past , some serious thought or earnest aspiration . When a boy finds reality like this in a book , then he begins to read . If to read is to connect our actual experience with what our books impart , it would seem to be most desirable to connect the reading of the scholar with his severer studies , so far at least as such reading may bring the matter of his studies home to his individual thinking . Inasmuch as history should be taught early // in life when the memory is fresh and keen , it follows that the romance of history and biography should be stimulated to their utmost by the skillful use of the manifold appliances which are now so ready at hand . Here is the field for the inventive and stimulative power of the teacher . That his task is not easy is most obvious . It is equally clear that something needs to be done to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-respecting habits of reading in place of the mechanical dawdling and superficial ways which are the result of ou* modern book-making and newspapers . Would that we could draw off into the sewer the torrent of frothy and sometimes nasty stuff that persistently tempts the youth of our schools and colleges , and could replace it with a tonic and refreshing stream . The least that we can say is that no youth has began to educate himself who has not taken his reading into his own hands in order to select the matter and direct the measure of its use . Look out for your reading , is the first cautionary and directive signal which the young scholar should set up who begins the work of self-culture . You may find in your reading your inspiration and solace . You have need of care that it does not become your poison and torment . The thought may long ago have occurred to some of my hearers that the Ideal Scholar which the speaker has in mind is the Ideal Scholar of other times when the physical universe was veiled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding those wondrous revelations which in such swift succession have since been unveiled to man 's wondering eyes ,  - -  which have been subjected to the most trying tests and successfully applied to the arts and conveniences of life . Surely it is not only natural , but necessary , to inquire what place this newly discovered Cosmos may claim in the studies of cultivated man and what changes should follow in our system of culture arid education . To this question I reply , N ature as now interpreted and understood , can not and should not be excluded from the scholar 's attention . The facts , the laws , the theories , the experiments , with the changed conceptions of matter and spirit which they warrant , the new views of the near and distant universe , the discoveries and arts which the microscope , the telescope and the spectroscope have made possible , the altered conceptions of matter , living and dead , and of spirit in its relation to both-all these should be // familiar to the man who aspires to the culture of the scholar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be understood unless the cultured mind recognizes what science has established as true and what science threatens to destroy . Tennyson 's " In Memoriam , " with its depressing questionings and its triumphant faith , shows most emphatically that even modern poetry is affected by scientific thought . Every newspaper and review , every history and tale is penetrated by the alldissolving or the all-assuring atmosphere of what calls itself Modern Science . We can not leave science out of our theory of education if we would , we would not if we could . What changes does this changed condition of things require in our theory of education ? The first thought which occurs in answer to this question is , that it invests the Mathematical studies with a new importance , whether they are viewed from the standpoint of practice or of theory . Indeed , all men concede that without a mastery over the pure and applied mathematics a mastery over modern science is impossible . What grammar is to linguistics and philology the mathematics are to scientific studies . They are at once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind they keep ward and watch at the vestibule of physical science . The inscription , Let no *nau enter herein unless he can geometrize , has a new significance in these modern times . Geometry and Algebra are both grammar and logic to the sciences of nature , as they train to the capacity of discerning the nicest distinctions in the field of thought , and as they enable us to follow them as they tremble 4dong Mahomet 's bridge of a single hair . In a sense that is loftier and more daring they keep and reveal the mysteries of the kingdom of nature and enable us to interpret the very thoughts of God . Next , scientific studies should be combined with those called literary . It is unnatural to divorce the two for the reason that they are equally natural and necessary to the thinking mind . An ideal education , so far as it proposes and effects a thorough or balanced culture , requires that both should be pursued , so far at least as to attain mastery of the principles fundamental to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the days of Descartes and Newton when modern physics began to be . To contend that the one is practical and the other scholastic is to overlook the truly scientific in each and what gives the common // interest to both . To overlook and to neglect the severer side of physics is to be faithless to science . To attempt to turn schools of science into mere workshops or distilleries is to begin at the wrong end of a lane and to find yourself thrown out of your path and in the region of nowhere . In other words , to divide schools of education too early into the so-called practical on the one hand and the scholastic on the other is to overlook the very essence of science . On the other hand , Physics as a science should not be taught too early , no more should the metaphysics of grammar or criticism , and for the common reason that the observing and retaining functions are developed before the reflective . For this reason familiarity with the phenomena of nature as these address the observant powers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be begun too soon or be too sedulously cultivated . Natural History in all its attractive branches can hardly be taught too early . If I may speak from a personal experience , I shall never cease to be profoundly grateful to one of my teachers who persuaded me to study botany with him as an extra at the age of thirteen , when the adventurous period which comes to every boy was beckoning me to every excitement of country life . The study had been wholly unknown , and with its hard terminology and its careful analysis it seemed at first anything but attractive , but I had not pursued it a month before nature became invested with unsuspected mysteries , revealing to me a new life . It taught me to walk adventurously miles and miles through brush and brier , over rocks and in swamps , fearless of snakes and vermin , to greet the early sunrise and the late sunsets of long summer days , in long tramps before and after school hours , till I had explored every rod as it would seem , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward ? It gave me eyea and ears , not only during my eager youth , but for*all my subsequent life . It gave an interest to my rambles in open nature which I have not lost till this day . I never see one of the formerly well-known flowers , whether common or rare , that I do not greet the first as a well-known friend , and the second as a friend long parted and now restored . These experiments were made long ago , long before the modern games of base-ball and lawn tennis which at present assert such exclusive possession of the youthful mind . We had base-ball in some sort then , but I am apt to think that if I had not been so fortunate in my botanical experience my life would have been the poorer . // My experience with Physics was not dissimilar . Upon this I stumbled almost by accident . It was taught to the girls of the school in a simple fashion , and also to those of the boys who were not destined to college life . I happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I can well remember how my mind exulted in its first acquaintance with the mysteries of force and law as illustrated by the simplest experiments , each one of which was a new surprise . I might speak of a similar accidental experience with American history . I merely wish to enforce the opinion that in an Ideal education science and letters should be conjoined , and that whether the period of learning is longer or shorter , both elements should be combined . The proportion between the elements may be diverse , the languages studied may not be the same , or if they are the same the methods of study may vary in some slight degree , while still it remains true that no man is truly educated who at some time and in some measure does not cultivate his mind by the reflective study of language and the reflective study of nature . The claims of science can never , however , be so engrossing as to set aside the demand for that culture which comes from letters and what letters imply . The one study should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , no thinking or cultured man can fail to be moved by the wondrous revelations concerning the material and spiritual universe which modern science has given to man during the present century . The Ideal Scholar is responsive to Truth in all her aspects and revelations . As he gazes upon her face it is brightened with the attractions of Beauty , and as he looks more and more intently there will be awakened the joy and adoration of Faith .
