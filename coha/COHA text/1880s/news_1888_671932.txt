txt THE FREE LIQUOR FLANK . The Republican organs , especially in the Central Western , States and in others where the temperance vote is strong , are trying to explain away the plank in their platform that prefers free liquor to the surrender of any protective tax whatever . They can not do it . That plank was a perfectly voluntary , unnecessary , and . therefore entirely sincere expression of what the committee believed to be the sentiment of the Republican Party . When it was reported . to the convention not a voice was raised against it , and . it was adopted unanimously with the rest . Moreover . at the close of the convention , when Mr. BourELLE , in behalf of the Prohibition sentiment of Maine , called up the question of the party 's action as to temperance , the offensive positive declaration as to free liquors was not touched , and the convention , by limiting its amendatory resolution to the vague recommendation oi " wise and . effective measures to promote temperance and morality , " confirmed its attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense to say that . this radical and . candid statement does not represent the sentiment of the controlling minds of the party . It is the logical and necessary outcome of the course of the party representatives in Congress , as it is the frank and . unrestrained expression of the party through its convention . It is now eight months since the President presented the reduction of the revenue and the reform of the tariff as the chief issue of the session of Congress then just opened . The issue was immediately accepted . by all the . Republican leaders in both houses . Mr. BLAINE , the then . acknowledged leader ' of the leaders , jumped at the chance to define the policy of his party . He had the sense to repudiate the notion of free whisky and called the attention of his followers , . that is , practically , of the whole party . to this particular phase of the situation . The Democratic Party , through its responsible representatives on the Ways and . Means Committee , proceeded to formulate its policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could never pass the House . Mr. RANDALL , for himself and his followers , rejected the authority of his party leaders in this matter . The situation , thus defined , throw on the Republicans the responsibility of a counter proposition . They made none . Week after week passedin extended debate . Every Republican of any consequence and scores of no consequence spoke in the debate . Not a man of them suggested any policy other than that of blind opposition to the bill ; not one of them indorsed the position of Mr. BLAINE as to whisky . The party convention met at Chicago . Then the policy of the party was for the first time explicitly declared . Then the fruit of the eight months of study , discussion , and preparation was exhibited . And what was it 7 Reduction of the revenue by prohibitory tariff rates and free liquor rather than the surrender of any protective duty . There is no getting away from that . If a party platform can mean anything , it is impossible to mistake or evade the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is protection not as the means to an end , but as a final good in itself , with no limit in time or amount . We do not say , and . we do not believe , that every Republican holds this curiously absurd and . preposterous doctrine . We know that a considerable number of them do not . But they were helpless in shaping the platform as they would be in shaping the policy of the party . The party is in the toils of the protected trusts and . monopolies . It may not wholly approve or admire them . It can not resist them . They have the brains and the energy and the money of the party . They make the plans , name the men to carry them out , furnish the sinews of war , and demand their price . It is they who have prevented action by the party in Congress . It is they who compelled the action taken at Chicago . And to the principles there laid down the party beyond a shadow of a doubt , be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
