THE BATTLE OF LAKE GEORGE . EARLY in 17* , the British and colonial authorities , without a declaration of war , attempted a series of combined operations to repel what were regarded as encroachments of the French . One of these movements was directed against Fort Duquesne , and resulted in the defeat of Braddock ; another against the French in Acadia , ending in the removal of the inhabitants of that country . The third , against Niagara , was never completed ; while the fourth , that against Crown Point , led to a curious and noteworthy passage-of-arms on the banks of Lake George . Crown Point was a dangerous neighbor which , for a quarter of a century , had threatened the Northern colonies . Shirley , Governor of Massachusetts , had proposed an attack on it to the ministry , in January ; and in February , without waiting their reply , he laid the plan before his assembly . They accepted it , and voted money for the pay and maintenance of twelve hundred men , provided the adjacent colonies would contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reputation she had won . Forty - five hundred of her men , or one in eight of her adult males , volunteered to fight the French , and enlisted for the various ex peditions ; some in the pay of the province , and some in that of the king . It remained to name a commander for the Crown Point enterprise . Nobody had power to do so , for Braddock was not yet come ; but that time might not be lost , Shirley , at the request of his assembly , took the responsibility on himself . If he had named a Massachusetts officer , it would have roused the jealousy of the other New England colonies ; and he therefore appointed William Johnson , of New York , thus gratifying that important province and pleasing the Five Nations , who at this time looked on Johnson with even more than usual favor . Hereupon , in reply to his request , Connecticut voted twelve hundred men , New Hampshire five hundred , and Rhode Island four hundred , all at their own charge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred more . When , in April , Braddock and the council at Alexandria approved the plan and the commander , Shirley gave *Johnson the commission of major - general of the levies of Massachusetts ; and the governors of the other provinces contributing to the expedition gave him similar commissions for their respective contingents . Never did general take the field with authority so heterogeneous . // He had never seen service , and knew nothing of war . By birth he was Irish , of good family , being nephew of Admiral Sir Peter Warren , who , owning extensive wild lands on the Mohawk , had placed the young man in charge of them nearly twenty years before . Johnson was born to prosper . He had ambition , energy , an active mind , a tall , strong person , a rough , jovial temper , and a quick adaptation to his surroundings . He could drink flip with Dutch boors , or madeira with royal governors . He liked the society of the great , would intrigue and flatter when he had an end to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means ; but compared with the Indian traders who infested the border , he was a model of uprightness . He lived by the Mohawk in a fortified house , which was a stronghold against foes and a scene of hospitality to friends , both white and red . Here - for his tastes were not fastidious - presided for many years a Dutch or German wench , whom he finally married ; and after her death a young Mohawk squaw took her place . Over his neighbors , the Indians of the Five Nations , and all others of their race with whom he had to deal , he acquired a remarkable influence . He liked them , adopted their ways , and treated them kindly or sternly as the case required , but always with a justice and honesty in strong contrast with the rascalities of the commission of Albany traders who had lately managed their affairs , and whom they so detested that one of their chiefs called them " not men , but devils . " Hence , when Johnson was made Indian superintendent there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , he was made a general , he assembled the warriors in council to engage them to aid the expedition . This meeting took place at his own house , known as Fort Johnson ; and as more than eleven hundred Indians appeared at his call , his larder was sorely taxed to entertain them . The speeches were interminable . Johnson , a master of Indian rhetoric , knew his audience too well not to contest with them the palm of insufferable prolixity . The climax was reached on the fourth day , and he threw down the war-belt . An Oneida chief took it up ; Stevens , the interpreter , began the war-dance , and the assembled warriors howled in chorus . Then a tub of punch was brought in , and they all drank the king 's health . They showed less alacrity , however , to fight his battles , and scarcely three hundred of them would take the war-path . Too many of their friends and relatives were enlisted for the French . While the British colonists were preparing to attack Crown Point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duquesne , recalled from his post , had resigned the government to the Marquis de Vaudrenil , who had at his disposal the battalions of regulars that had sailed in the spring from Brest under Baron Dieskau . His first thought was to use them for the capture of Oswego ; but the letters of Braddock , found on the battle-field , warned him of the design against Crown Point ; while a reconnoitring party which had gone as far as the Hudson brought back news that Johnson 's forces were already in the field . Therefore the plan was changed , and Dieskau was ordered to lead the main body of his troops , not to Lake Ontario , but to Lake Champlain . He passed up the Richelieu , and embarked in boats and canoes for Crown Point . The veteran knew that the foes with whom he had to deal were but a mob of countrymen . He doubted not of putting them to rout , and meant never to hold his hand till he had chased them back to Albany . " Make all haste , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall send you to Oswego to execute our first design . " Johnson on his part was preparing to advance . In July about three thousand // provincials were encamped near Albany : some on the " Flats " above the town , and some on the meadows below . Hitber , too , came a swarm of Johnson 's Mohawks , - warriors , squaws , and children . They adorned the general 's face with war-paint , and he danced the war-dance ; then with his sword he cut the first slice from the ox that had been roasted whole for their entertainment . " I shall be glad , " wrote the surgeon of a New England regiment , " if they fight as eagerly as they ate their ox and drank their wine . Above all things the expedition needed promptness ; yet everything moved slowly . Five popular legislatures controlled the troops and the supplies . Connecticut had refused to send her men till Shirley promised that her commanding officer should rank next to Johnson . The whole movement was for some time at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions of artillery and stores . The New Hampshire regiment had taken a short cut for Crown Point across the wilderness of Vermont , but had been recalled in time to save them from probable destruction . They were now with the rest in the camp at Albany , in such distress for provisions that a private subscription was proposed for their relief . Johnson 's army , crude as it was , had in it good material . Here was Phineas Lyman , of Connecticut , second in command , once a tutor at Yale College , and more recently a lawyer , - a raw soldier , but a vigorous and brave one ; Colonel Moses Titcomb , of Massachusetts , who had fought with credit at Louisbourg ; and Ephraim Williams , also colonel of a Massachusetts regiment , a tall and portly man , who had been a captain in the last war , member of the General Court , and deputy-sheriff . He made his will in the camp at Albany , and left a legacy to found the school which has since become Williams College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his regiment , and his brother Thomas was its surgeon . Seth Pomeroy , gunsmith at Northampton , who , like Titcomb , had seen service at Louisbourg , was its lieutenant-colonel . He had left a wife at home , an excellent matron , to whom he was continually writing affectionate letters ; mingling household cares with news of the camp , and charging her to see that their eldest boy , Seth , then in college at New Haven , did not run off to the army . Pomeroy had with him his brother Daniel ; and this he thought was enough . Here , too , was a man whose name is still a household word in New England , - the sturdy Israel Putnam , private in a Connecticut regiment ; and another as bold as he , John Stark , lieutenant in the New Hampshire levies , and the future victor of Bennington . The soldiers were no soldiers , but farmers and farmers ' sons who had volunteered for the summer campaign . One of the corps had a blue uniform faced with red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served out to them by the several provinces , but the greater part brought their own guns : some under the penalty of a fine if they came without them , and some under the inducement of a reward . They had no bayonets , but carried hatchets in their belts as a sort of substitute . At their sides were slung powder-horns , on which , in the leisure of the camp , they carved quaint devices with the points of their jackknives . They came chiefly from plain New England homesteads , - rustic abodes , unpainted and dingy , with long well-sweeps , capacious barns , rough fields of pumpkins and corn , and vast kitchen chimneys , above which in winter hung squashes to keep them from frost , and guns to keep them from rust . As to the manners and morals of the army there is conflict of evidence . In some respects nothing could be more exemplary . " Not a chicken has been // stolen , " says William Smith , of New York ; while , on the other hand , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Massachusetts frontier , " We are a wicked , profane army , especially the New York and Rhode Island troops . Nothing to be heard among a great part of them but the language of hell . If Crown Point is taken , it wilV not be for our sakes , but for those good people left behind . " There was edifying regularity in respect to form . Sermons twice a week , daily prayers , and frequent psalmsinging alternated with the much-needed military drill . " Prayers among us night and morning , " writes Private Jonathan Caswell , of Massachusetts , to his father . " Here we lie , knowing not when we shall march for Crown Point ; but I hope not long to tarry . Desiring your prayers to God for me as I am agoing to war , I am Your Ever Dutiful Son . " To Pomeroy and some of his brothers in arms it seemed that they were engaged in a kind of crusade against the myrmidons of Rome . " As you have at heart the Protestant cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I ask an interest in your prayers that the Lord of Hosts would go forth with us and give us victory over our unreasonable , encroaching , barbarous , murdering enemies . " Both Williams the surgeon and Williams the colonel chafed at the incessant delays . " The expedition goes on very much as a snail runs , " writes the former to his wife ; " it seems we may possibly see Crown Point this time twelve months . " The colonel was vexed because everything was out of joint in the department of transportation : wagoners mutinous for want of pay ; ordnance stores , camp-kettles , and provisions left behind . " As to rum , " he complains , " it wo n't hold out nine weeks . Things appear most melancholy to me . " Even as he was writing a report came of the defeat of Braddock ; and , shocked at the blow , his pen traced the words , " The Lord have mercy on poor New Eng-land ! " Johnson had sent four Mohawk scouts to Canada . They returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French were all astir with preparation , and that eight thousand men were coming to defend Crown Point . On this a council of war was called ; and it was resolved to send to the several colonies for reinforcements . Meanwhile , the main body had moved up the river to the spot called the Great Carrying Place , where Lyman had begun a fortified storehouse , which his men called Fort Lyman , but which was afterwards named Fort Edward . Two Indian trails led from this point to the waters of Lake Champlain , one by way of Lake George , and the other by way of Wood Creek . There was doubt which course the army should take . A road was begun to Wood Creek ; then it was countermanded , and a party was sent to explore the path to Lake George . " With submissiofl to the general ofilcers* " Surgeon Williams again writes , " I think it a very grand mistake that the business of reconnoitring was not done months agone . " It was resolved at last to march for Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way ; and on the 26th two thousand men were ordered to the lake , while Colonel Blanchard , of New Hampshire , remained with five hundred to finish and defend Fort Lyman . The train of I ) utch wagons , guarded by the homely soldiery , jolted slowly over the stumps and roots of the newly made road , and the regiments followed at their leisure . The hardships of the way were not without their consolations . The jovial Irishman who held the chiefs command made himself very agreeable to the New England officers . " We went on about four or five miles , " says Pomeroy in his journal , " then stopped , ate pieces of broken bread and cheese , and drank some fresh lemon-punch and // the best of wine with General Johnson and some of the field officers . " It was the same on the next day : " Stopped about noon , and dined with General Johnson by a small brook under a tree ; ate a good dinner of cold boiled and roast venison ; drank good fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fourteen miles from Fort Lyman . The most beautiful lake in America lay before them ; then more beautiful than . now , in the wild charm of untrodden mountains and virgin forests . " I have given it the name of Lake George , " wrote Johnson to the Lords of Trade , " not only in honor of his majesty , but to ascertain his undoubted dominion here . " His men made their camp on a piece of rough ground by the edge of the water , pitching their tents among the stumps of the newly felled trees . In their front was a forest of pitch-pine ; on their right , a marsh , choked with alders and swamp-maples ; on their left , the low hill where Fort George was afterwards built ; and at their rear , the lake . Little was done to clear the forest in front , though it would give excellent cover to an enemy . Nor did Johnson take much pains to learn the movements of the French in the direction of Crown Point , though he sent scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bateaux , or fiat boats , came on wagons from Fort Lyman , and preparation moved on with the leisure that had marked it from the first . About three hundred Mohawks came to the camp , and were regarded by the New England men as nuisances . On Sunday the gray-haired Stephen Williams preached to these savage allies a long Calvinistic sermon , which must have sorely perplexed the interpreter whose business it was to turn it into Mohawk ; and in the afternoon young Chaplain Newell , of Rhode Island , expounded to the New England men the somewhat untimely text , " Love your enemies . " On the next Sunday , September 7th , Williams preached again , this time to the whites , from a text in Isaiah . It was a peaceful day , fair and warm , with a few light showers ; yet not wholly a day of rest , for two hundred wagons came up from Fort Lyman , loaded with bateaux . After the sermon there was an alarm . An Indian scout came in about sunset , and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men moving from South Bay towards Fort Lyman . Johnson called for a volunteer to carry a letter of warning to Colonel Blanchard , the commander . A wagoner named Adams offered himself for the perilous service , mounted , and galloped along the road with the letter . Sentries were posted , and the camp fell asleep . While Johnson lay at Lake George , Dieskau prepared a surprise for him . The German baron had reached Crown Point at the head of three thousand five hundred and seventy-three men , regulars , Canadians , and Indians . He had no thought of waiting there to be attacked . The troops were told to hold themselves ready to move at a moment 's notice . Officers - so ran the order will take nothing with them but one spare shirt , one spare pair of shoes , a blanket , a bear-skin , and provisions for twelve days ; Indians are not to amuse themselves by taking scalps till the ene* my is entirely defeated , since they can kill ten men in the time required to scalp one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Carillon , or Ticonderoga , a promontory commanding both the routes by which alone Johnson could advance , that of Wood Creek and that of Lake George . The Indian allies were commanded by Legardeur de Saint-Pierre , the officer who had received Washington on his embassy to Fort Le Bceuf . These unmanageable warriors were a constant annoyance to Dieskau , being a species of humanity quite new to him . " They // 449 drive us crazy , " he says , " from morning till night . There is no end to their demands . They have already eaten five oxen and as many hogs , without counting the kegs of brandy they have drunk . In short , one needs the patience of an angel to get on with these devils ; and yet one must always force himself to seem pleased with them . " They would scarcely even go out as scouts . At last , however , on the 4th of September , a reconnoitring party came in with a scalp and an English prisoner caught near Fort Lyman . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for torture if he did not tell the truth ; but , nothing daunted , he invented a patriotic falsehood , and , thinking to lure his captors into a trap , told them that the English army had fallen back to Albany , leaving five hundred men at Fort Lyman , which he represented as indefensible . Dieskan resolved on a rapid movement to seize the place . At noon of the same day , leaving a part of his force at Ticonderoga , he embarked the rest in canoes , and advanced along the narrow prolongation of Lake Champlain that stretched southward through the wilderness to where the town of Whitehall now stands . He soon came to a point where the lake dwindled to a mere canal , while two mighty rocks , capped with stunted forests , faced each other from the opposing banks . Here he left an officer named Roquemaure with a detachment of troops , and again advanced along a belt of quiet water traced through the midst of a deep marsh , green at that season with sedge and water-weeds , and known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either hand , crags feathered with birch and fir , or hills mantled with woods , looked down on the long procession of canoes . ' As they neared the site of 1 * passed this way three weeks before writing the above . There are some points where the scene is not much changed since Dieskan saw it . Whitehall , a passage opened on the right , the entrance to a sheet of lonely water slumbering in the shadow of woody mountains , and forming the lake then , as now , called South Bay . They advanced to its head , landed where a small stream enters it , left the canoes under a guard , and began their march through the forest . They counted in all two hundred and sixteen regulars of the battalions of Languedoc and La Reine , six bandred and eighty-four Canadians , and about six hundred Indians . Every officer and man carried provisions for eight days in his knapsack . They encamped at night by a brook , and in the morning , after hearing mass , marched again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that led to Lake George . Fort Lyman was but three miles distant . A man on horseback galloped by ; it was Adams , Johnson 's unfortunate messenger . The Indians shot him , and found the letter in his pocket . Soon after , ten or twelve wagons appeared , in charge of mutinous drivers , who had left the English camp without orders . Several of them were shot , two were taken , and the rest ran off . The two captives declared that , contrary to the assertion of the prisoner at Ticonderoga , a large force lay encamped at the lake . The Indians now held a council , and presently gave out that they would not attack the fort , which they thought well supplied with cannon , but that they were willing to attack the camp at Lake George . Remonstrance was lost upon them . Dieskan was not young , hut he was daring to rashness , and inflamed to emulation by the victory over Braddock . The enemy were reported greatly to outnumber him ; but his Canadian advisers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops on the face of the earth . " The more there are , " he said to the Canadians and Indians . " the more we shall kill * " and // in the morning the order was given to march for the lake . They moved rapidly on through the waste of pines , and soon entered the rugged valley that led to Johnson 's camp . On their right was a gorge where , shadowed in bushes , gurgled a gloomy brook ; and beyond rose the cliffs that buttressed the rocky heights of French Mountain , seen by glimpses between the boughs . On their left rose gradually the lower slopes of West Mountain . All was rock , thicket , and forest ; there was no open space but the road along which the regulars marched , while the Canadians and Indians pushed their way through the woods in such order as the broken ground would permit . They were three miles from the lake , when their scouts brought in a prisoner , who told them that a column of English troops was approaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted on the road , the Canadians and Indians moved to the front , where most of them hid in the ; forest along the slopes of West Mountam , and the rest lay close among the thickets on the other side . Thus , when the English advanced to attack the regulars in front , they would find themselves caught in a double ambush . No sight or sound betrayed the snare ; but behind every bush crouched a Canadian or a savage , with gun cocked and ears intent , listening for the tramp of the approaching column . The wagoners who escaped the evening before had reached the camp about midnight , and reported that there was a war-party on the road near Fort Lyman . Johnson had at this time twenty-two hundred effective men , besides his three hundred Indians . He called a council of war in the morning , and a resolution was taken which can only be explained by a complete misconception as to the force of the French . It was determined to send out two detachments of five hundred men each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the object being , according to Johnson , " to catch the enemy in their retreat . " Hendrick , chief of the Mohawks , a brave and sagacious warrior , expressed his dissent after a fashion of his own . He picked up a stick and broke it ; then he picked up several sticks , and showed that together they could not be broken . The hint was taken , and the two detachments were joined in one . Still the old savage shook his head . " If they are to be killed , " he said , " they are too many ; if they are to fight , they are too few . " Nevertheless , he resolved to share their fortunes ; and mounting on a gun - carriage , he harangued his warriors with a voice so animated and gestures so expressive that the New England officers listened in admiration , though they understood not a word . One difficulty remained . He was too old and fat to go afoot ; but Johnson lent him a horse , which he bestrode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two hundred of his warriors as fast as they could grease , paint , and befeather themselves . Captain Elisha Hawley was in his tent , finishing a letter which he had just written to his brother Joseph ; and these were the last words : " I am this minute agoing out in company with five hundred men to see if we can intercept em in their retreat , or find their canoes in the Drowned Lands ; and therefore must conclude this letter . " He closed and directed it , and in an hour received his death-wound . It was soon after eight o'clock when Ephraini Williams left the camp with his regiment , marched a little distance , and then waited for the rest of the detachment , under Lieutenant - Colonel Whiting . Thus Dieskau had full time to lay his ambush . When Whiting came up , the whole moved on together , so little conscious of danger that no scouts were thrown out in front or flank ; and , // in full security , they entered the fatal snare . Before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Hendrick detected some sign of an enemy . At that instant , whether by accident or design , a gun was fired from the bushes . It is said that Dieskau 's Iroquois , seeing Mohawks , their relatives , in the van , wished to warn them of danger . If so , the warning came too late . The thickets on the left blazed out a deadly fire , and the men fell by scores . In the words of Dieskau , the head of the column " was doubled up like a pack of cards . " Hendrick 's horse was shot down , and the chief was killed with a bayonet as he tried to rise . Williams , seeing a rising ground on his right , made for it , calling on his men to follow ; but as ho climbed the slope guns flashed from the bushes , and a shot through the brain laid him dead . The men in the rear pressed forward to support their comrades , when a hot fire was suddenly opened on them from the forest along their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled outright , and the whole column recoiled . The van now became the rear , and all the force of the enemy rushed upon it , shouting and screeching . There was a moment of total confusion ; but a part of Williams 's regiment rallied under command of Whiting , and covered the retreat , fighting behind trees like Indians , and firing and falling back by turns , bravely aided by some of the Mohawks and by a detachment which Johnson sent to their aid . " And a very handsome retreat they made , " writes Pomeroy , " and so continued till they came within about three quarters of a mile of our camp . This was th' last fire our men gave our enemies , which killed great numbers of them ; they were seen to drop as pigeons . " So ended the fray long known in New England fireside story as the " bloody morning scout . " Dieskau now ordered a halt , and sounded his trumpets to collect his scattered men . His Indians , however , were sullen and unmanageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The veteran who commanded them all , Legardeur de Saint-Pierre , had been killed . At length they were persuaded to movc again , the regulars leading the way . About an hour after Williams and his men had begun their march , a distant rattle of musketry was heard at the camp ; and as it grew nearer and louder , the listeners knew that their comrades were on the retreat . Then , at the eleventh hour , preparations were begun for defense . A sort of barricade was made along the front of the camp , partly of wagons and partly of inverted bateaux , but chiefly of the trunks of trees hastily hewn down in the neighboring forest , and laid end to end in a single row . The line extended from the southern slopes of the hill on the left across a tract of rough ground to the marshes on the right . The forest , choked with bushes and clumps of rank ferns , was within a few yards of the barricade , and there was scarcely time to hack away the intervening thickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended through the pines , and another was dragged up to the ridge of the hill . The defeated party began to come in : first , scared fugitives , both white and red ; then , gangs of men bringing the wounded ; and at last , an hour and a half after the first fire was heard , the main detachment was seen marching in compact bodies down the road . Five hundred men were detailed ho guard the flanks of the camp . The rest stood behind the wagons , or lay flat behind the logs and inverted bateaux : the Massachusetts men on the right , and the Connecticut men on the left . Besides Indians , this actual fighting force was between sixteen and seventeen hundred rustics , very few of whom had been under fire before that morning . They were hardly at their posts when they saw ranks of white-coated soldiers mov // ing down the road , and bayonets that to them seemed innumerable glittering between the boughs . At the same time a terrific burst of war-whoops rose along the front ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians and Indians , helterskelter , the woods full of them , came running with undaunted courage right down the hill upon us , expecting to make us flee . " Some of the men grew uneasy , while the chief officers , sword in hand , threatened instant death to any who should stir from their posts . If Dieskau had made an assault at that instant , there could be little doubt of the result . This he well knew ; but he was powerless . He had his small force of regulars well in hand ; but the rest , red and white , were beyond control , scattering through the woods and swamps , shouting , yelling , and firing from behind trees . The regulars advanced with intrepidity towards the camp where the trees were thin , deployed , and fired by platoons , till Captain Eyre , who commanded the artillery , opened on them with grape , broke their ranks , and compelled them to take to cover . The fusillade was now general on both sides , and soon grew furious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after , " the hailstones from heaven were never much thicker than their bullets came ; but , blessed be God ! that did not in the least daunt or disturb us . " Johnson received a flesh-wound in the thigh , and spent the rest of the day in his tent . Lyman took command ; and it is a marvel that he escaped alive , for he was four hours in the heat of the fire , directing and animating the men . " It was the most awful day my eyes ever beheld , " wrote Surgeon Williams to his wife ; " there seemed to be nothing but thunder and lightning and perpetual pillars of smoke . " To him , his colleague Dr. Pynchon , one assistant , and a young student called " Billy 's fell the charge of the wounded of his regiment . " The bullets flew about our ears all the time of dressing them ; so we thought best to leave our tent and retire a few rods behind the shelter of a log-house . " On the adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sutler , watching , as well as bushes , trees , and smoke would let him , the progress of the fight , of which he soon after made and published a curious bird's-eve view . As the wounded men were , carried to the rear , the wagoners about the camp took their guns and powder-horns , and joined in the fray . A Mohawk , seeing one of these men still unarmed , leaped over the barricade , tomahawked the nearest Canadian , snatched his gun , and darted back unhurt . The brave savage found no imitators among his tribesmen , most of whom did nothing but utter a few war-whoops , saying that they had come to see their English brothers fight . Some of the French Indians opened a distant flank fire from the high ground beyond the swamp on the right , but were driven off by a few shells dropped among them . IDieskan had directed his first attack against the left and centre of Johnson 's position . Making no impression here , he tried to force the right , where lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire was hot for about an hour . Titcomb was shot dead , a rod in front of the barricade , firing from behind a tree like a common soldier . At length Dieskau , exposing himself within short range of the English line , was hit in the leg . His adjutant , Montreuil , himself wounded , came to his aid , and was washing the injured limb with brandy , when the unfortunate commander was again hit in the knee and thigh . He seated himself behind a tree , while the adjutant called two Canadians to carry him to the rear . One of them was instantly shot down . Montreuil took his place ; but Dieskan refused to be moved , bitterly denounced the Canadians and Indians , and ordered the adjutant to leave // him and lead the regulars in the last effort against the camp . It was too late . Johnson 's men , singly or in small squads , were already crossing their row of logs ; and in a few moments the whole dashed forward with a shout , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . The French and their allies fled . The wounded general still sat helpless by the tree , when he saw a soldier aiming at him . He signed to the man not to fire ; but he pulled trigger , shot him across the hips , leaped upon him , and ordered him in French to surrender . " I said , " writes Dieskau , " You rascal , why did you fire ? You see a man lying in his blood on the ground , and you shoot him 1 ' He answered , How did I know that you had not got a pistol ? I had rather kill the devil than have the devil kill me . ' You are a Frenchman ? ' I asked . Yes , ' he replied ; it is more than ten years since I left Canada ; ' whereupon several others fell on me and stripped me . I told them to carry me to their general , which they did . On learning who I was , he sent for surgeons , and , though wounded himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was near five o'clock when the final rout took place . Some time before , several hundred of the Canadians and Indians had left the field and returned to the scene of the morning fight , to plunder and scalp the dead . They were resting themselves near a pool in the forest , close beside the road , when their repose was interrupted by a volley of bullets . It was fired by a scouting party from Fort Lyman , chiefly backwoodsmen , under Captains Folsom and McGinnis . The assailants were greatly outnumbered ; but after a hard fight the Canadians and Indians broke and fled . McGinnis was mortally wounded . He continued to give orders till the firing was over ; then fainted , and was carried , dying , to the camp . The bodies of the slain , according to tradition , were thrown into the pool , which bears to this day the name of Bloody Pond . The various bands of fugitives rejoined each other towards night , and encamped in the forest ; then made their way round the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , they reached their canoes . Their plight was deplorable ; for they had left their knapsacks behind , and were spent with fatigue and famine . Meanwhile , their captive general was not yet out of danger . The Mohawks were furious at their losses in the ambush of the morning , and above all at the death of Hendrick . Scarcely were Dieskan 's wounds dressed , when several of them came into the tent . There was a long and angry dispute in their own language between them and Johnson , after which they went out very sullen ly . Dieskau asked what they wanted . " What do they want ? " returned Johnson . " To burn you , by God ! eat you , and smoke you in their pipes , in revenge for three or four of their chiefs that were killed . But never fear ; you shall be safe with me , or else they shall kill us both . " The Mohawks soon came back , and another talk ensued , excited at first , and then more calm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave Dieskau their hands in sign of friendship , and quietly went out again . Johnson warned him that he was not yet safe ; and when the prisoner , fearing that his presence might incommode his host , asked to be removed to another tent , a captain and fifty men were ordered to guard him . In the morning , an Indian , alone and apparently unarmed , loitered about the entrance , and the stupid sentinel let him pass in . He immediately drew a sword from under a sort of cloak which he wore , and tried to stab Dieskau , but was prevented by the colonel to whom the tent belonged , who seized upon him , took away his sword , and pushed him out . As soon // as his wounds would permit Dieskau was carried on a litter , strongly escorted , to Fort Lyman , whence lie was sent to Albany and afterwards to New York . He is profuse in expressions of gratitude for the kindness shown him by the colonial officers , and especially by Johnson . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning they fought like good boys , about noon like men , and in the afternoon like devils . In the spring of 1757 he sailed for England , and was for a time at Falmouth , whence Colonel Matthew Sewell , fearing that he might see and learn too much , wrote to the Earl of Holdernesse , " The baron has great penetration and quickness of apprehension . His long service under Marshal Saxe renders him a man of real consequence , to be cautiously observed . His circumstances deserve compassion , for indeed they are very melancholy , and I much doubt of his being ever perfectly cured . " He was afterwards a long time at Bath , for the benefit of the waters . In 1760 the famous Diderot met him at Paris , cheerful and full of anecdote , though wretchedly shattered by his wounds . He died a few years later . On the night after the battle the yeoman warriors felt the truth of the saying that , next to defeat , the saddest thing is victory . Comrades and friends by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could snatch a moment 's leisure , the overworked surgeon sent the dismal tidings to his wife : " My dear brother Ephraim was killed by a ball through his head ; poor brother Josiah 's wound I fear will prove mortal ; poor Captain Hawley is yet alive , though I did not think he would live two hours after bringing him in . " Daniel Pomeroy was shot dead , and his brother Seth wrote the news to his wife Rachel , who was just delivered of a child : " Dear sister , this brings heavy tidings , but let not your heart sink at the news , though it be your loss of a dear husband . Mon day , the 8th instant , was a memorable day , and truly you may say , had not the Lord been on our side we must all have been swallowed up . My brother , being one that went out in the first engagement , received a fatal shot through the middle of the head . " Seth Pomeroy found time to write also to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; adding , in quaintly pious phrase , " But as God hath begun to show mercy , I hope he will go on to be gracious . " He was employed during the next few days with four hundred men in what he calls " the melancholy piece of business " of burying the dead . A letter-writer of the time does not approve what was done on this occasion . " Our people , " he says , " not only buried the French dead , but buried as many of them as might be without the knowledge of our Indians , to prevent their being scalped . This I call an excess of civility ; " his reason being that Braddock 's dead soldiers had been left to the wolves . The English loss in killed , wounded , and missing was two hundred and sixtytwo , and that of the French , hy their own account , two hundred and twentyeight , - a somewhat modest result of five hours ' fighting . The English loss was chiefly in the ambush o4* the morning , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not be carried away were tomahawked by Dieskau 's Indians . In the fight at the camp , both Indians and Canadians kept themselves so well under cover that it was very difficult for the New England men to pick them off , while they on their part lay close behind their row of logs . On the French side the regular officers and troops bore the brunt of the battle and suffered the chief loss , nearly all of the former and nearly half of the latter being killed or wounded . Johnson did not follow up his success . He says that his men were tired . Yet // five hundred of them had stood still all day , and boats enough for their transportation were lying on the beach . Ten miles down the lake a path led over a gorge of the mountains to South Bay , where Dieskan had left his canoes and provisions . It needed but a few hours to reach and destroy them , but no such attempt was made . Nor , till a week after , did Johnson send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lyman strongly urged him to make an effort to seize that all-important pass , but Johnson thought only of holding his own position . " I think , " he wrote , " we may expect very shortly a more formidable attack . " He made a solid breastwork to defend his camp , and , as reinforcements arrived , set them at building a fort on a rising ground by the lake . It is true that just after the battle he was deficient in stores , and had not bateaux enough to move his whole force . It is true , also , that he was wounded , and that he was too jealous of Lyman to delegate the command to him ; and so the days passed , till within a fortnight his nimble enemy were entrenched at Ticonderoga in force enough to defy him . The Crown Point expedition was a failure disguised under an incidental success . The . Northern provinces , especially Massachusetts and Connecticut , did what they could to forward it , and after the battle sent a herd of raw recruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Oswego , declared that his reasons for not advancing were insufficient , and urged him to push for Ticonderoga at once . Johnson replied that he had not wagons enough , and that his troops were ill-clothed , ill-fed , discon tented , insubordinate , and sickly . He complained that discipline was out of the question , because the officers were chosen by popular election ; that many of them were no better than the men , unfit for command , and like so many " heads of a mob . " The reinforcements began to come in , till in October there were thirty - six hundred men in the camp ; and as most of them wore summer clothing and had but one thin domestic blanket , they were half frozen in the chill autumn nights . Johnson called a council of war . He was suffering from inflamed eyes and his wound still kept him in his tent . He therefore asked Lyman to preside , not unwilling , perhaps , to shift the responsibility upon him . After several sessions and much debate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the army lay more than a month longer at the lake , while the disgust of the men increased daily under the rains , frosts , and snows of a dreary November . On the 22d , Chandler , chaplain of one of the Massachusetts regiments , wrote in the interleaved almanac that served him as a diary , " The men just ready to mutiny . Some clubbed their firelocks and marched , but returned back . Very rainy night . Miry water standing in the tents . Very distressing time among the sick . " The men grew more and more unruly , and went off in squads without asking leave . A difficult question arose : Who should stay for the winter to garrison the new forts , and who should command them ? It was settled , at last , that a certain number of soldiers from each province should be assigned to this ungrateful service , and that Massachusetts should have the first officer , Connecticut the second , and New York the third . Then the camp broke up . " Thursday , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we set out about ten of the clock , marched in a body , about three thousand , the wagons and baggage in the centre , our colonel much insulted by the way . " The soldiers dispersed to their villages and farms , where , in blustering winter nights , by the blazing logs of New England hearthstones , they told their friends and neighbors the story of the campaign . The profit of it fell to Johnson . If // he did not gather the fruits of victory , at least he reaped its laurels . He was a courtier in his rough way . He had changed the name of Lac St. Sacrement to Lake George , in compliment to the king . He now changed that of Fort Lyman to Fort Edward , in compliment to one of the king 's grandsons ; and , in compliment to another , called his new fort , at the lake , William Henry . Of General Lyman he made no mention in his report of the battle , and his partisans wrote letters traducing that brave officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he owed him the victory . He himself found no lack of eulogists , and , to quote the words of an able but somewhat caustic and prejudiced opponent , " to the panegyrical pen of his secretary , Mr. Wraxall , and the sic rob sic jubeo of Lieutenant-Governor iDelancey , is to be ascribed that mighty renown which echoed through the colonies , reverberated to Europe , and elevated a raw , inexperienced youth into a kind of second Marlborough .
