txt A number of the Southern newspapers , notably one or two of the New-Orleans journals , despite the press of political topics in which they are usually most interested , have recently given a great deal of attention to some of the causes which underlie the continued lack of prosperity throughout many of their vast agricultural regions . Happily , they are no longer able to attribute their impoverished condition to " carpetbag Governments . " Still , they seem to be quite incapable of looking their troubles squarely in the face , and they are as far from acknowledging , even to themselves , the real cause of those troubles as they were during the days when it was fashionable among them to prate of " the wrongs of Radical misrule . " They are still unable to find fault with themselves or to correct their own errors . The long-suffering negro is , as usual , their convenient scapegoat , and upon his already much-burdened shoulders is laid the responsibility for scant crops and deteriorated land . The New-Orleans Democrat , for instance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relation of capital and labor in the South , declares with refreshing impudence that the lack of material prosperity in many of the cottongrowing districts is due to the failure of the black men to live up to the contracts which they make under the so-called tenant and share systems . Under these systems , as it may be well to state briefly , the negroes , in the first case , lease a certain quantity of land from the white owners with the understanding that rent for it shall be paid when the crop which is raised upon it shall have been sold . To this plan the Southern critic in question objects , on the grounds that the black tenants are not responsible ; that they are very rarely able , even if they were willing , to live up to their agreements as to rent ; that they make no effort to drain the land which they lease , do nothing to enrich it , and , being generally shiftless , ignorant , and improvident , soon make waste the places which in the olden time under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " the share system , " it is objected further that the white landowner and capitalist , upon a promise of receiving the proceeds of half the crop , not only gives up his land rent free to the negro laborer , but supplies him with provisions for the year , and gives him the seeds and implements with which to cultivate the land . Under both these systems , as it is now claimed , the landowner runs all the risks , not only of a failure of the crops , but of losing whatever money he may have advanced for tools and provisions , and of the impoverishment of his land by neglect or bad treatment . All these objections to the Southern systems of cultivation may , to the uninitiated , sound most plausible , but to those who know anything about the matter it must be at once apparent that they are not only exceedingly unjust , but that they suggest no remedy for the evils complained of . As to the share system , no Southern man needs to be told that it grew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resulted from its workings has gone into the pockets of the white landed proprietors , not to the benefit of the black laborer . The system , in all its details , was a device of the whites , not of the blacks . When the war closed , the men who , prior to the attempt against the Nation 's life , had been the capitalists of the South , found themselves absolutely without ready money . They had nothing in the world but their land , and that was useless , for they no longer owned slaves to work it , and they had not a penny with which to pay for its cultivation . In their dilemma they turned to their former bondmen for help . They proposed to the blacks that they till and plant the soil without pay , and that at the end of the year the product be divided between the owner and the worker . So if the contract had been faithfully carried out the risk would have been mutual . The whites gave land ; the blacks bone and muscle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? has not been equal , the few exceptions to this rule only going to prove it . If the harvest failed , it is true . that the white proprietor lost the money which he may have advanced to buy scant bacon and meal for the black laborer and received no return from his land . He would have been in a very much worse position had his land been in New'York , for in this State the failure of a crop means not only that the farmer receives no income from his laud , but that he loses the ready money which he has paid his laborers in advance . On the other hand , whenever the crops have prospered in the South , and since the war they have almost uniformly prospered , it is a notorious fact that for his " share " the negro laborer received very little besides the provisions which were served out to him during the year , while the landowner , on one pretense or another , favored by the partisan courts and supported by public opinion , has been enabled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sale of the harvest . As to " risks " run by the Southern landlords under " the tenant system , " they may be dismissed in a few words . It is true that the negroes do not pay their rent . But it is also true that they are charged three prices for the land , which is leased to them , so that if they pay even once in every two years , the landlord , in the majority of cases , is very far from being a loser . Still , let it be admitted that both the tenant and share systems have their evils , what is the remedy ? The answer is an obvious one . If the landowners of the South want their estates to be well managed and highly productive , let them manage them themselves , paying their laborers , regularly and honestly , a fair wage for their work . Under such a system they might at least have the satisfaction of knowing that if they failed they had themselves and no one else to blame .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
