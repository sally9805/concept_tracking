txt We have from time to time given our readers extracts from the columns of a few of the more intelligent Southern papers containing admissions as to the practice of cheating and violence in the elections at the South . We were Quite confident that the running debate in the United States Senate would not pass without similar citations being offered for the consideration of the Southern Senators , who have stoutly maintained that elections in the South were as free and fair as they are in any part of the Union . Mr. GARFIELD , in his address on taking the oath of office , pointed to the defense which had been made of their policy by the authors of the suppression of the suffrage in the South , and it was substantially what we have already laid before our readers . That there has been a very general and systematic attempt in several of the Southern States to overthrow Republican Governments , and to set up white Democratic Governments by the unlawful repression or perversion of the right of voting , there is now no sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this attempt , that is still open to question . To the admissions of the Southern press we may now add those of Senator WADE HAMPTON , no mean authority , since he was the man who was elected Governor at the time of the first signal triumph of this plan in South Carolina . Mr. HAMPTON is reported in the Record as saying : " We know that there have been irregularities and frauds . I admit it , but I plead as the only justification the cruel wrongs that have been inflicted upon our people . It was a case where the very civilization , the property , the life , the State itself , were all involved . I admit that there were frauds . I admit that they were wrong . * * * I announce here , as I have done everywhere , my unalterable determination to try by the best possible means , and at the earliest possible moment , to rectify these wrongs . " These are certainly amazing statements to be made . by a Senator of the United States ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. HAMPTON frankly admits that there were " irregularities and frauds , " the first impulse is to accept that general statement , and when he declares that he is bent on rectifying the wrongs committed , he may fairly count on some respect being paid to his explanation of the motive for them . But it would be well to be just before we are generous . It would be very easy to give too much weight to the Senator 's rather vague account of the matter . The fact is that besides frauds of the most extensive character in South Carolina there was a system of the most brutal and cowardly intimidation . The vaunted " civilization " of South Carolina was " saved " by ruffians who beat and maimed and murdered defenseless men , and who not infrequently extended their zeal to the shameful treatment of women . The " property " of the State was defended by highway robbery and arson . The supremacy of the " better class , " as the Democratic journals call it , was sought through trickery and perjury and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power in New-York . Granting every assumed provocation , and even pardoning to Mr. HAMPTON , and men like him , their share in the miserable work and in the fruits of victory , the record of that campaign which preceded HAMPTON 'S election is one of the most revolting in the history of political crime . Whatever may be its present outcome or its future results , we may not forget its true character , and we may well hesitate to accept without hesitation or distrust the promise of the authors of this scheme to " rectify the wrongs " committed . We are compelled , moreover , to ask what Senator HAMPTON means by his assurance that the wrongs shall be rectified by the best " possible " means , and at the earliest " possible " moment . To a simple outsider the best possible means would seem to be to cease cheating , and the earliest possible moment would seem to be now . That this means of rectifying wrong would be " possible " without overthrowing white Democratic supremacy in South Carolina we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if the description be true which is given by the Charleston News and Courier of the state of things brought about by this supremacy , its overthrow would not be an unmixed evil . It seems ; that " cheating as a means of securing honest government " has degenerated into " cheating for the benefit of local workers ' and machine-made office-seekers . " It is the history of cheating everywhere . The Vicksburg Herald testifies that the same result has come about in Mississippi , and that the " extreme element , " which " takes the position that hypocrisy , fraud , legal subterfuges , and any shameless cunning devices are justifiable , " " is surely sapping the good of the Democratic Party in the South and retarding the prosperity of many Southern States . " It would be rash to promise Mr. HAMPTON that the abandonment of the policy of fraud would not involve the surrender of its fruits . But it will , nevertheless , have to be abandoned . These admissions by himself and by the Democratic press are proofs of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with its results , they are the death sentence of the policy . It may die peaceably , or it may be defended by its authors with the recklessness shown in its inception , but it must go , and at no very late day . And when the present tedious discussion in the Senate is over and forgotten , when Congress meets again for serious work , it will be found that the national Government , again in Republican hands , will lack neither the means nor the disposition to aid in putting an end to it .
