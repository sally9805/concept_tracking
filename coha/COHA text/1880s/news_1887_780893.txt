txt There was very little in the situation on ' Change to-day to remind either the broker in the wheat pit or the spectator.inthe gallery of Tuesday 's stampede ? or of any Panio yet to come . The day 's fluctuations were covered ' by a range of 72 to 74 cents forluly and 703s to ' 72 cents for cash wheat . The wheat pit was half empty , although the price of July was many times observed to be jumping cheer-fully about by eighths , quarters , and halves at the rate of several jumps a minute . Reports were current to the effect that Armour had sent to all the banks . offering to re-. have them of the wheat , . and this . Mr. Armour admitted , was the case . The banks , however , returned answer that they had no , wheat . for sale at present . Nevertheless , it was again stated that the banks had closed out a great deal of the cash wheat they were carrying as collateral . The heavy sales of Boyd , Paxton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . Confirmations came from so many quarters that there seems no doubt the banks did protect themselves and let a great deal or wheat go . . At 11 o'clock some small sales had brought the price of July down to 72 ' cents , when the suspension of the firm of H. P. Wadham &; Co. was announced . For a few minutes the pit was filled with scalpers , and the price sagged off 78 cent . This was the only event of the day which had any important effect on values or volume of transactions , anti it lasted less than a quarter of an hour . The failure is a small one ? for less than $5,000 , as far as can be learned ? and the chances for resumption are good . The conviction that Kershaw &; Co. will not be able to pay their way out of their present difficulties having settled down upon the firm 's creditors upon the Board of Trade , the most interesting question is , to what extent Is C. B. Eggleston , a partner in the firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a special partner to the extent of $25,060 . " It is true , " he said , " that I am transferring my property to prevent Kershaw 's creditors from attaching it . I am not disposed to stand and have my property attached for Kershaw 's debts when I am not responsible . I do not know half as much about his business as many men who are on the floor . " Robert Lindblom has a claim against Kershaw &; Co. ' for $27,000 , and has garnisheed funds of Eggleston 's to that amount in the Clearing House . Other creditors of the firm propose to follow the same course . J. A. Edwards &; Co. , who were reported as having failed on Wednesday , say they simply gave notice that they would not stand calls for excessive margins . The firm was never posted , and has met , and is meeting , all just demands made upon it . A writer in an evening paper to-night at-. tempts to clear up some of the mystery concerning the famous wheat clique by narrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clique firms . It is set forth that the clique bad about $4,000,000 of its own money here with which to ' margin the cash wheat and margins . There was money enough until Monday , when the enormous arrivals of cash wheat " queered " the clique . the cash wheat absorbed the money . " Joe " Wilshire arrived here on Monday and had a conference with the clique brokers at which he promised that money enough to tide over the trouble would be furnished on Tuesday . Some money was forthcoming on that day . Wilshire claims that sufficient was furnished and that Rosenfeld &; Co. went under not because of lack of clique funds , but because of pressure.from holdings of " taller " wheat . It is alleged that the clique money came from Netr-York . Cleveland , Philadelphlia. and Cincinnati , and that the only money taken out of Chicago by the clique was $250,000 paid over to Wilshire by Rosenfeld &; Co. , on June 3 , before Kershaw sold the block of 3,500,000 bushels June wheat . The $600,000 which arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of $100,000 drafts of the Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia , and a letter of credit for $200,000 from the Fidelity-Bank of Cincinnati .
