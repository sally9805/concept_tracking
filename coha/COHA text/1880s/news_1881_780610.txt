txt A somewhat noteworthy church suit is now pending in the Supreme Court of this county . It is an action brought by the Rev. Alfred Goldsborough , a Protestant Episcopal clergyman , against the Church Wardens and Vestrymen of Christ 's Episcopal Church in the Village of Warwick , of which Mr. Goldsborough was not long ago the Rector . Mr. Goldshorough became Rector of Christ 's Church May 1 , 1873 , and continued his ministrations in peace and harmony for several years . Whether he was still the Rector between May 1 , 1879 , and May 1 , 1880 , is disputed , but Mr. Goldsborough claims he was , and his suit , is for 5500 salary for that year . The Wardens and Vestrymen claim that the clergyman was not hired for that year , though he occupied the rectory and officiated in the church . They contend that his contract expired in 1679 , and that he was discharged . As may be supposed from this , there had been troubles in the church . These became so serious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and that the Rector was obliged to act as Treasurer himself during the year for which he sues for salary , while the church , a Pretty country edifice , is now closed and the congregation scattered . The suit brought by Mr. Goldsborough was referred by consent of counsel to the Hon. M. H. Hirschberg , of Newburg. as Referee , and the first hearing was had in December . The plaintiff was represented by E. A. Brewster , and the Wardens and Vestrymen by M. Kane. of Warwick , and County Judge Brown . Mr. Goldsborough was the only witness examined at this time . He gave evidence as to his original engagement as Rector , continuation as such , &c.,; claiming that he had served as Rector down to June . 1880. and that his salary for the year 1879-80 had not been paid . The case was then adjourned . It was no secret that there was had blood between the parties to the suit , and the Referee has sought all along to confine them to the main point at issue , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming to prevent the squabbles and bickerings of the church coming into the trial of the case . He has ceased to be successful in this . The Wardens and Vestrymen have now twice applied to amend their answer , setting up as a separate and further defense to the clergyman 's snit that the minister had been , prior to May 1 , 1879 , guilty of grossly immoral conduct , on account of which they had discharged him . The Referee denied the application once , but the defense procured another adjournment on payment of costs , and yesterday renewed the application . In the amendment which the defendants wished to make to their answer they claimed that they had discharged Mr. Goldsborough May 1 , 1879 , as they had a legal right to do . on account of his grossly immoral conduct , adding that the immoral conduct was such that the great majority , if not all , of the parishioners of the clergyman lost confidence in his integrity and honesty , and caused a large part of the parishioners to withdraw from attendance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willful lies told by the Rector about members of his church . and that he spread scandal and gossip throughout his parish and the community in which the parish is located . They further charge that the minister applied scandalous and insulting language to his parishioners from the chancel of the church on a Sunday in March , 1879 . These grave allegations were supported by affidavits made by John D. Miller , a Vestryman : Samuel B. Dobson , a Warden ; John Cowdray , Treasurer , and Samuel J. Stewart . Mr. Miller swore that Mr. Goldsborough told him that Treasurer Cowdray kept his books falsely , and applied to his own use a portion of the Sunday collections . Mr. Miller further said that the Rector charged members of the church with immorality , and the Vestryman added that ho was informed , and believed , that the clergyman spread these statements over the parish . Mr. Goldsborough 's lawyer warmly opposed the granting of the application to amend the answer and the dragging into the case of the unsavory issues it would involve . He claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith , speaking of the Wardens and Vestrymen as a wicked , depraved , and cowardly set , and alleging that they had not the courage to meet Mr. Goldsborough face to face . Referee Hirschberg took the papers and reserved his decision .
