THE railway problem involves two questions : one economical , the other political . The economical question is : How can discrimination in , and Iluctuation of , freight rates be avoided ? The political question is : How can these things be avoided without endangering the liberties of the people ? The problem is solved when it is shown how discrimination and fluctuation may be destroyed without at the same time annihilating the spirit of the Constitution . Many solutions have been proposed , and it is the object of this article to examine these systematically . In order , however , to imake the subject perfectly intelligible to the readers who are not familiar with railway terms , the examination must be prefaced *by an explanation of the term " discrimination. ** It is generally supposed that common carriers must treat all persons alike . But railways do not treat all persons alike . They give more advantageous terms to certain communities than to others ; and to certain individuals , thatj to others . These more advantageous terms are called " discriminations in favor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detriment of the remaining communities and individuals . Discriminations may be classified under three heads : First . Discrimination in favor of one or more centers of commerce , to the detriment of another or other centers of commerce . Second . Discrimination in favor of places where there is a competition between two or more railways , to the detriment of places where one of these competing lines has a monopoly . Third . Discrimination in favor of one or more individuals of a certain locality , to the detriment of other individuals of that locality . // The following is an illustration of the first class : The great Eastern centers of commerce , Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore , are connected with the great emporimn of the West , Chicago , by four great trunk lines . In 1877 , these trunk lines entered into a combination for the purpose of dividing the traffic between the above-named sea-board cities and Chicago in a fixed proportion , instead of continuing to compete for the whole of it . According to the terms of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay from two to six cents per one hundred pounds in excess of the rates charged to the people of Philadelphia and Baltimore , while the people of Boston were to pay no more than those of New York . This arrangement was a discrimination in favor of the people of Boston and to the detriment of those of New York , since the distance from Chicago to Boston exceeds the distance from Chicago to New York by at least fifty miles . It was also , in all probability , a discrimination against New York in favor of Philadelphia and Baltimore for , although the distance between New York and Chicago is somewhat greater , the gradient is so decidedly in favor of New York that , practically , neither Philadelphia nor Baltimore are as near to Chicago as is New York . The following illustrates the second class : The distance from Milwaukee to New York via the New York Central railway is about one thousand and fifty miles . The distance from Rochester to New York via the same line is three hundred and seventy-one miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onethird as much as a Milwaukee miller for transporting his flour to the New York market . The late railway investigation of this State revealed that the former was compelled to pay fifty per cent . more than the latter . The reason for this discrimination in favor of Milwaukee , to the detriment of Rochester , lies in the fact that Milwaukee is a point at which various lines terminating in New York City compete , while Rochester is a point tributary to the monopoly of the New York Central railway . The third class is illustrated by the following example : A is a small dealer in an interior town of the State ; he must pay forty , thirty , twenty-five , or twenty cents per one hundred pounds , according to the kind of goods carried for him . B is a large dealer at the same place ; he pays only thirteen cents per one hundred pounds for all kinds of goods . // Tlie evil effects of discrimination and fluctuation become apparent on the slightest reflection . The first class of discrimination alters the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very foundations . The statistical abstract of 1880 , p. 37 , shows the immense gain of Philadelphia and Baltimore and Boston , in the matter of exports , over New York since 1874 . In 1874 the value of exports from the first-named three cities amounted altogether to $88,947,643 ; in 1880 it amounted to $183,856,652 . In 1874 the value of exports from New York amounted to $340,360,269 ; in 1880 it amounted to $388,441,664 . From these figures it becomes evident that while the exports from the three ports have increased over one hundred and six per cent . in six years , the exports from New York have only increased fourteen per cent . The chief evil in this class of discriminations lies not as much in the hardship it imposes upon the losing city ( great as this evil undoubtedly is ) , as in the fact that centers so populous , and of such vast economical and political importance , should be virtually at the mercy of a handful of men , who can to-day unsettle what was settled yesterday , and to-morrow again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value , and thus promotes wild speculation , and depresses proportionately the sound producing and commercial potentialities of the whole country . The second class of discriminations resembles the first in so far that it builds up one district of the country at the expense of others . Its effects are , however , far more striking , as it operates upon smaller centers , where capital is not so abundant , and is largely invested in factories . As soon as the New York Central carried flour from Milwaukee to New York at a lower rate than it carried it from Rochester to New York , it ruined the Rochester millers . Now , in one important aspect at least , this ruin of the millers of our State acts to the manifest detriment of the whole country . If the export trade is deflected from the city of New York to Philadelphia or Baltimore , there is no apparent loss to the country , as Philadelphia and Baltimore gain what New York loses . The capital invested in that trade is chiefly circulating , and can travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capital is chiefly fixed ; it is invested in buildings and machinery , and must remain there permanently . Now , the ruin of these mills means simply the destruction of as much capital as is invested in them , not only to the injury of the // millers but to that of the whole country . The economic evil following in the train of discrimination in favor of what , in railway parlance , is called " through " traffic , and against * traffic , is in this respect more serious than the one in favor of one sea-port over another ; it not only changes the distribution of wealth according to the interests of railway corporations , it actually diminishes it . Stili more pernicious to the prosperity of the country is the working of the third class of discriminations . It aims at nothing less than the complete destruction of the middle classes . The railways carry for the rich shippers at special rates , far below their public tariff . By this means they uproot every vestige of fair competition , and thus drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , confidential and secret , and the transactions have very much the character of conspiracies . The arrangement between various railways and the Standard Oil Company furnishes a remarkable instance of this class . These railways ( NewYorkCentral , Erie , LakeShore , andPennsylvania ) found it to their advantage to divide the transportation of oil between themselves , instead of competing for it . They thought that their plan could much better be carried out if they had only one shipper to deal with , and so they determined to reduce the large number of oil shippers to one . For this purpose they made an agreement with a corporation known as the " South Improvement Company , " the members of which afterward formed the Standard Oil Company . By this agreement the South Improvement Company was protected against loss and injury by competition , and the railways bound themselves to raise the rates of freight against all the competitors of the South Improvement Company sufficiently to overcome all competition with that company . The result was , of course , that the parties forming the Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other persons who had engaged in the oil trade . Another instance of this class was the " Cattle Eveners ' PooL " In order to avoid competition among themselves , the four great trunk lines leading to New York agreed upon dividing profits . For this purposethey made a contract with three persons , by which these persons received fifteen dollars for every car-load of cattle shipped from Chicago to New York , in consideration that they would hold themselves responsible for the proper division of the // traffic . The * with such a margin in their favor , soon obtained a monopoly of the cattle business , and found no difficulty in suppressing any attempt at competition . These two instances show how monopolies are created on a large scale at points where railways compete , by the combination of these railways . At non-competitive points , each railway is of itself sufficiently powerful to create them , and is continually creating them on a smaller scale . The smaller ones are , however , even more dangerous than the great ones . The great monopolies at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the small monopoly of the dry goods house , or grocer , in a country town , does not arouse public indignation , though it be no less a result of the ruin of many competitors . To the evils of discrimination we may add those of fluetnalions of rates . The insecurity of rates ; their sudden changes in times of railway wars ; their liability to daily changes in times of peace ; the knowledge that they do not fluctuate equally with all , and that the secret fluctuations may be even more extreme than the public ; all these things intensify so considerably the evils of discrimination , that at times they become well-nigh unbearable . Under these circumstances , is it a wonder that the vague , despairing cry of anti-monopoly is heard everywhere on the face of the land ? Would it be surprising if the dark streams of communism which flow in the nether soil were to be fed and swelled to formidable proportions ? Let our conservative men see to it that the ills brought on by the present management of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be correctly solved . The solutions which have been proposed , and which seem to exhaust all possible solutions , are six in number : ( 1 ) Free competition ; ( 2 ) Competition under State control ; ( 3 ) Competition under United States control ; ( 4 ) Combination ; ( 5 ) Monopoly ; ( 6 ) National railways . Our first question is : Can the railway problem be solved by the means of a continued application of the principles of free competition ? My answer is , that if the principle of competition could ever obtain as full an application in the matter of railway transportation as it has obtained in the operations of commerce , it would undoubtedly in the end work out a cure of the grave ills to which this method of transportation has given rise . But // can this principle ever receive so full an application in railway transportation ? It can only do so if the three following conditions are satisfied . First . There must be at Least two independent railway lines , running parallel to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These independent lines must be prevented from amalgamating and from making open or secret combinations . Third . Laws must be enacted fixing the minimum of the tariff , and these laws must be capable of preventing all secret arrangements with shippers , so that they can not be evaded by rebates and drawbacks and other devices . Unless the first condition is satisfied , there never can be any tine competition whatever . The maintenance of two parallel lines between all stations of the country would , however , occasion such an enormous sacrifice of capital that it must be absolutely condemned , even if it would ultimately prove both a cure and a preventive of the wrongs which the railways have produced . Unless the second condition is satisfied , this enormous sacrifice will not only not attain il2s object , but will , on the contrary , considerably aggravate our present evils . These parallel lines would , in every instance , amalgamate or combine , and new parallel lines would have to be built ad infinitum , in order to keep competition active . Unless the third condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could prevent that in every instance one of the competing lines would cut its rates , until the others would be driven into bankruptcy . It is also necessary for the protection of solvent lines against the competition of the insolvent ones : otherwise these insolvent lines , freed from the obligation of paying dividends and interests on their bonds , would be able in every instance , to ruin the solvent onesand so finally competition would prove to be the synonym of confiscation . And now , as not a single one of these conditions can ever be satisfied , and as it is evident that unless all three of them are , there never can be any competition in the true sense of the word among railway companies , it follows that the word competition , used in connection with railways , is a misnomer . And this false use of a popular word has become dangerous and ought to be abandoned . Let us see , next , whether competition in the sense used , when applied to railway transportation , and which now regulates it , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But the nature of this pseudo competition must be first examined . True competition presupposes an open market into which all sellers and buyers freely come . Each seller is free to seek the custom of every buyer , and each buyer is free to seek the wares of every seller . And this freedom is of the very essence of competition . Let us suppose it to be absent . Let us suppose that in a certain district there live four merchants , and that all the buyers of the district are compelled to buy their goods of these merchants . Let us suppose further that the buyers are divided into five classes , and that four of these classes are parceled out among the four merchants in such a manner that the first class can only buy of merchant A , the second class of merchant B , the third class of merchant C , and the fourth class of merchant D the fifth class , however , remains free to buy wherever it pleases . Would not any one , who might characterize such a dismal state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge of being either a knave or a fool ? Now , what course wiji business take in such a district The four sellers , each secure in the possession of the custom of one class of buyers , will compete d l'outrance for the custom of the fifth class . This competition will be carried on without the slightest regard to the cost price of the wares - the great regulating factor of competition under ordinary circumstances . But each merchant will sell at any price obtainable , expecting to make up all his losses by increasing his charges on the class parceled out to him . The only restriction which will save this class from absolute confiscation is the conviction of the merchants that it would not be profitable to drain it completely . The maxim by which this class would be treated would be expressed in the aphorism , " Tax it as much as it will bear . " In other words , these merchants would discriminate against the class over which they exercise the power of monopoly in favor of the class for which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sell cheaply to Paul . Such a system of competition would not only belie the name , but the manifest evils which it would originate would soon make it intolerable . And yet this is a fair picture of what is called railway competition , and which most people suppose is a perfectly proper system , or at all events the best one on which the great business of transportation can be conducted . // The four merchants are the four great trunk lines . The district embraces a large number of States and millions of people . The first four classes are the communities tributary to a single one of these lines , and the fifth class embraces a few great cities to which all the four great lines extend , and for whose traffic they compete . At the four competing points , competition is carried on in defiance of all laws of economy . At the numerous monopolized stations , the loss necessarily entailed by this competition is made up , regardless of all dictates of right . And this so-called system of competition is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition with the worst forms of monopoly . Now let us ask whether the pseudo-competition just described , if permitted to develop , can be relied upon eventually to solve the railway problem . We have seen that the fundamental evils of our system of railway management consist in two things , namely , discrimination and fluctuation . The question , therefore , resolves itself into this : Will the principle of pseudo-competition or competitionmonopoly ever be able to cure these evils ? The answer will be easy when we remember that this system is the very root and cause of discrimination and fluctuation . The competition , for instance , of the four trunk lines running between the four great sea-ports and Chicago , at those ports and that city , brings about periodical railway wars ; these wars cause the wildest fluctuations of rates . That these fluctuations are , however , attributable only to the monopoly enjoyed by the competitive lines at other points* becomes evident when we take into consideration that if it were not for this monopoly the four trunk lines could not carry for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence the competition-monopoly principle is responsible for fluctuations in rates . All railway wars are continued until the stronger can force the weaker into a truce profitable to the former . These truces or combinations are to put a temporary stop to competition , and are based on the principle of dividing the traffic instead of fighting for it . They can , however , not be brought about unless the more favorably situated roads allow themselves to be handicapped . Thus , for example , as the roads forming the most direct communications between Chicago and New York would take too large a proportion of the traffic , on account of the advan // tages of New York , the rates from Chicago to New York must be raised above those to Baltimore and Philadelphia , or no truce will be possible . It appears , therefore , that under the competition-monopoly principle of conducting railways , the competition at the competitive point invariably brings on railway wars , and that these wars can only be temporarily stopped by means of combinations , discriminating against the most favorably located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminations is this very principle . It would be absurd , indeed , to expect its cure from this quarter . The competition at the competing points , carried on as it is regardless of the question of cost of transportation , is only maintainable by the absolute power of the railways in the monopolized districts . Our present competition-monopoly system is , therefore , likewise the direct cause of the second class of discrimination , namely , that in favor of through , and against local , traffic . Being its cause , it can never become its cure . The competition at competing points requires for its success an artificial stimulus to certain business people at the monopolized points , so as to obtain powerful allies in times of railway war . For this reason , certain businesses must be fostered at the expense of others , and certain people enriched at the expense of others . And as certain combinations can only be carried out by having a monopoly instead of a number of competing individuals to deal with , they will bring about occasionally an accessory combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating such a monopoly . Witness the Anthracite Coal Combination , the Standard Oil Company , andthe Cattle Eveners ' Pool . This class of discriminations , being also directly attributable to the system of competition-monopoly , I fail to see how any development of this system will ever cure it . In fact , as long as railways are managed on this irrational principle , they will be perfectly justifiable in continuing to perpetrate these evils . Their arguments in palliation of their methods of action are , indeed , when considered in the light of this principle , simply unanswerable . The principle is responsible , and not the corporations . How can one line regulate its tariff at a competing point according to the cost of transportation ? Would it not immediately be underbid by the others , and completely driven off the field ? But if it must take traffic at the competing point regardless of cost , must it not be permitted to . // offset its losses by taking the traffic at the monopolized point sufficiently high to overcome this necessary loss ? If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will then become of competition ? The economic law which compels railways to discriminate against local traffic is inexorable . We can not have competition without this species of discrimination . But wars can not be continued forever , or not only the railways , but also the general business of the country , will be ruined . Consequently truces will be necessary and welcome . But truces mean discrimination against the localities favored by nature . This law is also inexorable . How can the railways avoid it ? This species of discrimination is certainly not in the interest of the road submitting to it . It loses as much as the city it feeds . Then do not let us be so inconsistent as to accuse the roads ; let us rather accuse the principle . Even their discriminations in favor of individuals can be excused . People who are at any tine liable to be dragged into expensive wars must be allowed means of defending themselves . Railways require allies , and those individuals become powerful ones . The principle , again , is responsible . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed of a disease , if only allowed to act unchecked , will eventually cure it . It is not insignificant that the principle has been abandoned in every country of the world excepting the United States . The second solution which has been proposed is competitionmonopoly tempered by State controL This control , in order to accomplish anything of practical value , must consist in regulating the maximum of the tariff . It will have the questionable advantage of protecting the citizens of the State against discrimination beyond this maximum  --  a slight protection only against discrimination , as the maximum rate will still be far above the rate obtainable at competing points . It will have the unquestionable disadvantage of ruining the railways within the State , and consequently of eventually ruining the citizens , who were beginning to imagine themselves protected . These are saved from the frying-pan by being mercifully thrust into the fire . The authority of the State is limited to its boundaries . The roads which feed the States extend beyond them to competing points . At the competing points , competition is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best rates they are able to make . These will be far below the cost of transportation . The railway 10 // which has a maximum fixed for it can not offset its loss at the monopolized points , and ruin is the consequence The State now perceives the folly of its course , and repeals the maximum rates with greater celerity than it fixed them . This is the vicious circle in which State control of rates must move . It permits no solution of our problem . The third solution , which would place the control of rates in the power of Congress , would probably require an amendment of the Constitution empowering Congress to legislate on transportation within a State . Even if it were adopted , no law could ever be framed under it which would bring us a step nearer to the solution we seek . How could a maximum rate be established which would operate fairly for all the roads of the country ? And if it could , of what avail would it be unless there was a second law establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils under which we are now suffering would continue unabated , and no one knows how many new ones would be added . The fourth proposed solution , combination , must be considered either as the combination of all the railways of the country under several independent organizations , or as the combination of all the railways in a single organization . Both these species necessarily bring about discriminations against certain cities , favorably situated , in order to produce a factitious advantage for the less favorably situated . Neither can , therefore , cure the evil of the first class of discriminations . Both these species will leave the two other classes of discriminations in the present condition , as each of the combining railways will retain the absolute control over the districts tribntary to it , and will continue to tax those districts to the extent which they will bear . The necessity of so acting will be forced on each of them , for the reason that combinations are known by experience to mean only truce , and not peace ; and no railway will dare to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that by so doing it may court ruin in the next war . The evils of fluctuation will be temporarily checked , but only to acquire increased violence a the break . Nor would it improve matters much if these breaks were to be prohibited by law ; for such laws could be evaded , or public opinion might force their repeal . They could never convert the armed truce into peace . Certainly , combination is not the solution of the problem . // We have seen thus that all the various forms of pseudo-competition fail absolutely to furnish a method according to which railways can be managed . We have seen , too , that the failure is not accidental , something which may be remedied by experience so as to disappear in time , but that this failure is of the very essence of the competition principle . We have seen that to it alone all the economic ills incident to transportation with which we are plagued are attributable ; that it is the root and poisonous principle of the disease , and must be eradicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inquire whether monopoly is or is not the proper method to be applied in the management of railway transportation . It must be admitted that there is no inherent reason which will prevent monopoly from curing the economic evils of discrimination and fluctuation . The cost of transportation on the various branches could be calculated , and the tariff fixed accordingly . The wielder of the vast power might find it to his interest to satisfy popular demands , and might be actuated by the policy of treating all persons fairly . Large cities , small cities , through traffic , local traffic , rich and poor , would all be alike before him , and he might , if he chose , treat them alike . Indeed , why should he take from one to give to another , when all are equally within his control ? There would also be an immense saving in running expenses , so that the rates would be considerably reduced , and the industries of the country proportionately advanced . And it is because the economic laws have utterly condemned competition between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to actually accomplish a monopoly ; for this solution , whatever its disadvantages , is not condemned by logic as an absurdity . And so , if the handful of men who control the vast system of transportation in a country containing fifty million of people , should to-day come together with the intention of establishing a monopoly , it would be established to-day-all the vague and vehement opposition , however wide-spread , notwithstanding . And , after its accomplishment , the people would gladly acquiesce , for they are tired of war and discrimination and fluctuation . And yet , the establishment of such a monopoly , however advantageous it might be for a time , would in the end not fail to undermine the constitution and entire political system of the country . IMore than that , the monopolist would become , in fact , the empe // ror of the United States . He would own president , legislature* and courts , and could bequeath his monarchy , as private property , to his eldest son . In the not distant future the ills from which monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Monopoly , therefore , though a satisfactory solution of the economic difficulty of our problem , ought to be , for political reasons , incontinently rejected . But have we the power to do so ? Is it not already too late ? This is a practical question , which can not be answered excepting by an actual trial of strength . At all events , it is certain that in order to have any chance of success whatever , something must be opposed to the monopoly principle which shall offer to the people all its economic advantages without its political dangers . Unless this can be done , the contest is decided in advance . Is there such a thing ? I answer , there is . The seventh proposed solution of the railway problem , placing the entire matter of railway transportation on the highways in the hands of the people of the United States , can cure all economic ills as well as monopoly can do it , for it has all the advantages of the latter , and will bring on none of the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its disadvantages . In this sign alone can monopoly be conquered . And here again let me caution against the misuse of a word ; for , popularly , the management of a railway by the State is also known by the name of monopoly . The slightest reflection , however , will show that the ownership and management of a thing by a nation for the benefit of the whole nation , is the very contrary of monopoly , which means the ownership and management of a thing by one person for the benefit of one person . If the coining of a new word is ever to be allowed , it ought to be in this case . Such an ownership has all the advantages of monopoly , inasmuch as it would be as little under the necessity of discriminating or of making frequent and sudden changes in rates as the latter . It would , moreover , be more certain to cure the economic evils from which we are now suffering , for the reason that while the monopolist might or might not consider it to his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private interest first , the nation has no private interest to consult ; and while the monopolist would be responsible to no one , and introduce the needed reforms according to his pleasure , the national railways // would be managed by the responsible agents of the United States , and amenable directly to its supervision . And we must consider that even were it possible theoretically to frame laws controlling the monopoly and making it responsible to the people , practically such laws would either not be framed or not be enforced , owing to the tremendous power the monopolist would wield , while the fixing of just rates for national railways would be a simple matter . A formula containing all the elements which enter into the cost of transportation could be determined by law , and then the rates be fixed strictly according to this formula . The disadvantages which will probably be popularly objected to national railways are : First , That they would tend to centralization . Second , The evils of paternal government . Third , That our civil service is too corrupt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the first objection I reply that railway management of a country requires a certain degree of centralization . The whole system of railways is in reality but a single machine , and we are suffering from the confusion , demoralization , and oppression caused by the fact that it is run by numerous engineers according to private and contradictory plans. / Excessive centralization can be easily avoided , as , for instance , * it is in the present Prussian state railway system . Moreover , we must remember that centralization is forced on us by the nature of things , and we only have the choice between intrusting it to our own agent , the Government , responsible directly to us and acting for us , or intrusting it to a private individual , with interests different from and colliding with ours , and responsible to no one . The second objection arises out of confusion in the use of the word government . Government may mean the private right of a dynasty , with private interests distinct from , and , perhaps , opposed to , those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes in the Middle Ages , the masters of the governed . Or it may mean the exercise of a trust , for public purposes alone , and by servants of the governed , which is the system of the United States . In the first case , the general welfare is often only a misnomer for the private welfare of the dynasty , and the promotion of the former often only a mask to accomplish the promotion of the latter . In the second case , there is no private welfare of a dynasty to be cared for , under any mask , and all // measures for the promotion of the public welfare are taken with the consent of the public , under its eyes , and by its servants . On the other hand , if we permit the railways to come within the control of a private individual , then we will raise up a private dynasty which will govern us paternally for its own inte*est and pleasure . Already now the railway magnates openly declare that it is their desire to foster and protect commerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would the sovereign . What spectacles would we not behold after the establishment of the monopoly ? We would see a nation on its knees before a more absolute potentate than ever ruled . Let us never forget that ( if we must forsooth call a government paternal , because it does its bounden duty of controlling the nation 's highways ) it is infinitely better to have a paternal government of all , by the agents of all , for the interests of all , than that all should be paternally governed by one for the interests of one . With regard to the third objection , I would answer that the chief danger to a free country is not the corruption of the civil service , but that of the legislature . The principles which regulate the civil service are responsibility and subordination ; the principles which regulate the legislature are irresponsibility and independence . The former is under the complete control of the latter ; the latter is under no control whatever . A corrupt civil service can not exist where the legislature is pure ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is less dangerous , so also it is more difficult to corrupt the civil service than to corrupt the legislature . The civil servant , if bribed , is bribed to commit a violation of the law , which is a crime ; the legislator , if bribed , is bribed to vote , and to vote is his duty . But if legislators are not steeled against the corrupting influences of railways , even under our present system , how can we expect them to become so against the constant baits of a stupendous monopoly controlling the wealth of the whole country ? On the other hand , with the railroads out of private hands , there is every reason to believe that the atmosphere in our legislative halls will become purified ; and a purer legislature would . find less difficulty in establishing for us a purer civil service .
