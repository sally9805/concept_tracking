through the air , waking the echoes of the hills , as the butcher 's bludgeon went through the goblin head of the milk-white cow , and the butcher himself reeled with the force of his blow and plunged his astonished head against the stomach of an unfortunate by-stander . At the same time a green lady was seen standing on a crag high up over the lake , with her arms outstretched toward the elfin cow , while she uttered this call to the wronged animal : " Come , yellow Anvil , Stray horns , spotted one of the lake , And of the hornless Dodin , Arise , come home . " At the sound of this voice the elfin cow raised her head and looked up at the crag ; then , with a bound over the heads of the assembled multitude , she dashed up the steep acclivity , and all her descendants , even to the third and fourth generations , went with her , disappearing over the summit of the crag and plunging into the lake . Only one cow remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned from milky white to raven black .

CHRISTMAS SONG . WRITTEN FOR THE OLD TYROLESE MELODY , " SILENT NIGHT . " SILENT night ! shadowy night ! Purple dome , starry light ! Pouring splendor of centuries down , Gold and purple , a glorious crown , Where the manger so rude and wild Cradles a sleeping child . Silent night ! mystical night ! Kings and seers sought thy light . Where the watch of the shepherds is kept , Heavenly hosts through the stillness have swept , Clear proclaiming a Saviour born ! Singing the Christmas morn ! Holy night-heralding dawn ! Far and near breaks the morn ! Breaks the day when the Saviour of men , Bringing pardon and healing again , " Holy , harmless , and undefiled , " Cometh a little child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks well for the Christian intelligence of the American people that they are so eager for the appearance of the Revised Version of the New Testament , now promised for publication this winter . Curiosity is quite lost in the deeper feeling of hope that at last our feet may tread upon surer. ground in the investigation of truth . For many silent years some of us orthodox people have been thrown heavily back upon our admiration for the version we use , and upon our loyalty to the venera ble Bible Society which issues it . We ought to be credited with a good measure of patience , for we surely have never concealed our convictions that it is possible to retain whatever is historically precious in the King James Bible , and yet eliminate the patent blemishes from some of the verses . We may be pardoned for admitting that we have grown tired of quoting the eleventh of Jude , and then waiting for the chirk superintendent to explain : " Now , children , that does not mean Core , but Korali ; Numbers xvi . i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer be put to the task of explaining that in two cases , Hebrews iv . 8 , and Acts vii . 45 , our Bible Society chooses to print the name " Jesus " instead of Joshua . We can be content to admit " Poti-pherah " for Po/*z5har , for they are only similar names for two persons ; but we find no apology for " Timothy " and " Timotheus " in the same chapter , applied to one man whom ministers have so much to say about . What right have Christian people to continue to publish and circulate as inspired what now many of them know is imperfect and inaccurate , and so suggests persistent doubts ? Let us understand that it is not the teachers or the preachers alone who do the fault-finding . Who does not know that if you should hold up a superlatively excellent bottle of apothecary 's ointment before an inquisitive boy , the first thing he would fasten his eyes upon would be the flies inside of it ? So the first thing to do afterward would be just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent suggestions has generally been sharp and impetuous . The man who asks them has been set up as a butt of attack for bad taste in finding fault with a version that some " English Roman Catholic scholar " has declared to be the best pattern of " uncommon beauty and marvelous English . " What has this to do with the fact that it is fatiguing to keep going over an old contradiction with our children ? " By and by " has long since ceased to mean immediately , and " let " now means just the opposite of hindered . One is usually asked if he can not find better occupation than carping at small blemishes in the midst of " superlative excellence . " Now this is as unfair as it well can be . Is it necessary to the supreme glory of this translation that there should be , in I. Cor. xvi . 22 , a comma after " anathema , " and before " Maran atha , " instead of a period ? Is an inquiring minister undermining confidence in this excellent version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelled Noah , so that he might be spared the explanation of it for the three times out of six where it occurs in the New Testament ? It is needless to try to conceal the fact that there is much uneasiness as to the manner in which the New Revision is presently to be issued . It seems to be generally understood that British publishers are to have the entire editions in charge , and only their sheets are to be offered in the American market . If the publishing houses of the United States , as well as the Bible Society and Tract Society and Sunday-school Union , and eventually the denominational Boards of all the churches , should h*ippen to be nobly jealous of this monopoly-if some high sense of national honor should lead them to deny that a volume of common ownership and interest like the New Testament ought to claim even that fiction of " moral copyright " which authors are talking aboutthen it would surely be very difficult to show wherein their pain resembled petu. lance , or why their regret should be pronounced mercenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Christian students and teachers is not caused by any - fear of losing dollars and cents from the sale of a new publication . The New Testament is sold for five cents now , and a whole Bible for a quarter of a dollar . So there is no special promise of gain held out in that direction . There are already a half-dozen cheap serial " libraries " in this one city of New York , and they are beginning to include religious books among their stories and romances . Several of them began with Canon Farrar 's " Life of Christ , " coupling it with his " Life of St. Paul . " Then Conybeare and Howson 's " Life and Epistles of St. Paul " appeared in a like form , followed by Geikie 's " Life of Christ . " Hughes 's " Manliness of Christ " has been thus printed , and Bunyan 's " Pilgrim 's Progress " is in prospect . Such volumes , alongside of Dumas 's novels and Sue 's romances , seem incongruous ; but why must religion not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses do not catch up the New Version the moment it is put in type , they will be exceedingly foolish in a business way ; shown on the corner stands , it would have an enormous sale . And why should they not ? Will it be unfortunate to have the New Testament in a cheap pamphlet so that every one can obtain a copy of it for twenty cents ? Will it not be to edification to find the novel-printers and the serial-story publishers competing with one another in circulating an edition of the revised and scholarly New Translation of the Bible ? The chief anxiety in connection with any kind of unauthorized issuing of a volume like the Word of God is found in the exposure to mistake and the liability to positive perversion . The familiar religious works mentioned above , although claiming to be " unabridged , " are incomplete at // 449 points . Any one who pleases can easily compare Farrar 's bound volume with the pamphlet , and imagine how indignant the author must be with the reproduction . We must run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing short of positive accuracy will content us in an issue of the Scriptures . The spelling , the paragraphing , the punctuation , the italicizing , are all of immeasurable importance . Let us remember how unfortunately exposed the wisest proof-readers are to charges of carelessness , and how nearly impossible it is to be absolutely accurate . Is not the " breeches " Bible the laughing-stock of old-edition hunters ? It was so named from the word in Gen. iii . 7 : " They made themselves breeches . " Who forgets the " not " Bible , sometimes called the " wicked " Bible , because it omitted the nega'tive in the seventh commandment ? Laud fined an unlucky printer fifteen hundred dollars for this mistake , and then suppressed a large and costly edition already in the market . Then there was the " placemakers ' Bible , " named thus because of the misrendering of the beatitude : " Blessed are the peacemakers . " So we recollect the " bug " Bible , and the " treacle " Bible , and the " rosin " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this time we begin to understand what Cotton Mather deplores , when he writes that " a blundering typographer " had made in his Bible , at Psalm cxix. i6i , a most suggestive mistake : " Printers have persecuted me without cause . " Indeed , this was the very word which the man had inserted in the place of " princes . " Now , it may not be within our achievement to attain entire correctness ; but Christian readers will not be satisfied with anything very far short of it-that is to say , they are not going to be patient if this great work falls into hands which can not be trusted . Hence it is of intense importance that the earliest editions of this Revision should be watched , for it will be hard to pick out mistakes later . The sensitiveness upon such points is well illustrated by those discussions which grew out of the changes in the Apostles ' Creed , a few years ago . Only the difference between a semicolon and a comma set some usually quiet men on fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the Holy Catholic Church , the communion of saints , " with the comma after " church , " means , I believe in the Holy Catholic Church , as the communion of saints , or , I believe the Holy Catholic Church is composed of the communion of saints of all names and all ages , on earth and in heaven . But the semicolon after " church , " so some said , makes it to mean , I believe in the church , and then again , I believe in the communion of saints . Hence , in opposing the alteration , some disputants argued against constituting the church an authority in any matters of faith . And then they went on to combat the notion that saints were to be believed in after death , although they " one communion make . " All this difference of opinion was provoked by a punctuation mark . Are there any such cases in the Bible ? Surely . No doubt this Revising Committee have spent days in canvassing the vexed question raised in I. Tim . iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , save me from this hour . " Ought that clause to be followed , as it is now , by a colon , or by an interrogation point ? Such things are vital to sense . Twenty-five years ago several more instances were pointed out , and by no less an authority than Dr. Hodgeclarum et venerabile izomen , great with the majesty of death upon it now . He calls attention to Rom. iv . i , in which the words , " according to the flesh , " if pointed in one way , qualify the word " father " ; thus Abraham is said to be our " father according to the flesh . " But if the clause should be pointed in the other way , then it qualifies " hath found " ; thus the question asked in the verse is , What hath Abraham found according to the flesh ? So he says about Rev. xiii . 8 , those words , " from the foundation of the world , " may refer to the word " slain , " and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of the world . " But if they refer to the word " written , " the sense must be , " written from the foundation of the world . " Hence , he rightly remarks , " to alter the punctuation here is to change the sense of the passage . " That punctuation is changed in our present version . Now the opinion is gaining ground among all thoughtful people that a definite and persistent endeavor should be made by American Christians to help the Bible Society here at home prepare to assume the wise work of publishing immediately an edition of this New Version which should bear for us the imprint and authorization that we know and love . We feel a sincere reluctance to receive our Book from an // English University . Our scholars have worked upon it early and late . We believe their learning has been valuable to the joint Committee . We know their services have been rendered generously in season and out of season . And we want their labors to come to this country with an American look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question might be raised whether the time has not come when the American Bible Society can perfect their own issue , and bring this Common Version into such form as will enable it to bear fair comparison with the new one , whatever it proves to be . Even Dr. Hodge admitted that some changes in the text proposed and made before 1857 were scholarly improvements , and he said more yet might have been adopted , if they had only come away around by Great Britain- " gradually introduced , first in Oxford , then in Cambridge , then in London and Edinburgh , then in New York ; " for after that " it would be the Received Version , and our own Bible Society would be authorized to print and circulate it . " Is it not worth a postal card now to ask whether the tidal wave of British permission to change the printer 's mistake of " she " in Ruth iii . is , is not by this time drawing somewhere near our desolate shores ? We might not read Solomon 's Song ii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some comfort to find that in the course of a quarter of a century , leave had been obtained from Oxford and Cambridge and London and Edinburgh for New York Christians to put the masculine pronoun " he " off the name of a bride , so as to call her " she , " like a woman . Indeed , we are not certain that the English have not done this ; and if so , a proper activity might follow it up here within a winter or so . Popular feeling has been lately aroused on this whole subject . In order to give the New Version a proper send-oft ; it has been deemed necessary to parade somewhat conspicuously the exigencies of the case , that is to say , the paramount demand for this fresh translation of the Scriptures . The arguments have been drawn from a detailed exhibition of the blemishes in the King James Bible . But who does not feel that the first result of this is to break the confidence in the version which we are using ? When the scholarship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction , who can complain that the common people are startled ? For the channels of communication which are the most direct into and through all the churches , the Sabbath-schools , and the families , have been selected for the advertisement . Here , for example , is an extra issue of the " World , " the organ of the American Sunday-school Union , a " Bible-revision Number , " October , 1878 ; it contains sixteen solid , finely printed pages of specific criticism upon that very version which is now put in the hands of us all as authoritative , " the old version of i6ii . " This has been sent to all the cities , towns , villages , from the center to the frontier , to which this vast national agency is accustomed to reach out its hand ; moreover , it has since been printed in a bound volume , and is now offered for sale upon the counters everywhere . And this is only one out of the many ways in which public sentiment in behalf of the New Version has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question such a policy ; it seems admirably chosen . But can not every one understand that when these great names of President Woolsey , Professor Abbott , Chancellor Crosby , Professor Thayer , Professor Strong , and Professor Schaff , able and evangelical as they are , are invoked , power will go with any appeal they make ? They seem to us to say that there are scores , or hundreds , or thousands of imperfections in the version we daily use . Is there anything new in their discoveries ? The language of Dr. Hodge , in 1857 , may be quoted in reply : " It appears from the collation of the editions of i6i i with those of Oxford , Cambridge , London , Edinburgh , and the standard edition , there are no less than twenty-four thousand discrepancies ; that is , twenty-four thousand c*ises in which these standard editions fail to concur. ** Of course , in a computation like this no mention is made of the points wherein this version diverges from the Greek or the Hebrew in translation , about which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his information from the Bible Society itselt ; which published the facts as he states them in its " Annual Report " of i8*r . Indeed , the Committee on Versions were instructed to correct some of the most annoying of these imperfections . They did so ; they made a few alterations with no other thought than that of getting the best edition of their regular version they could . They spelled " Noe " Noah . They said , in several instances , seraphim , and cherubim , instead of " seraphims , " and " cherubims . " They began " spirits " with a small s . They // 45 ' restored I. John ii . 23 to Roman letters . All they ever did in this direction was right and good ; Dr. Hodge frankly acknowledged that it was " generally for the better . " But he remarked , in a rather contemptuous fashion , " Not one reader in a thousand would notice the alterations , unless they were pointed out . " The Society publicly approved what their Committee on Versions had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cast new plates for their issues . They even bragged , in a goodnatured , artless sort of way , over their success . They put forth a splendid volume from their fresh stereotypes . This they kept in circulation , unquestioned , for several years . In December , i8*6 , they openly sent a copy of it to several statesmen of our own country , as a complimentary gift , and notably also to Queen Victoria , with a very nice letter , in which they told Her Majesty that they " believed it to be an unusually correct edition of that incomparable version . " Indeed it was : it remains ( out of print now ) a witness to the fidelity , the learning , and the patient laboriousness of that Committee on Versions who afterward suffered so much for their pains ,  --  the most fair and beautiful thing the American Bible Society ever gave to the world . But then came a storm . Less than a fortnight after this , and before the Queen could have received her new Bible , or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  in January , 1857 , the Rev. A. C. Coxe , then rector of a parish in Baltimore , now one of the bishops of the Episcopal Church , published a pamphlet , in which he violently arraigned the Bible Society for seeking to " supersede the time-honored version in its integrity . " He said , with an insulting figure , drawn from criminal coining , that these Christian men had surreptitiously gone into the circulation of a " cold , modernized , vulgarized work . " Further : with a form of speech peculiarly his own , the writer proceeded to announce , as the reason for such conduct , " the tendency of all human institutions to corrupt themselves , especially when they have begun to be rich . " The brick edifice on Astor Place had lately been finished , and so he added : " The American Bible Society , in its new palace , and surrounded by the great moneyed mart of this hemisphere , waxes fat , like Jeshurun , and , like him , begins to kick . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want the Scriptures to be " vulgarized , " took upon himself in those days to say . All this , however , would have gone for nothing , if it had not been for the fact that this disingenuous pamphlet went on to state , more than once , that the Society had made twenty-four thousand changes in the version of i8i6 . Now , what the Society had published six years before , in their report of was that the Committee on Versions had found twenty-four thousand differences from the standard edition of i6ii . Some few of the roughest of these they had tried to correct . With the utmost care , they had done what they supposed was going to be welcome to every student of the Bible . Even Dr. Hodge afterward patronized them enough to say , in 1858 , that they were conscientious , as was Paul , when he persecuted the Christians : " We cheerfully acknowledge the zeal and ability manifested in the work ; they , as was the case with the apostle , no doubt thought they were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with " a thoroughly unevangelical spirit , " and argued that they were entertaining at the Bible House , as they were in " New England , " the demon of rationalism , now " exorcised from its German haunts . " It does seem , at this distance , that persecuting Christians in Saul 's day was rather more heinous than changing " sodering " so as to read soldering , and " rere-ward " so as to read rearward ; or adding one Ii to " Juda , " and another to " Sara , " and casting a third out of " Chanaan , " or putting a final i on " Sina , " and spelling " Sion " with a Z Whereabouts did the rationalism come in ? The virulence and falseness of this attack is seen from a single paragraph , which we prefer to give by itself : " For more than thirty years the Society is said to have celebrated its great anniversary festivals , in the presence of hundreds of professed ministers of Christ , without a prayer for his blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity ; and that , confessedly , on the ground of the radical differences among its constituents as to the very nature of God , and the proper manner of invoking His adorable name . * * * Can such an association be a safe witness and keeper of Holy Writ ' ? It has answered the question by making itself a manufacturer of alloy , and debasing the very standard it is pledged to circulate in its integrity . " So these men had been counterfei/ing/ This figure , which pleased the author of // qwq except with ENTIRE UNAAZZA/ITYon the p a rt of/lie Committee and those acting with them . " The Bible Society published this sentence in the Annual Report they issued in 1852 , with the italics and the capitals as here given . Six years afterward , Dr. Spring disowned the transaction , and gave up the defense ; perhaps , as Dr. Breckenridge says , he was " blind . " It is fair to say , that , in his speech before the Board of Directors , Dr. Spring is reported as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resigning ; but " since listening to the remarks of his associates , and especially since hearing the menaces which had been uttered with regard to the continued existence and prospects of the Bible Society , he had determined to stand at his post , even if he stood alone . " He added that " he thought his associates had greatly erred , and he hoped they would yet see and acknowledge their error . " From this it is not easy to say whether Dr. Spring forsook his brethren on principle , or because he was annoyed by indiscreet talking on so exciting a theme and occasion . And now commenced the period of controversy ; for a few strong champions , chosen leaders of those veterans whose " strength is to sit still , " took up the hue and cry . On the other hand , Dr. Tyng wrote an excellent letter , lamenting the dire necessity of " going back to admitted errors and imperfections . " Dr. James Hoge hastened into print to show how he stood , pronouncing Dr. Hodge 's article " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee on Versions spiritedly ; but when he found fault with them for injuring the antique style of the Bible by changing " asswage " to assuage , he counted himself out of the discussion . Dr. Breckenridge collapsed rather suddenly ; for he found he had as much on his hands as he could attend to at the moment , in repelling the awkward charge of plagiarism which some theologians were pressing : he had published a volume of divinity , and they said he pilfered the best part of it from Stapfer . Dr. Murray ( " Kirwan " ) did what he could to allay suspicion by kind words : " I am free to confess that I regard this edition as the very best of the Version of King James with which I am acquainted : the entire question hinges on a question of power . " That was the ground held firmly , from the earliest moment it was taken : that the Bible Society had no right or " power " to change a letter or a point ; they must " just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , and print it . " The conclusion reached is best put in the words of the " New York Observer " : the course of that paper seems all along to have been quite fait ai ' *d considerate , and the brightest pen in the whole conflict could never have bettered the formula of decision it gave : " The Society is not only not bound , but is forbidden , to publish the best Bible it can make . " But it also added : " Ninety-nine hundredths of all the work of revision recently made by the much abused Committee on Versions is the result of collation , and will stand , and ought to stand . Let the alterations be restored , but the collations be respected . " That was well and wisely said for such a day . But it was not heeded . The Society made a quite needless surrender . They returned from " John the Baptist " to " John Baptist , " and restored all the errors to their old places , just as they are publishing the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said thus far in this article about the headings of the chapters ; for no man insists that they are part of that inspired book which the Society is limited to print ; even Dr. Hodge admitted that the Society was at perfect liberty to leave them out , and he said this , too , after having declared that this was " by far the worst feature of the case " ; that is , the Committee had made a series of alterations in these which gave him more concern and more offense than anything else . The Society , however , after a long debate in the Board of Directors , decided to retain them in their old form . They actually went back to repeating in Genesis xxii. , " Isaac is exchanged with a ram , " as they do now ; in Genesis I. , they kept this : " He dieth , and is chested , " instead of embalmed ; and this in Num. xiv. : " Mosespersuadeth God , and obtained pardon " ; and this in Esther v. : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this in Matt. xxii. : " And poseth the Pharisees about the Messias " ; and , *most astonishing to think , this in I. Sam . xvi. : " Samuel sent by God , under pretense of a sacrifice , cometh to Bethlehem . " These may now be discovered in the Bibles which the children have in our mission-schools . We can only bow our heads and wonder . So at last there was peace , and this woful story went on its way into history . Why bring up such an old controversy now ? Well , no one wants that old controversy ; // what we want is this New Revision . And we desire to receive it at the hands of the American Bible Society , to which we have clung loyally through evil and through good report for a whole generation . There can be no mistake in declaring that the Christian community wishes that the revised Testament , if it shall prove worthy of general acceptance , shall be published like our other Scriptures , and by our usual authorities . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said above leads even the most sanguine of us to doubt whether this can be now done . It is likely that , in 1857 , the Bible Society tied with its fingers what , hereafter , it can not untie with its teeth . If this be true , then two serious questions confront us all for answer . First ,  --  Will there be a contest and competition in our markets between the New and the Old ? So far , there is evidence of cordial working together . We find on the list of revisers making the New Version the name of the chairman of the present Committee on Versions in the Bible Society . Also , the name of the chairman of the Finance Committee , providing funds for the revisers , stood among those who constitute the Bible Society 's Committee on Publication . This good man has just died ; but we argue from the fact of his having occupied a double position so prominent that the two bodies are friendly . Are we to expect that this criticism of the Old will go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to feel at liberty hereafter just to peck at the Bibles we already have , and will this provoke the usual retort , and tongues equally sharp and eyes equally keen be occupied with faults they may find in these that are coming ? Secondly ,  --  Will there have to be another Bible Society ? Does any one suppose the American people are likely to be content with a steady importation of sheets from over the ocean ? Some persons are sanguine enough to believe that this New Version will be-what surely it ought to bethe mature fruit of the highest and best scholarship of the Anglo-Saxon race . Hence we trust it will be our Bible when all completed . Nobody seems to have seen it yet , and the American revisers are singularly reticent about its contents and peculiarities . But all the assurances which come to our ears are full of comfort and cheer . We are told that nothing of the old phraseology will be lost ; no doctrine will be touched ; the style will be in the same quaint , stately diction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it remembered , many of those " twenty-four thousand discrepancies ' * will no longer annoy our eyes , or irritate our ears , or balk our intelligence . So it is hoped that the common people will welcome it gladly . Hence it will be wanted for study and distribution in vast numbers . Shall we be obliged to form a new association for its supply and circulation in an authentic edition , or shall we look to Great Britain and the " Sea-side Library** ? It seems singular to find on the list of revisers the name of Charles Hodge-the great champion who did more than any three besides to force the Directors to bind themselves with thongs in 1857 . Did he mean to make a Bible which this Society should be first committed against issuing ? Are the members of that Board as grateful to their champions as they used to be for the help they had from them ? Now that the scholarship of the whole world is employed in criticising their version , are they quite happy to know they can not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who pushed them to the decision have spent their educated strength in producing a rival which they can not touch ? Can we not agree , in this era of good feeling , that when all the splendid work of years had to be undone ; when the new plates were destroyed , and the tow honored Committee abused ; when the former mistakes , detected and corrected , were suffered to come back into the text again ; when more things than Isaac were exchanged with a ram " ; when for men more distinguished than Mordecai was builded " a pair of gallows " ; when truth was ignominiously thrust out to restore error " under pretense of a sacrifice , " it was the most melancholy moment in the history of the Society ? But is it a foregone conclusion that this decision is irrevocable ? Can not that one awful expression in the Society 's constitution be extended , or expanded , or bodily expunged , namely : " The only copies in the English language , to be circulated by the Society , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not this be simply dropped , or made more elastic in some way ?

No , they say again , save by act of Legislature . Well , is it possible for the Legislature to do anything in the premises calculated to give us relief ? Some men there are who love the Bible and the Bible Society enough to go even to the primary meetings every year till a Legislature could be created which would give a new charter that would permit a new constitution which would let in a new version , rather than have two associations , with two Bibles in the field , confronting each other .

Some things besides the eternal verities of God 's truth were involved . Questions of policies widely distinct from Greek and Hebrew floated in the startled air . First of all , sectional feeling was simply rampant during those melancholy days of Buchanan 's administration . For this was the year of our Lord in which the New Haven ministers wrote their famous letters to the President . The " Dred Scott decision " made Northern people almost frantic .

Moreover , the business world was trembling under the crushing weight of the historic panic , and the shores of traffic were strewn with wrecks of fortune and reputation . The Sunday-school Union had just announced the loss of eighty thousand dollars by the defalcation of its trusted treasurer . The Tract Society was in trouble for months of controversy , for having refused to publish some antislavery tracts . The Home Missionary Society was censured heavily for voting not to help certain slaveholding churches .

If it should be proved that the Directors lacked courage , when the campaign was so fierce and the onset so bewildering , it might be admitted easily that their fright was no more unreasonable than the paleness on a brave peasant 's cheek when he holds his child in his arms while the cannon of Waterloo are thundering in his orchard . A few of those men were advanced in years ; some of them were infirm ; most of them were gentle and reflective by temperament , and unaccustomed to the intemperate way in which newspaper correspondents talked .

XVhen thoughtful Christians of this later generation read such a history , they can not help feeling that one of the usual divisions arose . A majority had brief triumph , and a minority went to the wall . They *lo not consent to say that any principle of constitutional working was fixed . For there were two sides taken . When the members of the Committee on // Versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they surely had something to say . And what they said was , that , while the Bible Society was publishing any version , it must necessarily see to it , beyond a peradventure , that what it was publishing should be the best edition of that version to be secured . So they declared that their task of collation was legitimate , and the results of it worth keeping . They went down on that issue , as the war-ship Cumberland went down , with colors flying and guns exploding even in the sea . There are scores of the best men we have now who believe they were right . That was a wild , tempestuous year ; but now-now-when the ancient feuds are forgotten , when slavery is dead , and the Presbyterian church is united without old or new school , and the Boston Tract Society has come home again-now , when the storm is over , and the air is clear , and the children are singing , can we not take up the discussion once more , and this time calmly reach a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful gift God 's beneficent providence is giving to this age of ours ? Why , this New Revision is the one thing of the era . It is greater than the Pacific Railroad , or the Brooklyn Bridge . It is the event of modern times . It is more majestic than the completion of the Cologne Cathedral in Gothic art . The issue of a new version of the Word of God in Anglo-Saxon speech is chapter first in volume second of AngloSaxon history . And when one remembers how much trouble our best scholars took , how many difficulties they surmounted , how much obloquy they met in popular estimation , and yet how persistently they labored for a recognition as a part of the Englishspeaking world , with patience and selfsacrifice securing a place for our American Christian learning at the last ,  --  he can not keep back his enthusiasm of thanks for an opportunity of welcoming them with their Bible in their hands . The least the American people can do is to offer them the loftiest honor in our pageant of reception . XVe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the best we have is that old , grand Bible Society with its press and its history ; the society which more than any other the whole church loves with pride and loyalty . Why should a petty rule stand in the way , provided it can legally and easily and cordially be surrendered ? When Elizabeth announced that she was coming to visit Ken ilworth , Leicester tore down a portion of a useless outer wall for a broad entrance , saying he had never till now had need for a portal that was fit for the passage of a queen . Here is a fresh crisis , with the bringing about of which none of us has had any concern . If the choice must be made between the New Version and the Old , we want the New-if it is as w* expect it to be . If in policy the choice is , as it once appears to have been , between losing patronage from some denominations or from some men , and the loss of power to move , even so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o in " throughly , " then a great number of us will go for the perfectness of the Bible , even if it constrains us , humbly and sadly , to invite another society to take up the work . In that case , others must choose friends also . Who are the so-called " friends " of the Bible Society ? Does one know its friends when he sees them ? Can we not now move in the right direction once more ? Can not the edition of the version be corrected in the texts and in the headings ? Are men going to be stubborn enough to resist this again ? What is desired by the strongest " friends " in the nation is that this Bible Society we love and work for should put into as good an edition as it can this Old Version , which is going to hold its place for many years yet ; and then that this same Society should print at once an edition of the New Version to be se't alongside of the Old , so that the people shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study and ultimately receive the New into a recognized place in their confidence and their hearts . Surely there is a way in which this can be done , and good men can find it . And we say , that if this fresh chance now offered be neglected , because opposition shall come from the old quarters , so that an exigency shall compel the Tract Society , or the Sunday-school Union , to issue the Ne*v Testament as it arrives now , and the Old Testament when it shall be completed  --  and if thus our honored Bible Society shall lose caste and receive injury , it will be because of wounds with which it shall be wounded in the house of its " friends .
