BY ANDREW CARNEGIE . THE reception given to the first paper upon this subject , to which our lamented friend , the late editor and proprietor of this REVIEW , was pleased to give the first place in the June number , has been most encouraging to its author , as it would surely have been to the editor had he been spared , for he was most deeply interested in the subject . As showing the unflagging attention which Mr. Rice bestowed upon his editorial duties , it may be permissible to tell that the manuscript reached him in the morning , and late in theevening of the same day he called to say that it pleased him so much that he had determined to publish it in the forthcoming number , instead of holding it for the succeeding issue , as had been intended . When urged to delay publication , that proper time might be given for revision , he declined . Had he complied , another than he , alas ! would have had to stand sponsor for my thoughts . Only one short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare o'er . He had played his part in life well ; and yet how little is he , or is any one , missed upon the march The race presses slowly on as before ; another rises to take the vacant place ; THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW shines on , a lamp still burning , to show the great army of humanity the pitfalls which it must avoid in order to retain what has been already conquered , and to light the paths which that army must tread on its way to future conquests . In the death of Mr. Rice we have another proof that in the progress of humanity persons are little or nothing ; the race is all . " The individual withers , and the world is more and more . " And yet it is much to me that probably the last manuscript our friend read , valued , and published was " Wealth . " Perhaps // your readers will pardon me for recalling an incident connected with our last interview . Sitting in my library , Mr. iRice expressed a wish to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened from beginning to end , making but one interruption . When the passage was read which stated that , of every thousand dollars spent to-day in so-called charity , probably nine hundred was unwisely spent , he exclaimed , " Yes , nine hundred and fifty ! Make it niuc hundred and fifty ! " and it was so made . I can not pass without paying a tribute to Allen Thorndike Rice . That I knew him is one of the sources from which sweet remembrances spring at times , when free from the roar and bustle of life . While " Wealth " has thus met a cordial reception upon this side of the Atlantic , it is natural that in the mother-land it should have attracted mosf attention , because the older civilization is at present brought more clearly face to face with socialistic questions . The contrast between the classes and the masses , between rich and poor , is not yet quite so sharp in this vast , fertile , and developing continent , with less than twenty persons per square mile , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no territory nuoccupied . Perhaps the Pall Mall Gazelle in its issue of September 3 puts most pithily the objections that have been raised to what the English have been pleased to call the " Gospel of Wealth . " It says : " Great fortunes , says Mr. Carnegie , are great blessings to a community , because such and such things may be done with them . Well , but they are also a great curse , for such and such things are done with them . Mr. Carnegie 's preaching , in other words , is altogether vitiated by Mr. Benzon 's practice . The Gospel of Wealth ' is killed by the acts . " To this the reply seems obvious : the ' gospel of Christianity is also killed by the acts . The same objection that is urged against the gospel of wealth lies against the commandment " Thou shalt not steal . " It is no argument against a gospel that it is not lived up to ; indeed , it is an argument in its favor , for a gospel must be higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law that it is broken : in that disobedience lies the reason for making and maintaining the law ; the law which is never to be broken is never required . Undoubtedly the most notable incident in regard to the " Gospel of Wealth " is that it was fortunate enough to attract the // attention of Mr. Gladstone , and brought forth the following note from him : " I have asked Mr. Lloyd Bryce ( North American Review ) kindly to allow the republication in this country of the extremely interesting article on Wealth , ' by Mr. Andrew Carnegie , which has just appeared in America . ' This resulted in the publication of the article in several newspapers and periodicals , and an enterprising publisher issued it in pamphlet form . It is now sold in Britain for a penny . All this is most encouraging , proving , as it does , that society is alive to the great issue involved , and is in a receptive mood . Your request , Mr. Editor , that I should continue the subject and point out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as further proof that whether the ideas promulgated are to be received or rejected , they are at least certain to obtain a hearing . Before entering upon the question which you have proposed , it may be advantageous to restate the positions taken in the former paper , for the benefit of those who may not have read it , or who can not conveniently refer to it . It was assumed that the present laws of competition , accumulation , and distribution are . the best obtainable conditions ; that through these the race receives its most valuable fruits ; and , therefore , that they should be accepted and upheld . Under these it was held that great wealth must inevitably flow into the hands of the few exceptional managers of men . The question then arose , What should these do with their surplus wealth ? and the " Gospel of Wealth " contended that surplus wealth should be considered as a sacred trust , to be administered during the lives of its owners , by them as trustees , for the best good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was pointed out that there were but three modes of disposing of surplus wealth , and two of these were held to be improper . First , it was held that to leave great fortunes to children did not prove true affection for them or interest in their genuine good , regarded either as individuals or as members of the state ; that it was not the welfare of the children , but the pride of the parents , which inspired enormous legacies , and that , looking to the usual results of vast sums conferred upon children , the thoughtful man must be forced to say , if the good of the child // only were considered : " I would as soon leave to my son a curse as to leave to him the almighty dollar . " The second mode open to men is to hoard their surplus wealth during life , and leave it at death for public uses . It was pointed out that in many cases these bequests become merely monuments of the testators ' folly ; that the amount of real good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus left . The recent decision upon Mr. Tilden 's will , which is said to have been drawn by the ablest of lawyers , and the partial failure of Mr. Williamson 's purposes in regard to the great technical school which that millionaire intended to establish in Philadelphia , are lessons indeed for the rich who only bequeath . The aim of the first article was thus to lead up to the conclusion that there is but one right mode of using enormous fortunes - namely , that the possessors from time to time during their own lives should so administer them as to promote the permanent good of the communities from which they have been gathered . It was held that public sentiment would soon say of one who died possessed of millions of available wealth which he might have administered : " The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced . " The purpose of this article is to prescut some of the best methods of performing this duty of administering surplus wealth for the good of the people . The first requisite for a really good use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaims him only a trustee of the surplus that comes to him , is to take care that the purpose for which he spends it shall not have a degrading , pauperizing tendency upon its recipients , and that his trust should be so administered as to stimulate the best and most aspiring poor of the community to further efforts for their own improvement . It is not the irreclaimably destitute , shiftless , and worthless that it is truly beneficial or truly benevolent to attempt to reach and improve . For these there exists the refuge provided by the city or the state , where they can be sheltered , fed , clothed , and kept in comfortable existence , and-most important of all-where they can be isolated from the welldoing *nd industrious poor , who are liable to be demoralized by contact with these unfortunates . One man or woman who succeeds in living comfortably by begging is more dangerous to society , and a greater obstacle to the progress of humanity , than a score of wordy Socialists . The individual administrator of sur // plus wealth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who need everything done for them , but those who , being most anxious and able to help themselves , deserve and will be benefited by help from others and the extension of their opportunities at the hands of the philanthropic rich . Jt is ever to be remembered that one of the chief obstacles which the philanthropist meets in his efforts to do real and perinanent good in this world is the practice of indiscriminate giving ; and the duty of the millionaire is to resolve to cease giving to objects that are not proved clearly to his satisfaction to be deserving . He must remember Mr. Rice 's belief , that nine hundred and fifty out of every thousand dollars bestowed to-day upon so-called charity had better be thrown into the sea . As far as my experience of the wealthy extends , it is unnecessary to urge them to give of their superabundance in charity so-called . Greater good for the race is to be achieved by inducing them to cease impulsive and injurious giving . As a rule , the sins of millionaires in this respect are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not take time to think , and chiefly because it is much easier to give than to refuse . Those who have surplus wealth give millions every year which produce more evil than good , and which really retard the progress of the people , because most of the forms in vogue to-day for benefiting mankind only tend to spread among the poor a spirit of dependence upon alms , when what is essential for progress is that they should be inspired to depend upon their own exertions . The miser millionaire who hoards his wealth does less injury to society than the careless millionaire who squanders his unwisely , even if he does so under cover of the mantle of sacred charity . The man who gives to the individual beggar commits a grave offence , but there are many societies and institutions soliciting alms which it is none the less injurious to the community to aid . These are as corrupting as individual beggars . Plutarch 's " Morals** contains this lesson : " A beggar asking an alms of a Lacedoamonian , he said : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater beggar , for he that first gave thee money made thee idle , and is the cause of this base and dishonorable way of living . " ' As I know them , there are few millionaires , very few indeed , who are clear of this sin of having made beggars . Bearing in mind these considerations , let us endeavor to pre // sent some of the best uses to which a millionaire can devote the surplus of which he should regard himself as only the trustee . First-Standing apart by itself there is the founding of a university by men enormously rich , such men as must necessarily be few in any country . Perhaps the greatest sum ever given by an individual for any purpose is the gift of Senator Stanford , who undertakes to establish upon the Pacific coast , where he amassed his enormous fortuue , a complete university , which is said to involve the expenditure of ten millions of dollars , and upon which he may be expected to bestow twenty millions of his surplus . He is to be envied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise upon the then crowded shores of the Pacific , may repeat Griffith 's eulogy of Wolsey , " In bestowing he was most princely : ever witness for him this great seat of learning . " Here is a noble use of wealth . We have many such institutions , Hopkins , Cornell , Packer , and others , but most of these have only been bequeathed , and it is impossible to extol any man greatly for simply leaving what he can not take with him . Cooper , and Pratt , and Stanford , and others of this class deserve credit and the admiration of their fellows as much for the time and the attention given during their lives , as for their expenditure , upon their respective monuments . We can not have the Pacific coast in mind without recalling another important work of a different character which has recently been established there , the Lick Observatory . If any millionaire be interested in the ennobling study of astronomy ,  --  and there should be and would be such if they but gave the subject the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed , for the progress made in astronomical instruments and appliances is so great and continuous that every few years a new telescope might be judiciously given to one of the observatories upon this continent , the last being always the largest and the best , and certain to carry further and fufther the knowledge of the universe and of our relation to it here upon the earth . As one among many of the good deeds of the late Mr. Thaw , of Pittsburg , his constant support of the observatory there may be mentioned . This observatory enabled Professor Langley to make his wonderful discoveries . The professor is now at the head of the Smithsoniau Institution , a worthy successor to Professor // Henry . Connected with him was Mr. Braeshier , of Pittsburg , whose instruments are in most of the principal observatories of the world . He was a common millwright , but Mr. Thaw recognized his genius and was his main support through trying days . This common workman has been made a professor by one of the foremost scientific bodies of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two now famous men , the millionaire Thaw did a noble work . Their joint labors have brought great , and are destined to bring still greater , credit upon their country in every scientific centre throughout the world . It is reserved for very few to found universities , and , indeed , the use for many , or perhaps any , new universities does not exist . More good is henceforth to be accomplished by adding to and extending those in existence . But in this department a wide field remains for the millionaire as distinguished from the Cruxisus among millionaires . The gifts to Yale University have been many , but there is plenty of room for others . The School of Fine Arts , founded by Mr. Street , the Sheffield Scientific School , endowed by Mr. Sheffield , and Professor Loomis s fund for the observatory , are fine examples . Mrs. C. J. Osborne 's building for reading and recitation is to be regarded with especial pleasure as being the wise gift of a woman . Harvard University has not been forgotten ; the Peabody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thayer may be cited . Seber Hall is worthy of special mention , as showing what a genius like Richardson could do with the small sum of a hundred thousand dollars . The Vanderbilt University at Nashville , Tennessee , may be mentioned as a true product of the gospel of wealth . It was established by members of the Vanderbilt family during their livesmark this vital feature-during their lives ; for nothing counts for much that is left by a man at his death . Such funds are torn from him , not given by him . If any millionaire is at a loss to know how to accomplish great and indisputable good with his surplus , here is a field which can never be fully occupied , for the wants of our universities increase with the development of the country . Second-The result of my own study of the question , What is the best gift which can be given to a community ? is that a free library occupies the first place , provided the community will accept and maintain it as a public institution , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools , and , indeed , an adjunct to these . It is , no doubt , possible that my own personal experience may have led me to value a free library beyond all other forms of beneficence . When I was a boy in Pittsburg , Colonel Anderson , of Allegheny ,  --  a name I can never speak without feelings of devotional gratitude ,  --  opened his little library of four hundred books to boys . Every Saturday afternoon he was in attendance himself at his house to exchange books . No one but he who has felt it can know the intense longing with which the arrival of Saturday was awaited , that a new book might be had . My brother and Mr. Phipps , who have been my principal business partners through life , shared with me Colonel Anderson 's precious generosity , and it was when revelling in these treasures that I resolved , if ever wealth came to me , that it should be used to establish free libraries , that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been foremost in appreciating the value of free libraries for its people . Parliament passed an act permitting towns and cities to establish and maintain these as municipal institutions , and whenever the people of any town or city voted to accept the provisions of the act , the authorities were authorized to tax the community to the extent of one penny in the pound valuation . Most of the towns already have free libraries under this act . Many of these are the gifts of rich men , whose funds have been used for the building , and in some cases for the books also , the communities being required to maintain and to develop the libraries ; and to this feature I attribute most of their usefulness . An endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a clique . The public ceases to take interest in it , or , rather , never acquires interest in it . The rule has been violated which requires the recipients to help themselves . Everything has been done for the community instead of its being only helped to help itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but none that I know of with such wisdom as the Pratt Library , of Baltimore . Mr. Pratt presented to the city of Baltimore one million dollars , requiring it to pay 5 per cent . per annum , amounting to fifty thousand dollars per year , which is to be devoted to the maintenance and development of the library and its branches . During last year 430,217 books were distributed ; VOL . CXLIx. - No. 397 , 44 // 37,196 people of Baltimore are registered upon the books as readers ; and it is safe to say that the 37,000 frequenters of the Pratt Library are of more value to Baltimore , to the State , and to the country than all the inert , lazy , and hopelessly-poor in the whole nation . And it may further be safely said that , by placing within the reach of 37,000 aspiring people books which they were auxions to obtain , Mr. Pratt has done more for the genuine progress of the people than has been done by all the contributions of all the millionaires and rich people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise administrator of his surplus has poured his fertilizing stream upon soil that was ready to receive it and return a hundred-f old . The many squanderers have not only poured their streams into sieves which never can be filled ,  --  they have done worse ; they have poured them into stagnant sewers that breed the diseases which afflict the body politic . And this is not all . The million dollars of which Mr. Pratt has made so grand a use are something , but there is something greater still . When the fifth branch library was opened in Baltimore , the speaker said " Whatever may have been done in these four years , it was his pleasure to acknowledge that much , very much , was due to the earnest interest , the wise councils , and the practical suggestions of Mr. Pratt . He never seemed to feel that the mere donation of great wealth for the benefit of his fellow-citizens was all that would be asked of him , but he wisely labored to make its application as comprehensive and effective as possible . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heavy , brought good cheer and bright sunshine when clouds flitted across the sky , and made every officer and employee feel that good work was appreciated , and loyal devotion to duty would receive hearty commemlation " This is the finest picture I have ever seen of any of the millionaire class . As here depicted , Mr. Pratt is the ideal disciple of the " Gospel of Wealth . " We need have no fear that the mass of toilers will fail to recognize in such as he their best leaders and their most invaluable allies ; for the problem of poverty and wealth , of employer and employed , will be practically solved whenever the time of the few is given , and their wealth is administered during their lives , for the best good of that portion of the community which has not been burdened by the responsibilities which attend the possession of wealth . We shall have no antagonism between classes when that day comes , for the high and the low , the rich and the poor , shall then indeed be brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best forms for the use of his surplus who chooses to establish a free library in any community that is willing to maintain and develop it . // John Bright 's words should ring in his ear " It is impossible for any man to bestow a greater benefit upon a young man than to give him access to books in a free library . " Closely allied to the library , and , where possible , attached to it , there should be rooms for an art gallery and museum , and a hall for such lectures and instruction as are provided in the Cooper Union . The traveller upon the Continent is surprised to find that every town of importance has its art gallery and museum ; these may be large or small , but in any case each has a receptacle for the treasures of the locality , which is constantly receiving valuable gifts and bequests . The free library and art gallery of Birmingham are remarkable among these , and every now and then a rich man adds to their value by presenting books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that our cities require to begin with is a proper fire-proof building . Their citizens who travel will send to it rare and costly things from every quarter of the globe they visit , while those who remain at home will give or bequeath to it of their treasures . In this way these collections will grow until our cities will ultimately be able to boast of permanent exhibitions from which their own citizens will derive incalculable benefit , and which they will be proud to show to visitors . In the Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city we have made an excellent beginniug . Here is another avenue for the proper use of surplus wealth . Third-We have another most important department in which great sums can be worthily used ,  --  the founding or extension of hospitals , medical colleges , laboratories , and other institutions connected with the alleviation of human suffering , and especially with the prevention rather than the cure of human ills . There is no danger of pauperizing a community in giving for such purposes , because such institutions relieve temporary ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better gift than a hospital can be given to a community that is without one ?  --  the gift being conditioned upon its proper maintenance by the community in its corporate capacity . If hospital accommodation already exists , no better method for using surplus wealth can be found than in making additions to it . The late Mr. Vanderbilt 's gift of half a million of dollars to the medical department of Columbia College for a chemical laboratory was one of the wisest possible uses of wealth . It strikes at the prevention of disease by penetrating into its causes . Several others // have established such laboratories , but the need for them is still great . If there be a millionaire in the land who is at a loss what to do with the surplus that has been committed to him as trustee , let him investigate the good that is flowing from these chemical labora* tories . No medical college is complete without its laboratory . As with universities , so with medical colleges ; it is not new institutions that are required , but additional means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The forms that benefactions to these may wisely take are numerous , but probably none is more useful than that adopted by Mr. Osborne when he built a school for training female nurses at Bellevue College . If from all gifts there flows one-half of the good that comes from this wise use of a millionaire s surplus , the most exacting may well be satisfied . Only those who have passed through a lingering and dangerous illness can rate at their true value the care , skill , and attendance of trained female nurses . Their employment as nurses has enlarged the sphere and influence of woman . It is not to be wondered at that a Senator of the United States and a physician distinguished in this country for having received the highest distinctions abroad should find their wives from this class . Fourth-Tn the very front rank of benefactions public parks should be placed , always provided that the community undertakes to maintain , beautify , and preserve inviolate the parks given to it . No more useful or more beautiful monument can be left by any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born or in which he has long lived , nor can the community pay a more graceful tribute to the citizen who presents it than to give his name to the gift . If a park be already provided , there is still room for many judicious gifts in connection with it . Mr. Phipps , of Allegheny , has given conservatories to the park there , which are visited by many every day of the week and crowded by thousands of working people every Sunday , for , with rare wisdom , he has stipulated as a condition of the gift that the conservatories shall be open on Sundays . The result of his experiment has been so gratifying that he is justified in adding to them from his surplus , as he is doing largely this year . To any lover of flowers among the wealthy I commend a study of what is possible for them to do in the line of Mr. Phipps 's example ; and may they please note that Mr. Phipps is a wise as well as a liberal giver , for // 693 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secures for them forever the public ownership , the public interest , and the public criticism of their management . Had he undertaken to manage and maintain them , it is probable that popular interest in the gift would never have been awakened . The parks and pleasure-grounds of small towns throughout Europe are not less surprising than their libraries , museums , and art galleries . We saw nothing more pleasing during our recent travels than the hillside of Bergen , in Norway . It has been converted into one of the most picturesque of pleasure-grounds ; fountains , cascades , water-falls , delightful arbors , fine terraces , and statues adorn what was before a barren mountain side . here is a field worthy of study by the millionaire who would confer a lasting benefit upon his fellows . Another beautiful instance of the right use of wealth in the direction of making cities more and more attractive we found in Dresden . The owner of the leading paper there bequeathed its revenues forever to the city , to be used in beautifying it . An art committee decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be introduced or what hideous feature is to be changed , and as the revenues accrue they are expended in this direction . Thus through the gift of this patriotic newspaper proprietor his native city of Dresden is fast becoming one of the most artistic places of residence in the whole world . A work having been completed , it devolves upon the city to maintain it forever . May I be excused if I commend to our millionaire newspaper proprietors the example of their colleague in the capital of Saxony ? Scarcely a city of any magnitude in the older countries is without many structures and features of great beauty . Much has been spent upon ornament , decoration , and architectural effect we are still far behind in these things upon this side of the Atlantic . Our Republic is great in some things ,  --  in material development unrivalled ; but let us always remember that in art and in the finer touches we have scarcely yet taken a place . Had the exquisite memorial arch recently erected temporarily in New York been shown in Dresden , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue of the newspaper given by its owner for just such purposes , to order its permanent erection to adorn the city forever . While the bestowal of a park upon a community as one // of the best uses for surplus wealth will be universally approved , in embracing such additions to it as conservatories , or in advoeating the building of memorial arches and works of adornment , it is probable that many will think we go too far , and consider these somewhat fanciful . The material good to flow from them may not be so directly visible ; but let not any practical mind , intent only upon material good , depreciate the value of wealth given for these or for kindred aesthetic purposes as being useless as far as the mass of the people and their needs are concerned . As with libraries and museums , so with these more distinctively artistic works ; these perform their great use when they reach the best of the masses of the people . It is worth more to reach and touch the sentiment for beauty in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being so touched should be pandered to . For what the improver of the race must endeavor to do is to reach those who have the divine spark ever so feebly developed , that it may be strengthened and grow . For my part , I think Mr. Phipps put his money to better use in giving the workingmen of Allegheny conservatories filled with beautiful flowers , orchids , and aquatic plants , which they , with their wives and children , can enjoy in their spare hours , and on which they can feed the love for the beautiful , than if he had given his surplus money to furnish them with bread , for those in health who can not earn their bread are scarcely worth considering by the individual giver ; the care of such being the duty of the state . The man who erects in a city a truly artistic arch , statue , or fountain makes a wise use of his surplus . " Man does not live by bread alone . " Fiflh-We have another good use for surplus wealth , in providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for concerts of elevating music . Our cities are rarely provided with halls for these purposes , being in this respect also very far behind European cities . The Springer Hall , of Cincinnati , that valuable addition to the city , was largely the gift of Mr. Springer , who was not content to bequeath funds from his estate at death , but who gave during his life , and , in addition , gave-what was equally important-his time and business ability to insure the successful results which have been achieved . The gift of a hall to any city lacking one is an excellent use for surplus wealth for the good of a community . The reason // why the people have only one instructive and elevating , or even amnsing , entertainment when a dozen would be highly beneficial , is that the rent of a hall , even when a suitable hall exists ( which is rare ) , is so great as to prevent managers from running the risk of financial failure . If every city in our land owned a hall which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatherings as a committee or the mayor of the city judged advantageous , the people could be furnished with proper lectures , amusements , and concerts at an exceedingly small cost . The town halls of European cities , many of which have organs , are of inestimable value to the people , when utilized as they are in the manner suggested . Let no one underrate the influence of entertainments of an elevating or even of an amusing character , for these do much to make the lives of the people happier and their natures better . If any millionaire born in a small village , which has now become a great city , is prompted in the day of his success to do something for his birthplace with part of his surplus , his grateful remembrance can not take a form more useful than that of a public hall with an organ , provided the city agrees to maintain and use it . Sixth-In another respect we are still much behind Europe . A form of beneficence which is not uncomlmon there is providing swimming baths for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the city benefited to maintain them at its own expense , and as proof of the contention that everything should never be done for any one or for any community , but that the recipients should invariably be called upon to do part , it is significant that it is found essential for the popular success of these healthful establishments to exact a nominal charge for their use . In many cities , however , the school children are admitted free at fixed hours upon certain days , different hours being fixed for the boys and the girls to use the great swimming baths , hours or days being also fixed for the use of these baths by ladies . In inland cities the young of both sexes are thus taught to swim . Swimming clubs are organized , and matches are frequent , at which medals and prizes are given . The reports published by the various swimming baths throughout Great Britain are filled with instances of lives saved because those who fortunately escaped shipwreck had been taught to swim in the baths , and not a few instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments have saved the lives of others . If any disciple of the " Gospel of Wealth " gives his favorite city large swimming and private baths ( provided the municipality undertakes their management as a city affair ) , he will ncver be called to account for an improper use of the funds intrusted to him . &amp;venlh-Churches as fields for the use of surplus wealth have purposely been reserved until the last , because , these being sectarian , every man will be governed by his own attachments ; therefore gifts to churches , it may be said , are not , in one sense , gifts to the community at large , but to special classes . Nevertheless , every millionaire may know of a district where the little cheap , uncomfortable , and altogether unworthy wooden structure stands at the crossroads , to which the whole neighborhood gathers on Sunday , and which is the centre of social life and source of neighborly feeling . The administrator of wealth has made a good use of part of his surplus if he replaces that building with a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides of which the honeysuckle and columbine may climb , and from whose tower the sweet-tolling bell may sound . The millionaire should not figure how cheaply this structure can be built , but how perfect it can be made . If he has the money , it should be made a gem , for the educating influence of a pure and noble specimen of architecture , built , as the pyramids were built , to stand for ages , is not to be measured by dollars . Every farmer 's home , heart , and mind in the district will be influenced by the beauty and grandeur of the church . But having given the building , the donor should stop there ; the support of the church should be upon its own people ; there is not much genuine religion in the congregation or much good to flow from the church which is not supported at home . Many other avenues for the wise expenditure of surplus wealth might be indicated . I enumerate but a few  --  a very few-of the many fields which are open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be judiciously used . It is not the privilege , however , of millionaires alone to work for or aid measures which are certain to benefit the community . Every one who has but a small surplus above his moderate wants may share this privilege with his richer brothers , and those without surplus can give at least part of their time , which is usually as important as funds , and often more so . Some day , perhaps , with // your permission , I will endeavor to point out some fields and modes in which these may perform well their part as trustees of wealth or leisure , according to the measure of their respective fortunes . It is not expected , neither is it desirable , that there should be a general concurrence as to the best possible use of surplus wealth . For different men and different localities there are different uses . What commends itself most highly to the judgment of the administrator is the best use for him , for his heart should be in the work . It is as important in administering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's work that he should be enthusiastically devoted to it and feel that in the field selected his work lies . Besides this , there is room and need for all kinds of wise benefactions for the common weal . The man who builds a university , library , or laboratory performs no more useful work than he who elects to devote himself and his surplus means to the adornment of a park , the gathering together of a collection of pictures for the public , or the building of a memorial arch . These are all true laborers in the vineyard . The only point required by the " Gospel of Wealth " is that the surplus which accrues from time to time in the hands of a man should be administered by him in his own lifetime for that purpose which is seen by him , as trustee , to be best for the good of the people . To leave at death what he can not take away , and place upon others the burden of the work which it was his own duty to perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor any sense of duty to his fellows . Time was when the words concerning the rich man entering heaven were regarded as a hard saying . To-day , when all questions are probed to the bottom and the standards of faith receive the most liberal interpretations , the startling verse has been relegated to the rear , to await the next kindly revision as one of those things which can not be quite understood , but which meanwhile-it is carefully to be observed-are not to be understood literally . But is it so very improbable that the next stage of thought is not to restore the doctrine in all its pristine purity and force , as being in perfect harmony with sound ideas upon the subject of wealth and poverty , the rich and the poor , and the contrasts everywhere seen and deplored ? In Christ 's day , it is evident , reformers were against the wealthy . It is none the less // evident that we are fast recurring to that position to-day ; and there will be nothing to surprise the student of sociological development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much anxiety : " It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven . " Even if the needle were the small casement at the gates , the words betoken serious difficulty for the rich . It will be but a step for the theologian to take from the doctrine that he who dies rich dies disgraced to that which brings upon the man punishment or deprivation hereafter . The " Gospel of Wealth " but echoes Christ 's words . It calls upon the millionaire to sell all that he hath and give it in the highest and best form to the poor , by administering his estate himself for the good of his fellows , before he is called upon to lie down and rest upon the bosom of Mother Earth . So doing , he will approach his end no longer the ignoble hoarder of useless millions , poor , very poor indeed , in money , but rich , very rich , twenty times a millionaire still , in the affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-soothed and sustained by the still small voice within , which , whispering , tells him that , because he has lived , perhaps one small part of the great world has been bettered just a little . This much is sure : against such riches as these no bar will be found at the Gates of Paradise . ANDREW CARNEGIE .
