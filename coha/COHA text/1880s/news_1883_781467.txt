txt Mr. JAY GOULD has organized a yacht club , which is to . be distinctively a steam yacht club . It is certainly a good idea to ' keep steam yachts , by themselves . They have properly no place in the fleets of the older yacht clubs . They can not , of course , enter regattas in competition with sailing yachts , and if a steam yacht attempts'to accompany a fleet of sailing yachts on one of those adventurous cruises up the Sound which our bolder yachtsmen commonly make , her owner soon finds that it is extremelytedious to wait upon the slow and uncertain movements of sloops and schooners . It is understood that the new steam yacht club is to have its races in emulation of the other clubs . , Of course , such races will be mainly tests of . boilers and machinery . Seamanship will have nothing whatever to do with winning a steam yacht race , and the only legitimate excitement connected with it will be that which results from close proximity to a boiler liable to burst at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how the steam yacht can be regarded as a pleasure vessel ; She is doubtless useful as a vehicle for carrying a traveler from one place to another , but so is a Pullman car , and one has about as much right as the other to be called a yacht . Mr. GOULD seems to have wasted his money in building ' a steam yacht , since he could travel more cheaply and much more comfortably in a Cunarder or a P. and 0. , steamer . If he wanted to be a steam yachtsman , why did he not fit up a special train of elevated railroad cars for himself and go steam yachting up and down the Second , Third , Sixth , and Ninth avenue roads ? He might have permitted several of his friends to equip similar private trains , and they could then have organized an elevated yacht club which would have given them much more pleasure . than their new steam yacht club , with ' i ? fleet of steam-boats , on board of which sea-sickness inevitably awaits the yachtsman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late for Mr. GOULD to reorganize the " American Yacht Club " under the name of the " Elevated Yacht Club , " and to sell its fleet of steam-boats and build palace cars in their place .
