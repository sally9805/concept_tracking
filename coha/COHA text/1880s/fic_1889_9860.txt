KA-FOOZLE-UM.  --  The Daughter of the Ba-ba . Just arrived from Turkey . Speaks no English . DIRECTIONS . This entertainment depends largely upon the selections made to personate the different characters . If there are people in the community where it is given who have any special talent , they can be easily introduced into the Unique Collection or substituted for any unavailable character suggested here . MCGINTY should be something of an actor , and he can leave the stage during the performance to reappear as one of the Chinese twins . The Glass-eater must be provided with one or two bottles made of sugar amongst the other glassware , and these he devours in part before the audience . Confectioners make them in exact imitation of beer-bottles . The Greek maidens should practise posing in graceful attitudes , to a slow waltz , continually changing positions , in order to present a series of pretty tableaux . The waltz movement should not be too long . Twenty or thirty measures are sufficient . The programme or announcement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEZIAH.  --  A black dress , small white apron , white lace kerchief crossed on her breast , a pointed cap with ruffle la Mother Hubbard , and carries a large fan , which can be used to indicate the different members of the show .

One stands back of a small table , with his hands dressed as feet , resting upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching to the floor . ) Another stands behind him , extending his arms under the arm-pits of the person in front , thus making arms for the dwarf , but carefully concealing himself . The first person does the talking , while the second makes the gestures . This can be made very funny if the person who speaks is good at improvising . He may talk entirely in an unintelligible gibberish , supposed to be Japanese , or in " pigeon " English , with appropriate and emphatic gestures made with hands and feet . LAURA LEE .  --  A green dress waist , a fish-tail , long yellow hair , and a profusion of coral and shell necklaces , ornaments , etc .

A pair of tiny stockings are stuffed to represent legs , and tied about his waist . A little skirt of some bright color conceals the junction of the legs with his body , and gives him the appearance of sitting on the box .

SISTER KEZIAH addresses the audience before the curtain which is raised when she gives the signal . KEZIAH . LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :  --  It is with great pleasure that I find gathered here to-night so large and cultivated an audience to behold my unique collection . Some of these creatures are most fearfully and wonderfully made , and I know how impatiently you await the rising of that curtain which alone hides them from your gaze . I must , however , ask your attention for one moment while I explain to you my position , and how it happens that I , Keziah Peak , stand here alone , without that row of cultured sisters , with their snowy caps rising and falling majestically before you ! " They have all gone : " dropped away one by one , not carried off by disease or death , but lured from my side by the fascinations of the men ! I need not add that this never happened in the East ! It was a Western boom , and those charming girls went like chaff before the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks are often volcanic . I assure you , there is nothing explosive about me ! If there had been , I should have gone off long ago . Abandoned by my sisters , I cast about for another field in which to find congenial work . Naturally , longing as I do , to elevate the masses . I decided to be a missionary , and turned my face toward Boston , Mass. , that centre of all culture , in order to ascertain at the fountain-head whether I was most needed in Central Africa or Japan . On my arrival I learned for the first time of the death of that prince of showmen , our old friend P. T. Barnum , and my heart went out in pity towards those dear creatures , that little band of nature 's freaks , left , as it were , orphans , without a father 's care . I decided at once to adopt them , and I assure you , since I accomplished that object  --  I took the job lot  --  I have never ceased to wonder at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . I might add that I find missionary work sufficiently trying amongst them , without broiling myself under a tropical sun , or running the risk of having my head chopped off in a Chinese riot . With this brief introduction we will proceed . Jonathan ! ( No answer . ) Brother Jonathan is my assistant . He does not wear striped trousers or in any way suggest Yankee Doodle . There is nothing of the " Spread Eagle " about Jonathan . Quite the reverse ! I engaged him because of his retiring disposition . He has never been known to speak before an audience , and so great is his dread of being obliged to respond to some remark addressed to him , that I have been obliged to provide him with a simple means of replying when he is addressed . No doubt , however , that this same youth is now peeping through that small hole in your fine curtain to size the house . He is quite brave when invisible . Jonathan ! ( Noise of retreating steps . ) There , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He replies . Jonathan , we are ready . Draw the curtain . CURTAIN RISES . ( Characters discovered sitting and standing about the stage ; JONATHAN not visible . ) KEZIAH . We always open our entertainment with the singing of a hymn . Music has such a moralizing effect . SONG . ( All joining in the singing , led by SISTER KEZIAH , who beats time with her closed fan . ) KEZ. ( calling off ) . Jonathan , you need not sing the second verse . You are off the key ! From China and from far Japan , From Italy and Greece , And from the land of Turco-man Behold us here in peace ! Since life is such an awful grind To folks who are not queer , We ought to thank this sister kind For bringing of us here ! KEZ. ( speaks ) . Friends , I can with difficulty decide which of these charming creatures to introduce first . I am sorry to say that there is sometimes jealousy amongst them , on this very account . ( To KA-FOOZLE-UM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Katy , you must wait till the last . I have always heard that Turkish women were very retiring , kept in confinement , as it were , and reared to be submissive . I find them , judging from this specimen , quite the reverse . Daniel ( to MCGINTY ) , you may step forward . This gentleman has spent so many months , I might say years , in retirement , that I will give him the preference . ( MCGINTY bows . ) Daniel , you may explain why you kept out of sight so long , when there was such a demand for you . SONG . THE PLEASURES OF THE DEEP . ( Air " Down went McGinty . " ) MCGINTY ( sings ) . Dan McGinty is me name , And I 'm not unknown to fame , For they rarely lave me out of anny show , Niver thinkin ' as they sing That perchance I 'd take me fling With the mermaids that 's ' a-sportin ' down below ! Sure , there 's pleasures in the dape ! Whativer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this benathe the say ? Whin the mermaids combed their hair , Sure , they had me in a shnare , An ' they held me ! Oh , the lovely Lorelei ! Chorus . Down stayed McGinty at the bottom of the say , An ' entangled in a net Where ' t was very , very wet , Sure , he vowed he 'd niver look again upon the light o ' day Save with a mermaid for bride ! Now , perhaps you think it queer That a mermaid seemed so dear To a lad that 's used to ladies with two fate . Sure , McGinty wants his bride To cheer his fireside And not for Comic Opera Up to Date ! Thin the chapeness of it , too , For she needs no sock or shoe , To say nothing of her gowns without a trail ! O ye men who fear to wed , Lave the ladies whom ye dread , An , ' like McGinty , seek a mermaid with a tail ! Chorus . Here stands McGinty from the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's feelin ' pretty well , And he 's very glad to look again upon the light o ' day , Having a mermaid for bride . ( Retires to the side of LAURA LEE . ) KEZ . That will do . I never allow Daniel to sing more than two verses , for fear that he may strain his voice . The physical condition of my charges is of the greatest importance . Daniel is very valuable to me . I wish to explain here , that I have attempted to Americanize the names of these ladies and gentlemen . All foreign ways and customs are extremely disagreeable to me , and particularly the heathenish names by which foreigners designate themselves . Now , this tiny creature on the left , I call Lucy Zarrett , but her real name is Lucia Zarate . She is one of the greatest wonders of the age . She has travelled with Tom Thumb , and other distinguished Lilliputians . She is forty-six years old , her height is twenty-nine inches , and she weighs but four and three-fourths pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCIA obeys orders . ) KEZ . That will do . ( LUCIA sits . ) Now , here ( indicating KIOTO ) is a poor , heathenish creature whom it is utterly impossible to Americanize in name , language , or customs . His name is Kioto . He speaks an utterly unintelligible language , and he lives upon rice and ( shudders ) rats . You see what an atom he is , the shortest man alive  --  I mean in stature , not financially . Kioto , what have you to say for yourself ? ( Aside . ) He does n't understand me , but a glance will set him going . ( KIOTO talks and gesticulates . ) KEZ . There ! Now , what can any Christian woman do with a creature like that ! I have already told you that Daniel is very valuable to me . It is not only on his own account , but because of the important additions that he has made to my exhibit . This remarkable creature ( indicating MERMAID ) , he says he brought in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Whistle . ) You may come here . ( To audience . ) Please do n't take any notice of Jonathan at first ; it embarrasses him . He will get over it shortly , if let alone . ( JONATHAN enters , R. , sidling towards F. , equally afraid of freaks and audience . ) There , there , Jonathan , do n't be foolish ! I want you to help Daniel to move Laura 's couch a little to the front . ( JONATHAN takes head of couch and DANIEL foot . While moving it , JONATHAN casts terrified glances towards MERMAID . When couch is in position DANIEL shakes his fist at JONATHAN . ) KEZ . Jonathan ! Daniel ! What is the matter ? DAN . Then let him lave me bride alone , and quit makin ' eyes at her ! KEZ . Daniel , you are dreaming ! Jonathan is incapable of such behavior . Ladies and gentlemen , I hope you will excuse this interruption . I engaged Jonathan particularly because he is like adamant to the charms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN . ( aside ) . Doa n't they though ? ( To KEZ . ) Sure , an ' it 's himself as may be harmless ; but will ye kindly remove him for a brief space while me lovely bride is a warblin ' of her evenin ' lay ? Thim mermaids is a very takin ' kind o ' females , an ' the poor soul might milt unbeknownst to himsilf an ' the stony nater of him . KEZ . Perhaps you are right , Daniel . ( To audience . ) I have heard of these mermaids enticing poor sailors into the sea by their winning ways . I 'm sure I do n't see why  --  they are not at all attractive to me ! Jonathan , you may leave the room . ( JONATHAN sidles off R. ) We will now proceed . This creature , whose fascinations kept Daniel so many months below , sings her evening song and combs her yellow hair at about this time every night . You will now have the pleasure of listening to her . THE MERMAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Student 's Songs . " ) ( LAURA LEE sings solo , ALLEGRO PENSEROSO , RAPHAEL , and GALASSI join in chorus . ) LAURA ( sings ) . When the day is done and night comes on , And the shadows fall on the land , Then she seeks her retreat , each lovely mermaid , With her comb and her glass in her hand . Chorus . Oh , the ocean waves may roll , And the stormy winds may blow , And while poor mortals are fretting on the land , Oh , the mermaids sport down below , below , below , And the mermaids sport down below ! Reclining there , she combs her golden hair , And warbles her song of love . While the soft , sweet strains are wafted on the air Till they charm mortals sighing above ! Chorus . Oh , the ocean waves may roll , etc. , KEZ . Perhaps it is as well that Jonathan was not present . ( Calling . ) Jonathan ! ( JONATHAN , who has re-entered during song and placed himself beside KEZIAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan , what do you mean by frightening me so ? I intended you to remain outside . Assist Daniel . I am quite displeased with you . ( JONATHAN rubs his sleeve across his eyes . KA-FOOZLE-UM pats him on the back . KEZIAH looks the other way in great displeasure . Then DANIEL and JONATHAN place MERMAID in former position . ) KEZ . I have referred to Daniel 's great assistance to me . I have another treasure that he discovered at the " bottom of the sea . " Jonathan . I want you to bring in Cassius White . ( Exit JONATHAN , L. , returns immediately carrying CASSIUS , who is very stiff and stony . ) KEZ . Place him right here , in the centre of the stage . ( To audience ) This dear child Daniel raised with the greatest difficulty in order to add him to my wonders . I say with difficulty , for the boy is one solid mass of stone ; only a few of his organs remain unpetrified , and they are gradually hardening , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explain ? MCGINTY . Sure , thin , ladies an ' gintlemen , ' t is little there is to tell , savin ' yer honors . The poor little crater was in the wan shpot there below , jist anchored by the weight of him , an ' a callin ' all thim weary years upon his cruel parent , who left him , an ' him such a wee mite , too , in the sole charge of a sinkin ' ship . It was his little v'ice as guided me to that same shpot . ( Aside to JONATHAN . ) Punch him , Jonathan ! ( JONATHAN pokes the boy , who speaks in a loud , sing-song tone . ) CASSIUS . " Say , father , say , If yet my task is done ? " ( Stops short . ) MCGINTY ( prompting ) . " He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son . " ( Aside . ) Punch him , Jonathan , punch him ! CASSIUS . " Speak , father !  --  MCGINTY . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CASSIUS . " If I may yet be gone ! And  --  MCGINTY . But the booming shots replied , And fast the flames rolled on . Upon his brow he felt their breath , And in his waving hair , And looked from that lone post of death , In still yet brave despair . And shouted but once more aloud , " ( Makes sign to JONATHAN to punch CASSIUS . ) CASSIUS . " My father ! must I stay ? MCGINTY . While o'er him fast through sail and shroud The wreathing fires made way . They wrapped the ship in splendor wild , They caught the flag on high , And streamed above the gallant child Like banners in the sky . Then came a burst of thunder sound  --  The boy  --  oh ! where was he ? Ask "  --  ( overcome by emotion . ) KEZ . That will do ! Ladies and gentlemen , this child is Casabianca  --  nature 's monument to the faithful discharge of duty , brought to the surface by Daniel McGinty . Whether he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall never know . Jonathan , put Cassius away . ( JONATHAN carries the boy to place , at foot of MERMAID 'S couch . Exit MCGINTY quietly . KA-FOOZLE-UM meantime has approached KALLULU , who makes a slash at her with his razor . She utters a shriek and jumps aside . ) KEZ . Katy , will you be careful ! ( To audience . ) I am sure I do n't know what these savages may be " upon their native heath , " but they are certainly exceedingly trying on ours . This creature ( indicating KALLULU ) is the only living specimen on this continent of that wonderful tribe of little men discovered by Henry M. Stanley , the great African explorer . He calls himself Kallulu , a name suggestive of that omnivorous bird that ate up the missionary and the hymn-book too . You may notice that I keep at a respectful distance from him . In fact , we all do , otherwise our show would present a scarred appearance and lose its moral character . ( Approaches KALLULU carefully ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing a nice little song to these kind friends ? ( KALLULU grins , mutters , and then waves his razor frantically . ) KEZ. ( starting back ) . Fortunately , this savage 's legs are so small that he gets about with great difficulty ; otherwise our lives would be in danger . Come , Kally , sing . Katy , perhaps if you stand near him he will favor us with the only intelligible song he knows . Do n't get too near ; remember how cutting he can be . Now ! ( KA-FOOZLE-UM smiles and KALLULU sings . ) SONG . ( AIR , " Razors in the Air , " by BARRY MAXWELL . DITSON . ) KEZ . That will do . We will now proceed . One of these gentleman  --  Mr. Glassi ( pronounced Glasseye ) , will you please step forward ? ( SIGNOR GALASSI comes to F. , also KA-FOOZLE-UM . ) Katy , keep your place . One of these gentlemen , I repeat , has been a source of the greatest anxiety to me . I refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands before you . ( GALASSI bows . ) KEZ. ( aside ) . Jonathan , bring me Glassi 's lunch . ( While KEZIAH continues her remarks JONATHAN places a small stand in front of GALASSI , on which he arranges a tray covered with bottles , glasses , etc. , which GALASSI handles with care , until ordered to eat them . ) KEZ . This man devours tons of glass annually , and yet look at him ! Is he pale or thin ? Does he have an emaciated appearance ? And yet they do say that a very little pounded glass will kill a rat . Now , it stands to reason , that what would kill a rat , can not be good for a man , and I have tried to cure Mr. Glassi of this dreadful habit . It 's of no use . When he is denied his favorite dainty , he becomes quite unmanageable , and , breaking away from all restraint , wanders up and down , seeking what he may devour . In this condition , he would be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your new Bank , or to eat up the stained glass Memorial in your beautiful Town Hall , as not ! And I should have to pay the bills . I find it much cheaper to keep him supplied with common glass bottles , which can generally be procured for nothing in " no license " towns , and which you will now see him devour . ( GALASSI begins to crunch the glass . ) KEZ . You see with what a relish he eats ; but I must confess that he prefers Cathedral glass . He has eaten so much of it surreptitiously and otherwise , that it easily accounts for his ruddy complexion . ( KA-FOOZLE-UM approaches , and GALASSI presents her with a piece of glass . ) KEZ . Katy Slum , do n't you dare to eat that glass . Give it to me immediately . This part of our exhibition is extremely disagreeable to me  --  it sets my teeth on edge , and causes cold chills to creep up and down my spine . ( Shudders . ) That will do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you display too great a love of the bottle . KEZ . Jonathan , bring one of Mr. Glassi 's songs . ( To audience . ) I do n't know why it is , but Signor Galassi always prefers songs about bottles and glasses  --  in short , drinking-songs  --  and we have to indulge him in his choice . Fortunately most of our great composers were affected in the same way , therefore , the music is always good . Giulio has a remarkable voice . One might think after devouring so much glass , it would be a little sharp . Quite the reverse ! SONG . BY GIULIO GALASSI . ( Selected . ) ( JONATHAN meantime has removed table and tray to former position at back of stage . ) KEZ. ( to GALASSI ) . Now , you may finish your bottle . GALASSI ( returns to B. ) Now , let me see ! ( KA-FOOZLE-UM comes forward . ) No , Katy ; I must again beg you to wait your time . You are as uneasy as if you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-headed girl . Allegro Penseroso . ( A. P. comes forward . ) Here we have the most remarkable creature of the nineteenth century  --  a human-being with one body and yet with two heads ; with one heart beating in unison with two minds . I call her Allegro for this mind which is so cheerful , and Penseroso for that mind which is so mournful . Some people tell us that our dispositions are governed by our livers , but Ally has the same liver as Penny , and Ally smiles when Penny weeps . Indigestion may cause the blues , but what agrees with Ally ought not to disagree with Penny . Jonathan , bring a pickle ! Now , there are people who believe that all pain and distress originate in the mind . ( JONATHAN approaches with pickle cut in two pieces . ) I can give you a practical illustration of this great theory . ( Passes pickles to girls . ALLY takes hers , laughing , and proceeds to eat it . PENNY refuses . ) KEZ . Penny , I insist . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes it reluctantly . In a second she groans and seems in great distress , while ALLY still laughs and offers bit of pickle to JONATHAN . ) KEZ . There , you see the effect . Now , what does this prove ? Simply that Allegro can eat pickles because she thinks that they agree with her , and Penseroso can not eat pickles because she fears that they will disagree with her , and yet it is the same pickle , and the same  --  ahem ! Under these circumstances it is most inconvenient to have two minds . Then , again , Ally loves to go , and Penny to stay . Think of the inconvenience of that . I often have to interfere , or Ally would drag Penny out on the street when they  --  I mean she  --  had better be at home . These are some of the disadvantages ; but , young ladies , think of the advantages of being a double-headed charmer ! You would never have to sit out a dance , for surely no man could resist such attractions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate , all these charms combined . It would be a poor specimen of a man who could n't manage to get on the right side of such a girl . But  --  it is very inspiring . I begin to feel as if I had two heads myself . Jonathan , take Allegro Penseroso to her place . ( JONATHAN starts to lead PENNY but changes to ALLY 'S side . ) KEZ . Jonathan has always like ! Ally the best . Most men prefer a cheerful disposition . Now , I ask your attention for a few moments to my Grecian maidens , Ida and Ione ( pronounced I-own ) . They are posers of the Delsarte school . ( IDA and IONE come forward from R. and L. to C. ) ( Posing to music introduced . ) KEZ . That will do . I knew that you would be pleased . I have among my charges a most remarkable artist . Raphael Tintoret , the famous blind painter . ( RAPHAEL bows . ) Jonathan ! ( JONATHAN is engaged , whispering to KA-FOOZLE-UM . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to business ? I believe that Turkish girl would flirt with a hitching-post . Now , Jonathan , bring Mr. Tintoret 's easel and his latest work . ( JONATHAN places casel C. , on which he rests a common house-blind or shutter . RAPHAEL seats himself before it , led to his place by KA-FOOZLE-UM , and proceeds to paint , using an artist 's palette , brushes , etc . ) KEZ . Friends , I may be prejudiced , but I do not like artists as a class , and but for this man 's infirmity I should not have added him to my troupe . I was once deceived by a gentleman of his profession , and I have never trusted painters since . I refer to F. Jenkinson Jones , a promising young artist who eloped with Sophia one of our most attractive sisters . In fact , her disappearance was the final cause of our collapse , for she was our great drawing card . I fear the poor child 's life is passed in misery , for I hear that Mr. Jones can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! But to return to Raphael . He is a most prolific artist . See with what ease and abandon he dashes on the color . He is an impressionist of the deepest dye . ( Turning blind towards audience . ) Gaze upon this work of art ! Did Whistler ever do anything more incomprehensible ? Does Monet get more brilliant effects ? Has Turner ever mingled earth and sky more completely ? Perhaps you imagine these masterpieces can be purchased . Not at all . I place them as soon as completed in a building where they are well insured . In due time , I hope to give a series of receptions at which Raphael will exhibit his works , and I shall serve Russian tea . Tickets , 75 cents . Then , when the public is fully roused to the value of these masterpieces , I shall dispose of them at auction-sale , when every citizen of this charming place will have an opportunity to decorate his house with one or more of these marvellous works of art . Mr. Tintoret , you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KATY conducts RAPHAEL to place . ) KEZ . It is strange when Raphael can paint so well , that he is so helpless in moving about . If he could see , I never should dare trust him to Katy . ( JONATHAN approaches KEZIAH and whispers . ) KEZ . True , Jonathan . I very nearly forgot my Chinese twins . They always remain without , because Daniel is so prejudiced against the Chinese . Daniel ! ( Looking about . ) Where is McGinty ? Oh , I hope he has n't ventured outside this hall , he is so apt to fall into things . If there should be a hole anywhere in your town he would be at the bottom of it before you could say Jack Robinson . Jonathan , call in the twins , and then hunt for McGinty . ( Enter CHINESE TWINS , who trot to F. ) KEZ . Allow me to introduce Ah Chin and Wun Lung , twins , who are inseparable , being joined together at birth by a ligament which no surgeon has yet dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the same conclusion  --  that to cut this cord would render these two poor creatures utterly useless for further business in this line . SONG . By AH CHIN and WUN LUNG . ( " From the Land of Tea , " by C. A. WHITE . ) ( This song is very effective if given with appropriate gestures . ) KEZ . And now , ladies and gentlemen , we come to this poor heathen woman who calls herself Ka-foozle-um . What it means I know not . It is impossible in a moral show to countenance such a barbarous name as that , so , arguing that K-a-may stand for Katy , and that F certainly does stand for Foozle , I have taken the liberty to christen this Turk Katy F. Slum . Katy , come forward and make your bow . ( To audience . ) I ca n't tell you what she will do . Sometimes she dances , sometimes she sings , and sometimes she turns stubborn and refuses to do anything . We will await the result . ( KA-FOOZLE-UM strikes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pianist plays the air of the song " Ka-foozle um " once through for the dance . At interlude KA-FOOZLE-UM poses before TINTORET in beseeching attitude , then leads him to F. He sings the explanatory song . All the freaks join in a spirited chorus , KA-FOOZLE-UM posing meantime with cymbals . At the end of third verse TINTORET pulls off her mask , and draws her to him . Tableau ! ) SONG . ( AIR , " Ka-foozle-um , " by HOWARD PAUL . ) TINTORET ( sings ) . In heathen lands there is a Turk , A horrid beast within the East , Who does the Prophet 's holy work As Ba-ba of Jerusalem ! He has a daughter , sweet and smirk , Complexion fair and curly hair ! With naught about her like a Turk , Except the name Ka-foozle-um ! Chorus . Oh , Ka-foozle-um ! Ka-foozle-um ! Ka-foozle-um ! Oh , Ka-foozle-um ! The daughter of the Ba-Ba ! ( Repeat . ) An artist this dear girl did see , And in his heart , felt Cupid 's dart ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He painted signs and prospered well , Possessing name and winning fame , So ringing at the Ba-ba 's bell , He asked him for Ka-foozle-um ! Chorus . Oh , Ka-foozle-um ! etc . The Ba-ba flew into a rage : Oh , how he swore and slammed the door , And said no Jew of any age Could manage to bamboozle him ! Now , while the trusting father dreams , These lovers bold , the Ba-ba sold ! This artist brave worked out his schemes , And carried off Ka-foozle-um ! ( Clasps her in his arms . ) Chorus . Oh , etc . ( TINTORET unmasks KA-FOOZLE-UM . ) ( All the freaks utter a prolonged Oh  --  and the music stops abruptly . Tableau ! The DWARFS laugh immoderately , the MERMAID fans herself with the hand-mirror , the CHINAMEN chuckle . ALLEGRO giggles , PENSEROSO sobs , GALASSI doubles up , and JONATHAN stands in doorway , R. , in open-mouthed astonishment . KEZIAH for a moment is paralyzed with astonishment . KEZ . Good gracious !
