txt About four years ago the heir apparent to the throne of Japan visited Europe , and an account of his journey , written by his private I secretary , has lately been published . From this journal it appears that the Japanese Prince 1 , was badly treated while in England , and it is quite possible that his sympathizing countrymen may , on reading the journal , be filled r with indignation ' against the British f Government . The Prince asserts that in November , 1881 , being then in London , he was invited to lunch with the Queen at Windsor Castle . Accordingly , he went to the castle , where the Prime Minister met him at the front door and led him into the dining . room . The Queen and her family were already at table . In fact , they were half through their meal , and instead of apologizing to the Prince for having failed to wait for him the Queen treated him with much coldness . It can not be denied that the Prince 's story puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had invited the Prince to lunch with her , and it was her duty-to wait for him for a reasonable length of time : The Prince gives us no reason to think that he arrived at the castle after the lunch hour , and offers no explanation of the Queen 's conduct except the implication that she was out of temper and thought it not worth while to be polite to a Japanese Prince . It will please all the friends and acquaintances of the Queen to learn that her apparent rudeness to her Japanese guest was not wholly without excuse . The Prince undoubtedly meant to give a truthful account of the affair , but in his ignorance of the English language and of English customs he made a grave mistake . The Queen 's note of invitation requested the Prince to be at Windsor Castle at " 1 o'clock sharp . " With kind forethought her Majesty inclosed in her note a railwaytime table , with a blue pencil mark opposite the 11:15 train , which was the one . she expected the Prince to take . It so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a London society journal that it was considered rude for a guest to appear promptly at the hour mentioned in his note of invitation . In accordance with this advice , the'Prince took the 12:80 train instead of the 11:15 , and purposely arrived at Windsor Castle at 2 o'clock . The Queen , having ascertained that her guest had not arrived by the 11:15 train , gave him up , and sat down to lunch at the usual hour . It would have been impracticable for her to wait another hour , , even if she had thought of so doing , for the Cabinet Ministers , who are entitled to whatever is left over after the Queen has had her lunch , were very hungry , and were , moreover , anxious to hold a Cabinet meeting at 2 : 30 . Mr. GLADSTONE himself begged her Majesty not to think of postponing the meal , and added that he knew Lord HARTINOTON was very hungry , for . he had not eaten anything since half past six in the morning . Grace was thereupon said without loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen sat down to lunch . Now , it can easily be seen that the , unexpected arrival of the Japanese Prince at 2 . o'clock was very unwelcome . The Queen could not ask him to sit down with her . for in that case she would have been compelled to remain at table for another half hour , and the Cabinet Ministers would have been entirely cheated out of their luncheon . There was only one thing for her to do , and she did it . ? She rose gracefully from the , table , and said to Mr. GLADTONE : " WILLIAM , you can let the Prince lunch with you and the other Ministers . Just tell the cook to put on another piece of ham , and to pour a little more hot water in the teapot . " So saying she withdrew , and the Japanese Prince , unwilling to eat with mere Ministers , went back to the railway station and took the first train to London . There would have been no trouble had the Prince complied with the Queen 's expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into difficulties by following the advice of a society editor , he had no one but himself to blame . Still , he will probably never learn the real state of the case , and will go down to his grave under the impression that Queen VICTORIA wantonly insulted him .
