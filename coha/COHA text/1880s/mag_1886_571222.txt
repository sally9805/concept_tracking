417 ARTICLE 111. - THE ETHICS OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF CONFUCIANISM COMPARED . I. IT is the aim of the following discussion to confine attention to the ethical relations of Christianity and Confucianism ; although moral and religious convictions can not be arbitrarily separated into two disconnected classes , each standing independent of the other . They have their common origin in the unity of the Divinely constituted human nature , and so are mutually interpenetrating . They are indeed the exercise of the same faculties in the twofold relation of man to man , and of man to God . Ethical teaching is an orderly unfolding of man 's relation to his fellow man , while right religious teaching is an orderly unfolding of man 's relation to God . Thus men 's religions convictions lie naturally at the basis of their moral convictions , and it will be found that the breadth , and accuracy , and vigor , of religious convictions largely determine the breadth , and accuracy , and vigor , of moral convictions . It follows , that a just estimate of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they are imbedded . There is a special interest to the student of the world 's history , that attaches to the study of ethical and religious teachings , since these Jeachings are the great spiritual forces that determine the varying types of civilization among the different nationalities of the earth . It is true that the average social life among any people lies far below the standard of right and duty which has been set up by Sages and social reformers , and has been responded to by the general conscience . There are tendencies in every man 's heart , and in society , however we may account for them , that turn men aside from those high ideals of virtue which they have set up for imitation . It follows that different estimates are formed of the civilizations of any nation , according as those estimates are based on the study of the high moral teachings that are found in the best literature of the nation , or on the other hand , are based on the study of the actual social life of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most opposite accounts of Chinese civilization in the writings of western scholars , those scholars all drawing their information from Chinese sources . Some have imagined that the ideal China , which is found pictured in the writings of the Sages , is the actual China , and have so described it ; while others have described the real China , as it reveals itself to the observing student . But to form a just estimate of Confucianism , we should not place those evils to its account which have not sprung out of its teachings , but have appeared and perpetuated themselves , in opposition to the true spirit of Co*ifucianism . Were a Chinese traveler to make the tour of England and America , pointing out the social evils which he had observed , and charging them back upon Christianity as the outcome of its teachings , Christian men and women would be justly offended at so rash and undiscriminating a conclusion . So we should not charge against Confucianism those evils of society which have not sprung naturally from its teachings . Its excellences or defects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by what it has accomplished for men , but by what it has failed to accomplish . A vessel is wrecked in a dangerous channel by reason of the lack of knowledge of the pilot in charge . In assuming to be able to guide the ship , he has made himself accountable for the misfortune that has resulted . So Confucianism , in assuming to be able to pilot men through the tortuous channel of human obligation , makes itself responsible for the moral losses which it has not wisdom enough to prevent . A special interest attaches to the study of the ethical teachings that have prevailed in China , since we find here not only one of the oldest and earliest developed civilizations , but also a civilization that stands in comparative isolation from the rest of the world . There is no evidence that the ethical ideas of the Chinese have been borrowed from external sources . Their Sages acknowledge no such indebtedness , but teach that their doctrines are derived from the light of nature . The solidarity and antiquity of the central truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been learners from the outside world . The Christian scholar is therefore delighted to find in Confucianism an independent corroboration // 419 of many of the ethical teachings set forth in the Scriptures , a testimony to the unity of the fundamental moral convictions of the human race , and an independent refutation of the theory that man has no original moral nature , but that his moral convictions have been slowly evolved , through a long and fierce struggle for existence with his fellow man . The divergence of Confucianism from the moral teachings of the Scriptures illustrates on the other hand , the inability of even the wisest and best of human teachers , to set forth maxims that will not result in error in many of their remoter applications . We shall farther observe as we proceed , that a chief source of men 's errors in judging of human relations and duties , lies in a distorted or false religious belief , showing that correct ethical teachings must be based on a correct religious faith . No man has ever adequately unfolded the relations of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man to God . II . Christianity and Confucianism are agreed in regarding men as endowed from birth with a moral nature . We read in the first chapter of Genesis the august words : " And God said , let us make man in Our image , after Our likeness . " As the Scriptures assume the being and sovereignty of God , without any categorical announcement , so they assume that man is born with a moral nature , subject to the law of God , God 's commands are issued to men , with promises of reward for obedience , and threatenings of punishment for disobedience . Our Saviour assumed that man is possessed of this moral , and therefore responsible , nature as the basis of all his teachings . He came not to destroy the law of God , to which man as a moral being is subject , but to fulfill . Men though estranged from God by reason of sin , were to bow before Him in penitence and faith , calling Him their Heavenly Father . They were to place the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving to be perfect even as their Father in Heaven was perfect . The Apostle Paul boldly declares that the Gentiles , who have not the revealed law of God , yet have a law written in their hearts , by which they will be acquitted or condemned . Even abandoned sinners , who have come to be without natural affections , know the judgment of God , that they who commit such things are worthy of death . So Confucian // scholars uniformly teach that man is born with a moral nature . We read in the Book of History : " The Exalted Ruler Above has bestowed a moral nature upon the people below . " The word which I have translated , " the moral nature , " is explained as " the good heart . " A fuller explanation is that Heaven has conferred upon man a nature containing the law of benevolence , righteousness , propriety , wisdom , without deflection or inclination . This is called the good nature . The ancient literature of China has preserved no traditions , so far as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , or of their possessing an original civilization . The aborigines of the land are conceived of as living in a primitive state , without clothing , without houses , without fire , eating raw food , not knowing the flavor of meat , without social regulations . This was the state of nature before the moral faculties had been awakened into life and activity . Then appeared the Sages and Holy men , among the people , as the gift of Heaven , to teach them the relations and duties of life , as also to cultivate the soil , and to prepare for themselves proper food and clothing . The people responded to the instructions given with the simplicity and alacrity of children , and a high state of social order soon resulted . In this fanciful picture of the early condition of the Chinese we have a conception of the work of the Sages and Holy men , that is uniformly preserved throughout the literature of the people . The common people were possessed of a nature as perfect in the range of its capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wait for the light of the sun to quicken it into life , so their moral capacities must wait for the light of the teaching and example of the Sages to quicken them into life . We read in the opening passage of the Doctrine of the Mean : " What Heaven has conferred is called nature . " This perfect nature is given to all men alike , and the Sage differs from other men , only in that he has first comprehended his nature , and perfectly unfolded its capacities . In the opening passage of the Great Learning we read : " The doctrine of the Great Learning pertains to making lustrous the lustrous virtue , " that is , the unfolding of the original capacities of the perfect nature . We are told that this bright virtue is received from Heaven , pure , spiritual , un // clouded , embodying all moral principles , and in harmony with all things . Mencius tells us that , " Tie great man does not lose his child-heart . " Again he says : " Men lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but they lose the heart , " that is , the child-heart , " and have no under*tanding to seek after it . The path of education is none other than to seek after the lost heart . " Let us here note the fundamental error of Confucian teaching concerning man 's nature , as measured by the Christian staudard . Christianity tells us of an original apostasy from God , and the Old Testament Scriptures uniformly represent the entire race of man as persistently tending towards evil . The Scriptures never speak of the naturally good heart of man , but continually speak of the naturally evil heart of man ; and the apostle Paul distinctly teaches that his heart , which so coustantly inclines towards evil , is inherited from Adam , the progenitor of the race , and this evil nature God regards and treats as sinful . Confucianism stands in direct antagonism to such teaching . To charge man as possessed of a nature tending towards evil from birth is regarded as blasphemy against Heaven . The doctrine of the Philosopher llsiin Tsi*i , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected by the whole line of Confucian scholars , as an offense against Heaven and against man . Confucius says : " Men 's natures are naturally near , " that is as explained , they are alike good at birth . " By education they become remotely separated , " that is , by right education some become Sages and Holy men , while others by wrong education become monsters of wickedness . Mencius boldly teaches that the Emperors Chieh and Chon , though they descended to the greatest depths of wickedness , did not differ in their Heaven-derived natures from the holy Emperors Yao and Shun . Their , sins were wholly to be accounted for by external evil influences , rousing unbalanced desires in the heart . Mencius rejects the teaching of Kao Tsii concerning man 's nature , as false and degrading . Kao Tsi*i taught that the nature at birth was in a state of indifference , without tendency either towards good or evil . The willow tree supplies material out of which the workman fashions dishes according to his pleasure . So righteousness and benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by education . Again nature is like water , that flows to the east or west , according as an opening* is made for it . Mencius opposes this teaching , pointing out that violence is done to the nature of the willow in cutting it and fashioning it into vessels , while no violence is done to the nature to produce righteousness and benevolence . Water is indeed indifferent as to the direction of its flow , whether east or west , but not so as to its flow whether upwards of downwards . It can be forced over a mountain , but its law is to flow downwards . So by forcing the nature men are driven into evil , but the law of the nature is towards goodness . Man 's nature tends to*wards goodness as the mountains tend to clothe themselves with forests . Men may cut down the trees with axes , and cattle browse away the young shoots that spring np from roots , in nature 's effort to recover its normal condition , until at last the mountains are bald and desolate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the effect of external violence . So men become wicked by external evil influences , doing violence to their Heaven-derived nature . In all this there is no hint of any natural tendency of the human heart towards evil . How different from the language of Scripture which declares that , " The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked . " I will only note in this place two evils that grow out of this distorted conception of human nature . The first is a false estimate of the ease with which men may be turned from sin to holiness . Confucius regrets at one , time that none of the princes employ him to correct the evils of government . If thus employed , three years would be sufficient to restore order . If good government continued for a hundred years , the evils of society would disappear . Confucius was employed for a short time as minister of crhne in the kingdom of Lu . In three months good government was restored . If articles were lost in the streets the passers-by were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not closed at night . Men and women walked in different paths . This fanciful idea of the ease with which the evils of society can be brushed aside , has been crystallized in the classical writings of the people , and handed down from generation to generation as a pleasing // dream , while actual human nature in China has been as obstinate in resisting good influences as in the rest of the world . The second evil that I would note is closely related to the first , and has been illustrated in the examples given above . A false estimate of the transforming power of sages and holy men over the lives of their fellows . The errors of the people are regarded as springing from a lack of right instruction and example . The sages supply the needed instruction , and set the right example , and immediately men turn towards virtue , as wanderers turn towards the true road . " The virtue of the superior man is like the wind , the virtue of the common people is like the grass ; when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest influence is that of a king , who can regulate society by the law of heaven . A sage king has only to shed forth the glory of his virtues , like the brightshining of the sun , and immediately the hearts of the officers and people respond to his virtues , and move about him in beautiful social order . But Confucius is imagined to be the embodiment of all heavenly wisdom and virtue . He has been exalted to a dignity above that of kings , in the affections of the people . His writings have been the food of thought , the patterns of government , and of social life , from generation to generation ; and yet the evils of which he complained in his time , have not melted away and disappeared , under the transforming influence of his life and teachings . He has reigned as Emperor of China not three years , not one hundred years , but two thousand four hundred years , and we look out upon a China that worships Confucius as a God , and has woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak , which is worn with proud ostentation , but which , alas , is spread over lives abounding with the sins which those maxims condemn . III Christianity and Confucianism are agreed in regarding man as subject to law , according to which he ought to regulate his life . Christianity assumes that man has written in his nature a law of right and duty . This law responds to the revealed law of God as the eye responds to the light . As light would be without meaning were there no eye to perceive , so the light of divine revelation would be without meaning , were // there no eye of conscience to perceive its radiance . This truth is poetically set forth in proverbs : " The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord , searching all the inward parts . " The apostle Paul tells us that the Gentiles show the work of the law written in their hearts ; and John warns us that , " If our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , which all men may understand by studying their own hearts , is not a sufficient light , and that there has been superadded the fuller , clearer law of the Divine Command . We are toki in Psalms that the law was given , " That men might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments . " Confucianism fully recognizes this law written in the human heart . In the opening passage of the Doctrine of the Mean we read : " Following nature is the path , " that is , of virtue . This path is not remote from men , and difficult to find . It is near at hand , and all may walk in it . Fidelity to one 's relatives , and goodness to all men , is the law of benevolence ; reverence to superiors , and deference to associates , is the law of propriety ; serving the prince , and respecting the superior , is the law of righteousness ; discriminating between the true and the false , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law of Heaven by studying their Heaven-derived natures . Thus Confucianism is chiefly occupied in defining the relations of man to man . If those relations are properly regulated , and those duties are properly discharged , the law of Heaven is fulfilled , and men 's lives are in harmony with Heaven . General prosperity and worldly good-fortune will be the result . In this the order of Christianity is reversed . That order is , to first correct the heart relation of man to God , and following this , the human relations are easily regulated . As we have seen , the Sages and Holy men are exalted to the rank of the interpreters of Heaven . Out of their clear intuitions they unfold the laws of life . They are regarded as perfect in wisdom and virtue . Their example is therefore without error , and their teachings are infallible . This conception of the Sages and Holy men excludes the idea of a special Divine Revelation . No higher truths than they have propounded are necessary for the moral // improvement of men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to righteousness . The result of such a false conception of the character and office of the Sages , is to exalt them into a place of reverence that passes into worship , and thus places imperfect , fallible men in the seat of the perfect , infallible God . It further brings men into a kind of intellectual and spiritual slavery to the teachings of past ages , and thus hinders their growth in knowledge and virtue . IV . Christianity and Confucianism are agreed in tracing human obligation to a Supreme Source , Christianity to God , and Confucianism to Heaven . Christianity conceives of human nature as the gift of God , of law as the will of God , of destiny as the verdict of God on the free moral acts of men . The Heaven of the ancient Chinese had elements of personality which have been clouded over in modern times by the speculations of materializing philosophers . Heaven in the ancient classics is the supreme ruler . Laws were established , and decrees put forth , by Heaven . Wicked rulers were overturned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionate ; the favor of Heaven was propitiated by prayers and offerings . This conception of Heaven , involving an intelligent personality , does not disappear in the later classics . It was observed of Confucius that Heaven was about to use him as an alarm-bell . " To those that sin against Heaven there is no place for prayer . " At the death of his beloved disciple , Yen Hui , Confucius exclaimed , " Alas , Heaven is destroying me , Heaven is destroying me . " Passages of this class can be multiplied , which if translated into western languages , and read in the light of the clear theism of Christianity , would be understood to involve a conception of God . Yet , on the other hand , Heaven is conceived of as standing apart from man , silent and distant in its august majesty . It is without voice or sound . No other revelation is vouchsafed than that which is made through the teachings of the Sages , or manifested by the concurrent will of the people . We read in the Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hearing and seeing of the people , Heaven 's manifestations of favor to the good and of terror to the evil are in accordance with the people 's manifestations of favor to the good and of terror to // the evil . " Heaven is father , and the earth is mother , this language showing that only the upholding , nourishing power of Heaven and earth is thus symbolized . We have at best in the Heaven of the ancient Chinese but a blurred , distorted conception of the God of Heaven . The Creator and the creature are confounded , and the glory of the Creator has already set in eclipse behind the works of His hand . These reflections are not aside from the theme under discussion . Christian ethical teachings rest for their ultimate principles on man 's relation to God . The doctrine of God , his character , his law , his relation to man , is unfolded with ever increasing clearness through the long line of prophets , culminating in the reVelation of God in Christ , who was Immanuel , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory , and the express image of His person . " The fountains of Divine love are opened for the parched and thirsty lips of men . The glorious perfections of the character of God are revealed , and truth , right , duty , in man 's relation to his fellow man , catch the luster of the Heavenly light in which they are bathed . But in Confucianism the light of the knowledge of God , which at first appears only as a confused reflection from a broken mirror , gives place at length to deep , impenetrable darkness , which has settled down over China . Men professing themselves to be wise have become fools , and have changed the glory of the uncorruptible God , not indeed into an image made like to corruptible man , but into blind force and dead matter , spontaneously acting and reacting without thought , without will , without purpose , without heart . Nature is a vast machine of fate , rolling and whirring on without a guiding hand . The little lives of men are but sparks that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scintillate for a moment , and then go out in darkness . Motives to a pure and noble life do not spring from the command of God , " Be ye holy , for I am holy , " but from the cold ideal of a dead law , without love , without compassion , without power to help . Thus , Christian ethics are vital with the consciousness of man 's relation to God . They are living waters that spring from the Eternal Fountain ; while Confucian ethics are like waters that have long since been cut off from their perennial source , and have become stagnant and bitter , without power to slake the spirit 's thirst , and q*iicken the life of men . // Y. Briefly compare the lives of Christ and of Confucius , to bring before our minds the different ideals that the two systems hold up for imitation . Christianity describes Christ as the incarnation of the eternal God , the revelation among men of the Divine perfections . Confucianism describes Confucius as raised up by Heaven to correct the evils of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so is exalted to a kind of associate relationship with Heaven and earth , to assist them in moulding the hearts of men . Christ while in the world lived a life of prayer , of the closest communion with the Father , in all things seeking to do His will . Confucius lived a prayerless life , conscious of no need of communion with a Being above himself , conscious of no sins that needed to be confessed to such a Being , conscious of no weaknesses that needed help from above to overcome . Christ came to set up a Universal Kingdom of love in the world . Confucius went about among the divided kingdoms of his time , seeking to restore good government after the models of the ancient Sage-kings . Christ opened up for men 's feet a pathway of holy living , that led on to a blessed immortal destiny , Himself walking in that pathway , clothed in the bright garments of perfect virtue . Confucius groped among the graves of the dead past , imitating the stiff ceremonial virtues of the ancient worthies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no higher hope or ambition than to revive the good customs of antiquity . VI . There is a strong contrast between the Christian and the Confucian conception of sin . Sin to the Christian man is an offense against God . The relation is a personal , vital one . " Against thee , " said the Psalmist , " thee only have I sinned , and done this evil in Thy sight . " Deep , spiritual , heart repentance towards God is a constant Scripture theme . Sin to the Conft*cianist is an offense against the majesty of Heaven , a departure from law . It is constantly spoken of as error , deflection , something to be put away by good resolutions , something to be grown out of by self-culture . There is no conscience of the deep guilt of sin , no groaning in the struggle with a heart that is desperately wicked . There is no conception of the deceiving , blinding , destroying power of sin . All men have // strength , if they would only use it , to overcome their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy men . Thus sin becomes a kind of external tarnish , that obscures the luster of the naturally bright virtues , that can be easily brushed aside , when those virtues assume their original brilliancy . The virtue of truthfulness in speech , and of sincerity in life , is often commended in Chinese classical writings . Confucius was not always truthful or sincere , but in this regard he stood on a plain high above the most of his contemporaries . Mencius , though endowed with a keener intellect than Confucius , showed less stability of moral character , and often , in his political aud ethical discussions , descended to the level of a cunning casuist . The mass of the Chinese , from the days of Confucius and Mencius down to the present time , have been false in word and insincere in life , and the most false and insincere of all have been the scholars , who while they are untruthful in word and in life , are perpetually praising the virtue of integrity and uprightness . Shakspeare puts into the mouth of the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purse steals trash ; but he that filches from me my good name , robs me of that which not enriches him , and makes me poor indeed . " lagos abound in China , who know how to cover the darkest falsehoods in the brightest livery of truth . If it be not just to charge this deep moral prostration back upon Confucianism as its cause , it yet can be urged that Confucianism has been powerless to correct this evil , and that it has increased in volume and intensity from age to age . VIE There are parallels and divergences between the Christian and the Confucian conception of the relation of king and people . Christianity teaches that governments are ordained of God ; Confucianism , that they are ordained of Heaven . Both systems teach that evil human laws ought to be broken , evil rulers , in the last extreme , ought to be set aside . Confucianism , while propounding such principles , qualifies them with the greatest care . It is only when the will of Heaven has been most clearly revealed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the constituted authority . Doubtless the idea of* the natural dignity of human nature , and the birth equality of all men , has done much to keep open to the lower classes // the road of progress , and has checked the tendency towards caste , but Confucianism has always showed an inclination towards aristocracy . The people are held in a kind of childish servility , and the king , as the representative of Heaven , is exalted to a position of superstitions reverence . The ideals of government that prevailed when China was but a handful of people , are held up for imitation under entirely altered conditions , and the people are hindered in growing into self-responsibility by the excessive estimate of the fatherly supervision and protection , which it belongs to the emperor to exercise . The unity of the family is emphasized without a proper discrimination of the rights of individuals , and punishment for sin falls continually upon the innocent along with the guilty . VIII The Christian and the Confucian conception of the relation of parent and child differs in many regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for the child than the child for the parent . God has committed to the parent an immortal soul , to be fitted , by faithful teaching and example , for its high destiny . Confucianism reverses this order , and emphasizes the relation of child to parent . The child is to live for the parent . This is filial piety . He is to serve the parents while living , anticipating their every want , and is to worship them when dead with the proper ceremonies . Confucianism holds the child in perpetual minority during the life of the parent . A boy of seventy appears in the gay colored garments of childhood , and sports in the presence of his centennarian father . A man of such a surpassing spirit of obedience is canonized in Confucian literature , for the mutation of the generations to come . Confucianism gives unjust power to the parent over the life of the child , which is often exercised with the utmost cruelty and selfishness . Sins against parents are visited with fearful punishments , while sins against children are slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the father was attempting to break into his room to steal . The question of punishment was appealed to the highest officers of government . They decided that the son must be cut to pieces for the sin , since it must have been by his unfilial life that the father was driven to steal ! The relation of parent and child // thus becomes one of authority and of fear , rather than of tenderness and of love . This exaggerated idea of the relation of child to parent distorts the conception of duty in other relations . Parents and children are to help each other in covering np sins . The case is snbmitted to Confucius of a man who has taken possession of a stray sheep , belonging to a neighbor . The son exposes the father 's crime . The question is asked whether the son has acted properly ; to which Confucius replies : " With ns the father secretes for the son , and the son secretes for the father . " Wife and children are to be neglected for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away his wife and children , because his father has unjustly driven him from home , and this act is commended by Mencius as showing the man 's spirit of obedience to his father . He would not enjoy the pleasures of a husband and a father , if he could not discharge the duties of a sdn . Reverence for parents passes into worship of dead ancestors and thus becomes idolatry . IX . Christianity and Confucianism are agreed in regarding the relation of husband and wife as a sacred and exalted one . Christianity places it first in importance , while Confucianism subordinates it to the relation of parent and child . Christ came into the world , born of a pure and devout woman . His tenderness and love towards the wom*en who followed Him and ministered to Him , has done much to exalt their place in Christian society . The wife has come to be the companion of her husband . In childhood she has been trained in knowledge , and cultivated in virtue , and when the responsibilities of motherhood come upon her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , both by wise precepts and a right example . Good seed is thus sown in the tender years of childhood , which produces beautiful flowers and luscious fruits , in later years . Confucianism degrades woman , it neglects her education . The popular saying , " It is the virtue of a woman to be without talent , " is a true embodiment of the spirit of Confucianism towards women . This reminds us of the saying in the evil days of American history , now happily past , that slaves were only injured by being educated , which was true if they were to be kept in slavery . Women in China are kept // in ignorance . Among the wealthy they live in pampered idleness ; among the poor their lot is one of drudgery . Children are born to them and committed to their care , bat they are themselves but children in knowledge and self-government . They rule with passion and caprice , and the minds of the children , in their most impressible years , are fed on husks and chali . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or cunning and hypocritical . They follow their evil impulses , and the evil example set before them , of abandonment to paroxysms of rage , when their wills are in the slightest crossed . And thus in a land of boasted filial piety , filial impiety abounds in all classes of society . There is little hope of renovating China , until the mothers of China are renovated in heart and life . Confucianism justifies polygamy . It declares that the greatest act of filial impiety is to be without children . Confucitis was the son of a concubine , and the Confucian literature has no word of condemnation for the practice of polygamy . Shun received from Yao his two daughters at once for wives , and emperors and high officers , in an unbroken line , have set before the people , in this regard , an evil example . Women can be divorced for seven reasons : irreverence to the husband 's parents , impurity , laziness , barrenness , excessive talking , theft , evil disease . If a husband is stricken down by death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wife to destroy herself , and be buried in the tomb with her husband . There is a tablet in Tungehon near my home , erected by the officers of the city in honor of a woman , who starved herself to death by the grave of her husband . The memory of this commendable act is thus preserved for the imitation of other women . There is no lot so hard in China as that of the young wife . She is yoked in life , without choice of her own , to an entire stranger . For the husband to love the wife is a weakness to be condemned . The son must side with the mother against the wife , and beat her as he would a child , at his own or the mother 's caprice . Cases of suicide are continually occurring among the people , where young wives find life unsupportable , and they choose self-destruction to end their miseries . So general is the tyranny of mothers-in-law , that young wives are congratulated by their friends , when the // mother-in-law has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of women , until the graces of gentleness and pnrity , of patience and love , write themselves in lines of beauty upon their faces , as they grow old in years . Confucianism neglects the culture of women , and as they grow old in years , their faces grow ugly with the marks of ignorance and neglect , of selfishness and passion . X. In nothing do the ethics of Christianity and Confucianism show a more marked divergence than in the spirit of philanthropy which distinguishes Christianity , but which is comparatively lacking in Confucianism . According to Christian teaching , love begins towards those that are near , but it flows forth until it encompasses with its blessings the most remote , the most degraded members of the race . Wherever the Christian sees ignorance , and sorrow , and sin , there does he see a brother to be taught , and comforted , and purified . Paul accounted himself a debtor to all men , to unfold to them the *truths of a better life . The Sages of China perceived and announced the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ; but the demands of Confucian reciprocity fall far short of the demands of Christian philanthropy . Reciprocity , at best , is only the duty of benevolence towards those in the midst of whom our lives are cast . ft has never been a moral , propulsive power , sending men forth to lead lives of self-denial , in persistent and methodical efforts for the good of others . Confucianism rejects love as the bond of the family , and substitutes parental tenderness , and filial respect . The philosopher Mo Tsi* proposed universal love as the bond of the family and of society . His teachings draw much closer to the Christian doctrine of love for all men than do the teachings of Confucian scholars . Mencius caricatures and repudiates his teachings , as destroying the five relations , nrging men to love a passing traveler with the same love that they exercise towards a parent . Mencius contrasts the relation between brothers , with the relation between strangers , in a manner that proves him to have no conception of the brotherhood of man . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bow to kill another stranger , and he laughingly exhorts him to desist ; but if he sees a brother in a like act , he exhorts him with flowing // tears . The killing of a stranger , or the death of another stranger in punishment , is of slight consideration , but the thought of a brother losing his life in punishment for crime , fills his heart with the deepest consternation . Thus , Confucian ethics are selfish and not humanitarian . They have ever tended towards egoism . Christian motives in life begin and end in God . Confucian motives begin in an ideal law , and end in an ideal self-culture . Pharisceism has been the natural result . China has been to the Confucianist the favored land of Heaven . It has been enlightened with the knowledge of the pure doctrines of Heaven , and adorned with the lives of Heaven-sent Sages and Holy men . The inhabitants of other lands are outside barbarians , not indeed to be pitied , and helped to a better life , but to be walled out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Archimedes , delighted with the discovery of the control of mechanical power , boasted that with a proper foundation he could move the world . Confucianism has boasted that the teachings of the Sages , resting for their foundation on the law of Heaven , could easily move the world ; and yet the world upon which Confucianism has exerted its power , has sunk deeper and ever deeper into sin . Christianity now comes to a world helplessly sold under sin , and declares that with the Law . of God as a foundation , and the Gospel of Christ as a lever , it can lift the world into a new life of love to God and love to man . It points to its magnificent achievements in the past and in the present , in transforming the lives of men , as a pledge of its continued power in the future . It comes to China , both as a system of ethics , and as a system of religion , not as a suppleinent to Confucianism , but as a substitute . It does not offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , to fill the holes , and improve the appearance of the Confucian garment ; but it offers a new and complete robe , to all who will cast off their old garments , and receive the gift of God in humility , in penitence , in faith .
