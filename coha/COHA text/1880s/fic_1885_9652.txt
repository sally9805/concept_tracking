He could thunder off famous classic pieces on the piano ( imaginary ) so accurately that musical experts could name the pieces .

WIDOW Yes , as I was saying , years and years ago I got hit  --  just here  --  by an Irishman  --  MOTHER LEROUX The brute ! WIDOW Oh , he did n't mean it  --  it was n't intentional . I was passing along the sidewalk , and he  --  er  --  he fell off the roof  --  he was at work up there , you know  --  and I was n't noticing , and he struck me just there  --  there , you , you can feel if you like  --  ( The OLD WOMEN feel his head. )  --  and then he bounced off like that ( Circles in the air with hand. )  --  summersaults , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

WIDOW At this late date I could not be certain , of course . Still , I think there was considerable variety . MADAME CARON ( To MADAME BATHILDE . ) She is certainly touched in her mind . It is not safe for her to be alone . One of us must sleep with her to-night . MADAME BATHILDE You are perfectly right . Will you propose it ? MADAME CARON You never can tell what a person in her condition will do . Like as not just take a freak and object . MADAME BATHILDE Quite right  --  best to just act , and say nothing . MADAME CARON I think so . I wonder  --   --  do you think she could become violent ? MADAME BATHILDE I think not , but there 's no telling . Perhaps I 'd better come , too .

MADAME CARON You think it best ? CHICAGO To speak to her ? Yes , I think so .

( They precede CHICAGO to the WIDOW . ) MADAME CARON Dear Madame Tillou would you like several of us to come and sleep with you to-night ? WIDOW ( Looks from one to the other speechless . Then aside . ) That 's Chicago 's work  --  I 'll drown that fellow , yet . ( In CHICAGO 's ear . ) Get me out of this scrape  --  and go hang yourself . CHICAGO ( Delivers check-book to WIDOW . ) ( To MESDAMES CARON and BATHILDE privately . ) It seems to disturb her ; I would n't push it .

He never wrote any  --  except a line now and then to tell me of his health and enclose me a little money to live on . Dearly as we loved each other there was a coolness . He could n't get over it because I did n't name all the children after him . I did name eleven of them for him  --  MADAME CARON ( Aside . ) There , her mind 's wandering again . WIDOW Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an unappeasable appetite that way . Now then , go on and tell me in three words the amount of this debt , when it is due , the man 's name , and  --  MOTHER LEROUX Fifteen thousand francs . He gave us till to-day . His name is Andr  --  Bastien Andr  --  picture-dealer and usurer . WIDOW It is a cruel and shameful thing . And you were old particular friends of my poor brother ? MADAME LEROUX Oh , yes . WIDOW This must be looked into . MOTHER LEROUX Ah , if you only could persuade him to extend the time ! Oh , if you only can !

MOTHER LEROUX ( Weeping ; with French passion repeatedly kisses the hem of the WIDOW 's garment . ) WIDOW ( To ANDR  --  pause  --  inspecting him critically . ) Is it the custom of people in your line of business to go around in person to collect financial chicken-feed like this ?

WIDOW ( Signs two cheques , per sample  --  gives them to ANDR ; gives the receipt to MOTHER LEROUX . ) My brother owed you some money . Here it is . I do n't want a receipt  --  the cheque-stub will answer . And here are the 15,000 . ( Seriously . ) I wish to say a word to you ,  --  then you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I am a lady and that privilege is denied me . From these friends I know your history . You are a man without pity  --  a man whose lust for money has withered every kindly impulse you were born with . You found my brother and his poor young artist-friends struggling honestly and manfully for their bread against hunger and misery , and you have traded upon their poverty ; ( Gradually rising excitement. ) you have bought their pictures for francs , and sold them for Louis d'or , you have hidden their talents , such as they were , from the world , ( Rising from seat. ) you have beguiled them into debt and robbed them in a hundred mean and pitiful ways ; and yonder , stretched upon his bed lies that blameless old man whom your deceptions , your inhumanities , your pitiless brutalities have brought there  --  PAPA LEROUX ( Tottering in R. feeble , excited  --  appealingly . ) Ah , beg him to have mercy ! WIDOW ( With vehemence . ) I am a lady , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say  --  that from head to heel , from heart to marrow , from pallet to midriff you are a mean , cowardly , contemptible , base-begotten damned scoundrel !  --  oh !

WIDOW To make me forget that you ever said those cruel words to me . ANDR About  --   --  ? WIDOW The time you said if I did n't marry you you would carry my poor brother 's contract into the courts ? ANDR I never meant it , darling  --  never , never . It was only a wild outburst of despair . Forgive me , precious . You do forgive me , do n't you ? WIDOW Forgive you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so gladly . But you know , as long as that piece of paper exists to remind me of that cruel hour  --  ANDR ( Kiss . ) It shall cease to exist the moment you promise to be mine .

Two witnesses ,  --  pals of his , I suppose . ( Aloud . ) Poor brother ! I suppose it was the last thing he did before he went away to die ? ( Puts the paper down . ) ANDR Almost the very last . Returned it to me by the hand of the witnesses . I had been unkind and had refused the poor dear fellow 's pictures . I was sorry and ashamed , for he was really right in saying the old contract should have read " Shall " the way this one does , and so I framed this one , dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signed and sent it to him for his signature .

And he hugged me the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it strange ? WIDOW I never could have believed it . MARIE Well , it 's true , just as I tell you . You remind me of him in so many ways . You look like him , you act like him , you have his dear voice , you almost walk like him . WIDOW Do I ? MARIE Indeed you do . He was more graceful ; but in woman 's clothes I think he would n't have been . I do n't think he would have kicked his skirts around the way you do sometimes ; still he might because he was an impetuous creature . ( Aside . ) Phew ! I do wish she would n't smoke . WIDOW I am glad I remind you of him . MARIE Well , you do  --  oh , in so many many ways . All these three months it 's been almost as if I was with him . WIDOW Yes ?

MARIE The day . WIDOW The day ? MARIE The funeral . WIDOW ( Aside . ) O , hang the funeral . I ca n't keep it in my mind  --  I 've never had one before . ( Aloud . ) No , I had not forgotten  --  I always whistle when I am sad . MARIE Well , that 's one thing that 's not like him  --  but it 's almost the only one . Oh , he was so good , and tender , and kind . He had pity for everybody that was in trouble , and would do everything he could to help them . I wish you were more like him in those ways , Daisy . WIDOW For instance ? MARIE Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loves you , Daisy . WIDOW He 's a bad man , and he tried to ruin your father . MARIE Yes , he is bad , but there is good in everybody , somewhere ; and he has never had the right influences around him . It hurts me so , to see you keep him hopeful a week , and then miserable a week , and then hopeful again , and then  --   --   --  why , Daisy you know it 's cruel . And Chicago  --  Chicago 's always egging him on , and telling him you 'll marry him yet , and it 's too bad . WIDOW Would you like me to marry him , dear-heart ? MARIE Y-yes  --  I would . Because it would uplift him , it would save him . WIDOW Why , you poor innocent , he 's only after my money , that 's all . MARIE Daisy ! it 's no such thing . WIDOW How do you know ? MARIE Because he told me so . WIDOW That settles it . MARIE Well , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Do let me , Daisy . WIDOW No , I 'll be d ( Her hand on his mouth. ) hanged if I will . MARIE Well , then , wo n't you put him out of his trouble ? WIDOW I  --  er  --  I do n't know about that . MARIE Do , dear Daisy  --  for my sake . WIDOW ( Aside  --  musing . ) Cap-ital idea ! I see my way out . Chicago can send out and buy the things and take the dimensions , and at 10 o'clock to-night  --  ( Aloud . ) Ah , well , I give in  --  I suppose if you were to ask me for my head I 'd have to give it to you , dear . MARIE You darling sister ! ( Kiss . ) WIDOW I 'll be alone in this room at ten to-night . Send him word to slip in here in a quiet way and unannounced . I 'll give him his answer , plain yes or plain no . MARIE O , goody ! And try to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so . WIDOW Well , we 'll see , we 'll see .

Plurality in wives I regard as an offence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must I. C. Man-Servant . One moment , sir . I am not mistaken  --  you are  --  ? Reporter . I am . C. Man-Servant . I was sure of it . When I am dead-sure of a thing in that way . I always want to find somebody , who thinks the contrary , to bet with . Reporter . Sorry I ca n't oblige . I never bet myself . C. Man-Servant . You are wise . Your value , as a stake , is trifling . You are not money  --  reporters never are ; you are not even a cup . Reporter . Nevertheless I can hold almost any given quantity . C. Man-Servant . Hem ! Pardon my seeming obtuseness , but the fact is , the beer sold in this garden is from a boycotted firm , which I am bound in honor not to patronize . Reporter . Bound in what ? C. Man-Servant . In honor . Reporter . Hem ! Pardon my seeming obtuseness , but the fact is , I do not understand the foreign language you are now amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with leg up , carelessly ) . Come now , Ben Busted , tell me by what extraordinary circumstance you , one of the gilded youth of New York , heir to a fortune and a fine family name , are now seen in the humble and not altogether savory capacity of reporter for the society papers . Reporter . The same not extraordinary but very ordinary circumstance which has reduced you yourself , Gordon Goneup , a man about town , and well-known club lounger in every city of the two hemispheres , to some low level in the social world which I do not as yet quite fix . What are you , Gordon ? C. Man-Servant . I am a confidential man-servant . Reporter ( in surprise ) . Indeed ! To whom ? C. Man-Servant . To a gentleman of New York . Reporter . That statement confines guessing to a narrow circle . I shall call them all off , and when I see your face change I shall know I 've hit the right one , as the spiritual mediums do when they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's side . C. Man-Servant . I like being a man-servant with a gentleman better than being a gentleman with a man-servant . Reporter . You surprise me . You are democratic indeed . George Washington himself was less so . Even the present President falls short of the Jeffersonian simplicity of which you boast . C. Man-Servant . I 'd rather be right than President . Reporter . The people of the United States would rather you would too , I 'm sure . C. Man-Servant . Then all are satisfied . What can we wish for more ? Shake hands . They shake hands . Reporter . Is it possible that you have squandered your entire fortune , Gordon ? C. Man-Servant . Yes . I have run through the chemical works . Reporter . Dear me ! Now I should have thought that , on the contrary , the chemical works  --  C. Man-Servant . Oh no . I am a wonderful alchemist . I got the whip-hand of them . I turned everything into greenbacks . Reporter . And then turned greenbacks into everything . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But tell me , does your employer move in the very highest circles of society ? C. Man-Servant . He scales the Right Calm of the Alps of American fashion . Reporter . Dear me ! How exalted ! I wonder if you and I could not make a deal ? C. Man-Servant . Do n't ask me to write a letter to you saying I will wait upon him as you direct . I do not wish to be indicted . Reporter . No . Something easier than that ; something done quite in  --  in  --  what was that peculiar word you used just now ? Lays his finger on his brow , as if in thought . C. Man-Servant . Honor ? Reporter ( snaps his fingers ) . That 's it ! Knew I 'd heard the word before . Learnt it at school . Have n't thought of it since . Forgot it along with my Greek and Hebrew . What I was going to propose is this . You live in luxury , do you not ? C. Man-Servant . I do . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side to being a gentleman such as I was . Same pleasures , same table , same carriages , horses , yachts , opera-boxes , and so on . Less the consideration , true ; but , on the other hand , less the responsibility , which equalizes the matter to a nicety . What can I do to oblige you ? Reporter . Just this . You can give me items for my paper of what goes on in the circles of high life . Like this , you know . Albert Scotland has given his mother 's diamonds to a Parisian soubrette , Mrs. Pompadour Dubarry is a friend of Mr Sovereign King . All that sort of thing . Do you take ? C. Man-Servant ( holds out his hand ) . Yes , any thing . Reporter Oh , that 's all right . The paper is generous for a beat in scandal . We will go shares in what I earn . C. Man-Servant . Very good . You shall hear from me shortly . I can give you cart-loads of the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Reporter . You are going ? C. Man-Servant . Yes ; I see my employer yonder . He may come this way . Reporter . And you walk off the other ? C. Man-Servant . Quite so . He might want me to do something for him , and I 'd rather not . Strolls off leisurely through trees at back . Reporter ( solus ) . Big stroke of luck , my meeting him . I shall dispose of all I can write now , and then I 'll be exhibited in the dime museums as the greatest curiosity ever known in the journalistic world . But haste ! Let me make some memoranda of this evening scene in the notebook of the society reporter  --  my shirt cuff . Pulls down shirt cuff , and writes on it with pencil . Enter CLOWN and PUNCH , with fencing foils . Clown ( handing fencing foils to REPORTER ) . Would you kindly oblige by acting as second to both of us in our approaching duel ? Reporter ( aside ) . A duel between the Clown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's luck ! Two columns at least . Aloud . With pleasure . Punch ( striding about ) . Oh , cruel fate ! To kill my best friend ! Clown ( skipping after him ) . To run a man through , when you decidedly prefer him without any holes in him ! Oh , remorseless necessity ! Reporter . But only on condition that I am fully informed of the particulars of the quarrel . Punch . Particulars ! The usual particulars  --  wears bonnets and gowns . Clown . Is a widow with a lapdog . Punch . To explain , the matter briefly , sir , let me introduce myself as Colonel Sam Shivertree , a gentleman of leisure , well known the country through . I have been in Congress , still live , and am sometimes believed on oath . This is a young gentleman named Randolph Rex , a member of an aristocratic family residing in Washington Square . We are firm friends , and have postured to-night , as perhaps you may have observed , as leading figures in the popular picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing rapidly on shirt cuff ) . I wish I had another shirt here . These two cuffs will hardly take all my news . Punch . Last Monday Mr. Rex was kind enough to give me his confidence . He is twenty-three years old , and had fallen in love . Reporter . Remarkable novelty , these circumstances . Writes . Punch . Others are to follow . On Tuesday I , who am fifty-six years old , did the same thing . Clown . For a whole week on alternate days we confide to each other the rapture we have experienced in the society of the most fascinating creature that ever acted as tug for a King Charles spaniel  --  Punch . And to-night , for the first time , we recognize the horror of our situation . We , fast friends , have both fallen in love with the same woman . Clown . And her name is Patty  --  Punch . A widow  --  Clown . From the Pacific coast . Punch . A heartless coquette ! She loves me on Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fridays . Sundays are off-days with her  --  so far as we know . Now neither of us is satisfied with half her heart . Each wants all of Patty , or none of Patty . So on guard , rival ! One , two  --  They cross swords savagely . Enter PATTY precipitately . Patty . Three ! Interposes . They cease fighting . Reporter ( writing ) . " The charming cause of contention suddenly appeared upon the scene  --  " Patty . How dare you attack an admirer of mine , Mr. Randolph Rex ? Clown . You defend him against me ! Oh , Patty ! Patty . By what right do you ill-treat this young friend of mine , Colonel Sam Shivertree ? Punch . You are pulverized by the attractions of the youthful Clown ! Oh , Mrs. Perplexity ! But a widow ! Sure Weller was right . Patty . I am very fond of you both . Reporter ( writing ) . " Remarkable peculiarity in a widow  --  fond of two men  --  " Patty . Who are you ? Reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty . A reporter ! I do n't want to be interviewed . I was born on the Pacific coast in the year 1858 , of poor but dishonest parents ; never went to school ; remarked for my beauty at the age of sixteen ; married at eighteen to a wealthy old scoundrel who died two years after , and left me free , with a large fortune . I am young , opulent , and beautiful . I do n't want anything published about me in the newspapers . Reporter . Hum ! so I should fancy . Punch . Such charms , you will agree , are worth fighting for . On guard , rival ! They cross swords . Enter CONFIDENTIAL MAN-SERVANT . C. Man-Servant . Ah , a duel ! Pray are these gentlemen from Ohio ? Patty . Go about your business . C. Man-Servant . I have none . I 'm a New York servant . Patty . A servant ! Then you certainly know your employer 's business . How does he avoid fighting ? C. Man-Servant . He adopts the plan mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come , duellists , run away ! Reporter . Allow me to suggest your doing so first . We men have a few words to say together . Patty ( going ) . I am now residing , Mr. Reporter , in the state drawing rooms of the Martha Washington Grand Hotel , on Cornwallis Avenue , and may be seen without a telescope any day at the dinner-table , attired in a wondrous creation made by Value , the great Parisian man-milliner , which sets off to the fullest degree my remarkable beauty . I am  --  Reporter . I see you are . This way , madam , will lead you to perfect seclusion . Hands her off . Clown . We have now , each of us , a second . Quite the right thing . Rival , on guard ! They cross swords . Punch . Stop ! There 's a pin sticking me in my ruff . I must remove it . They cease fighting . C. Man-Servant . Really , gentlemen , these false starts to your duel are becoming a nuisance . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why fight at all ? I know a neat way to accomplish your aim . Clown and Punch ( together ) . Name the aim ! C. Man-Servant ( drawing a pack of playing-cards from his pocket ) . You see these mystic toys of the goddess Chance ? Reporter ( writing ) . " Mystic toys of the goddess Chance were now drawn from the tail coat pocket of the  --  " C. Man-Servant . You simply  --  very simply indeed  --  draw cards from the pack until one of you draws a heart  --  Clown and Punch ( breathlessly ) . Draws a heart ? C. Man-Servant . And the first man who draws a heart gets Patty . Clown and Punch ( breathlessly ) . And the other ? C. Man-Servant . Gets a pistol . Reporter ( writing ) . " One duellist is loaded with Patty , the other with  --  " C. Man-Servant . The man who gets Patty marries her . That 's his punishment for being a fool . And the one who gets the pistol blows out his brains with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to this plan ? Clown and Punch ( breathlessly ) . We do ! C. Man-Servant ( to REPORTER ) . Then let us join the lady . Reporter . Trusting that the champagne furnished at this beer-garden does not labor under the disadvantage of coming from a firm which Patty , in honor or otherwise , feels herself obliged to boycott . They exeunt leisurely , arm in arm . Punch . Now then , sir ! I place the cards upon the ground , face downward . Draw ! Clown . After you , sir . Youth after age , beauty after homeliness  --  Punch . An ass after a wise man ! I draw . There ! Draws a card . The Ace of Spades ! Clown . That gives you a black eye . Draws . The Queen of Hearts ! Punch . You 've pulled pretty Patty ! Clown . Queen of Tarts ! and Queen of Hearts ! I 'll join them in their carousals . They went this way , I think . Exit , skipping joyfully . Punch . To die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Enter CONFIDENTIAL MAN-SERVANT with a glass of wine . C. Man-Servant . The Burgundy at this beer-garden is not to be despised . I have brought you a glass . After you have disposed of it , I shall come to you again , accompanied by the pistol . Exit . Punch ( sits on chair with glass in his hand ) . Strange how very desirable life now appears to me , even devoid of the attractions of Patty ! Nay , perchance its sweetness would be enhanced by the absence of the widow . I care for the boy , though . What fools we both were ! Laughter and clinking of glasses heard outside . Ah ! they are enjoying themselves vastly . They care little enough for me . Enter CLOWN . Clown . What , singing ! You must feel very gay . Punch . I do . You 've no idea how completely at ease one is concerning all one 's small worldly troubles when one is about to intrust their settlement to that admirable executor , a pistol . Clown . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall relish life with a King Charles spaniel . Punch . And Patty . Clown . And Patty , of course . Very much of course . Very much of Patty . Enter PATTY . Patty . Oh , my beloved affianced ! Embraces CLOWN vigorously . Clown . Do n't press me too hard ; I 'm afraid you 'll bend me . I 'm far from firm , I assure you . Weeps . Patty . I have forgotten to mention to you that after we are married I intend residing in Arizona . Clown . Do you ? How long ? Patty . As long as the Indians will permit . Come , future husband . Lead Carlo by his string . Clown . While you lead me by mine . She drags CLOWN off , and he drags the dog off . Exeunt . Punch . Patty ? Or the pistol ? ' T is Hobson 's choice for unpleasantness . I see that now . Enter CONFIDENTIAL MAN-SERVANT , with pistol . C. Man-Servant . Excuse my keeping you waiting for the pistol . Punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here it is . A clumsy affair , but a sure one . Belongs to the brewer . He keeps it to shoot his disabled old horses , and put them out of their misery . I 've oiled it well . Punch . You are infernally obliging , I must say . C. Man-Servant . Do n't mention it . There are the balls , caps , powder . Gives them . And so good-by to you . Shakes hands , and retires out of sight . Punch ( charges the pistol with powder and cap ) . I do n't mind losing the widow , certainly ; but why did n't I think of that before I won the pistol ? Plays with balls . To think that these tough pills are to be the final dose for Colonel Sam Shivertree ! Um ! one last cigarette under the trees yonder . I 'll leave the pistol here . The balls will be safe in my pocket . Leaves pistol on table : puts balls in his pocket . Exit leisurely . CONFIDENTIAL MAN-SERVANT descens stage . C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in long cloak . Reporter . Is the deed done ? C. Man-Servant . He will shoot himself anon . Reporter . Do n't let him fail . Think of our bargain . Halves in all our newspaper sensations . There 's the Treasury in it ! Exit . C. Man-Servant . If he wo n't shoot himself , I must find some one who will . Enter PATTY , wildly . Patty . Have you seen him ? C. Man-Servant . No . Patty . Where 's the Reporter ? This makes me the most celebrated woman in America . Two gentlemen fight a duel for my hand . One shoots me , the other marries himself . No , reversely . No matter , you know what I mean . If you see the Reporter send him to me . Exit . C. Man-Servant . We are sure of an item about her . But the pistol must not miss fire . Picks it up from table . Enter CLOWN , who snatches it from him . Clown . Give it to me ! My resolve is fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rushes off with pistol . C. Man-Servant . Any way you like , so there 's a man shot . Enter PUNCH . Punch . I 've finished the cigarette . Now for another sort of fire . Looks for pistol . Gone ! Pistol-shot heard outside . What 's that ? C. Man-Servant . Only this : the friend you wanted to kill in a duel has shot himself . Punch ( weeps ) . Ah me , how can I endure life without the friend I wanted to kill in a duel ! Loud sneezing heard without . C. Man-Servant . Sneezing after shooting one 's self with a pistol ! Punch . Peculiar , but not inexplicable . The powder acted like snuff . The pistol was not loaded . I have the balls in my pocket . Shows them . Enter CLOWN , followed by PATTY and REPORTER . Clown . I am tired of shooting myself . One can have too much of a good thing Good-by , pistol . Throws it on ground . C. Man-Servant ( picking up pistol , and giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he do n't kill himself , you must kill yourself . Clown ( snatching pistol from him ) . Vampire ! Have n't enough people been shot here in the last half-hour ? Reporter . The worst of it is that nobody is dead . Patty . I do n't care whether they are dead or alive . I am now the most celebrated woman in America . I consent to be interviewed . This way , Mr. Reporter , and I will give you my whole history . To begin at the beginning , I was born when I was a mere infant  --  She takes the arm of the REPORTER , and talks to him until they are out of sight , he listening . CLOWN and PUNCH execute gymnastics of delight , and embrace each other . Clown . Colonel , my old friend ! Punch . Randy , my boy ! Clown . No more Patty ! Punch . No more pistol ! C. Man-Servant . And no more Reporter !               @ @ @ @ @ @
