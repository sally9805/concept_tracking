THOSE who manage affairs in our present system of ruling the country through national political conventions , first usurp all the constitutional powers intended to be conferred on the electors chesen under State laws , and make of these high offices the most abject slaves to party edicts , and then they formulate and declare in " party platforms " the policies of the government and the laws that should be enacted to execute their will . It is the alleged representative character of these conventions that gives to their action such undisputed control of the public administration , reaching down through all grades of office and governmental employment and including every place of public ti*ust , both in National and State governments . But for the representative character of these conventions , the people could never be induced to permit their decrees to stand as a substitute for all freedom of thought and action , as they , in fact , do , or to dictate absolutely to the electors the persons they shall choose for President and Vice-President . These omnipotent bodies of party managers always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a rule , omit nothing that is believed to be needed to catch votes ; and include nothing , however necessary and proper , that may lose votes to the particular party they control . The bidding for votes in party platforms , either by direct offers of pledges to sustain the interests of powerful classes of men , or of men whose wealth gives them an unjust and injurious influence in elections , is so common that it has almost ceased even to excite comment . That these tendencies towards the surrender into the control of professional politicians of the powers of the great body of the people in free self-government are dangerous , needs no other proof than our very sad experience , and only the arguments that every man 's observation addresses to his sober judgment . // Those whose footing has been sure enough to stand firm , even for an honr , in this sweeping tide of political movement that rushes towards a fatal gulf , must feel grateful to Mr. Cleveland for his resolute determination to lay before the American people the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital concern , and to plant the success , or failure , of his administration upon the ground that the people should not be compelled to longer suffer from excessive and unjust taxation . In his effort to relieve the people from these unnecessary burdens , he had no assurance that he would call to his support any powerful and aggressive body of men , united in compact organization even for self protection . He well knew that he would antagonize the most powerful and the best organized bodies of men that have ever grown up in this or any other country , who are united in a common purpose to employ the taxing power of the United States Government to make money for themselves . He knew that , as a rule , the owners of the industries and properties that have so long been drawing wealth from the taxes imposed upon our whole population , would consent to their own unjust taxation rather than break the phalanx that stood guard , on every side , to protect the gains derived from the general policy that they call " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches to one man at the expense of ten other men . Mr. Cleveland knew the power of these alliances , often concentred in a common movement by positive agreement and in complete organization , and he did uot undervalue their strength . On the other hand , he had no safe reliance for saccess in relieving the people of the burdens yoked upon their necks by the power and unremitting diligence of this organized aggression , except the sense of justice and love of the right and of fair play by the individual men , unorganized and without a common fund at their command , who would agree that unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation , and would attempt , by their votes , to purge ourtax laws of their gross injustice , selfish discriminations , and to keep in the pockets of the people who earned the money by their labor the vast sums that this tax locks up in the treasury . Candor will not refuse to admit that the convictions are sincere that led a man with so much power to influence political results in his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOL CXLVIL-*O. 383. 29 // powerful combination that was so eager for his support , and to turn to the unorganized sufferers and ask them to help him to correct the evils they were suffering , and to avoid the financial congestion that the money abstracted from their various employments was threatening to create in the country . It is not giving to Mr. Cleveland credit for any extraordinary ability , to commend him for having seen these wrongs and dangers . They are seen and known of all men . But , seeing them , he had the honesty and the courage to meet these evils face to face ; to confront those who produced them and maintain them with facts , arguments , and appeals to their sense of justice , their love of country , and their humanity towards the toilers , whose labor pays , at last , every dollar of the taxes and every dollar of interest on money , or credit , in this country and the world over . There can be no doubt of the moral strength and sincere motive of his attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any political national convention to declare for him the principles or line of conduct that he thought it his duty to recommend . lie made his declarations and arguments in his message to the Fiftieth Congress . He staked his political life on the justice of the cause he espoused . No man could do more in proof of his sincerity . It is said , thoughtlessly , that he made the platform for his party in favor of lower taxation of the people . This error is an injustice to the Democratic party . Since 1868 that party has never failed to demand a reduction of tariff taxation . If he had written his message as Mr. Arthur did , when he urged that the war taxes should be largely reduced under the inspiration of the Republican platforms during the same period , he would only have stated , in better form , the same facts and the same conclusions that he has so clearly stated and has so powerfully supported with argument . If the Mills bill is the direct and legitimate fruit of the message of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been quite as easily traced to any of the Republican platforms since 1868 , except the last one adopted at Chicago , but for the improbability of finding an eagle 's egg in a rook 's nest . The merit of Mr. Cleveland 's effort to reduce taxation and to prevent the heaping up of surplus money in the treasury is , that he implored Congress to take action in December , and did not wait for a national convention to meet in June , to intimate a // pledge that , if he should be chosen for a second term , he would then recommend to Congress , in some way , to make some reduction of the tariff taxes . The difference is in a bold and honest leadership which seeks the post of responsibility and danger at the head of the column , and in following in the rear with the wagon train and the sutlers , until the battle is won by others , and the spoils are to be divided . General Harrison found Mr. Cleveland and his supporters in the advance and moving directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost exclusively , to an attack upon him in reference to his views on excessive taxation and the heaping up of surplus revenues in the treasury . Besides this assault upon Mr. Cleveland and the Democracy , there is little else in General Harrison 's letter , except some assurances that , while he was in the Senate , he gave votes that approved the declarations in the Republican platform on the subject of contract labor and civil service reform . On these points it was well for Mr. Harrison to be specific , since his silence might have identified him in sympathy with his party when , in 1868 , it offered rewards to those who imported contract labor into the United States . If elected President , he might do as well in gathering good fruit from the matured tree of civil service reform as Mr. Cleveland has done in his efforts to gather fruit , while planting and nurturing the tree . But , if General Harrison 's partisanship is as intense while President as it has always been , it will be a painful experience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the Chinese question he makes a pledge which causes him to recant his votes in the Senate . He deserves credit for thus yielding to the force of conviction so strongly expressed by the people , and to the concurrent opinion of the Chinese Empire , solemnly expressed , that it is impossible to accept the lower classes of Chinese as an agreeable or safe element in any American community , or one to which our industrial classes can be justly reconciled as competitors in their work . Since the date of the Burlingame treaty the Democratic party has constantly set its face against Chinese immigration to the United States . This has been a distinctive policy of that party , supported by Thurman , Bayard , Beck , and others , on grounds of national and social necessity , and has lately resulted in a treaty that has made the nearest // approach possible to the restoration to the United States of the legislative right , taken away by the Burlingame treaty , to regulate in our own way the coming of additional masses of Asiatic people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale against our return to the former level of our just powers , and Mr. Cleveland threw his weight into the other scale . We are greatly indebted to him for the preponderance that is about to restore to the United States its sovereign authority over this dangerous subject , and because he has been able , through vigorous diplomacy , amicably conducted , to place this question upon ground that wins the approval of General Harrison , and causes him to pledge himself to abandon his former opinions expressed in his votes in the Senate . General Harrison makes cautious allusion to our troubles with Canada , and intimates the belief that he could negotiate a treaty with Great Britain that would secure to our people much larger and more satisfactory privileges in Canadian ports , and in the fishing waters , than we have yet enjoyed . There is nothing in his record , or in that of his party , to *varrant so flattering a belief . Mr. Fish , in 1871 , as Secretary of State , and as negotiator , distinctly admitted that Great Britain still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1818 , as to the bays and harbors within the limits of our renunciation of the right to take fish . He could not settle the question , and , for a makeshift , resorted to the plan of paying Canada for all the fish we should catch inside those limits . He also gave Canada the right to bring fish into the United States , whether fresh or cured , free of duty . Mr. Fish and General Grant were both strong men , and where they failed it is almost hopeless to expect that General Harrison would easily succeed . The Republican party put fresh fish , for immediate consumption , on the free list , both by treaty and act of Congress ; and ten years later , in the act of 1883 , they deliberately continued this arrangement by act of Congress . Naturally Great Britain ought to desire the restoration of that party to power , so that when this subject again comes up they can have the advantage of the precedent set by that party in giving to Canadians a release from the duties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession a serious embarrassment to his diplomatic success . We have yielded that powerful leverage without any compensation , and the Republicans will be harassed to find a good excuse for recalling this free gift to Canada . his evident disposition to open new negotiations with Great Britain on the fisheries controversy would be very encouraging to our hopes of continued peace with Canada , were it not for the wet blanket in which these budding hopes were enveloped in the recent action of the Republicans in the Senate , where they solidly followed the dictates of a party caucus , and declared , in harmony with the assertion of the Committee of Foreign Relations , that this " is not a fit subject for negotiation , " and that the time for negotiation has passed . Unless there is a total revulsion of feeling and change of attitude on the part of the Republican Senators , General Harrison would be compelled to lean upon the Democrats of the Senate to support any further overtures to Great Britain to treat about the fisheries . These and other questions that are alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have included the payment of fifty million dollars a year to the sinking fund as creating an unnecessary demand for taxation , so as to give a pretext for leeching the people out of many millions more to enrich those who , claiming to be poor and patriotic , really " sit at the receipt of customs . " It would have been gratifying if General harrison had explained the necessity for a tax of fifty million dollars a year to maintain our national credit , while we are paying one hundred and twenty-eight dollars for each hundred dollars of the face value of our bonds , in order to keep money in circulation . But this is a part of his plan for the encouragement and " protection of American industry , " to create an unnecessary demand for fifty million dollars of annual taxation in order to increase the value of our bonds to twenty-eight per cent . above par , and to compel us to buy them in at that figure , or else to see the circulation of money obstructed by its being locked up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is on the subject of tariff taxation that General Harrison makes his main assault on Mr. Cleveland and the people who are interested in that phase of constitutional " protection " which // gives to every man the right to just and equal laws , and the impartial administration of laws that create and distribute the burdens of taxation . If the constitution justifies tax laws to protect selected industries at the expense of all others , it equally requires that equal protection shall be given alike to the manufacturer and the consumer of his goods . Protection to " American labor " ought to include protection to all descriptions of labor , and even those unfortunates who can not labor , but must live . The benignity of the laws should never fail to bless the poor and helpless . General Harrison 's horoscope seems to include only those who labor to keep large masses of accumulated capital , and the adventurous energy of speculative credit employed in manufactures . He fails to regard those who furnish their own little capital in their solitary struggles to win bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mines and the fisheries . It is a sad defect in the reach and sweep of his political vision that it passes over these lower levels of " American labor , " and only touches the high promontory points where aggregated and incorporated capital has reared its vast and splendid workshops , and assembled its labor-saving machinery . While Mr. Cleveland is delving with the unprotected masses to shelter them against injustice and oppression , General Harri*n reproaches him with being indifferent to American labor , because he prefers to do what he can for the unprotected classes of such laborers , to help them in their hard trials to earn a living , and then to give to the protected classes all that can be justly given them in compensation for their contributions to the general welfare of the country . In sheltering the unprotected bread-winners , Mr. Cleveland has not thought it best to repeal the tax on whisky . This deadiy luxury has so little of the protective sympathy of General Harrison that he congratulates the Chicago convention on having set its face in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his concurrence in that part of the platform which pledges the Republican party to free whisky , rather than to give up any part of the protective duties on any taxed article of import . He insists that such a policy would be better deferred to a future time . In this , as in other matters , General Harrison has availed himself of a liberal margin for oscillation , // allowed him in the vague committals of the Chicago platform , to evince his higher confidence in his own judgment and experience in the affairs of state , and to shape his course to his own liking . He seems even to dissent from the views of Mr. Blame as to the harmlessness of " trusts , " and to venture opinions in hostility to such conspiracies . There is an attractive air of sincerity in the boldness with which he takes ground on the tariff question . The Republican party has a history of public pledges , made in the most solemn form , which commits it , as far as resolves can bind men in the performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shall not exceed the aggregate of the sum needed for the support of the government . Quotations from these pledges are not needed to make them conspicuous or to inform the country of their terms . They have been reiterated in every convention , and insisted upon by every Republican President in messages to Congress since General Grant 's second term . But all this signifies nothing in the view that General Harrison takes of this subject . lie has decided , for his party , that during his administration of the Executive Office he will not , if he can prevent it , permit the first step to be taken in the direction of a reduction of excessive taxation , if that step in any wise reduces the profits derived from the protective features of the tariff . It is the step in that direction that he declares to be unwise and fatal to American interests . As there can be no reduction of taxes on any article that competes with a like commodity manufactured abroad , without reducing the profits that are the result of protection , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of tariff taxation that he can prevent , except upon articles that are not produced in the United States . He declaims against maxims and demands that facts shall control in our policies ; but where facts and maxims unite to destroy a theory of taxation that he so boldly demands for our country , it would be better if he should deVer to the experience of the country , which has been so often and so powerfully stated in the Republican national platforms . The fact is that every article not of absolute necessity imported into the country should bear some of the burden of taxation , if we would have every class of people // bear some part of the necessary expenses of government . This is not a maxim . But it is a maxim , and one worthy of close attention , that the burdens of government should fall lightest upon those who are least able to bear them ; and , also , that it must be an urgent necessity of government that will justify a tax on articles that are necessary for the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel , and shelter . In reference to the simplest elements that support human existence , the law of necessity is stronger than any legislative enactment in its appeal to the instinct of self-preservation , and in its obligation upon the consciences of lawmakers . To tax these elementary fruits of the Divine Creator 's benevolence to mankind , so as to increase the cost of them to every human being ( as is the case in every such tax ) , whether they are or are not in competition with like articles imported from other countries , is an extremity of hardship that our lawmakers should never resort to , unless the support of government makes it unavoidably necessary . Our system of taxation , as it is now declared on our statute book and enforced in our custom houses , does tax very severely many of the articles that are indispensable to human existence , such as salt , wood , lumber , coal , sugar and fuel . These articles of necessity are cited to illustrate the point at which General Harrison 's vow to maintain the protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes the common necessities of the human family , and the crushing weight of the blow that will fall , if he is ever President , upon those least able to bear it . These articles are all produced in the United States , and the tax on them must raise the cost to the consumer above the price that the people of other countries pay for them . To reduce the tax on them must make them cheaper . But General Harrison says that this boon to human life must be denied , because to grant it would be to take a step in the direction of reducing the profits of the protected industry , lie argues , as all theorists do who resort to maxims when facts fail them , that the incidental advantage to other industries arising from the stimulus given to the market for the article increased in price by such a tax , compensates the consumer for his loss in that increase of price . If an argument so entirely theoretical has any place in a wise political economy , that place is not found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coal and wood . Without such articles it would overtax // the skill and energy of mankind to obtain the means for the barest subsistence , and to protect life against the exposure to the cold of the winter . If the cost of such articles is placed beyond the means of any human being , by a tax imposed by law , that tax is an inhumanity as to that person . A life frozen out of a human body by a tax on coal that deprives a human being of its use , is not atoned for by the protection that is given *o the owner of a coal mine by that tax . The sufferings of infancy , of the sick , of the aged people for the want of the delicate nutrition of sugar ; those of the brave , houseless pioneers on the storm-beaten plains of Dakota for the want of lumber and wood ; the exposure of the poor in their daily toil for subsistence to the cruelties of the winter winds for the want of comfortable woolen wear , all invite humane legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the common necessaries of life that General Harrison declares he will never permit us to take if he is elected to the Presidency . If the speculation upon the wants and fancies of mankind , that is the life of the so-called protective system , is a thing to be promoted and encouraged by tax laws , it does not follow that this speculation can be safely nurtured at the udders from which human life must , of necessity , draw its support and appropriate its most nutritious draughts . There is a line that General Harrison refuses to see , which separates between the stimulus by heavy taxation and consequent increase of price of articles designed for the gratifying of the tastes , fancies and pleasures of mankind , and gives greater profits to the manufacturer , and a like increase of price , by heavy taxation , on the products of an industry that works for the support of human beings in every phase and shape in which God has breathed into them the breath of life . Whether that life is refined , rich , and luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stinted with poverty and exposed in shameless nakedness , every human life is entitled , where no imperious necessity otherwise requires , to actual support by means that are free from taxation . General Harrison has taken his stand upon ground that is outside the limits of sympathy for the real laborers and real sufferers of the country , when he declares his abhorrence of any step that may be taken to lessen taxation upon articles that are necessary // to the existence even of human life , comfort , health , and shelter , if such reduction gives up any of the so-called " protection " to any domestic industry . He stands within the limits of that coterie which claims , to the last cent , all the profits that capital can gather from the existing tax laws , and adheres with unyielding tenacity to a system which employs our tax laws as a means of extorting money from all classes of our people to enrich a selected class . He has declared his purpose to interpose his shield as a covering to the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy all the profits of the present tariff laws which can be gathered under the name of " protection . " The entrenched camp of the friends of monopoly , trusts and excessive taxation to raise excessive revenues to be squandered by Congress , may , for a time , withstand the pressure of the great body of the people . but there cau be no relaxation of effort , because the purpose is to secure justice for those who are wronged and oppressed . Such objects have never failed of ultimate success in the United States . When the taxing power is used only for public and governmental purposes , and not as the legislative means of securing exclusive privileges to speculators in human labor , a contented people will gladly pay the expenses of their government on a scale that is commensurate with the dignity of the country and corresponding with its splendid progress .
