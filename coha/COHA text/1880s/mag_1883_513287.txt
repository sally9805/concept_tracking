MARYLAND AND THE FAR SOUTH IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD . qwq was elected by the people , and the royal assent was supposed to be requisite to the validity of any laws passed by the popular assembly . Massachusetts , on the other hand , until its charter was abrogated by Charles II. , in 1684 , was an example of a Charter government : the governor and council , as well as the assembly , were chosen by the people , and the assembly could pass any laws it liked , provided they did not contravene the laws of England or any of the specific provisions of the charter . The advantage in theory of the charter government was that it prescribed the relations between the crown and the colony , and so protected its independence ; though in point of fact none of the Stuart family ever considered themselves either legally or morally bound by any contract whatever to which they had put their names . In the Proprietary governments , of which Maryland was the first example , there was a charter which adjusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no specific provisions concerning the relations between the proprietor and the settlers . The charter , indeed , was careful to guarantee that the colonists should not be deprived of the rights and immunities which were the inheritance of every Englishman , so that the settlers of Maryland could hardly have been legally governed by Lord Baltimore as an absolute monarch . As it was , his position was almost precisely that of a constitutional king , though in accordance with the ideas of the Stuart period rather than with those that have prevailed since 1688 . The charter was drawn up in imitation of that of the county palatine of Durham , the purpose being to create a barony in which the lord proprietary should exercise semi-regal prerogatives . In token of allegiance and homage he was to send two Indian arrows to the king each year ; and whenever it might seem necessary the oath of allegiance to the king might be administered to any of the inhabitants of the colony . But , saving this formal recognition of his overlord , the lord proprietary was virtually king in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass any law which did not come into conflict with the laws of England ; and in case the assembly could not conveniently be brought together in an emergency , he could legislate by himself . His office was strictly hereditary , although in some instances the actual work of administration was deputed to a governor . He could grant titles , he could create courts and appoint the judges , and pardon criminals ; and it was , moreover , expressly stipulated that no taxes could be either assessed or levied within the limits of the colony by the English government . In outward appearance , therefore , Maryland was a semi-independent constitutional monarchy , as Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island were semi-independent republics , and as Virginia was a dependent plantation or province . But in reality , it hardly need be added , there wa* about as much practical independence in one colony as in another , and the spirit of English liberty animated all alike . Among the express provisions of the charter there was nothing that looked toward universal toleration . The Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presentation to livings , as well as the right of building and consecrating churches and chapels , was to be vested in the lord proprietary . Yet , in spite of these provisions of the charter , Lord Baltimore 's policy was one of universal toleration , and to some extent he succeeded in carrying out that policy . This was due to a remarkable combination of circumstances . Lord Baltimore was . himself a Roman Catholic , and so were his principal followers  --  a fact which in granting the charter the king conveniently ignored . But the great majority of the early settlers were Protestants , and this made it necessary for each party to tolerate the other . In view of the almost regal powers wielded by Lord Baltimore , it was not easy for the Protestant settlers to oppress the Catholics ; while on the other hand , if the Catholic settlers had been allowed to annoy the Protestants , it would forthwith have raised such a storm in England as would have overwhelmed the lord proprietary and blasted his enterprise* . Besides this , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished for worldly wisdom and for a moderate and conciliatory temper . The policy of toleration , which was thua made compulsory upon both ruler and people , soon began to draw men of all creeds to Maryland , and the colony grew rapidly in population and wealth . Puritans , in particular , came in considerable numbers , but as the strength of the Puritan party grew in England , the Puritan colonists began to think that the time had come when , instead of accepting toleration // at the hands of Roman Catholics , they might safely attempt to oust the latter from their pre-eminent position in the colony . This was natural enough , since neither Puritan nor Episcopalian nor Catholic had any clear comprehension of the principles of religious liberty , and to the Puritan especially the living in amity with Catholics must have seemed very much like keeping on terms of polite familiarity with the devil . In 1645 , while the great rebellion was at its height in England , trouble broke out in Lord Baltimore 's feudal domain . The lord proprietary himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , when the king ordered him to seize any Parliament ships that might be tarrying in Maryland waters . It was of course necessary to forward the royal order to America , and the deputy-governor , by way of obeying it , there being apparently no ships at hand commissioned by Parliament , seized forthwith the ship of one Richard Ingle , who was known to be a Puritan , and supposed to be a pirate . This incident caused some excitement , and afforded an opportunity for William Clayborne , a Virginian , who laid claim to the proprietorship of Kent Island , and had felt himself aggrieved by the settlement of Maryland , to invade the colony with an armed force . In the name of the Parliament , Clayborne and Ingle succeeded in overturning the government for a while . But Virginia , which had no fondness for Ronudheads , willingly sent a force to aid in expelling these agitators , and so the government was re - established . After the overthrow of Charles I. , the shrewd Lord Baltimore appointed William Stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony ; and in 1649 Stone 's first assembly passed the famous Toleration Act , by which the Catholics were guaranteed against persecution . But in the following year , as the Cavaliers began to come over in increasing numbers to Virginia , so many Puritans went from Virginia into Maryland as to make their party allpowerful in the younger colony ; and they began at once to undermine the proprietary government and to molest the Catholics . A period of dire confusion ensued , in the course of which a battle was fought at Providence , not far from the site of Annapolis , and victory perched on the banners of the Puritans . After seven years of dissension , however , Baltimore carried his point , toleration was restored , and during most of the reign of Charles II . the career of the colony was peaceful . But the quarrel was taken up again on the occasion of the popish plot in England , and so matters went on until the accession of William and Mary , when the new laws enacted by Parliament against Catholics destroyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government suddenly fell to the ground . All writs now ran in the king 's name instead of Lord Baltimore 's , taxes were levied for the support of the Church of England , the further immigration of Catholics was prohibited under heavy penalties , and the public celebration of the mass was strictly forbidden within the limits of the colony . These measures , of course , served only to increase the general discontent . Taxation for the support of a church of which only a small part of the population were members was as unpopular with the Puritans as with the Catholics . In their zealous efforts to overthrow the proprietary government the Puritans had not bargained for this ; and now the hatred of both parties was directed toward the royal government , and for the first time the connection with England itself began to be regarded as oppressive . At last in 1714 the fourth Lord Baltimore abjured the Catholic faith , and his proprietary rights were revived . He died in the following year , and was succeeded by his infant son Charles , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Frederick , the sixth and last Lord Baltimore ; and the old proprietary government , thus firmly re-established , endured down to the time of the Revolution . This long-continued administration of the affairs of a commonwealth by six generations of hereditary rulers is something as unique in American history as the attempt to secure universal toleration for Catholics and Protestants was unique in the history of the seventeenth century . And it is to these two features that the colonial history of Maryland owes its chief interest . The social condition of the colony affords also an attractive subject of study , both in the points in which it resembled Virginia and in those in which it differed from the older commonwealth . As in the case of Virginia , the first settlers of Maryland were almost exclusively English . At a later period considerable numbers of Germans from Pennsylvania // settled in the western districts of both these colonies , and this non-English infu*sion seems to have been larger in Maryland than in Virginia . After the town of Baltimore had risen to importance as a sea-port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this foreign admixture was , on the whole , very slight in its amount and in its effects . The English colonists were of the same high class as those who had settled in Virginia . For a long time the colony served as a refuge for Catholic gentlemen escaping from the persecution to which they were subjected in England . Besides these , the principal element in the population consisted of Puritans who were driven from Virginia as the latter colony fell more and more under the control of the Stuart party . Here we find at once an element of sympathy between Maryland and New England which did not exist in the case of the older colony , and which was enough to prevent the ideas of* the Maryland people from running completely in accordance with those of the Southern people in general . Yet at first the economic circumstances of Maryland were precisely the same as those which determined the character of society in the southern colonies . Tobacco played as important a part as in Virginia . The land was parcelled out in vast estates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly introduced in great numbers , but they never came , as they did in Virginia , to outnumber the white people . At the beginning of the Revolution the population of the colonywas about 250,000 , of whom less than 100,000 were negroes . As in Virginia , the slaves had no legal rights , but were in general mildly treated . Convicted felons and kidnapped pauper children were brought from the mother country to Maryland , and bound to service for a term of years ; and they made the beginnings of a pariah class of " mean whites , " exactly as they did in the southem colonies . For a long time the exclusive cultivation of tobacco prevented the growth of towns , and the life of the people was as isolated as in Virginia . The roads were few and bad , and travel , whether for business or for pleasure , was mostly confined to the rivers . Crime was more frequent than in any of the northern colonies . Education was at a low ebb , for although public schools were established in 1728 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of England , and being thus deprived of popular sympathy and support , they made but little headway . There was no university and no literary activity , and there were but few private libraries , and no newspapers until 1745 . So far there seems to have been but little to distinguish the state of society in Maryland from that in Virginia . But before the Revolution , under the influence , perhaps , of the example of Pennsylvania , a remarkable change had set in . A succession of bad tobacco crops , due to the exhaustion of the soil which is wont to attend the overcultivation of that staple , led many of the great planters to turn their attention to the raising of wheat . This was the beginning of very important changes in the social structure of the colony . The wheat crop soon became so considerable that wheat and flour began to be exported in great quantities ; and through this export trade the town of Baltimore , which had been founded in 1729 , grew so fast that by the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , with a population of nearly 20,000 . And having once got such a start , Baltimore not only served as the great sea-port of Maryland , but was enabled to compete with Philadelphia as an outlet for the foreign trade of Pennsylvania . The growth of Annapolis was also stimulated by these circumstances ; and this rapid development of town life , with the introduction of a wealthy and powerful class of merchants , went far toward assimilating Maryland with the middle and northern colonies , and diminishing its points of contact with the society of the South . Some thirty years after the settlement of Maryland , the territory of Virginia was again curtailed-this time to the southward-and an attempt was made to found a colony which should be oligarchical in its constitution . In order to provide for some of his loyal friends whose property had suffered in the great rebellion , Charles II . in 1663 made a grant of the land between Virginia and Florida to the Duke of Albemarle , the Earls of Shaftesbury and Clarendon , and five other noblemen , to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown . This was creating a proprietary form of government somewhat similar to that of Maryland , save that , instead of the semi-royal lord proprietary , an oligarchy of noblemen was to stand at the head of // the administration . The country was already known as Carolina . A century before , in 1562 , the great Huguenot leader , Jean Ribault , had founded a short-lived and ill-fated colony at Port Royal , and had named the country Carolina in honor of the wretched Charles IX. , a king deserving little respect from any one , least of all from Huguenots . So far as paying compliments to an unworthy king goes , the name served the purposes of the English colonists equally well , and it was retained . At the request of the oligarchy of noblemen , a very elaborate constitution was drawn up for the colony by no less a person than the great philosopher Locke . " The country was to be minutely and exactly divided into counties , which were to be subdivided into seignories , baronies , and precincts . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportioned to those of the settlers . The eldest of the proprietors was to be called the Palatine , and was to be the supreme officer . Each of the proprietors was to hold a court in his own barony , with six councillors and twelve deputies . There was to be a parliament , meeting once in two years , " * and consisting of the proprietors and the noblemen , corresponding to the House of Lords , and the representatives elected by the freehol ders corresponding to the House of Commons . Having provided this elaborate constitution , the next thing in order was to find colonists ; and settlers were attracted by the liberal offer of a hundred acres of land for every man , and a hundred more for every one of his children . In this way the country was rapidly settled , and the local governments at first instituted soon grew into two flourishing colonies ; but the aristocratic constitution prepared by Locke was never anything more than a dead-letter . The proprietary form of government was very unpopular from the beginning , and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct control of the crown . The lords proprietary sold out all their rights , and royal governments were instituted , like those in most of the other colonies , with governor and council appointed by the king , and an assembly elected by the people . The careers of the two southern colonies thus founded were very different , and * Doyle , Hist . United States , 171. between their respective social characteristics the contrasts were so great that it is impossible to make general statements applicable alike to the two . In one respect . the contrast was different from that which we have observed in comparing Virginia with New England . In New England we have observed a marked concentration of social life in towns and villages co-existing with extreme democracy , while in Virginia we have observed the isolated life upon great plantations as connected with an aristocratic structure of society . But between the two Carolinas the contrast is just the reverse of this . Of all the southern colonies , North Carolina was . the one in which society was the most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also the one in which the general aspect of society was the least aristocratic . On the other hand , in South Carolina there was a peculiarly strong concentration of social life into a single focus in Charleston ; and in connection with this we find a type of society even more essentially and more intensely aristocratic than in Virginia . We shall find it worth our while to dwell for a moment upon some of the immediate causes of these differences . The history of North America affords an interesting illustration of the way in which the character of a community may be determined for good or ill by geographical circumstances . But for the peculiar physical conformation of its coast , North Carolina , rather than Virginia , would doubtless have been the first great American state . It was upon Roanoke Island that Raleigh founded his short-lived colony , under the lead of Amidas and Barlow ; and it was upon the soil of North Carolina that Virginia Dare , the first child born in America of English parents , was born , in August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jamestown . But this little colony was unable to support itself , and for three-quarters of a century afterward the attempts that were made to settle the country were for the most part miserable failures . The country did not lend itself to the wants of primitive agricultural colonizers , as did Virginia . Instead of the broad rivers and magnificent harbors of Virginia , there was here a dead line of coast hemmed in by long sand-banks , and offering no safe or convenient harborage . Huge pine-barrens near the coast hindered the first ef // forts of the planter , and extensive malarial swamps made it unsafe for him to stay there . Farther inland the soil grew richer , until on the slope of the Alleghanies the country was as fine as could be found anywhere in America . The excellent John Lawson , who was surveyor-general of the colony early in the eighteenth century , describes it with enthusiasm as " a delicious country , being placed in that girdle of the world which affords wine , oil , fruit , grain , and silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate climate , and fertile soil . These are the blessings , under Heaven 's protection , that spin out the thread of life to its utmost extent , and crown our days with the sweets of health and plenty , which , when joined with content , render the possessors the happiest race of men upon earth . " The good Lawson , who was inclined to see things in rose-color , praised even the gentleness of the Indians , who returned the compliment by roasting him alive for the crime of surveying their lands . But , with all this beauty and richness of the interior country , the obstacles presented at the coast turned the first great wave of English colonization into Virginia ; and thereafter the settlement of North Carolina was determined largely , and by no means to its advantage , by the social conditions of the older colony . At the time of the Revolution the population of North Carolina numbered about 200,000 , of which somewhat more than one-fourth were negro slaves . The white population was mainly English , but the foreign element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other colonies which we have thus far considered . There were Huguenots from France , German Protestants from the Palatinate , Moravians , Swiss , and Scotch , and what we have to note especially is that this foreign population was in the main far more respectable and orderly than the English majority . The English settlers came mostly from Virginia , though in the southeastern corner of the colony there was a considerable settlement of Englishmen from the Barbadoes . Now the English settlers who thus came southward from Virginia were very different in character from the sober Puritans who went northward into Maryland . North Carolina was to Virginia something like what Rhode Island was to Massachusetts  --  a receptacle for all the factious and turbulent elements of society ; but in this case the general character of the emigration was immeasurably lower . The shiftless people who could not make a place for themselves in Virginian society , including many of the " poor whites , " flocked in large numbers into North Carolina . They were in the main very lawless in temper , holding it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , and above all things to pay no taxes . The history of North Carolina was accordingly much more riotous and disorderly than the history of any of the other colonies . There were neither laws nor lawyers , says Bancroft , with but slight exaggeration . The courts , such as they were , sat often in taverns , where the judge might sharpen his wits with bad whiskey , while their decisions were not recorded , but were simply shouted by the crier from the inn door or at the nearest market-place . There were a few amateur surgeons and apothecaries to be found in the villages , but no regular physicians anywhere . Nor does the soul appear to have been better cared for than the body , for it was not until 1703 that the first clergyman was settled in the colony . The Church of England was established by government , without the approval of the people , who were opposed on principle to church-rates as to all kinds of taxes whatsoever . Owing to this dislike of taxation , most of the people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was complete toleration , even of Quakers , because nobody cared a groat for theology or for religion . The few ministers who contrived to support life in North Carolina were listened to in a mood like that in which Mrs. Pardiggle 's discourses were received by the brickmakers , while the audience freely smoked their pipes within the walls of the sanctuary during divine service . The industries in which these people were engaged were more numerous and diversified than the industries of Virginia , but they were all purely agricultural . There were no manufactures . The simplest and commonest articles of daily use were imported from the northern colonies or from England . Agriculture was conducted more wastefully and with less intelligence than in any of the other colonies . In the northern counties tobacco was almost exclusively cultivated , but it was of very inferior quality compared with the tobacco of Virginia . In the southern part of the colony the principal crops were // rice , indigo , and cotton . A great deal of excellent timber was cut ; for the yellow pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its hardness and durability . Tar and turpentine were also produced in large quantities . All this furnished the basis for a flourishing foreign commerce ; but the people did not take kindly to the sea , and the carrying trade was entirely monopolized by New - Englanders . The fisheries , which were of considerable value , were altogether neglected . All business or traffic about the coast was carried on under perilous conditions ; for pirates were always hovering about , secure in the sympathy of the people , like the brigands of southern Italy in recent times . It was partly due to this , no doubt , as well as partly to the want of good harborage , that a very large part of the commerce of North Carolina was diverted northward to Norfolk or southward to Charleston . Under such conditions as these anything like town life was impossible . In 1776 Wilmington and Newbern were villages of five or six hundred inhabitants each . Not only were there no towns , but there were very few large plantations with lordly manor-houses like those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with its primeval forest , in which thousands of hogs , branded with their owners* marks , wandered and rooted , until the time came for hunting them out and slaughtering them . Where rude clearings had been made in the wilderness there were small ill-kept farms . Almost all the people were small farmers , but the work was done entirely by slaves or by indentured white servants . The treatment of the slaves is said to have been usually mild , as in Virginia , but their lives were practically at the mercy of their masters . The white servants fared better , and the general state of society was so low that when their time of service was ended they had here a good chance of rising to a position of equality with their masters . The country swarmed with ruffians of all sorts , who fled thither from South Carolina and Virginia ; life and property were very insecure , and Lynch law was not unfrequently administered . The small planters led for the most part a lazy life , drinking hard , and amusing themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fist , and eyes gouged out by a dexterous use of the long thumb-nails . The only other social amusement seems to have been gambling . But , except at elections and other meetings for political purposes , people saw very little of each other . There were no roads worthy of the name , and every family was almost entirely iso-* lated from its neighbors . Until just before the War for Independence there was not a single school , good or bad , in the whole colony . It need not be added that the people were densely ignorant . The colony was a century old before it could boast of a printing-press ; and if no newspapers were published , it was doubtless for ' the sufficient reason that there were very few who would have been able to read them . A mail from Virginia came some eight or ten times in a year , but it only reached a few towns on the coast , and down to the time of the Revolution the interior of the country had no mails at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in great measure cut off from the currents of thought and feeling by which the other colonies were swayed in the middle of the eighteenth century . In the War for Independence North Carolina produced no great leaders : she was not represented at the Stamp ActCongress of 1765 , and she was the last of the States , except Rhode Island , to adopt the Federal Constitution . All these consequences very clearly followed from the geographical circumstances of North Carolina , and from the character of the immigration by which it was peopled . And in the character of ' this immigration we find the reasons for the comparatively democratic state of society in this colony . As there were very few large plantations and wealthy planters , while almost all the white people were small land-owners , and as the highest class . was thus so much lower in dignity than . the corresponding class in Virginia , it became just so much the easier for the " poor whites " to rise far enough to become a part of it . North Carolina , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminals and insolvent debtors , but it afforded a home for the better portion of the " poor white " class of Virginians . The indentured white servants , who on their liberation found it impossible to maintain a respectable existence under the conditions of Virginian society , were thus naturally segregated into two classes . The least enterprising and thrifty individuals remained at home to recruit the ranks of the " white trash , " save such as . // became outlawed , and fled across the border to North Carolina to escape the hangman . Those , on the other hand , who had still some ambition left and some snirit of enterprise , found it possible to make a place for themselves in the rude and simple social system of North Carolina . From the vigor and ambition of this better class of " poor whites , " re-enforced by the excellent Huguenot element , came at last the strength and prosperity of this remarkable community . In the later history of the American people we see the men of North Carolina founding and settling the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern Illinois , and southeastern Missouri , often presenting a characteristic type of feature and a facial expression that is as easily recognizable as that of the London cockney . From this strain of the English race , taken at its best , have come two of our Presidents , Jackson and Johnson , concerning whose principles and policy there has been much hot controversy , but whose rugged strength of character is doubted by no one . Taken at its worst , with the brutalizing influences of frontier life added to those of slavery , this type of American is seen in the Hannibal Chollop so amusingly por-. trayed by Dickens , in the " border ruffians " led by the ferocious Quantrell to the dreadful massacre at Lawrence , and in the desperadoes whose dark deeds used onde to give the town of Memphis its unenviable prominence in the pages of the Police Gazette . The settlement of South Carolina took place under different circumstances from those of the sister colony , and the resulting state of society was very different indeed . At the time of the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as North Carolina , but of this number nearly three - fourths were negro slaves . In the race character of its white population South Carolina differed widely from any of the other colonies we have thus far considered . The people of Virginia and of the New England colonies were as purely English as the people of England itself ; in Maryland they were scarcely less so ; and in North Carolina , though there was a more considerable foreign element , still the people were mainly English . But in South Carolina nearly half of the white population would seem to have been of foreign origin . A great many Hugnenots came after 1685 , and for some seventy-five years large numbers of Germans kept coming from the Palatinate . There were also a few Scotch Highlanders , and a good many Protestants from the north of Ireland . It is hardly correct , however , to describe the ScotchIrish Protestants as foreigners , or to rank them among the non-English elements in the population of an American State . The so-called Scotch-Irish are the descendants of the Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1611 . So far as race is concerned there is nothing Irish about them ; nor in point of race can there be said to be any difference between an Englishman and a Lowland Scot , since the difference is less than the difference between a native of Camberland or Cornwall and a native of Kent or Suffolk . The Irish settlers of South Carolina were simply men of English blood and names , whose grandfathers or great-grandfathers had crossed the Channel to Ireland . There is no better breed of men to be found anywhere in the world . The Huguenots , too , in whose veins flowed the best blood of France-admirable men of quick wit and sturdy character , whom France could ill afford to loseformed an excellent stock for the peopling of a new state . The German settlers belonged mostly to the peasant class , and were less active and intelligent than the French and the Ulster English ; but they were honest and thrifty , and made good citizens , as Germans always do . The general character of the immigration by which South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one respect there is a resemblance , not wholly superficial , between the settlement of South Carolina and that of Plymouth . Most of the South Carolina settlers had left Europe for reasons connected with religion ; and emigrants who quit their homes for such reasons are likely to show a higher average of intelligence and energy than the great mass of their feb low-countrymen who stay at home . Calvinism was the prevailing form of theology in South Carolina , though there were some Lutherans , and perhaps one-fifth of the people may have belonged to the Church of England , which was established by the proprietary charter , and remained the state church until 1776 . For the first forty years after the settlement of the colony there was a good deal of wrangling over religious matters , cause&amp; // by the attempts of the High-Churchmen to enforce conformity on the part of the Dissenters ; but early in the eighteenth century such attempts were abandoned as hopeless , and a policy of toleration prevailed . Though the Church of England was supported by public taxation , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected by their congregations like the Dissenting clergymen . Their education was in general very good , and their character lofty ; and in all respects the tone of the Church in South Carolina was far higher than in Virginia . At the outbreak of the Revolution the Episcopal clergy of South Carolina almost to a man were found on the side of the patriots , in curious contrast to the Episcopal clergy of Virginia , whose fanatical Toryism was carried so far as to ruin the reputation of their Church in that great State . But the most interesting feature connected with the establishment of the English Church was the introduction of the parish system of local self-government in very much the same form in which it existed in England . The vestries in South Carolina discharged , though less perfectly , many of the functions which in New England were performed by the town-meeting-the superintendence of the poor , the maintenance of roads , the election of repres*ntatives , and the assessment of the local taxes . In the course of our comparative survey of the colonies we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political economy lies at the bottom of the philosophy of history . The economic circumstance which determined the whole complexion of society in South Carolina was the cultivation of rice and indigo . A good deal of cotton was also raised , but the cotton crop was far less important in the eighteenth century than it became after the invention of the gin and the development of the great factories in England . Rice and indigo absorbed the attention of the colony , as tobacco absorbed the attention of Virginia . There were no manufactures whatever . Every article , great or small , whether a mere luxury or an article of prime necessity , that had to be manufactured , was imported , and paid for with rice or indigo . This created a very prosperous trade in Charleston . The planters did not deal directly with the ship-masters , as in Virginia , but sold their crops to the merchants in Charleston , whence they were shipped , sometimes in British , but usually in New England vessels , to all parts of the world . Now the cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy occupations . They are said to be deadly to white men , and even to negroes they are very exhausting . But negroes were brought to South Carolina in such great numbers that an athletic man could be had for ? 40 . Every athletic negro could raise in a single year much more indigo or rice than would repay the cost of his purchase , so that it was actually more profitable to work him to death than to take care of him . Accordingly , the negroes were worked to death , and the relations between the slave and his master were very different from what they were in Virginia and Maryland . The negroes in South Carolina were simply heathen savages ; wedlock was almost unknown among them ; they were kept in brute-like ignorance , and were often treated with barbarons cruelty . Consequently , instead of becoming softened in disposition and partially civilized , like their brethren in Maryland and Virginia , these negroes were as ugly and ferocious as any tribe of savages in Africa . Like the dog that is used to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were a dangerous class of society , prone to commit crimes of violence , and to run away or rise in rebellion when occasion offered . In the course of the eighteenth century there were several alarming insurrections , which were suppressed with atrocious barbarity . The planters lived in perpetual terror . A sort of standing army , in the shape of a well-drilled militia 8000 strong , was kept continually on duty , and part of the business of this militia was to visit all the plantations and search the negro quarters for concealed weapons . They were also authorized to flog any stray negro they might chance to meet , without stopping to ask questions . For the murder of a master or overseer negroes were sometimes burned at the stake , or exposed in an iron cage and left to starve . Of the general degradation wrought by such a state of things it is unnecessary to speak . But one peculiarity of life in South Carolina , in which it afforded a striking contrast to Virginia , may have been in great part the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate neighborhood of Charleston , none of the // planters lived on their estates . They all owned houses in Charleston , and most of them lived there all the year round , occasionally visiting their plantations , but leaving them in the mean while to be managed by overseers . This , with the brisk foreign trade , made Charleston a very important town . In 1776 it had a population of 15,000 , and ranked as the fifth city of the United States . Charleston had a theatre , and concerts , balls , and dinner parties made the society there quite brilliant . There were no schools in the colony , but it was the universal custom among the rich planters to send their children to Europe for an education , and in this way they were usually well educated . The knowledge of the world thus acquired , as well as the constant and concentrated commercial intercourse with England , gave to society in South Carolina a somewhat less provincial aspect than it wore in Virginia . The contrast with North Carolina , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its imperious and fiery aristocracy , was one of the first of the colonies to take up the cause of independence , and furnished many able leaders .

And whereas North Carolina was the paradise of the " white trash , " being the one colony in which they succeeded in obtaining a comfortable position in society , on the other hand , in South Carolina , owing to the peculiarities of the rice and indigo culture , and the great number of slaves , there were hardly any " poor whites " at all , and hardly any small farmers , except in the western hill country . The rapid growth of the Carolinas was not regarded with favor by the Spaniards , who laid claim to the country as part of Florida . They kept inciting the Indians to hostilities toward the settlers , just as the French in Canada prompted the Indian raids upon New England . Independently of Spanish influence , North Carolina in 1711 became involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe of the great Iroquois family . After a great deal of tomahawking and scalping on the western border , the united forces of Virginia and the two Carolinas crushed the Tuscaroras , and in 1715 these savages made their way to New York , *nd joined the League of the Iroquois. hardly had this danger been removed VOL . LxvL-No. 393. - 27 when the Yamassees and other southern tribes , prompted by Spanish intrigues , invaded South Carolina with a force that is said to have amounted to 7000 warriors . After they had slaughtered four or five hundred settlers , Governor Craven , with 1200 militia , routed them in an obstinate battle , and drove them forth from the colony ; but for several years after this defeat they continued to be a source of great annoyance , and upon the frontier no man 's life was safe . The great multitude of slaves , too , ever ripe for insurrection , made the neighborhood of the hostile Spaniards particularly dangerous . In 1732 this wretched state of affairs on the South Carolina frontier attracted the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place among the heroes of early American history . James Oglethorpe , an officer who in youth had served with distinction under Marlborough , conceived the plan of freeing the insolvent debtors who crowded the English prisons by carrying them over to America and establishing a colony which might serve as a strong military outpost against the Spaniards . The scheme was an opportune one , as the South-sea Bubble and other wild projects had ruined hundreds of English families . The land between the Savannah River and the Spanish settlements in Florida was made over to a board of trustees , and was named Georgia , in honor of the king , George II . Oglethorpe was appointed governor ; German Protestants and Highlanders from Scotland were brought over in large numbers ; and a few people from New England joined in the enterprise , and founded the town of Sunbury . All laws were to be made by the trustees , and the settlers were to have no representative assembly and no voice in making the government . Military drill was to be rigidly enforced . Slave labor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquors ; so that Maine can not rightfully claim the doubtful honor of having been the first American state to try the experiment of a " Maine Law . " Such were the beginnings of Georgia , and in the Spanish war of 1739 it quite justified the foresight of its founder . The valor of the Highlanders and the admirable generalship of Oglethorpe were an efficient bulwark for the older colonies . In 1742 the Spaniards were at last decisively defeated , with terrible slaughter , in the battle of Frederica , and in the following // year Florida was invaded , and if Oglethorpe had been properly supported he would unquestionably have wrested the country from the Spaniards entirely . But the attempt to found a despotic oligarchy in Georgia fared no better than the attempt to set up an aristocratic constitution in the Carolinas . The government of the trustees , after Oglethorpe 's return to England , became simply unendurable , and in 1752 Georgia was made a crown colony , and a representative government was introduced simultaneously with negro slavery and Jamaica rum . The social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sufficient importance to detain our attention for more than a moment . In 1770 the population numbered about 50,000 , of which one-half were slaves . The earliest English settlers were rather a thriftless set , but the character of the immigration improved as the great natural resources of the country began to be understood . It is difficult to tell what were the proportions of English and of foreign blood , but the German element was certainly considerable . There was no town life . Rice , indigo , and cotton were the principal crops , and there was a large export of lumber . Near Savannah there were a few extensive plantations , with elegant houses after the Virginia pattern ; but most of the estates were small , and most of the owners were poor . The Church of England was supported by the government , but the clergy had little influence . The condition of the slaves differed but slightly , if at all , from their condition in South Carolina . But there were a good many " mean whites , " and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods , and there were neither schools , nor mails , nor any kind of literature . Colonial Georgia , in short , was a thoroughly illiterate and barbarous frontier community , and gave no earnest of the future prosperity which was to raise it in our time to a position among the Southern States second only to Virginia . In its development it came for a long time under the powerful influence of South Carolina , and in its social system differed from the older State only in points of minor importance . In South Carolina , indeed , we have found , originating in adaptation to local economic circumstances , a type of social structure such as in later times has been more or less closely imitated in all the other States of the far South . Nothing could be more unlike the type of social structure which existed in the New England colonies , and it was not strange that differences so deep-seated and so aggressive in the very nature of the case should by-and-by engage these opposing types of society in a life and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had they not done so . Between Virginia and New England the antagonism of interests and prejudices need never have assumed the extreme form of warfare ; between South Carolina and New England it could hardly fail to assume such an extreme form , and this by reason of the very intensity of nature and tenacity of purpose which we rightly regard as . a chief source of the greatness of the people . The South Carolinians , we have seen , were in original character not unlike the New-Englanders . The touch of French admixture may perhaps have added a little vivacity , and made it a little easier for the blood to rise quickly to the boiling-point . But between the Huguenot and the Puritan there were many striking points of likeness , while in the Scottish and English Presbyterians of Ulster one sees the Puritan type of character most completely exemplified . Great uprightness of motive with iron strength of will was characteristic of the original stocks from which South Caroina was peopled , and these fine qualities have not been lacking in their descendants . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen in sourness of temper and fanatical obstinacy . Instances of this have been found in plenty among the slave-holders of South Carolina as well as among the abolitionists of New England . But notwithstanding these points of likeness in original temperament , the enormous difference between the social system of South Carolina and that of New England wrought most powerfully upon the character of the people . The varied mercantile and cosmopolitan life of the New England towns , the political democracy , the tireless industry , and the devotion to intellectual pursuits , even were it only in the shape of endless hair - splitting in theology and metaphysics -- all this tended to make the minds of the people more and more flexible , and their tempers more and more inclined to courtesy and to compromise . In South Carolina , on the other hand , circumstances tended in just the opposite ' // direction . With a small population of intelligent masters holding in absolutely cruel and ruthless bondage a large population of slaves , with the monotony of business pursuits , the absence of intellectual interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all resulting from such a wrong state of things , the people could not fail to grow less and less flexible in mind , and more and more fanatical , impatient , and impracticable in disposition . After the union of the States under the Constitution the political conduct of South Carolina was so imperious and so unreasonable that she was not uncommonly known as the " Hotspur State , " or as the " vixen sister . " Never willing to yield a point , or to enter into any sort of compromise for the general good of the American people , she begafi with threats of nullification or secession whenever any measure was proposed in Congress that seemed to conflict with her local interests ; and when , by reason of the extension of South Carolinian ideas throughout the zone of territory bordering on the Gulf of Mexico , they had acquired power enough to make war inevitable , it was South Carolina herself that hastened on the day of battle . Such was the unrighteous outcome of Calvinistic rigidity of mind and obstinacy of temper when brutalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this was the state of mind produced by the conditions of life in Virginia may be seen by contrasting the political conduct of the smaller with that of the greater community , until , in 1861 , Virginia , slowly and reluctantly and with many misgivings , felt herself obliged to follow the lead of her implacable sister . Opposed as Virginia and New England were in their prejudices and in what were supposed to be their political interests , it needed the fiery fanaticism of South Carolina to push on these antagonisms to the point of hatred and of warfare . And when all this is duly considered , the circumstances of the settlement of South Carolina , the race characteristics of the early settlers , their religious enthusiasm , and their cultivation of rice and indigo , become invested with that rare and high interest which attaches to dull historical facts as soon as they are studied in their implications . And thus we begin already to see how the history of the American people , down to the present day , is simply the inexorable logical outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy the different portions of the American soil .
