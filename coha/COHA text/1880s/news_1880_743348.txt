txt The bill which Gen. McCooK has introduced into the House to regulate the appointment , assignment , and duties of Chaplains is a great improvement on his last year 's measure . The object of both bills was the same  --  to provide the Army with Rcbrnan Catholic Chaplains . But Gen. McCOOK 'S first plan proposed to take an annual census of the doctrinal beliefs or proclivities of all the officers and men , and to assign and shift Chaplains in accordance therewith . It went into such details as uniting " two or more Protestant denominations , " when neither in any department could poll his specified number of votes , and then " assigning a Chaplain of the most numerous of the denominations so united . " So , with fewer than 800 Roman Catholics in any department , the Secretary of War was to " unite them with the Roman Catholics of some adjoining department , " in order to secure a Roman Catholic Chaplain . Every year this sectarian census and shifting process was to be repeated . Such a scheme would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains to point out at the time , that it was drawn up in ecclesiastical , and not in military , interests ; that it substituted for authoritative selections from the various priesthoods religious ballots among the enlisted men ; that it concelled to sectarian religions a latitude in the Army not allowed to national polities , and that it would not only label men Catholics or Protestants , whose sufficient description was that of American soldiers , but would open the door for intrigues to secure changes of station for troops and consolidations of posts , in order to carry the annual count of sectarian noses . We are glad to see that from his pending bill Gen. McCooK has stricken out every vestige of this vicious voting scheme . Perhaps he has seen that it is as much out of place as asking Congress to legislate for an annual census of Democrats and Republicans in the Army , in order to assign a fair share of each among the teachers of the post-schools . At any rate , he has seen that his end must be approached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven sections of his new bill provide a retiring-board to examine existing Chaplains  --  the object being to create as many vacancies as fairly possible , in order to advance the operation of his own system of chaplaining . All Chaplains now over 50 years old are required to appear before the board , to be examined for physical ability to perform their duties , and all under 50 who believe themselves physically unable , and wish to be placed on retired pay , are also to be examined . This being settled , hereafter , in filling vacancies , Chaplains are to be an -- pointed by the President , with . the consent of the Senate , " in such a manner that there shall be at least one Roman Catholic Chaplain and one Protestant Chaplain , who shall be stationed at each military department head-quarters . " The first effect of this provision , as matters stand , will be to make none but Roman Catholic priests eligible to Army Chaplaincies for many years to come , and until the equalization so spoken of is effected . Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division ae cording to Church ordination , is not a grasping one . Assuming that the bill uses " department " in its technical sense , as distinct from the superior term division , and the inferior district , there are at present but nine places to be controlled by this bill  --  the Department of Dakota , of the Missouri , of the Platte , of Texas , of the East , of the South . of the Columbia . of Arizona , and , presumably , of West Point . There are thirty Post Chaplains in the Army , and four regimental Chaplains , so that the bill as it stands does not aim at controlling an unfair number of them ; but it evidently contemplates an increasing number of departmental Chaplains , to absorb them nearly all , as it limits the Chaplains to be assigned in compliance with it to " thirty , " expressly excepting the four regimental Chaplains . The remaining sections of the bill provide that the Chaplain shall not be appointed if over 40 years old ; that he shall bring written recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical certificate of physical ability ; that he shall visit , and report upon , twice a year , unless detailed to accompany expeditions in the field , each camp and post in his department , ministering to the spiritual necessities of all officers and men " professing the same religious belief as his own , " though no constraint shall be put on any officer or enlisted man to attend or abstain from religious service . It is also expressly provided that no Chaplain shall be " required or permitted " to minister to any officer or enlisted man professing a different religious belief , unless at the latter 's re- - quest , and that he shall be allowed to conduct all religious ceremonies according to his faith and discipline , and shall not be compelled to perform any contrary thereto . Such is the new plan . It labors under the objection of employing the terms Roman Catholic and Protestant in a general law of Congress , but it is an objection , perhaps , inhering in the nature of the case . There ' are undoubtedly many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious instruction familiar to their childhood , and above all the spiritual ministration provided for the sick and the dying in battle or in hospital , are very dear . It must not be supposed that these religious offices are wholly wanting , for in fact hardly a post on the frontier is without its semi-annual visit of some Roman Catholic priest . Still , it is perhaps not an unfair demand that the latter should not be practically excluded from competition for the rank , pay , and mileage given to the Chaplain . There is one other way out of the difficulty , as suggested by Gen. SHERMAN . This is to abolish the rank of Chaplain in the Army , after the present incumbents shall have ceased to hold it , and allow each post Council of Administration to select a civilian Chaplain , a monthly allowance being made for this purpose , in lieu of the Chaplain 's pay . This plan is also not wholly free from difficulties , and perhaps in some cases the religious preferences of the men might not be consulted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid , the existing discrimination , against which Gen. McCoox 's new system of chaplaincy is aimed .
