txt A case of life insurance fraud has just been brought to light here which is creating great excitement , from the fact that the person insured was highly recommended by prominent physicians in the community , who acted as medical examiners for the different companies , as a safe risk , when , in fact , it was generally known that she was in the last stages of consumption , and the indications are that the whole affair was a bold attempt to swindle the various companies in which the woman was insured . The person in question was Mrs. Emma Reinert , living with her father in Amity Township , this county . She died several weeks ago from consumption . She had for some years been living with her husband at Phcenixville , but on account of sickness returned to her father , as he says , to die . Soon after her return , the business of taking out policies on her life was begun , and at the time of her death , it is stated , about $26,000 in insurance had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for $5,000 in the Home Mutual of Lebanon , on Oct. 5 , 1880 , in which the age of the woman was given as 26 years . The examiner , a prominent physician , gave it as his judgment that the person examined was safely insurable . The Reading Mutual Aid Society issued a policy for $1,000 on the life of Mrs. Reinart in favor of Samuel Shirey , the examining physician saying that she had never had consumption or any other organic disease ? " only a slight cough from a recent cold . " The Secretary of this company says they were imposed upon , and that they , will not only not pay the policy , but will prosecute the person who deceived them to the full extent of the law . The Prudential Aid Company also issued a policy on the woman 's life for $2,000 on the same representations , and they now find that some of the persons who vouched for the woman never saw her , and knew nothing as to her health , &c.; There are quite a number of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and who issued policies for large amounts , but as yet the names have not been given to the public . It is stated that in one of the cases an agent was paid $100 as a fee for the share he took in getting out one of the policies . The different companies have taken the matter in hand , and intend to unravel the mystery attending it . Another case of a supposed " crooked " nature was the insurance of Joseph Richardson , near Pottstown. for $3,000 , a few weeks before he died , at the age of 75 years , from a cancerous affection of the head . This section of Eastern Pennsylvania is noted for speculative insurance , which has worked much evil in the past .
