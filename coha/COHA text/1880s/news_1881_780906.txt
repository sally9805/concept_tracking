txt Both branches of the Ohio Legislature have passed a bill prohibiting pool-selling in the State . An amendment added in the Rouse makes it necessary for the ' bill to go back to the Senate before it becomes law , and the sporting men are rallying their forces to defeat it before it is too late . The measure is of very stringent character , and includes in its penalties all who have anything to do with sale of pools or layingof wagers , from the owner of rooms where betting is done down to the smallest buyer of a pool ticket . An attempt to except from the provisions of the bill the grounds inclosed by fair , agricultural , and regularly organized running and trotting associations , failed Capt . Stone , head of the Chester Park organization , and manager of the celebrated mare Maud S. said that if such a law had been in operation the past two years Maud S. would never have been heard from . " The . bill , if it becomes a law and is enforced , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in the State of Ohio . We will never be able to have another turf meeting here or at Columbus or Toledo or Dayton , or any of the points in the State where wo have usually held meetings You ca n't support races with the profit of pool-selling , and you ca n't , as a rule , find people who are willing systematically to lore money for the sake of amusing other people . The only way that racing events can be made to pay expenses is by means of the profits which the society gets from the sales of pools . If this bill is a law we will have to close up and can never have another turf meeting here . " Public sentiment , however , strongly favors the ge of such a law , and the sporting men will hardly be able to commis its defeat .
