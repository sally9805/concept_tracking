AN UNPUBLISHED CHAPTER OF HAWAIIAN HISTORY . FROM 1838 till 1843 the Hawaiian Islands were a bone of contention . Intrigues were constantly set on foot by agents and subjects of France and England , having for their object the subversion of the native government and the seizure of the islands . In 1839 the French compelled the king , Kamehameha III. , to comply with certain unwarrantable demands , and as a security for future good behavior to deposit $20 , 000 . It was thought that the demand was made in expectation that the king would be unable to comply , and that thus the French would have an excuse to seize the group . The American merchants came forward and raised the sum , and the peril was for the time averted . But the plots continued , and in 1842 the British consul , Richard Charleton , a coarse and illiterate man , incited by an ambitious adventurer , one Alexander Simpson , endeavored to involve the native government in difficulties that would result in hoisting the British flag over the group . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson Bay Company 's territories , visited the islands . An English gentleman of liberal views , he would not lend himself to the intrigues of // his countrymen , albeit one of them was his nephew , and by his advice the king , harassed on all sides , decided to send commissioners to the United States , England , and France to try to obtain , if possible , a definite acknowledgment of his kingdom and sovereignty . To this important embassy were appointed Rev. William Richards , formerly one of the American missionaries , but who had been for some time acting as adviser to the king , and Haalileo , a native chief . They quietly embarked in a small schooner for Mazatlan , and crossed Mexico to Vera Cruz . As soon as it was known that they had left the islands on this mission , the British consul , Charleton , also secretly embarked for London , vid Mexico , to lay his complaints before the British government , leaving Simpson as deputy to carry out their joint designs , whom , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleton fell in with Lord George Paulet , commanding her British Majesty 's frigate the Carysfort , and made his lordship , as his course afterward showed , a convert to his schemes , and by his formal and plausible complaints against the king induced RearAdmiral Thomas , commanding the British squadron on that station , to order the Carysfort to Honolulu for the purpose of investigating the alleged grievances . On his arrival Lord Paulet , a hot-headed young nobleman , readily lent himself to the designs of Simpson , without inquiring into the merits of the case , dazzled by the idea of so early in *his career making a brilliant stroke for his country , and extending her drum-beat round the world by one more station . Making outrageous demands upon the king , at the cannon 's mouth , compliance with which he knew would be impossible , he required , as an alternative , the immediate cession of the kingdom to England , or he would open fire upon the city and declare war in the name of Great Britain . In this terrible crisis the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so touching and so king-like that I will quote it here : " Where are you , chiefs , people , and commons from my ancestors , and people from foreign lands ! " Hear ye ! I make known to you that I am in perplexity by reason of difficulties into which I have been brought without cause ; therefore I have given away the life of our land . Hear ye ! But my rule over you , my people , and your privileges , will continue , for I have hope that the life of the land will be restored when my conduct is justified . " Done at Honolulu , Oahu , this twenty-fifth day of February , 1843 . " KAMEHAMEHA III . " KEKATJLUOHI . " Lord Paulet took formal possession of the islands , installing himself as governor of her Majesty 's new dominion , destroyed every Hawaiian flag he could get hold of , and placed an embargo on every native vessel , so that no one could go out and carry the news . An American man-of-war , the Boston , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cession . Captain Quackenbush , late of Norfolk , Virginia , was then a midshipman on board of her . The Americans were very indignant . They had their guns double shotted in hopes of an opportunity to interfere , but , being on a cruise , could not go out of their way to carry the news , and could only remain neutral . Lord Paulet would thus have cruelly prevented the king from communicating with his ambassadors who were abroad successfully working for the acknowledgment of his independence , hoping to commit the home government to an acceptance of this " voluntary " cession at the cannon 's mouth before the other side of the story could be represented to it . His young lordship and Simpson chuckled over the success of the stroke by which they had , as they supposed , closed every avenue of egress for Hawaiian vessels , and secured the arrival of their own dispatches in England in advance of every other version of the story . Yankee shrewdness was , however , too much for his lordship 's plans . It happened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runner ) , previously to the cession , to an American house for a voyage to Mazatlan and back . Lord Paulet , anxious to get possession of the only creditable craft at the islands in order to send Simpson as his bearer of dispatches to England by the speediest way , and being prevented by its charter from seizing the vessel without the consent of the American house , offered , in case they would relinquish their charter , to allow them to send an agent on the ship to attend to their business on the coast , and to bring down any freight // on the return trip , thereby saying them the whole expense of the charter . It must be remembered that in those days communication between the islands of the Pacific and the coast was very infrequent , depending on merchant ships that came from Boston twice a year , except for occasional chance vessels . Lord Paulet rightly conjectured that the Yankee merchants would jump at the offer to have all their business transacted at his expense , but he little dreamed of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them . The officers of the Boston , who would have been glad of an excuse for a forcible interference with his lordship 's plans , not being allowed that pleasure , consoled themselves by giving a ball on board , to which the officers of the Carysfort were not invited . I was then a young merchant in Honolulu , and attended the ball with many other of the American residents . At its height I was quietly invited into the cabin of the Boston , where I found Captain Long , Dr. Judd-previously a prominent American missionary , then acting as the king 's minister - and other influential citizens and warm friends of the king . Here I was told of the king 's desire to send an envoy to England to present his protest against Lord Paulet 's act of violence , and his answer to the charges against him , and to demand the restitution of his sovereignty . I was informed also of the opportunity offered to the firm of Ladd and Co. of sending a messenger to the coast in the yacht . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island government , had proposed that the king should send a secret ambassador , in the character of their commercial agent , thus turning Lord Panlet 's master-stroke against himself in the neatest possible way . I was asked if I would go in this double capacity of ostensible supercargo and actual minister plenipotentiary . Mr. Charles Brewer , who was one of the council , a noble - hearted man , with whom I was about associating myself in business-now enjoying a green old age in Boston-not only gave consent to my going , but agreed to advance for the king the necessary funds , and take his pay in fire - wood , all the king 's other revenues having been cut off . I readily accepted the commission . No time was to be lost . Lord Paulet had rechristened the Hoilcailca as " her Majesty 's tender Albert , " and was fitting her out with all possible dispatch . The king and his premier , a princess almost equal in rank , without whose signature none of his acts was valid , had left the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of despair buried themselves among the mountains of the adjacent island of Maui , leaving Dr. Judd , his minister , to represent and protect his interests  --  a man of indomitable courage , unusual ability , and unflinching devotion to his sovereign . Those happy isles in that day did not boast a lawyer . My credentials were copied verbatim , except necessary variations , from an old Blue-book containing the credentials of John Adams as the first American minister to England . Mine were a commission as " envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court of St. James , from the Native King of the Hawaiian Islands , " the title Kamehameha was allowed by Lord Paulet to retain , with some half - dozen other blank commissions signed by the king and premier , to be filled out by myself for other countries as occasion might require . These were rendered necessary by the uncertainty of my finding the king 's other ambassadors , Haalileo and Richards , with whom , in case I did find them , I was to associate myself . The papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight , in the royal tomb in Honolulu , with a king 's coffin for a table . So secret was it necessary to keep the transaction that even this clerk was not trusted with the name of the ambassador , which was left to be inserted by myself after I had sailed . The papers prepared , a canoe with picked crew of Kanakas was dispatched from a distant point of the island to summon his Majesty and his suite to a midnight council . Crossing the boisterous channel in this frail conveyance , they landed at midnight on the shores of Waikiki , a suburb of Honolulu , and in its cocoa-nut grove , by the light of torches , my credentials received the signature and seal of the king and his lcuhina-nui- " great minister " - Kekauluohi , the " big - mouthed queen . " Then , the king and his attendants returned to their mountains , without Lord Paulet having a suspicion that they had ever left them . // The American consul at Honolulu took advantage of the opportunity also to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cession , which would , of course , have momentous interest to the American government , and the protest of the American residents against the act of Lord Paulet . All the hurried preparations being completed , " H. B. M. s tender Albert " sailed on the eleventh day of March , 1843 , for San Blas , commanded by a midshipman from the Carysfort and two old men-ofwar 's men with a crew of eight Kanakas , and two passengers , one of whom was Mr. Alexander Simpson , late " deputy consul , " now special bearer of dispatches to her Majesty from the " Governor of the Sandwich Islands , " the other one myself . After a thirty days ' voyage we landed at San Blas on the 10th of April , and engaged our mules and guides for Tepic , the city , thirty miles inland , of which San Blas is the sea-port . It is a handsome city , healthy , and pleasantly situated on high ground . We reached it the following day , and were received with princely hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant who had married a Mexican lady of rank , and was a very influential citizen . I had been his guest three years before , on my first trip across Mexico to the United States , and had received many attentions from him . All the way over Mr. Simpson had been pouring out upon the young midshipman commander , who had plenty of time to converse while his old tars took care of the ship , his expectations of the lionizing he should receive at Tepic . He lost no time to inform the consul - general , with no little self-complaceny , of the glorious news that the Hawaiian Islands were under the British flag , through their " voluntary " cession by the king . Mr. Barron listened in unconcealed amazement to his startling and excited statements , appearing to notice from time to time the utter silence which I maintained all the while . When they were finished he rose and invited me into his private office , as if on the business of Ladd and Co. , whose agent he was . Arrived in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full statement of the remarkable affair , which , he was convinced , must have another side from that which Mr. Simpson had so fluently set forth . Knowing that I was speaking to an honorable man with the Briton 's love of fair play , I did exactly what I was asked to do , explaining the facts of the case , and that the king , far from having made a voluntary cession of his domain , as stated by Mr. Simpson , had made one under protest to save bloodshed . I showed him my own commission from his Majesty , and his protest against this outrage to the Queen of England , and request for redress and the restoration of his sovereignty . I told him that the officers of the Hudson Bay Company and other leading Englishmen in Honolulu disapproved of the outrage , and that any fair tribunal would dismiss as baseless the charges against the king upon which the demands had been made . I explained that , under this pressure , the king had made the cession under protest , relying upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rights , and restoration to his throne . Mr. Barron thanked me for the information I had given him , and assured me that he would take the same pains to forward me on my way to England that he did to send Mr. Simpson , promising at the same time to keep my secret from him . Returning to the parlor , he said to Mr. Simpson : " This is indeed very great news that you have brought , and much as I should be pleased to have you stay and partake of our hospitalities , it is of the utmost importance that you reach England without delay . I will have your mules and muleteer and guide in readiness for you to start early to-morrow morning . " Turning to me , he said , in a way not to excite Simpson 's suspicion : " As you will have plenty of time here , would you not like to take a trip to the city of Mexico ? If so , you can go with Mr. Simpson , and I can furnish you with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to go . The ci-devant British consul and prospective Governor of the Hawaiian Islands looked somewhat dashed at being so speedily turned off . It was not so much like being lionized as he had expected . In those days the travel on the west coast of America was by horses and mules , with pack-saddles for the baggage ; there were no public conveyances . We left Tepic April 12 , reached Guadalajara on the 16th , and on the 21st arrived at Lagos , where we took the diligence for the city of Mexico , where we arrived on the 25th . The next day I called on the American // consul , Mr. Black , and with him on Hon. Waddy Thompson , the American minister , telling them the news I had brought and my own errand . On the 28th Simpson and I started in the diligence for Vera Oruz . The same day we reached the beautiful Puebla de los Angeles ( City of the Angels ) , where we passed the night . The next day we arrived at Perote , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minister in Mexico , and learned from him my first tidings of the Hawaiian ambassadors , Richards and Haalileo , with whom I was to be associated , they having gone to Washington with him . On the 30th we passed through Jalapa , a beautiful town in a healthy situation , a place of resort for citizens of Vera Cruz in seasons of vomito , which I learned was then raging with great violence in that city . But I heard that a vessel was about to sail from there , so kept on my way with Mr. Simpson , and reached Vera Cruz on May-day . Mr. Simpson at once embarked on the English steam-packet for Havana . I , hayiug dispatches for Washington , was to take the schooner advertised to sail for New Orleans . Imagine my dismay at learning that her destination had been changed ! Here was a situation-vomito raging , my beloved friend the consul on his way to England , and no vessel up for any port ! The prospect was not cheering . On May 10 I sailed for New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay at the Balize , waiting for a tow-boat to cross the bar , we reached New Orleans on the 22d-two hours too late for the daily train for Mobile . Here I was told that I might possibly reach Boston in time for the steamer of June 1 , provided no accident occurred to the mail train . To do so would , however , be to make the quickest time ever made , while delays were the rule rather than the exception . My arrival with the news of the seizure of the islands caused great excitement in New Orleans , where there was already strong feeling against England , on account of real or supposed interference with the affairs of Texas , then fighting for her independence . An interesting circumstance of my brief stay in the city was the accidental discovery of the fate of the first California gold - dust ever brought to the States . On May 23 , at 3 * I started in the cars for Lake Pontchartrain , the editor of the New Orleans Picayune accompanying me to interview me ofi the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my native country I found myself hurrying through it , with no time to visit a ftanc*e in Mobile , or a father and mother in Boston . Arrived at Mobile , however , I found that we had to wait over six hours . Fortune was but mocking me - the young lady had sailed the day before for Boston . On May 27 I found myself in Charleston , greatly elated at having got so far without serious delay . In fact , we reached Charleston two days ahead of the mail which left New Orleans when I did . I felt sure , therefore , of reaching Boston in time for the steamer of June 1 , as there were seldom delays north of Charleston . For the first time in the season the Charleston steamer failed to make her appearance on time . This blasted my hopes of reaching Boston in time , and compelled me to spend the Sabbath in Charleston , somewhat consoled by the thought that the delay would give me fifteen days with my family while waiting for the next steamer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking a sailing vessel from New York instead of the steamer from Boston , and , to miss no possible chance of proceeding on my mission , I passed through Washington without stopping to deliver my dispatches in person , intrusting them to the care of my naval friend Lieutenant Brodie , who pledged himself to deliver them from his own hand to Mr. Legar* , then acting Secretary of State , which he did in due time . I reached New York June 1-too late , by a quarter of an hour , for the London packet ship George Washington . I tried , like my indomitable antitype Mr. Phileas Fogg , to charter a steamer to put me on board of the ship , but was told it was of no use , as she had a fair wind , so refrained from going to his lengths of seizing the steamer and putting her captain in irons , but gave it up and went on to Boston , reaching home June 2 , to the astonishment of my parents , who , having had no warning of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were almost as much astonished as if I had , when told of my rank and my mission , extraordinary and plenipotentiary . // Learning that Daniel Webster , Secretary of State , was then at his Boston residence , I called upon him , June 4 , with James Jackson Jarves , the well-known art critic and historian of the Sandwich Islands , and Henry A. Pierce , afterward American minister to Hawaii , whose place in a business firm I was about to take on my return to Honolulu . My object in calling on Mr. Webster was to consult him as to my mission , and to engage the interest of the United States government . I well remember his majestic presence and deep , cavernous eyes . He said unequivocally that the United States would interfere if the British government did not disavow the acts of Lord Paulet . To use his own language : " We will await the result of your mission . If England does not then disavow the acts of Lord George Paulet and restore the group , we 'll make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our American ministry at the court of St. James , the Hon. Edward Everett . On the 14th of June I embarked at last , on the steamer Acadia , of the Cunard Line . As we passed down the harbor she fired a salute of twenty-one guns for President Tyler , just coming into Boston . We landed at Liverpool June 28 . June 30 I called on our minister , Mr. Everett , in London . I told him of my errand in England , laid my papers before him , and learned that Mr. Simpson had arrived only seven days before me . If I had not missed the steamer , I should have been a week in advance of him . As Mr. Everett examined my high-sounding credentials his habitually grave countenance relaxed in a smile . My papers made me actually outrank himself , as I was made ambassador not only to England , but to any other country of the world . He said , " You are very young to have such an important mission , " to which I replied with becoming modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on the experience of his ambassador . I learned from Mr. Everett that Mr. Riehards and chief Haalileo were in Paris , but expected to return soon to London , and he advised me to notify them of my arrival , and wait for them there . I did so , taking lodgings at No. 1 Bury Street , St. James , paying the moderate sum ( for a royal ambassador ) of three shillings and sixpence per day . Mr. Everett had already , I found , had an interview with Lord Aberdeen , Minis ter of Foreign Affairs , and Sir Robert Peel , Prime Minister , on the Hawaiian question , on behalf of the United States ; and though England had not officially disavowed the act of Lord George Paulet , we had some intimations that such might be the result . She was waiting to hear the whole story . My first interview with Mr. Everett left me much encouraged with the prospects of my mission . On the 12th of July , not having heard from my associates , with Mr. Everett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inclosing a copy of my credentials , and requesting an interview . The same evening a flunky in full livery . with a letter for me bearing the seal of the Foreign Office , called at the lodgings of the " minister plenipotentiary , " evidently exalting him greatly in the astonished eyes of his landlady , which were beginning to look with some suspicion upon a lodger of modest bearing without apparent occupation or visible means of support . The note was from the Under Secretary , and read as follows : " Mr. Addington presents his compliments to Mr. Marshall , and , by desire of the Earl of Aberdeen , requests that Mr. Marshall will call on Mr. Addington at this office on Friday next at two o'clock in the afternoon . " FoRETeN OrFIcE , 12 July , 1843 . " I found Mr. Addington very affable in manner . He courteously offered me a chair and a wet blanket , saying that Lord Aberdeen desired him to say to me that the English government could not recognize me as " envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew no such person , the late king having ceded his islands to Great Britain , and having therefore no power to appoint an envoy to that government . I replied that by the terms of the cession his Majesty Kamehameha III . had retained the title of " Native King , " by which title I had designated him in my communication to Lord Aberdeen ; that I had no anxiety to be , nor much expectation that I should be , recognized as minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary , but had forwarded my credentials to him simply to show that I was fully empowered to represent the " native king " ; that if Lord Aberdeen would recognize me as the king 's accredited agent , and afford me the opportunity of presenting his letters // and the proofs which I had of the injustice with which he had been treated , and the manner in which he had been compelled to cede his kingdom , my object would be accomplished . Mr. Addington said that the English government had not been desirous of assuming any jurisdiction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty , but that the charges against him were very serious , and must be disposed of , or the king must grant redress . I expressed my full confidence that a thorough investigation would dispose of them to the satisfaction of the English government . We had a long conversation on the subject of the cession and the circumstances which had led to it , and I left much encouraged by the candid way in which Mr. Addington seemed disposed to consider the matter . Almost as soon as I reached my lodgings after this interview Mr. Richards and Haalileo arrived there . They had come post-haste from Paris on getting my second letter from London , which was the first to reach them . We spent the rest of the day in discussing the startling events which had occurred at the islands since they left , and in laying out our plan of attack upon the British lion . I took up my quarters thenceforth with the other members of the embassy , at St. Paul 's Coffeehouse , St. Paul 's Church-yard , from which we laid siege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of the Hudson Bay Company , all of whom favored the cause of the king , and expressed indignation at the outrages brought about by one who had been in their employ , and who was a nephew to so prominent a member of the company as Sir George Simpson . On the 21st I commenced copying for presentation to the Foreign Office through Mr. Addington , who had agreed at our interview to receive my statements , the long letter of Dr. Judd to the ministers , and portions of the charges brought by the Hawaiian government against Simpson for having violated all the rules of diplomatic courtesy . On the 22d of July we were agreeably surprised by the arrival of Mr. Peter A : Brinsmade from Belgium , full of his scheme , the then famous Belgian contract , for establishing a Belgian colony at the islands . Mr. BrinsWade was one of the partners of Ladd and Co. , the American firm at Honolulu , as whose ostensible agent I was enabled to leave the islands , as I have related . Before that event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intriguing powers , had given authority to Ladd and Co. to form a company of capitalists in Europe and the United States to develop the agricultural resources of the islands , and be as a barrier between him and the designs of any foreign nation upon his sovereignty . Mr. Brinsmade , a gentleman of good education and address , had been for a year or more in Europe working for this project , and had finally succeeded through the " Belgian Company of Colonization . " A company had been formed with ample capital , and with King Leopold as president . The Belgian government had favored the scheme in the hope of finding a new market for Belgian manufactures , making investments at the islands , and establishing profitable business there , sugar-growing , etc . The contract was drawn up by which all the unsold government lands at the islands were to be placed under control of this company , and the stores and warehouses and sugar plantations of Ladd and Co. were to be purchased by ther*i . Mr. Brinsmade had informed his partners , Ladd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him and bring him back to the islands with the first installment of the purchase-money that they chartered the king 's yacht to go to San Blas . Just as the contract was ready for the signatures the news of the seizure of the islands came like an extinguisher , and stopped all proceedings . The firm were under pecuniary embarrassments from which they would have been relieved by this negotiation , and Mr. Brinsmade realized that for them , as for the islands , everything was at stake . His talents had been at the service of Messrs . Richards and HaalileQ from the time of their arrival , and he had been of very great help to them , having written nearly if not quite all of their dispatches to the governments from which they were seeking recognition of Hawaiian independence . He immediately entered heart and soul with us into the work of presenting our case to the British government . We had also the advice of Sir Henry Pelly , home governor of the Hudson Bay Company , who had promised to see Lord Aberdeen personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . All our dispatches were submitted to him before being sent to the Foreign Office . An amusing dilemma embarrassed us verdant diplomatists at the outset of our proceedings . As I had now , according to my instructions , become associated with Messrs . Richards and Haalileo , the dispatches were to be signed by all three of uts . We pondered long over the momentous question as to how the Earl of Aberdeen should be addressed in them . The ordinary phrase " My lord " seemed sirtgular for a plural signature . The native chief suggested that " Our lord " would be proper . Our missionary associate thought that savored of irreverence . Another proposed " 0 lord , " which was open to the same objection . We finally surmounted the difficulty by considering that our three signatures together meant Kamehameha III. , and began it " My lord , " which passed muster with our Hudson Bay House censor . Our method of concocting this momentous document , upon which , as we believed , hung the fate of a nation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round a large table in our lodgings , under the shadow of St. Paul 's , would take np the points one by one , and each write what he thought was the best thing to say , and the best way to say it ; then each would read aloud his own production . But we almost invariably adopted the language of Mr. Brinsmade , who proved himself a born diplomatist , and to whom for his services in drawing up these dispatches , which were complimented by the Earl of Aberdeen as being " remarkably strong and well write ten , " the Hawaiian government owes a debt it has ill repaid . Going in one day to the office of the Hudson Bay Company to leave one of our dispatches for the perusal of Sir Henry Pelly , I found that Mr. Simpson had been in the day before and left one of his - a weak presentment of a weak case , ' ' in Sir Henry 's estimation . On the 24th of July we finished our dispatches to Lord Aberdeen , transmitting with them copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed between Lord George Paulet and the Hawaiian government . On the 7th of August we sent him a dispatch presenting the defense of the Hawaiian government against the charges made by Lord Paulet , and its appeal to the British government and to British love of justice and fair play for redress . This was acknowledged by Lord Aberdeen to be a very strong document . It took up all the charges against the government seriatim , answered and disproved them . Three days of suspense followed , one of which , my twenty-fourth birthday , I spent at the White Hart Inn , and visiting Windsor Castle and Hampton Court . We were invited to dine with the great philanthropist Mrs. Elizabeth Fry , who was at that time engaged in her noble efforts for prison reform . I anticipated the meeting with great pleasure , but the sudden illness of Haalileo prevented the fulfillment of our engagement . Mrs. Fry , however , sent us a very elegant Bible , which was to have been given us at the dinner , for presentation to his Majesty Kamehameha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined all invitations to public receptions , both from the court and the American Legation , having no time or money to spare for such occasions . I was in nervous anxiety to conclude our negotiations and get away . There was no Pacific Railroad or Isthmus route in those days , and if I missed the fall trading ship from Boston to Honolulu , vid Cape Horn , I might have to wait six months . On the 9th of September , not having heard from our document , we sent an urgent note to the Earl of Aberdeen , requesting an early decision , " as Mr. Marshall , one of the commissioners , was compelled to return soon to the islands . " Hearing nothing by the 12th , I addressed a note in my own name to Mr. Addington , requesting a private interview with him , and received a prompt reply , appointing Monday the 14th . At my interview , I explained my personal reasons for desiring to know as early as possible how far the representations which , with my associates , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exonerated the king from the charges made by Lord Paulet , and whether the decision of the British government could not be given before I returned to the islands . Mr. Addington replied somewhat coldly that our statements had been received , but whether they had had the effect we expected he could not say ; that the opposing statements were so contradictory that it was very difficult to decide between the parties ; that the facts seemed to be that the government of the islands was administered by foreigners , and that there // was a continual struggle between two parties bitterly hostile to each other to obtain the control . All he could tell me at present was that a person had been appointed as consul-general ; that he would leave as soon as possible for the islands , and had been instructed in relation to the adjustment of the difficulties . He said , further , that the Foreign Office had just been informed that the King of the Sandwich Islands had granted to an American blank assignia which gave him power to dispose of all the lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed a weakness on the part of the king which demonstrated his unfitness to rule . I replied that I would at once deny the truth of any such charge , not from my present knowledge of the facts , but from my knowledge of the king 's character , and that I would pledge myself to disprove the charge within twelve hours . I then made an urgent appeal through him to Lord Aberdeen to allow the commissioners to be heard , and to have the case settled in London , in order that their pending negotiations with other powers might not be embarrassed . Mr. Addington promised to repeat our conversation to Lord Aberdeen , and to let us know the determination of the government in regard to the proposed reference as soon as possible . On my return from this interview I related its substance to my fellow-envoys , and they approved of the views I had urged upon Mr. Addington , that it would be for the interest of both nations to have the new consul-general begin his career unembarrassed by all these old claims which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreed with me that strong effort should be made to have the troubles all settled before he should leave for his post . Mr. Brinsmade was justly indignant at the charge made against the king in regard to the blank assignia of power to sell Hawaiian lands , and laid before me the king 's contract with Ladd and Co. and all the documents relating to the organization of the Belgian Company under that contract . They were as complete an answer as I had supposed to Lord Aberdeen 's charges . I wrote immediately to Mr. Addington , requesting another interview appointing an interview at two the next day , whereupon we prepared another letter to the Earl of Aberdeen . On Tuesday , the 15th , punctual to appointment , Mr. Addington received us at the Foreign Office . I introduced Mr. Brinsmade as the American who held the contract which had been so misrepresented to the Foreign Office , and who would read it and explain to Mr. Addington the steps which had been taken under it . Mr. Addington was evidently taken by surprise by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more so on seeing for himself its nature and terms , which were simply to the effect that the king granted these lands and privileges on condition that a joint-stock company should be formed , the stock of which should be offered for sale in England , France , and the United States , providing that the king 's sovereignty should be guaranteed , and his rights amply secured . This , of course , was complete disproval of the charge that the king had sold his sovereignty or shown any partiality to the United States . Mr. Addington on reading the contract and hearing Mr. Brinsmade 's report of his action in furtherance of it , expressed his satisfaction that the matter had been misrepresented . I followed up this advantage by urging the equal falseness of the other charges of national partiality on the part of the king , and stated that the appointment of Dr. Judd , of the American mission , as the king 's prime minister , an appointment which had been instanced as proof of such partiality , had , in fact , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson . Mr. Addington asked m* how it was that the Americans seemed to prefer French occupation to that of the English . I replied that the Americans did not fear French competition , but that they felt that if the English took possession their trade would be ruined . This idea seemed rather gratifying to British pride . Mr. Addington requested a copy of the king 's contract with Ladd and Co. , for the satisfaction of Lord Aberdeen , and informed us that the council was then deliberating upon the Sandwich Islands question , and that we should know its decision at as early a period as possible . I returned to our rooms , copied the contract , and sent it to the Foreign Office the same evening . We felt that the end of our warfare was at hand . // On Wednesday , August 16 , we sent another dispatch to the Foreign Office , urging in the strongest possible terms that the decision of the government should be made there in London , so that its new representative at the islands might enter upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aberdeen would by this time be glad to decide the matter to get rid of us , and that on receiving this last dispatch from " St. Paul 's Coffeehouse , St. Paul 's Church-yard , " he would exclaim , " Hark ! from the tombs a doleful sound . " We formally proposed in this letter to submit the whole matter to the decision of the law advisers of the Crown , confident of British love of fair play . The same day I received a note from Mr. Addington , appointing an interview for the next . The interview was a most satisfactory one . Our proposal was accepted , and we received from Lord Aberdeen , through the Under Secretary , very satisfactory assurance that we had made out our case , that the Sandwich Islands had been misrepresented , and that the British government would do it justice . My own share of the work was accomplished . Leaving my associates to receive the formal announcement of the government 's decision , which was rendered in accordance with its pledges , I caught the first steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto myself a wife , and embarked with her for the Sandwich Islands , November 12 , on the good ship Congaree . Our " wedding journey " of five months at sea , without sight of land , I cowmend to all young married couples as the most efficient method of getting acquainted with each other . After the usual perils and pleasures of a Cape Horn passage , we arrived , April 8 , off Diamond Head , the whole cost of my embassy to the court of St. James and return having amounted to $1995 95-in firewood-an account which would compare quite favorably , I imagine , with those of other royal ambassadors . Neither the king 's finances nor my own private means justified any display on the occasion of his ambassador 's successful return , but he sent his own double canoe to bring my bride and myself on shore , where we were received with open arms and cordial greeting by the king and all loyal to his cause . The news of the success of my embassy had , of course , been anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own emotions were unutterable on again seeing the Hawaiian flag floating over the palace and the shipping . On landing , the first news I learned was that Admiral Thomas , in command of the English squadron in the Pacific , had hastened down immediately on receiving Lord Paulet 's dispatches , and the urgent letters of his old friend Mr. Barron from Tepic , and had restored the islands on the 31st of July , 1843 , to the sovereignty of their rightful king , with imposing ceremonies. * Amidst the boom of cannon from all the *vessels in the harbor , including the Carysfort , the British flag was lowered , and the Hawaiian colors hoisted on every available flag-staff in the city , the British landing and saluting them . Admiral Thomas was , however , too careful of British interests and his own position to give up the islands except as " pending the decision of the British government , " and meanwhile took up his residence in Honolulu , ready to seize them again if such should be his orders . England herself lingered over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France would not run off with the bon morceau if she dropped it . The consul-general appointed by England , General Miller , arrived in due time at the islands , and succeeding events amply proved the wisdom of our desire to have the questions in dispute settled before his coming . The one point left open by the decisions of the Foreign Office took years to settle , roused much ill feeling , and was not finally adjusted according to the facts , in the opinion of those longest conversant with them , though the consulgeneral did the best that could be expected of a stranger in his position . Mr. Alexander Simpson retired , after the failure of his magnificent schemes , into the Highlands of Scotland , and there disappeared from public view after writing a book of bitter denunciation of the British government for letting this brilliant prize slip through the fingers into which he had drawn it , and , as he said in a letter to the London Times , " putting more faith in the representations of a Yankee shop-keeper than in those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hawaiian Island.s , Second Edition , p. 183.
