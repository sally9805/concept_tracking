txt The Philadelphia Musical Association is determined to make a big fight against the importation of alien musicians , notwithstanding a clause in the Congressional bill which reads , " Nor shall the provisions of this act apply to professional actors , artists , lecturers , or singers . " A number of the officers of the association to-day expressed themselves as being confident that they would be successful in the pending suit against William E. Braun , lessee of Ridgeway Park , charged with making contracts with musicians abroad for their services here during the summer . One of the prominent officers of the organization said : " We hold , that these musicians do not come under the exception clause of the law . They are classed as artisans , and not as artists or professionals . The law would not apply to Patti or Nilsson , but it does apply to common laboring musicians who work hard 10 hours a day for a nominal sum . The term laborer is a broad one and has long since ceased to be confined to one who carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule the foreigners out ? " For their own good and for the good of American musicians . For their own good because they are deceived . They get $10 per week . In Germany , where these contracts are made$ , 10 per wee6 sounds like a good salary , but when they come here they pay four times as much for everything as they ao at home , and they never return the second time . " The association is thoroughly organized , and it has been working at this suit some time . A few months ago a committee tried to get an in- 1 junction in New-York , but the Judge held the law to be unconstitutional . No such decision is expected in the higher courts . The association claims that these musicians who thus contract in advance to come here are , as a rule , of an inferior order of ability . In order to promote art it is best to debar all such low priced and inferior talent from coming . Three-fourths of the musicians of this city are members of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can belong to an orchestra of non-union musicians . There is not an orchestra in the city which is not composed of the members of the association . William E. Braun , lessee of the Ridgeway Park . has defended himself against the charge that the contract was made in Europe , and his counsel will also claim that the law does not apply to musicians .
