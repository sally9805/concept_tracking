txt This Sunday night there was a sad scene at the Morgue . The body of Mary Weilde , a bright German girl of 17 , lay there . A few weeks ago she lived happily at home with her parents , who own a large grocery store at No. 819 South Second-street . Then Theodore Steber , a young baker , came along , and , after a short acquaintance , prevailed upon Mary to run away from home and live with him as his wife and sweetheart . The two got along so well together that Mary 's parents were left unacquainted with her new home , and saw nothing of her until Sunday , two weeks ago . At that time she came to the house of her father , and , finding no one but her mother at home , unhosomed herself . She said she had been enticed away from home under a promise of marriage , and that she had lived happily until that day , when Steber had told her that he was not going to marry her , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her any longer . Hearing this much she had ran away from him , and had only come home to beg her mother 's forgiveness and to tell her that she no longer wanted to live , but was going to drown herself . Before the mother could grant forgiveness or take her child back to her arms , the latter fled from the house . The mother followed , screaming to her daughter to come back . The poor girl ran down Poplar-street , with several persons running after her . As she crossed the railroad track on the levee an engine attached to a long train of freight cars came along and separated her from those who were in pursuit . After the train had passed the girl was looked for , but no trace of her was found . All but her mother believed it a case of suicide , but the latter clung to the theory that the girl was alive and had returned to her lover . A lot of boatmen out in the river this afternoon saw the girl 's body floating along , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgue . The police had a description of the girl , and they recognized her ' and then called in the mother and father . Since the girl 's disappearance Steber has also been missing , and some of his friends think he was overcome with remorse at his own action and took the same route as his unfortunate victim .
