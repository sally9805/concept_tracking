txt Yesterdny boring operations for the great artesian well on the grounds of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company were temporarily suspended . Jonn H. Hogan , the contractor , has gone to Bradford , Penn .. to get tools with which to remove the obstruction which the drill has encountered . It is thought that this consists of one or more pieces of iron thrown into the deep hole by some parties maliciously inclined . Hogan is a Bradford oil well driller . It is said that not less than $20,000 have been expended in boring the hole , from which as yet no flow of water has been obtained . It was the intention of the Winchester Arms Company to go down into the earth deep enough to secure a flowing well , This would make them independent of the water company for their water supply . A contract was made with Mr. Hogan to do the boring . lie commenced la months ago , an engine being used to work the drill . Hock of the red sandstone order was met with a short distance below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way through this material ever since . The hole is now 2,500 feet , or nearly half a mile , deep , and still there is no water . When this stratum of sand stone is pierced , however , Mr. Hogan is confident that water will bubble up plentifully from the 8-inch orifice which his drill has burrowed into the earth . When Mr. Hogan bad got down but a few hundred feet a portion of the drilling apparatus dropped into the hole , and as it could not be grappled with , and thus drawn up , nearly six months was consumed in boring through it . The present obstruction Mr. Hogan does not propose to deal with in the same way , on account of the greater depth at which it is located . If the grappling apparatus which he has gone to Bradford to obtain does not work successfully , in removing the obstacle which clogs up the well he will abandon the job .
