THE PEOPLE 'S PROBLEM . II . A PEOPLE ' S GOVERNMENT . THE argument of the preceding paper was to this effect : The purpose of the people in framing our present political system was to create what they thought would be a People 's Government , under which , as the phrase is , the people should govern themselves-should keep power in their own hands . The main idea which led them to form that purpose was that they could not trust their public officials . The main features of the system which they framed on that idea ( as those features have developed ) are : election districts have become very large ; elective offices have become very many ; and elections are very frequent . The particular results which have followed from these features are : we have a great mass of election work ; this election work is so large that it can not be done by men who have other occupations ; it falls , therefore , into the hands of professionals ; these professionals capture our public offices ; they keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they naturally and necessarily have grown into large organizations , with able leaders and thorough discipline ; naturally and necessarily , too , as must always be the case with large bodies of men , the action of // these large organizations is controlled by their leaders . The general result which has followed from those features of our system is : our public officials , instead of being elected by the people , are appointed by the election organizations ; instead of serving the people , they serve the election organizations ; instead of using our public offices and public moneys for the people , they use them for the election organizations ; instead of obeying the will of the people , they obey the will of the election organizations ,  - -  in short , we have , not a government , but an election machine . There is the disease . But then come the questions , What is the remedy ? And how is the remedy to be applied ? In the present paper , an attempt will be made to answer the first of these questions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remedy must go to the root of the disease , and not play with the symptoms . The disease comes , if the diagnosis is correct , in the main from constitutional defects in our system of government , from a wrong use of the process of election , and the use of a wrong form of that process . The treatment , then , must be directed to those constitutional defects . In the compass of this paper necessarily only an outline of a system can be given , for the purposes of thought and discussion . In the attempt to outline such a system of government , it will be necessary to con-sider : i . What a people 's government is ; 2 . The main features of a system framed to give us a people 's government ; 3 . The results which a system so framed would give ; 4 . The reasons why the system would give us those results . I. A people 's government is an organization for doing the people 's common work , according to the people 's common will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What this common work is , is not within the line of the present argument . This common work is to be done , as most Americans will agree , not according to the will of any one man or class of men , but according to the common will of the whole people . And it must be done , not " by th' people " ( for that means nothing ) , but by the hands of their servants-by men specially selected , in some way , for the special work they are to do . The people can at most select and control , directly or indirectly , the men who are to do their common work . II . We come , then , to the statement of the main features of a system framed to give us a people 's government . One point of objection had best be met here . It is often said that governments can not be constructed on paper-that they must grow . Governments do , indeed , grow ; but how do they grow ? This National Government under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the way in which its growth began . So it was , too , with our State governments . And shall we have our governments grow wild ? How do governments get the best growth-without or with the hand and thought of man ? The American method , the scientific method , the common-sense method , is first to draft a scheme of government on paper , as the first stage of its growth ; then to think of it , discuss it , and change it ; then to enact it , or make it into a constitution ; and after that , when time develops faults , when faults grow , then to devise such changes in the scheme as will meet the faults . But it has never been the method of the American people to say that " nothing can be done . " As the next stage , then , in the growth of our system of government , let us see if we can not work out on paper some of the main features of a people 's government . These features are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i . All political action , by more men than on ' * , should be taken by men meeting and acting as one body-giving to every man one voice . The meaning of this is , that citizens would act in their own persons only in the affairs of towns , or of small districts where the numbers of the citizens are not too large for them to nieet and act as one body . In all other public action , whether as to the affairs of cities , counties , States , or the nation , whether it be the choice of public officers or the adoption of public measures , whenever the numbers of the citizens who are to act are too large for them to meet and act as one body , then they should act by delegates . This is , as it seems to me , the key-stone of the political arch , the fact which lies at the very foundation of popular government . Its especial importance is in its application to the process of election . And its application to the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large city , or a large district , or a State , casting their ballots // directly for a mayor , or a member of the State legislature , or a governor , or a presidential elector , or a representative to Congress , the citizens in each small election district ( which should , as a rule , have not more than five hundred voters ) would meet in one place , as one body , at one time , and vote for a member of an electoral convention-an elector . This voting by the citizens should be done on a call of names , each citizen giving his vote aloud at the call of his name . And , to insure greater deliberation and greater unanimity , a two-thirds vote rather than a majority , as it seems to me , should be required for a choice . The delegates thus chosen to an electoral convention would in their turn meet , as one body , at one time and place , and would elect the mayor , or member of the State legislature , or governor , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once seen that , in some instances , it would become necessary , on account of the large number of voters , to use an intermediate convention ( or it might be more than one ) to choose the members of the final electoral convention , which should elect the officer himself . That would depend on the size of the voting constituencies . Each successive convention should , as to its membership , be kept , as to numbers , within the limit which will secure deliberate action . That limit seems to be about five hundred men . It may add clearness to the statement of the plan proposed to give one illustration of its working , with the figures . In electing a President of the United States , for instance , the number of citizens entitled each to his one voice in the choice of his President is , taking it roughly , nine millions . If we make the number of the electors who vote directly for the President , in the final col ) vention , three hundred , that would give ninety thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If then , each of these distriits of ninety thousand voters were divided into small districts having each two hundred and fifty voters , there would be three hundred and sixty of these small election districts , each of which would have one delegate in the convention which should choose the presidential elector . The reasons in favor of such a system , especially for elections , are these : ( a ) The system is simple and practical . It is the system which is , in form , used for the nomination of candidates  --  a system which has grown , which has been called into existence , without the aid of any enactment , by a living and growing need . It is the system which the national party organiz*itions have been compelled to adopt in order to get any common action of their members . It is , in substance , the system which the framers of our national Constitution supposed they had adopted for the election of the President . Bu* they overlooked the necessity of having the electoral college of presidential electors meet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of population , and the consequent increased numbers of popular constituencies . ( b ) This system is the only way in which we can secure a common judgment of the people , as to men or measures . The result which we wish to secure by any political action , where the action is by more men than one , is the judgment of those men , and not merely their choice between two lists of names or two measures prepared by the hands of others . And we wish to get , not a mere declaration of the individual judgments of the single men who make up the body , but the common judgment of the whole body . And that common judgment can be had only by a meeting , a conference , of the men who are to act , where each man can be heard , and can hear other men ; where each man can change his own opinion , and change the opinions of other men ; where men and measures can be discussed on their merits ; where a common judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two , or three individuals-a new thing-can grow and take form ; where new combinations can be made , on the spot , and at the time ; where it will be impossible for a small knot of men.to force a vote for some one man or measure , as a mere choice between two evils , simply because it is then too late to combine on any other man or measure . This method of having the citizens ot each small election district meet and choose their one delegate to cast their collective vote will secure , as far as any system can , the common judgment of the whole people . The result of the action of the delegate may not be , in all respects , what any individual citizen would most wish . But it will be a result to which , as a whole , all the citizens can agree . The delegates , if there be a reasonably large number of them , will be as sure as any body of men can be to represent fairly the common opinion of the citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a large number of citizens in a large district vote , as to men or measures , without any opportunity for conference , they may indeed assent to the action of some other men , but ther action can not be , in any correct sense , their own common judgment . ( c ) This system is the only way in which we can secure to every man his one voice , and his full weight . Whenever men meet for common a*ction , and have an opportunity for conference , every man will have his one voice ; he can vote for any man he may wish to vote for , can give his reasons for it , and have his opportunity to influence other men . We shall secure , as far as any system can , that every man will be weighed at his true worth . The rich man who has won his wealth honestly , by honest work , will have great weight in the public councils . The same points of character which have given him wealth will give him influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sound , practical sense , even if he be not a man of great pecuniary means , will surely have power in these citizens ' meetings and representative conventions . The proposal to restrict the right to vote according to a property standard is not for the best interests of either rich or poor . With such restrictions the moneyed men would have too much power for their own good . They could not be secure against its misuse . A property qualification with us is neither practicable nor sound on principle . The rich man of to-day is the poor man of tomorrow . But the man himself does not suddenly change . His voice in public affairs is , in itself worth as much the day after he loses his money as the day before , though it will not have the same tone or power-will not be heard as far . If men meet together , talk together , and act together , every man in the long run will have his just *veight in public affairs ; and in no oti er way can that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only way in which we can secure to the people the free choice of their public servants . Any system of election which requires the citizens , in a district so large as to make it impossible for them to meet and act as one body , to vote directly for public officers , necessarily makes it certain that they must adopt some nomination which has been made beforehand . The necessary result is that we turn the process of election by the whole people into that of nomination by a few men . If , in addition , we have many elective officers , and have frequent elections , the certain result is that we take from the people the choice of their public servants , and create a permanent class of self-appointed office-holders . I do not mean that there will not be , from time to time , some change in the individuals who manage the election organizations . Single men , here and there , will for special reasons cease to be useful to the election machines , and will therefore be dropped from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues ' * and party names , the old familiar faces will meet us at every turn , changing from time to time the names and " platforms " of their organizations , always keeping before our eyes a due proportion of the grand old platitudes about liberty and free suffrage , and will reappoint themselves from year to year under the form of popular election . ( e ) This system will secure , as surely as any system can , the selection for the people 's service of the people 's best and wisest men . We have nothing of that kind nowand for the reason that the people do not make their own choice . But how would it be under the system here proposed ? Take the case of the election of a representative to Congress from a district of thirty thousand voters . Suppose the number of small election districts were one hundred , giving an average of three hundred voters to each small election district . These three hundred men meet together and have to choose a delegate to an electoral convention . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are personally known to one another . In the rural districts , nearly all of them would be life-long acquaintances . These men know that they are really taking a substantial part in the selection of the men who are to tax them , and have the control of their property-of all their public affairs . Very certainly it will be no unknown man who will receive a two-thirds vote , or a simple majority vote , of those citizens who are met together to choose their delegate . They will be certain to choose men who have a reputation , of some kind . But there are only two classes of men in a community who have reputations  --  the men who have good reputations and the men who have bad ones ; and , in the very large majority of instances , the reputations are just . XVhen , then , in the local meetings , a delegate is to be selected by the agreement of two-thirds or one-half of the citizens // present , what manner of man is it that they will choose ? One or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not say that , in such cases , the people would never be deceived , but , in a very large majority of instances , the man who would be thus chosen by a real vote of the people would be a man long and widely known for his honorable life . When the delegates should meet in convention , though each man might be influenced by his personal prejudices , yet they would have to agree on some one . And they will not agree on a man unknown . Neither will they agree on a man known for his bad deeds . Again , in the very large majority of instances , their vote will be for a man known , and widely known , for his honorable life . The wider the district becomes from which the delegates assemble , the wider will be the reputation of the man who can command their voices . When we come to a convention of delegates from a whole State , or from the whole country , the choice of a public officer by such a convention will , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he will very certainly be a man of great ability , and honesty . For those delegates will be as free as men can be from improper influences . Each one of them will have his own private interests and prejudices . But these will neutralize one another . It can not be said that an unfit man would never be chosen by such a convention , but we make the chance of such a thing as small as any system can make it . Each successive stage in the ascending series of conventions will tend more and more to separate the delegates from local and improper influences . They will be as favorably situated as men can be for giving us a wise and upright choice of men . The men who would be chosen to our national Congress or to our State legislatures under such a system would be very certain to be the ablest and wisest men among us . And the common action , the action approved by the common judgment , of such a body of men , as to either men or measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better thing , than the individual thought and action of nine out of ten of the individuals who make up the body . This is the method of the old town-meeting , of the Convention which framed our national Constitutionthat " most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man , " as Mr. Gladstone says . It is a method which gives us the best result that a people is capable of reaching . We should get , in sober truth , the distilled essence of the wisdom of the whole people . This stream would rise higher than its source . This force of gravitation would work upward , and not downward . The ablest and most honest men would rise to the top , as they always do when things are free , when nature 's forces are allowed to o.perate under nature 's laws . To group the arguments in favor of this return to the simple methods of the old town-meeting and the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , they are these : A system so framed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can secure a common judgment of the people , as to men or measures ; it is the only way in which we can secure to each man his one voice and his full weight ; it is the only way in which we can secure to the people the free choice of their public servants ; it will secure , as surely as any system can , the selection for the people 's service of the people 's best and wisest men . Can more than that be said of our present system ? 2 . The people should act , in their own persons , only in the local affairs of the small districts , where they can meet and act as one body . This has been argued . It is separately stated for the sake of completeness . 3 . In all other than the local affairs of these small districts , the people should act by delegates . This has been argued . It is separately stated for the sake of completeness . * . Each man and each public body , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national governments , should have work of only one kind . Especially the men who have to do with executive administration should have nothing to do with general supervision  --  the work of the legislature . And the men in the legislature should have nothing to do with the details of administration , especially with appointments to executive offices . Either work needs different men , with different training , and requires the undivided time and efforts of the men who are to do it . A public servant , if he is to do his work well , can not be a man-of-all-work . Here is one of the main defects in our present system of government , and in what is called parliamentary government . Both those systems compel the chief public officials to give much of their time and thought to election work and the keeping their places . But , aside from // that point , under what is called parliamentary government , the men who are at the head of executive departments are compelled to give their energies chiefly to work in the legislature . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend for keeping their executive positions . The consequence is that their executive work is done , in the main , by subordinates-in other words , it is substantially not done at all . The work of organizing is left undone . For subordinates can not organize ; they can never be the strong , moving will and brain of administration . The men who are to organize and supervise the executive departments can not , if that work is to be well done , have on them also the burden of work in a legislature . Mr. Gladstone , who is , in his way , one of the great men of his time , is gradually breaking down under the attempt to do two kinds of work , both of which no one man can do , and for one of which he is not fitted , either by temper or training . He is a great , impetuous parliamentary orator ; he is not an administrator . The two powers are seldom combined in one man . In order to have an illustration of the methods of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of the British War Office . Sir James Stephen , as long ago as in 1847 , said that if a European war occurred , the British War Office would " utterly break down . " And the prophecy came true in the first war that Great Britain afterward had  --  the war of the Crimea . A military correspondent of the London " Times " has lately written that the British army " is in a state of collapse . " During the present disturbances in Ireland , the War Office of the British Government has proved unequal to the work of supplying and moving quickly a force of less than one thousand men . Even the British navy is not managed on sound professional principles . An English admiral , Admiral Lord Dunsany , in the " Nineteenth Century , " May , i88i , has just given us the exact statement of the situation . He writes : " The truth is , our navy is a House of Commons navy , ' devised to suit financial , or , as the French would say , budgetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body profoundly ignorant of all military and technical considerations . " British ministers are almost always men who are ignorant of matters of administration . They are selected on other tests . They are House of Commons men . They are able men , if they were in the right place , but they are out of place . That is the reason why the British army has been , in the language of Sir Garnet Wolseley , " unworthy of being classed as a fighting implement fit to be employed against an enemy more formidable than a Kaffir or an Asiatic . " Navies should be managed by sailors , armies by soldiers , postal affairs by trained postal officers , foreign affairs by diplomates , and a gre*tt House of Commons orator-should stay in the House of Commons . 5 . The only elective officers should be the chief executive , and the members of the supreme supervisory body-which we commonly call the legislature . This is intended to apply to city , State , *and national governments alike , as are all the general principles here laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only elective executive official . He should be the responsible head of all city executive administration . He should appoint and remove the head of each executive department . In the same way , in a State , the governor should be the only elective executive official . He should be the responsible head of all State executive administration , of every kind , - canals , schools , prisons , and public charities . He should appoint and remove the head of every executive department . So it should be , too , as in law it now is , with the President of the United States . There are two main reasons for this : The first is , that the appointment and removal of every official throughout the executive administration , from the very top to the very bottom , should be in the hands of his immediate superior ; for he is the only man in a position to judge wisely of the fitness of the subordinate . The second is , that this rule would diminish greatly the number of elective offices , and , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would take from the people the burden of nominally electing a large number of officials as to whose fitness they can not possibly have knowledge . 6 . In executive administration each kind of work should be in the hands of one man . And each officer should have the appointment and removal of his own immediate subordinates . This is a point which all practical men of affairs well appreciate . To secure efficiency , we must have the responsibility of one man . And to secure the responsibility of one man , we must put power in the hands of one man . Each single office must be under one control , each division and department // must have one head , and all the departments , if we are to have system and organization , must be under the control of one chief executive . Each superior must have the appointment and removal of his subordinates , and each subordinate must be under the control of his immediate superior . This is just as true of national and State administration as it is of the administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work to be done by men . We must be able to centralize public opinion . There must be , as to each piece of work , one single official , who may get the honor of good work , and on whom we may heap the odium of bad work . Men say that it is unsafe to trust power in one hand : it is much more unsafe to divide it . Our greatest security with all officials under any proper system is in the power of public opinion . But public opinion must be able to find its object quickly , if it is to strike . 7 . Each man in the service should be selected for fitness-for his one work . But under our Constitution , and under what is called parliamentary government , the chief officers of the people are in fact selected for their fitness for election work . The chief places in the executive administration are put up as a prize , to be fought for in an election contest , to be won by the most skillful election workers . XVith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great national campaign once in four years between two national armies , with smaller local battles each year , which serve to keep the troops always under arms , and in a high state of discipline . Under the English system , the contest is carried on in the House of Commons , between two champions , the decision as to who is the winner being given by vote of the House , with an occasional appeal " to the country . " And on the European Continent it is a never-ending scramble for place , between small factions . With us in the United States it is government by campaign , in England it is government by prize fight , on the Continent it is government by rne*/te - and , with all of us , government by election machine . The science of war by election has , with us , reached the highest stage of development yet recorded . The civilized nations of Europe are slowly toiling onward in our path of progress . M. Gambetta in France and Mr. Chamberlain in England are , consciously or unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fitness for election work will be the test by which public officials will be selected , for local as well as national administration . 8 . Every man in the service should be removable at once-for his own failure to do well his one work . What we must secure is the responsibility of individuals for the work of individuals . But under our system of short ferms , with a large number of elective offices , many of which become vacant at the same time , we lose sight of individuals , and see only the great organizations , to which the individuals profess allegiance . It is always a question of " platforms , " almost never a question of whether this man or that man has given good administration . But this attempt to mass responsibility destroys it . What we must have is a system which will , in city affairs , secure at the head of one department responsibility for that one department , and at the head of the whole city administration responsibility for the whole administration . When we come to State affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons , canals , and our State finances . And x* hen we come to national affairs , we wish at the head of each department responsibility for that one department ; and with the President of the United States , we wish responsibility , not for opinions , or platforms , or " grand cld principles , " before election , but for administrative results after election . We wish , not a " policy , " but performance  --  a thorough supervision and efficient management of our executive administration . This responsibility for working results , as the experience of many centuries has shown , can be secured in only one way , and that is , by the summary removal of all ireflicient men . Removing men at the end of four years , or of one year , does not serve our needs . The removal must be immediate , if it is to have any good effect on the other men in the service . And if we wait till the next general election , there is a great possibility that the man will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to enforce responsibility , remove the right man , the one who makes the failure , and not remove one man for the failure of another , or the heads of twenty departments for the failure of one , or a constitutional adviser because his chief will not take his advice . We must , too , make the removal for the right thing . We must not remove the head of the War Office for a blunder in the House // 577 of Commons , nor for a failure to do good election work . And this power of removal must exist as to the chief executive , as well as subordinates-the mayor of a city , the governor of a State , and the President of the United States . The chief is the man we must deal with . And he should be removed for the right reason-for a failure to give good administration-by a two-thirds vote of the supre*ne legislative body . Members of the supreme body would be removable , as they now are , by vote of the body itself . 9 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there are vacancies . It should not be used constantly , at fixed periods , in the fruitless attempt to thereby enforce responsibility . But that is what we have really been trying to do under our system as it now stands . We have been acting on the belief that by electing men frequently we secured their responsibility to the people . It secures only responsibility to the election machine . Aggregate removal by aggregate election is not a sound political process . Removal of individuals for individual faults is the only way in which responsibility can be enforced . To talk of the responsibility of a " party " is like talking of the responsibility of the whole collective human race . in . For supreme supervision and control , there should be the one common judgment and will of the whole people . This common judgment and will of the whole people must be uttered , as to the local affairs of the small districts , where citizens can meet and act as one body , by the citizens themselves ; as to city , county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their chosen delegates . This is the only way , as has been shown , in which such a thing as a common judgment of the whole people can be had . If we try , as to the affairs of a city , a State , or of the whole nation , to have that common judgment uttered at the polls , by the citizens themselves , nine millions of them , through periodical elections , we get , not the people 's voice , only a collection of paper ballots . The hand may be the hand of the people , but the voice is the voice of the election maclime. i i . Every political act should be open . Above all , let the vote of the individual be open . No man should be allowed to vote who has not the courage to have his vote known . Secret voting by ballot is the pet device of the professional corruptionist . Here , as everywhere , publicity is the essential to honest action . We say we wish " responsible government . " Let responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his individual action . We shall then soon make the purchase of votes impossible . I 2 . Time and quiet must be had to secure a healthy political growth . Our present political system , taking it at its theoretical best , is a system of government , by revolution , at regular periods . Parliamentary government , taking it also at its theoretical best , is a system of government , by revolution , at irregular periods . The theory of each system is that one group of men is to control public affairs for a time , and that then , if the people are dissatisfied with their control , there shall be a clearing out of the men who are at the heads of all the executive departments . Changing a large number of subordinates would be comparatively harmless ; but we are continually changing the men at the head . We might as well keep changing a man 's brain , and hope for vigorous and healthy life . Mere automatic action of the extremities is not enough in political organisms . We must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a series of revolutions , but a system which allows steady growth , a gradual renewal of single organs , as they die or become useless  --  a system where single men can be weeded out , and new men can be brought in , as the needs of the service require , instead of having these annual and quadrennial earthquakes and avalanches . We must have government by evolution , not government by revolution . Men must have time  --  to find their places , to learn what their work is and how to do it , to do their work after they learn it , to find new work to be done , and new ways of doing it . Men must have time  --  to become adjusted one to another , to grow into a living and working organization . The organization must have timefor its leaders to be found , for them to grow . The organizers at the head must have time  --  to find the worth of the men under them , and to train their successors . Abuses , even , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true remedies . This perpetual turmoil of elections , where year after year we go through the empty form of placing in a box a list of names of men we do not know , put in our hands by men whom we do not respect , may have for some men in the community certain // pecuniary advantages . But it is not government . The conclusion of this branch of the argument , then , is this : In order to secure a people 's government , in order to have the people 's common work done according to the people 's common will , we must have a system with these main features : i . All political action , by more men than one , should be taken by men meeting and acting as one body-giving to every man one voice . 2 . The people should act in their own persons only in the local affairs of the small districts , where they can meet and act as one body . 3 . In all other than the local affairs of the small districts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each public body in the service should have work of only one kind . * . The only elective officers should be the chief executive , and the members of the legislatures. 6 . In executive administration each work should be in the hands of one man ; and each officer should have the appointment and removal of his own immediate subordinates . 7 . Each man in the service should be selected for fitness-for his one work . 8 . Every man in the service should be removable at once-for his failure to do his one work . * . The process of election should be used only to fill vacancies , when there are vacancies . It should not be used constantly , at fixed periods , in the fruitless attempt thereby to enforce responsibility . 10 . For supreme supervision and control , there should be the one common judgment and will of the whole people . ii . Every political act should be open . 12 . Time and quiet must be had to secure a healthy political growth . III . And what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let two points be understood . It is not intended that the system here set forth is the one which we must adopt . It has already been said that this problem of the people is too large a one for any one man to deal with . What is here submitted is given only by way of suggestion  --  to draw out other schemes and discussion , so that in the end we can work out a true solution of the problem before us . Nor is it expected that , under any system that can be devised , there will be no imperfections or abuses . The aim here is to find some remedy for those abuses that we now see . Others will , no doubt , arise under any system which we may adopt . But these we already know . These we must deal with as well as we can . So much being premised , let us , as far as we can , forecast the probable working of the scheme here proposed . i . This system would make things free . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the chief control of their public affairs . It meets directly the disturbing causes in our present system . It does away with the large election districts , restores the old town-meeting , as the basis of all national and State as well as local government-makes the town-meeting , as it were , the single cell of political organization . The system also lessens greatly the amount of election work to be done , and leaves no official dependent on the carrying of the next election for his present support or future advancement . Moreover , as far as any system can , it makes it impossible for any band of men , by any possible completeness of combination , to arrange beforehand the result of an election . Any combination for that purpose would have to capture the whole people . And there is only one thing that can capture the whole people , and that is a great reputation . 2 . It would specialize , instead of centralize , the different powers in the government . Under our present system of frequent elections , by direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election machines get the control of everything , of local as well as national affairs . If , on the contrary , as is here proposed , we decrease the number of elections and elective offices , decrease the size of election districts , and make the national , State , and local elections distinct , by having distinct electoral conventions , we shall separate the administration of national , State , and local affairs , one from the others , as far as they can be , and as far as they should be . * . The system would enforce the responsibility of public servants . That is , it would provide the means for removing single individuals for their single failures to do their single work , as soon as the failure took place . And it would place the power to make this removal , as to each executive official , in the hands of the one man who would be best fitted to use it , and who would have a stronger motive than any other man or body of men to use the power // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system where power is trusted in the hands of single men , when affairs go wrongly , then public opinion is at once centered on the man who has the power . He is driven to use his power of removal of his subordinate in self-defense . He gets all the odium which comes from the bad work , and all the praise for the good work , which is done by the men under him . He might , no doubt , misuse his power . But all the inducements would be in favor of his using his power wisely . But now the inducements are , in the main , in favor of his using his power unwisely and corruptly. * . It would promote the efficiency of the public service . Again , it is the tendencies of the system with which we are dealing . With us , and with every free people , a very great number of our best men have a strong wish to go into public life . It was so in the early days of the country , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best men in public life . The best men for the public service will be drawn into it , if they are not kept out by some abnormal condition of things , such as we now have . And men once in the service will find their right places in due time , if the operation of natural laws is not checked by some foreign force , like that of the election machine . And the men in the service will learn how to do their work , and will do it from mere pride , which is for most men a sufficient motive , if they are not compelled , by some foreign pressure , to give their main efforts to other things . Even the men that we now have in our public offices-selected , as they are , on a false test-in the main serve us as well as they can , under all the disadvantages of the system under which they labor . If they were only as fairly placed as the men in any of our great private business establishments ,  - -  if they were only sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their work ,  --  they would soon become an efficient organization of working-men . But all the prizes go to the men who manage caucuses and conventions . Instead of being sure of their places , our public officials may at any moment be removed , to make way for some man who has counted ballots at a disputed election . Under this system here proposed , the pressure begins at the top , where it must begin to have an efficient service . The chief executive will be a man chosen by the whole people , on a free vote . He will very cer tainly be a man who has already shown administrative talent . Very probably he would be a man who had already distinguished himself in the public service . Above him would be a body of men who would have the power to remove him , at any time , in case his administration of affairs were not satisfactory . It would be very certain that they would not agree to remove him , by a two-thirds vote , if his administration were able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be certain of holding his position , and of gaining a great reputation among a great people . All his influences and surroundings would be in favor of his giving us the best management of affairs that he could . If he should try to appoint favorites to office , he would at once injure the working of the force under him . He would arouse opposition everywhere . He would concentrate on himself alone the combined hostility , of the people , who wish their affairs well managed ; of the men above him , who would feel the effects of his misconduct ; of the men under him , who would be angry at having the places , which should be used to reward them for honest service , used for his selfish purposes . Moreover , he would have time to become known . If he were a man who should try to use his power for his own gain , he would not do so in single instances only ; the abuses would be many ; the hatred of the people would have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot to hold him . But now , we simply wait till the next election . We have no time to work out the real remedy . We leave it to time to bring the remedy for us , which time never does . * . This system would purify the public service . Under this system , we should begin to purify the public service at the top . We should have in our supreme body an assembly of men who would , as far as men could , be free from any inducement to use their power wrongly . They would be men in very high station , with slight possibility of any further political advancement . The chief executive would be under every possible influence to act honestly and wisely . He would be in the highest position he could reach . There would be , with them and him , the possibility of lasting disgrace if they were dishonest , and the certainty of great fame if they did what was right . To make men honest , or as honest as they can be , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certainty of de // tection in case of any wrong-doing . Under our present system we have no thorough supervision . For we keep changing the men at the head . They have neither the time nor the motive to learn thoroughly what is done by the men under them . But this thorough supervision and certainty of detection exists in all large , well-ordered private establishments . For , in every large business , work must be so subdivided that each man has his work brought into contact at many points with other men . He can not be dishonest or inefficient without making a disturbance in other departments . The larger the business , the more sure is this result ; and our public business is the largest in the land . 6 . The system would embody and enforce the people 's will . Many thoughtful men would have the fear that the system proposed would give us a bureaucracy ,  --  what is sometimes called an aristocracy of permanent office-holders ,  - -  who would lose their sympathy with the best thought and feeling of the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true that most of the men who once entered our public service would probably be there for the whole of their lives . But they would not all stay in the same places . Seventeen of Napoleon 's marshals rose from the ranks . So it would be in a well-ordered civil service . It would be a body full of life and energy , where the strong men would rise to the highest places , where there would be a perpetual struggle for advancement . In every well-ordered industry we have what is , in one sense , a life tenure-that is , most men who are good workers follow the calling which they have chosen through their lives . But the faithful workers do not stay in one position ; they rise . As to such a system giving us a bureaucracy : The thing which is really meant by this word is an irresponsible bureaucracyan army of officials appointed by an irresponsible ruler , who uses the places in his service to pension his personal adherents . In such a state of things , stagnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist under a responsible government . As to such a system giving us a permanent aristocracy of office-holders : If our public service is to be efficient , we always shall have , under any system , a permanent class of office-holders . XVe have it now . The question with us is , whether these permanent office-holders shall be our best men , or those who gain and keep their places by the manipulation of an election machine . As to such a system causing our public officials to lose their sympathy with the popular thought and feeling : How much sympathy with popular thought and feeling do we find in our public men *now ? The system under which they are placed in power , and are kept there , makes it impossible for them to regard the people 's real wishes . On the contrary , under the simple , natural system here proposed , what would be the situation ? The men who would be sent to our State and national legislatures would generally be men well advanced in life . I'heir periods of service would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The members would be continually changing . New blood would be always coming in . There would always be a large number of experienced men to give character and stability to the policy pursued . The new men , as they were elected , would be in harmony with the prevailing tone of thought of the day in the districts from which they came . All the members , new and old , would be always learning and thinking . Instead of being behind the thought of the age , they would lead it . These men would very certainly be men of commanding ability , men like Webster , Calhoun , and Clay  --  the great men of the day , who have the confidence of the people . Would an assembly so made up be one of intellectual stagnation ? Or would such men embark in wild schemes of political piracy , and endeavor to subvert the people 's liberties ? Such men would have their own ideas . It might even be , that some of them would try to use their public places to forward their private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those men could be . And some one we must trust , otherwise government can not exist . We can not , by any machinery we may devise , secure that any body of public men shall continually trim to every shifting current of popular feeling . Nor do we wish that . We wish men , and not weather-cocks , in our public assemblies ; men who will use in our service their superior knowledge and abilities . We wish their judgment , and not our own . They can not fail to change their opinions with the times , being open to the same influences with other men . 7 . This system would give us a healthy national life and growth . We should be free . Now we are bound // 581 hand and foot . Every vote of the peol ) le , every act of our public men , bends to the needs and the power of the election organizations . The whole body politic is in the condition of a man whose every artery and vein are under a ligature . Wherever we try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of railroads , or canals , or customhouses , or carrying the mails , or the administration of justice , or of the public charities , we are m*t with this one overpowering pressure , which compels our public servants to use the public offices and treasuries to pay for election work . The scheme here outlined is an effort for freedom . It may be that this scheme is not wisely conceived . Then let us devise some other ; for we must do something . But the argument here is that the system here proposed is based on sound principles , and would give us an organization under which the l ) eople 's common work would be done according to the people 's common will , by the hands of the people 's common serv ants-that it would give us a People 's Government . IV . And the reason of this result would be , that we should make it for the individual interest of each man in the service to do his official work , instead of making it for the common interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , if a. man in our public service gives himself to the simple , honest discharge of his duty to the people , he signs his political death-warrant . Drivers of ash-carts and Presidents alike , we cornpel them to do caucus work , or leave our service . But even if this argument be sound , the question then comes : How are we to accomplish the change ? Especially , since we are now in the hands of this great power , which controls so many of our public men ,  --  which , in effect , disfranchises the people ,  --  .  - -  how can a way be devised to put the system into effect ? An attempt will be made , in the next paper , to answer this question .
