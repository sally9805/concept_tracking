txt Signor DEPRETIS , the Italian Prime Minister , who is about to withdraw from public life because of his advanced age , will take with him an enviable reputation . He has been three times at the head of the Cabinet , and has been continuously in publie life for more than a generation ; but his real reputation as a statesman has been made during the last five years . Up to that time he was regarded as a man of unusual ability ; but he was thought to be a skillful political manager rather than a true statesman . Soon after his last accession to power as Prime Minister , DEPRETIS recognized the fact that , as the representative of the Left , it was impossible for him to govern without displeasing either the moderate or the radical elements of his party , and in either case losing his Parliamentary majority . He thereupon came to an understanding with the moderate men of the Right , between whom and the moderate men of the Left there was no essential difference . This gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to free himself from the malign influence of the radical faction of the Left . He has since governed with intelligence and firmness , and while he has suppressed disorder and lightened taxation at home , he has made Italy universally respected abroad by a policy both peaceful and dignified . His withdrawal will be a loss to the country , and he will rank in history as the ablest Italian Prime Minister since CAVOUR . The cable intimates that Signor MANCIN . I will probably succeed DEPRETIS . This is hardly probable , as MANCINI is not popular with the Chamber , and should he be made Prime Minister he would probably remain in power but a short time . The supporters of DEPRETIS would do a - wise as well as a graceful act should they now give their support to Signor MINGHETTI , who , as the leader of the Right , has done so much to make the Depretis Ministry successful by the loyal support he has given to a lifelong political opponent .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
