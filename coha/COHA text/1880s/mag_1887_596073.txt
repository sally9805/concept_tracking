OWE VER odd the title of this article may seem , its implications are correct and legitimate . The undergraduates of American colleges , taking the socalled Rugby game of foot-ball , have developed it into a game differing in many of its phases from any of its English prototypes . There were already differences in the game in its primitive home . Kicking the ball was , of course , common to all ; but there was , further , the so-called Rugby game , whose leading feature , speaking roughly , was that the player might run with the ball ; there was the Association game , in which , speaking as roughly , the player might " charge , " that is , run against , an opponent and might not run with the ball ; and there were a dozen other variants of the game . The peculiar featureo* the Rugby game was the " scrimmage , " of which more will be said farther on ; and American players , working out the scrimmage into a new form , have changed the possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to its individual opportunities for the exhibition of skill , one of the most scientific of outdoor games in its " team-playing , " or management of the entire side as one body . It would be impossible , within the limits of this article , to enter into a technical explanation of the finer points of this team-play , or to give a minute statement of the rules of the game ; all that can be hoped for is to give him * ao witnesses the American game some general knowledge of it , so that he may follow it with intelligence and enjoyment . On entering the ground and securing his post of observation , the spectator will see before him a field 330 feet long and i6o feet wide . The shorter line is the " goal-line . " Across the field , at intervals of five yards , are white lines parallel to the goal-lines ; these are meant to guide the umpire in the imposition of penalties for fouls , off-side playing , or delaying the game , the penalty being commonly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // is in fault . In the middle of each goal-line is the " goal , " two upright posts 18 ' 2 feet apart with a cross-bar io feet from the ground . In order to score a goal , the ball must pass between the uprights and over the cross-bar , and must cross it from a " place-kick , " or from a " drop-kick , " - that is , from a kick made just as the ball is leaving the ground , not from a punt , " a kick made while the ball is in the air . Each side , while defending its own goal , necessarily faces the goal of its opponents , and its object is to advance the ball , by running with it or by kicking it , toward its opponents ' goal-line , to plant the ball on the ground on the other side of the opponents ' goal-line , which constitutes a " touch-down " and scores four points in the game , and to kick the ball over the cross-bar of the opponents ' goal or force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory .

One man , lying on the ground , holds the ball in proper position ; another , when the ball is dropped to the ground , kicks it ; ifthe ball goes over the cross-bar , it counts two points in addition to the four points for the touch-down , and , if the goal is missed , it counts nothing . A touch-down and a successful goal thus count together six points ; a goal kicked from the field , without a previous touch-down , counts five points ; and a " safety " touch-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feature in this process of advancing the ball which is most difficult for even the practiced eye to follow , and which will probably always remain a profound mystery to the unskillful , is the prohibition of " off-side playing. ** The general principle , however , is not difficult of comprehension : it is merely that no player has legal rights when he is between the ball and his opponents ' goal ; he is then " off-side " until the ball has touched an opponent , or one of his own side carries the ball ahead of him or runs in front of him , having touched the ball while behind him . So long as he is " offside , " a player must not interfere with the ball or with his opponents . The players of both sides are so continually on- and off-side that it is hardly possible to follow the process . A line of men comes charging down the field : the ball is kicked back over their heads , and they are all technically off-side . In an instant the ball is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entitled to play , since the ball has touched one of their opponents . The shifting is often so rapid and constant that the men themselves almost come to forget the prohibition until one of them happens to play RUNNING WITH TIlE BALL . // at a moment when he is off-side , and then the imposition of a penalty , the loss of five yards by his side , recalls him to a sense of the rules of the game . " Passing " the ball , or throwing it from one to another , is another feature of the game . Hardly any combination of team-playing and individual skill is more noteworthy than the sight of a first-rate team carrying the ball down the field , each player taking his turn in running with the ball , and , when hard pressed , passing it over the head of an opponent to one of his own side , more fortunately situated , who carries it farther . Considering that the eggshape of the ball makes it the concentrated essence of irregularity , that only the most skillful player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take after a bound , and that an error of but an inch in the direction of a throw may carry the ball a dozen feet away from the place at which it was aimed , one may be pardoned for admiring the certainty with which individuals and teams make each point of play and combine them all into an organized system . Passing has also its phase of off-side playing . A " pass forward " is not allowed , and is a foul ; tbe ball must be thrown straight across the field , parallel to the goal-line , or in any direction back of that line . Hitherto we have been looking at the game only from the standpoint of the side which is advancing the ball . It is not to be supposed that its opponents are idly watching the ball 's progress : it is their object to check the advance of the ball , and to retort by advancing it in their turn and toward their objective point ,  --  the opposite goal . One way of doing this is by a " faircatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly-catch , " of a kick or throw from an opponent , provided he who catches the ball makes a mark with his heel while catching , and does not move Trom it until the catch is admitted . The mark is then the dividing point between the two teams ; both take position between it and their own goals ; and the player who caught the ball kicks it back toward the opposite goal , usually by a " punt . " The more common way of checking the advance of the ball is by a " tackle . " Any player may run with the ball . While he is doing so , any opponent may seize him and cry " Held ! " or throw him and hold him until he cries " Down ! " If the tackle is made by seizing the runner above the shoulders or below the hips , it is a " foul tackle , " and penalties are imposed for it . If it is a fair tackle , it effectually blocks the further progress of the ball ; the game is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting the ball into play again and resuming the A FAIR-CATCH . A GOAL . // game . This brings us to the peculiar feature of the American game , the " scrimmage . " In the English game , the scrimmage consists in placing the ball on the ground , after which both sides crowd around it and kick indiscriminately and furiously until the ball emerges and is carried off by one of the players . The game had hardly been introduced into America when the new players saw that the English scrimmage was altogetl*er illogical ; it was certain that one or more of the players would he off-side during the process . A new form of the scrimmage xv as developed at once . The enforcement of the rule against off-side playing , together with the natural desire of the players to get as near as possible to the opposite goal , led to the arrangement of the two sides in parallel lines , neither being ahead of the ball ; and this was the origin of " liningup " at the beginning of the American scrimmage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , which has the ball , forms in a line , no player being allowed to get ahead of the ball , that is , to be off-side ; side B forms in a parallel line as near as convenient to the line of side A ; the player in the center of A 's line , the " center rush , " kicks the ball backward , or " snaps it back , ' to the quarter-back , who " passes " it to another player ; and the ball is " in play " again , side B trying to break through in pursuit of it , and side A trying to prevent this by getting into the way , any holding or striking being absolutely forbidden . The bulk of the game is thus made up of occasional kicks and free catches , and a great deal of running with the ball , tackles , and consequent scrimmages . When the ball goes outside of the side-lines , it is put into play again in much the same way as in the scrimmage . The two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a member of side A , which has the ball , standing astride the side-line , either throws the ball straight in , over the heads of the players , or , more commonly , bounds it backxvard to one of his own side , and the ball is in play . The introduction of the American form of the scrimmage has quite changed the character of the game . It soon forced a reduction of the numbers engaged , from fifteen on a side to eleven , which has since been the rule . Every subsequent development of the game hasmade it more scientific and more difficult to play with the highest success . The game has , in fact , become a miniature game of strategy , and can best he comprehended by comparing the football-field to a battle-field , limited by the sidelines , and the respective sides to two armies , managed on military principles by the captains . Four arms of the foot-ball service have been developed , as the spectator may see on watching two teams lining-up at the beginning of a game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field stretch the foot-ball infantry , the " rush-line , " or " rushers . " They are the seven heavy men of the team , but must also be agile , very fair runners , and quick in tackling . Their most powerful player is usually in the middle of the line , and is commonly known as the " center-rush " : he snaps the ball back in the scrimmage . The two players on the ends of the line , the " endrushes , " stand slightly back of the main line ,  - -  in more military language , " the wings are slightly refused , " - in order to tackle any player who may succeed in passing the main line at those points . Behind the " center-rush , " generally , plays the " quarter-back , " answering very much to the quartermaster 's department : he takes the ball from the " center-rush , " in the scrimmage , and serves it out to the players back of him , who are to do the running . A FOUL TACKLE , HIGH . A FOUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a first-rate halfback carry the ball almost or quite the full length of the field , dodging one opponent here and another there , thrown headlong again and again , but up and away before the tackle can be completed , and finally score a touch-down , while the heavier rushers , who have grasped at him . and missed him , toil panting and disgusted after him in hopes of another opportunity . Farthest to the rear , and at first in front of his own goal , is the eleventh player , the " full-back . " He constitutes the artillery of the team . He is to relieve a too-great press ure on his team by an opportune punt over the heads of the line , while his rushers follow the ball down the field , ready to tackle any opponent who secures the ball , cause a " down , " and thus transfer the struggle to the enemy 's territory . // undergraduates nearest to a state of semidelirious enthusiasm .

For the rest of the game , the two evenly matched teams struggled desperately , Princeton to score something , Yale to prevent it ; and , when less than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score was * to o in her favor . In an instant , the whole aspect of affairs was changed . One of Watkinson 's long punts crossed the field diagonally , throwing the Yale line out of alignment for the moment . Lamar caught the ball while running at full speed , and went like a flash between two of the Yale rushers , entrapped one of the half-backs into missing tackle , and dodged another ; and lo the whole field was before him , without an opponent between him and the much-longed-for Yale goal . A touchdown and a goal followed ; and the team which seemed assured of the game but a moment before had lost it by a score of 6 to 5 . He who " can not understand the popularity of foot-ball " should have been there to witness the frantic excitement , the cheers , the embracings , and the general delirium of those spectators who were but a moment ago resigned VOL .

" Rush-line tricks " are the leading feature of the modern form of the ganc1* against an unskilled team they are deadly , and score touch-downs and goals with bewildering rapidity . Instead of passing the ball from a scrimmage to a halfback , the quarter-back will hold it for an instant until one or another of his rush-line takes it from him and charges with it . But the clock-work precision with which the whole matter is managed , the manner in which every other player of the rush-line supports the one who has the ball and does just the work necessary to help him break the opposing rushline , show that nothing has been left to chance . Such " rush-line tricks " are possible only through perfectly organized team-play , and an ingenious system of signals . The spectator , during the scrimmage , can hear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , exhortations to " play hard , " or " put THE SCRIMMAGE . HALF-BACK TAKING THE BALL . // the ball through , " or apparently superfluous information on every kind of subject connected with the game . He is really managing his team , telling them to whom the ball is to be passed next by the quarter-back and what players are to do special pieces of work connected with the play . Every sentence has its pregnant word , conventionalized to mean to the players something quite different from the meaning which the opponents will probably attach to it ; and the whole system , carefully memorized and practiced for weeks , enables the captain to keep his team well in hand throughout the game . Each team has its pet system of signaling , which it fondly imagines to be undiscoverable ; while the first few minutes of a " great " game are spent in studying the signals of the opposing team , to see whether they have been changed since the last season . Under its new form , the game has taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the three colleges in which it is played most successfully , Yale , Harvard , and Princeton , the undergraduates would probably give up base-ball a trifle more willingly than foot-ball . There is enough in the game to stir one 's pulses . The training has been a long period of self-surrender and of selfdenial , and it has enabled the players to show courage , constancy , an intelligent willingness to meet and defeat physical dangers , and an ability to think connectedly in the presence of physical dangers , to an extent offered by no other form of exercise . Every spectator knows that the players are in the acme of physical condition , and that they are able and more than willing to strain every muscle to the breaking point rather than allow their rivals to outscore them . Every student as well as every player knows that the playing of the team , rather than its success , will go far to measure the college 's reputation for every physical characteristic which goes to make up a man , and for those psychological traits which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical powers . Wesleyan and Pennsylvania have a pride in showing how well their teams can play . Harvard , though unfortunate for the last few years , has put her mark too high in the past to be willing to fall below it . Yale wants three championships at least . Princeton having no Medical School or Law School from which to draw graduate players , has a pride in showing that her undergraduates can fill the lack . College feeling , in its most intense form , permeates the whole season , and is not confined to a twenty minutes ' dash for victory or a tedious procession . Yet one who played the game in the past , and likes it not a whit the less in the present , must feel regret in seeing the general disposition to consider the game one which is objectionable as a game for students who are gentlemen . The criticisms upon it have run in two general lines , though they have branched out into many different phases . They are , first , the innate roughness of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the likelihood of severe accident , or even death , from it ; and , second , its tendency to degenerate into brutality and personal combat , from the personal contact between the players , which is an inevitable feature of it . The first point has its true and its false side . The game is as safe as any outdoor game can well be , provided it is played with the careful preparation and training which are the rule in the larger colleges ; it is a dangerous and unfit game when men undertake * to play it without such preparation and training . In the season of last year , two fatal accidents were reported ; both occurred in colleges which were attempting to play the game as it is played by the leading teams , without any of the preparation which they I find an essential . The writer , who has been in the habit of attending I the regular games of the college with which he is connected , has felt under obligations to be equally consistent in attending the daily practice games of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he must confess to a great respect for the good sense and good management of the undergraduates who have the matter in charge . The " University team " is selected provisionally ; it is pitted daily against a second , or " scrub , " team of somewhat larger numbers ; both teams are kept under careful training and supervision ; the playing is made short and as gentle as possible at first , until the men begin to become " hard " ; the playing is then gradually lengthened and made more severe , as the men become able to endure it ; and , by the time the season comes to its last game , the players are able to endure with impunity treatment which would be dangerous to men who are " soft , " or out of condition . After the first few weeks are over , and serious playing has begun , men who have not yet played are not encouraged , or , in extreme cases , even allowed , to play on the " scrub " team ; the managers think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only brought to a point of physical condition which makes it a pleasure to watch them ; they are taught how to fall , when a fall is inevitable , in such a way as to retain control of the ball without hazarding a broken bone or a dislocation . When the closing games come on , the player can take what seems to the spectator a frightful fall not only without a bruise , but so skillfully that it is regularly necessary forhis opponent to " hold him down " lest he rebound and take to his heels again . The preliminary practice games can hardly be more severe elsewhere than at Princeton ; and yet the writer has never seen a serious accident occur there . An accident may occur , of course , and will give no warnDROPPING ON THE BALL . ing of its coming , but its coming has been put as far as possible out of the range of probability . But if men in other colleges wish to play foot-ball , as should be the case , they must not ignore the systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-trained team as a model , and attempt to imitate it . It is from such folly that the recurring accidents in foot-ball come . With good physical condition in the players , the requisite training , and suitable grounds , the game is not only one of the best of outdoor sports , but one of the safest . The asserted tendency of the game to degenerate into personal combat is at least as serious a question ; and it has much the same answer . The writer 's observation has led him to believe that , in nine cases out of ten , a general tendency to indulge in striking with the fist is the result of conscious inferiority . When a team finds itself constantly outwitted by the team-play of its opponents , it is apt to become exasperated and to be tempted into striking ; while the captain who is managing his team as a whole would be annoyed and interfered with by a disposition on the part of any of his men to abandon their functions in his plans and turn to a personal assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural development of the game into teamplaying is itself a corrective to any tendency to blows ; a successful team can no longer afford to indulge iii individual combat . The belief is confirmed by the testimony of players . They say that difficulties of this sort come only in the minor games ; and that , in the // games with the stronger teams , toward the end of the season , where the teams are played strictly as units , the tendency to strike is very far less and may generally he disregarded . An influence of a somewhat higher moral nature is the fact that the intensity of the later competition has made every prominent football player known to his rivals in other colleges . They canvass all his characteristics , his methods of play , and their fair or foul character . He knows that he is to meet them in after life , and is to leave a reputation among his contemporaries , not only in his own college , but in other colleges . He is not over-anxious to make that reputation one for foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural results of this better acquaintance are telling more for good every year . Still , it must always be admitted that the game offers more provocatives to a naturally bad temper than any other outdoor sport . The credit of those who learn to undergo such discipline and to control their tempers under such provocatives should be the greater ; but an artificial restriction may be of service even to them . Until this season every umpire has been much restrained from inflicting the penalties prescribed by the rules , from the fact that the undergraduates of the injured college would ascribe a defeat to him . It is for this reason that the effort has been made , with the concurrence of the undergraduates themselves , to transfer the appointment of such umpires to a graduate committee , so that they will he removed from all sense of responsibility to the undergraduates . Even in past years , very far the most of the striking has been quite imaginary . The player who has the ball is permitted to thrust off any one who attempts to tackle him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open hand only . The reporter or spectator who sees a stalwart player running down the field , one arm holding the foot-ball , 775 75/ . LINING UP . BREARING THROUGH THE RUSH LINE . // while the other is moving with the rapidity of a steam-engine 's piston toward and from an opponent , asks no further testimony than " that of his senses " that this is another scandalous case of " slugging , " as striking has come to be called . If he should look a little closer , he would see that the " striker 's " hand was open and the fingers up , so as to make any real striking impossible . Again , at the beginning of a scrimmage , the proximity of the two lines gives an appearance of constant striking . One team is on a line with the ball ; the other is parallel to the first , at such distance as pleases it . Theoretically each side has a right to be on a line with the ball , so that the line between the two sides ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , only the side which has the ball can play on an exact line with it , but the other side naturally presses as close as possible to the theoretical dividing line . Until the ball is snapped back , the side which has the ball is continually thrusting its opponents back , but the action is precisely the same as in " wardingoff . " In either case , the spectator who wishes to know whether there is real striking or not must watch the ka ; id , and not the motion of the arm , or he may do extreme injustice to young men who are undergoing successfully a severe trial of temper , and overcoming temptations which most of the spectators could not endure , and who deserve credit for it . The real evil of the game is the betting . It is not true that the number of those who bet is large ; and it is true that it is far more the graduates than the undergraduates who bet ; but it must be admitted that the fact of the betting is demoralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is said by some that a college should not concern itself with the question whether men bet on intercollegiate games or not . It is the name of the college which brings the spectators , and the opportunities for and temptations to betting ; and the writer must admit the right of the college to stop the use of its name for any such purpose . He would not be understood , however , as wishing to see the college exercise this right , and thus lose the great benefits of intercollegiate athletics . He would far prefer to ground an appeal to the undergraduates to put down betting on the purely material side of the good of the game ,  --  partly from the fact that , if the game becomes a mere medium for betting , it will be a public nuisance , and ought to be suppressed ; and partly from its effects on the team and its playing . It is not the fault of the college periodicals that there is any betting among undergraduates ; their influence has been cast strongly and persistently against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their editors are usually among the most judicious of the undergraduates , and they know the dangers which surround the game at present , and have been persistent in warning students against this particular evil of the game . It is to their influence that we have most reason to look with hope for a development of right feeling on this point among undergraduates ; and it is only from undergraduates that any strong influence can be brought to bear upon graduates . Three colleges , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard , are the leading foot-ball institutions at present . With them , the whole foot-ball season , from the beginning of the college year until Thanksgiving Day , is crowded with foot-ball games ,  --  the intercollegiate matches , class games , games between eating and other clubs and between societies . The man who does not " kick " to some extent in the course of the season is quite an exception . Every man in college is , or considers himself , a competent critic of the captain 's methods ; and every step in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of play for the season is watched with the keenest scrutiny , and , in its turn , has its influence on the minor games . All this is the chief argument for intercollegiate athletics , in that they oust for the time the forbidden and abhorrent forces which are always lying in wait for the recreations of college students , and carry the interest off into the direction of healthy , outdoor sports . From this point of view , no game can claim a higher place than the American game of foot-ball . Not every man can own a shell ; and the percentage of cost per man to the healthy results of a boat-race would startle any one who should attempt to figure it up . But any twenty-two men who can combine to own a foot-ball , and to procure a place in which to play , have a whole season of sound and attractive e5ercise in this one " bag of wind . " Let them once become interested in the game , and their spare time goes to it ; they will have none left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare during the foot-ball season than in any other part of the college year ; and , so far as the writer 's observation has gone , the most strenuous supporters of the game among college faculties are those who have most to do with college discipline . But how about those who spend more time in such amusements than they can really spare ? This question is asked more often than any other ; and those who ask it do not seem to recognize the injustice to the modern college faculties which is implied in it . The development of the American college is not in a direction which makes the implications // of the question possible . It is less possible every year for a man to waste his time , and yet remain in college . The increase of numbers alone has made the process of " weedxng out " incompetent or lazy men in freshman year more of a possibility , and more of a feature in college life ; and the influence of this process lasts throughout the course . The " high-class man " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time more carefully , to cut off every other drain upon it , and to give spare time to nothing else ; the man of less ability is compelled to follow a course as nearly parallel as his ingenuity will enable him to take ; and the effects are somewhat like those which high taxation often has on a people , in bringing out more work than would be the case without it . The organization of athletics has a parallel effect . The undergraduate managers of a successful foot-ball team now form a strong organization , which watches the course of promising players with a care which a college professor is not always in a position to give ; and it will go to almost any lengths of pressure upon a player rather than allow him to forfeit his place in college through waste of time . The hopelessly athletic student thus gets less mercy every year ; and the influences which college athletic organizations bring to bear upon such students , the ingenious expedients by which they extort study from men who do not incline to study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who know of them . They fail again and again , of course ; but they do a work to which any other agency is incompetent . The game has found little favor at the South , but almost every Northern college now plays it more or less . The Intercollegiate Foot Ball Association , founded in 1876 , consists of the three colleges named above , Wesleyan University , and the University of Pennsylvania . Each team plays one game with each of the other four teams during the season , the last game falling to the two teams which stood highest during the previous season . For the past few years these two teams have regularly been those of Yale and Princeton ; and these two are to be the contestants this year . This is always the great game of the year ; the two teams come to it , usually , with an unbroken record of victories over all their other opponents ; and the result of the game is to decide the championship for the coming year . No prudent man will ever venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two leading opponents . The championship rules of the Association have been so loose and unsystematic , and have offered so many opportunities for disputes , that the newspaper statements of the championships of past years are quite worthless . Most of the opportunities for dispute seem now to have been covered , and it is to be hoped that the present year will see a clear and undisputed victory for one side or for the other . It would be far easier to write a " vivid " description of this final game than of all the boat-races that ever were rowed ; the excitement is more prolonged ; the ups and downs of the game are constant and never to be foreseen ; and the points of individual and team playing are vastly more numerous , more perceptible , and more easily apprehended . The enormous crowd , the coaches filled with men and horns , the masses and shades of color among the spectators , the perpetual roar of cheers , including the peculiar slogans of almost all the Eastern colleges , combine to make up a spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant response of the spectators to every shifting phase of the play shows that a very large number of them have enjoyed the advantage of a good foot-ball training in the past . But , to him who really likes the game , and who understands its possible influence on the development of Americans , the excitement , the cheers , the blowing of horns , and the ebb and flow of the game , count for little . There is , instead of them , a feeling of thankfulness for the antecedent process of which all this is only a symptom , and a moving force for the coming year ; a satisfaction in knowing that this outdoor game is doing for our college-bred men , in a more peaceful way , what the experiences of war did for so many of their predecessors in i86r-6* , in its inculcation of the lesson that bad temper is an element quite foreign to open , manly contest .
