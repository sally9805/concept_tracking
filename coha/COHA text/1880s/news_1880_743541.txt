txt The great gun at the Democratic ratification meeting here last night was Montgomery Blair , who delivered himself of a large collection of figures , intended for the utter destruction of the Treasury Department , as administered under the Republican Party . Officers of the Treasury have been examining the collection to-day , and have come to the conclusion that most of them were evolved from Mr. Blair 's inner consciousness . Mr. Blair exhibited considerable boldness in assuming for the Democratic majority in Congress all the credit of the reductions in expenses , interest , &c.,; which have been accomplished during the last five years by a Republican Executive . For example , he showed that the cost of collecting Customs and internal revenue was less in the years from 1876 to 1879 than in the years from 1372 to 1875 , and at once declared that the saving was accomplished by the Democrats . Not by new laws assuredly , for the Democrats have not made them ; not by compulsion , through reduced appropriations either , for at the end of the last fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on hand 52,000,000 which he hau not found it necessary to use . But Mr. Blair went further . He declared that Democratic legislative ascendency had turned the balance of trade in our favor , and that the reduction of the public debt was the work of the Democrats in the House . Wade Hampton declined to make a speech in the following words : " If I thought that I could do any good for the Democracy by attending your meeting in Washington , I should . most cheerfully do so ; but everything I say is so misrepresented that I really think it best for our party that I should remain silent .
