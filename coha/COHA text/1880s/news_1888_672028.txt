txt Senator EDMUNDS has revived , with a nalvet6 characteristic of his age and temperament , the well-worn theory that a nation is a family , that - everything brought into our country from a foreign country deprives one of our own family of the chance to get paid for making it , and that every citizen is bound not to buy of any one else what one of his brothers might sell him . This is not a very profound notion . It is , in fact , one of primitive simplicity , and was most prevalent in the Middle Ages , when it was nearly universal , except for the Venetians and the Jews , who became very rich by studiously violating it and by taking advantage of the necessities that , from time to time and in various degrees , forced others to violate it . But it is about as near to a general theory as any one can come who insists upon the protective tarift as now , for the first time in this country , viewed by the Republican Party . No other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely justify the Republican advocacy of cutting down the revenues by prohibitory duties . If that can not be sustained by the notion that we are under a fraternal obligation to do everything " within ourselves , " then it can not be sustained at all . Nor is the theory without attraction to persons who are ignorant of the actual conditions or of the history of industry and commerce , or who are prone to think superficially of them as Mr. EDMUNDS unfortunately is . It is a well-known and . frequently-observed fact in sociology that there is a certain correspondence between want of development in intelligence and like want of development in point of time . The most ignorant races of to-day are in many regards on a level with the remote ancestors of the higher races , and so the state of Mr. EDmumos 's mind and of those to whom his simple and shallow theories appeal is not very different from that which prevailed in the fifteenth century , except among the Jews and the ' Venetians . But it is plain that if , by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance , commercially , of men who think with Mr. EDMUNDS , it would get on as badly , relatively to the rest of the world , as the stupid people of all Europe then did relatively to the brighter and sharper Venetians and Israelites . To examine this theory with any degree of seriousness seems uncomfortably like breaking a fly on the wheel , but since a man who is unquestionably so sincere as Mr. EDMUNDS and who is so intelligent in other things appears to think that he thinks the theory to be true , it is worth while to trace its practical workings a little way at least . We need not go far to run upon its absurdity . Let us suppose a family of a dozen  --  the parents , three daughters , and seven sons  --  who start out to live in accordance with Mr. EDMUNDS 'S theory . As in our climate the three great needs of common life are food , shelter , and clothing , we will suppose the father and two sons undertake farming to ' provide the food and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the buildings and their furniture , while the remaining two devote themselves to the manufacture of clothing , including hats and shoes , and the women prepare the food and assist wherever they can . It is plain that the builders , after they had got up the needed house and outbuildings , would be relatively idle , and would be very poor customers for the others . It is equally plain that the makers of clothing would be in like case as soon as they had provided very simple satisfaction for the common needs in their lino , and would have little temptation to do more , as they would get nothing for their labor but food and house room . In short , the whole family , shut up to trading with each other , would have a very narrow and poor existence ; but by Mr. EDMUNDS 'S theory they should be sustained by the consciousness that they wore confining their purchases to their own family , and that it would be a wrong to their brothers to buy anything of any one else . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , so far as it has been applied , the protectionist scheme has reduced the American people , and in this situation the Republicans have no remedy to offer but to aggravate the causes that have produced it . . The American national family have now reached a point where they can produce in the great variety of occupations to which they have devotedthemselves , and in which , thanks to their native ingenuity and energy and to the resources of the country , they excel . a great deal more than they can consume . They could produce still more and on still bettor terms if they were not taxed heavily on the materials that.they require from foreign countries , mostly , as in the case of woolen and metal goods , to use in combination with their own . This actual surplus , and the greater surplus that could and would be produced if the duties were taken off these materials , they can not sell abroad , partly because the taxes make the cost of ' production too high , and partly because the taxes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanging their products with . foreign producers . This is the actual net result of protection as applied . It is not a good result . It places us on a very low level in the scale of commercial nations . it keeps us , so far as concerns the foreign trade  --  which is the only trade by which we can dispose as a people of j our , surplus productsust where the English people were in the reign of ELIZABETH , when the importation of domestic wool and the export of foreign woolens were equally made impossible . If we ask why such an absurd and mischievous situation should be perpetuated the answer is that in this country the class that exactly corresponds to that which had a royal monopoly under the TUDORS has influence enough with the Government to prevent a change that would be greatly for the general advantage , but would interfere with their monopoly . Happily this class has been deprived of its power in the popular branch of the Legislature and in the Executive . From its stronghold in the Senate , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it hopes to regain its hold on the country . Unless the people want to reject all the splendid opportunities of the commerce of the world in this latter part of the nineteenth century they will not gratify that hope .
