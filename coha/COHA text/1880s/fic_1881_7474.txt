Sill , Edward Rowland , 1841-1887 : I WAIT FOR THEE . from I wait for thee ( 1881 ) Calmly the night comes down on all the land , Faintly the twilight glimmers o'er the sea , Sadly the lingering ripples kiss the sand , So sad I pace the beach and wait for thee . Soft steal the muffled inland echoes here , A sound of church-bells trembles on the lea ,  --  So softly , muffled memories meet the ear , And seem to mock me as I wait for thee . Solemnly still the great , calm stars glow on , And all the broad fair heaven leans silently , While slumberous Ocean 's undulous undertone Still whispers to me as I wait for thee . Upon the strand where life 's loud surges beat , My footsteps follow where my hope must be ; The dull , long days and nights break at my feet  --  Must I forever , weeping , wait for thee ?                  @ @ @
