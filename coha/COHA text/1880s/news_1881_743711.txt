txt Once in a while we hear of a town or city , generally in the West or South-west , which repudiates its obligations and lets its credit become so thoroughly impaired that its bonds arc worthless . But the city of Memphis , Tenn. , enjoys the rare distinction of becoming bankrupt by its . own act , and of persisting in its dishonorable conduct by disincorporating itself . The city made extensive internal improvements of various kinds , including pavements , sewers , &c.,; and lent its credit to one or two railroad corporations , issuing bonds therefor . On the 1st of July , 1879 , the city debt , bonded and floating , amounted to $5,178,878 . From this may be deducted the cash on hand , amount of uncollected taxes due and collectible , bonds due from various persons , and other assets , all of which would leave a total debt of $3,929 , . 896 . There is no claim anywhere set up that any part of this debt is not justly owing to the creditors of the city . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city by persons desiring investments . Then there are warrants on the city Treasury , paving bonds , school bonds , judgments against the . city , claims for salaries , and , in short , very much such a mass of indebtedness as would be filed against the City of New-York if this Corporation were to go into bankruptcy to-morrow . When the debts were created , the city of Memphis had ample powers , under the State Legislature , for the levy and collection of such taxes as were necessary for the payment of debts according to the contracts then . made . The city has never owned any property except such as is devoted to public uses , and as this property is exempt from levy and sale for the payment of debts , it has always been understood that such debts could not be paid except by the levy and collection of taxes . The creditors of the city were not even allowed , as in New-York , the poor privilege of seizing a lot of portraits in the City Hall as the " personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Default was made in the payment of the outstanding bonds of the city of Memphis , and the interest was allowed to accumulate . After much tribulation , the bondholders and other creditors of the city submitted to a large deduction from the amounts severally due them , and a new form of indebtedness , the evidence of which was known as " compromise bonds , " was acknowledged . Finally , the interest on these was also allowed to remain unpaid as soon as it became due ; and the interest on a bonded debt of $2,774,000 has accumulated against the city . A portion of these bonds were due in 1877 ; and the longest bonds are not due until 1907 . But on all of these , various classes of bonds the interest is unpaid . The tax-payers complained that they could not bear the burden which this amount of indebtedness imposed upon them . They had pavements , sewers , railroad communications , and various other costly improvements , all of which had been paid for by the persons who had lent them money , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens groaned under the burden of taxation , and , after refusing to make any provision for the payment of the interest on their obligations , they made a bold stroke for repudiation . By act of Legislature , passed in January , 1879 , the charter of the city of Memphis was repealed , its existence as a municipal corporation was destroyed , all its civic offices were abolished , and the population of the city was resolved back into the body of the State , and all power to levy and collect taxes was withdrawn and reserved to the Legislature . This was not exactly a technical form of going into bankruptcy , because no provision was made for any division of the city 's assets among its numerous creditors . It was more as if the debtor had taken refuge in flight . At first it was held that each taxpayer 's property was liable for the amounts due by the city , and that any creditor could levy upon any individual parcel of real es ' tate inside of the city limits and proceed precisely as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon decided that although the Legislature had removed the cover of municipal protection which had always existed between the citizen and the city 's creditor , the only way in which the money to pay the debts of the city of Memphis can be collected is through the power of taxation . And it has been further decided that this power can be exercised only by and under the authority of the State Legislature . To make the exemption of the tax-payers of Memphis yet more complete , the statute abolishing the city , and repealing its charter , created a new corporation styled " The Taxing District of Shelby County . Tenn. , " which anomalous concern is expressly prohibited from paying any debt of the city of Memphis . The United States Supreme Court has decided that this act is valid , and that , if relief is not otherwise afforded to the creditors , they must appeal to the Legislature . To the Legislature , accordingly , the creditors have gone , and a remarkable petition for redress has just been presented to that body . Unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unshaken , and the better part of its citizens regard this particular complication with uneasiness . It is a dishonorable thing that a community should repudiate its obligations . It is not pretended in this case that the money is not justly due , and the fact that most of the indebtedness is the remainder of a compromised debt adds to the dishonorableness of the transaction . The Supreme Court of the ' United States has relegated the settlement of the city debt of Memphis to the State Legislature . The action of that body will be watched with curious interest .
