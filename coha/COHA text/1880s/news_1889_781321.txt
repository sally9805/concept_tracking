txt The scenes on the burned district this afternoon were mainly a re-enact-ment of those of the past two days . Crowds of people filled with curiosity still hung about the lines , keeping the policemen busy in restraining the too adventurous and forward ones . Passing by the ruins was still more or less dangerous on Chauncy , Bedford , and Kingston streets , al-though shores had been placed against the Nevins building on the corner of Rowe-place , and on the only remaining wall of the Ames building on Bedford-street , as a protection . A staging has been erected on the former building , and the wall will be taken down stone by stone . On the opposite side of the street the sidewalks to-day were piled high with bundles of blankets and dry goods , dripping and steaming but the carriageway was practically clear of rubbish and the city teams engaged in the excavating work passed through without interruption . In the buildings on the south side of Rowe-place a general " clearing-up time " was in progress . The bricks and other debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings themselves the painters , glaziers , and carpenters were hard at work . In Kingstonstreet , where the ill-fated engines were stationed and crushed , a gang of men was hard at work digging at the piles of dirt , brick , granite , and iron girders which fill the street at this point . Two large derricks and a hoisting engine were also placed here , and these greatly aided in the heavy work . Late in the afternoon the wrecked Hayes truck was unearthed and splinter by splinter was drawn forth , the only part of the apparatus worth saving being such accessories as axes and bars . On the Brown , Durrell &; Co. lot . was still another gang of laborers who , assisted by one of the derricks , were engaged in the thus far fruitless search for the lost firemen . Two or three streams are constantly playing upon the ruins here , cooling them down so that the laborers pursue their work without the danger of being scorched . On every hand were the safes which have been hauled from their beds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents of most of those thus far exhumed have been found intact , but in a Low cases the iron had succumbed to the heat and strain , and books and papers were a total loss . For two days the men have worked on the largo vault of Taylor Brothers , in the Ames building . but although they have drilled holes almost entirely around the iron door , the sun went down on their unsuccessful efforts for a second time . In the morning two of the safes of the Shoe and Leather Exchange were opened . Tile contents or one were a triffnscorched. but not seriously injured , and those of the other were intact . Their largest safe has not yet been opened . The safe of the Herbert and Rapp Elastic Goring Company was opened , and everything within , including $7,000 in cash , found unscorched . The investigation as to the cause of the great fire was continued at the office of Fire Marshal Whitcomb to-day . There were five witnesses examined , and the testimony of each was taken by a stenographer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything of the general tenor of their testimony . He said that it would take a week at least to finish the investigation , as he wished it to be very thorough .

Ames 's Bedford-street building , insured for $85,000 ; W. L. Strong &; Co. , S2 Chauncey-street , dry goods . insured for $76,000 ; W. II .

The Board of Aldermen this evening received a communication from Mayor Hart recommending that the opportunity for widening certain streets in the burned district be seized upon ; that pecuniary relief be given by the city to the ' anilines of the firemen burned in the recent tire , and urging the passage of each ordinances as snail require every telephone , telegraph , or other electric wire that enters any building in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fusible alloy satisfactory to the Fire Commissioners or the Superintendent of the fire alarm .

The Board of Fire Commissioners also sent a communication asking for increased fire apparatus and new quarters for the central tirealarm station .
