By Lester Wa/lack . FIRST PAPER . NOTE . - Mr . Charles Dudley Warner , in his " Backlog Studies , " says : " The best talk is that which escapes up the open chimney , and can not be repeated . " The following papers are simply the result of an effort to catch and preserve the familiar talk of a veteran of the stage on its way to the fireplace of a certain front room in Thirty-fourth Street , New York . They do not pretend to be complete or consecutive ; or even to be what is termed literature ; only the Memories , Social and Professional , of Half a Century ; affectionately inscribed to the audiences the speaker has addressed in other days and in other ways . My first experience on any stage was at an establishment at Mitcham , in Surrey , called Baron House Academy , a fine old mansion which had become a private school . Colman 's " Heir at Law " was produced immediately before the beginning of the summer holidays , upon an improvised stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and general manager . As the son of " the celebrated Mr. Wallack , " it was felt proper , naturally , that I should take part , and I was billed for the speech from Home 's tragedy of " Douglas " - " My name is Norval " - although I was only ten years of age . I was dressed in a red tunic trimmed with fur , white trousers and red shoes , and carried a round wooden shield and a wooden sword painted blue . As for the lines , I suppose I must have painted them red . How I spoke them heaven only knows . I only remember that I never missed a syllable . My next appearance was at another school performance given at Brighton , when I was about fifteen years old . This was at a seminary kept by a Mr. Allfree , which was then rather celebrated , and the play was " Pizarro . " At that time my uncle , Henry Wallack , was stage manager at Covent Garden . Of course all the boys were racking their brains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother applied to my uncle , who sent down a lot of splendid properties , a leopard skin robe and all the necessary things for Rolla , all of which were of course very much too large for me , particularly the sandals . I remember nothing of the play except that it went off with a great deal of applause , but I do remember that the end was a most undignified one for me , because as I fell dead I fell just exactly where the curtain must come down on me ; and when it began to descend the boy who played Aloazo , and one of the soldiers stepped forward , and taking me , one by one leg and one by the other , dragged me up the stage , a bit of new " business " which was greatly appreciated if I might judge from the " roars " in front . On returning from my first visit to America , which had been a purely social one , and before it was quite determined whether I should finally go into the army or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out upon a starring Henry Wallack , Uncle of Lester . tour to Bath and other provincial towns , proposed that I should join him , partly as a companion , and partly to support him in such parts as could safely be entrusted to one who could only be looked upon as an amateur ; and the first appearance // I made on any stage after I arrived at manhood was as Angelo in a play called " Tortesa the Usurer , " by N. P. Willis . I had seen it brought out before when my father had the National Theatre in New York . The character of Tortesa was written for him , and when he went over to England he took the play with him and starred in it . The character I assumed was originally acted by Edmon S. Conner , then his " leading juvenile . " 7- , / During this tour I played that part , Mac Gustavus Brooke . duff to his Macbeth , and Richmond to his Richard IlL , and these , I think , constituted the main portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning of the National Theatre in 1839 . I had done enough , inexperienced as I was ( so my father told me afterward ) , to show that , if ever the profession should become a necessity to me , I had a certain amount of promise ; that in fact I had " the gift . " During this engagement I assumed the name of " Allan Field , " which had belonged to a relative of the family . I hesitated long before I made up my mind to become an actor ; but when I finally did so , I determined that I should know my profession from beginning to end , and should depend upon it for my sole support ; and the consequence was that my poor mother often cried in those early days , because I would not let her send me a five pound note now and then , to add to my weekly stipend of twenty shillings ! I was resolved that whatever success I might make I would owe to myself , and not to my father 's name ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester in the town of Rochester , in a comedy called " Charles II. , " by John Howard Payne . I had a very good part-the second part of the piece . Charles Kemble was King Oharles , Fawcett playing Edward and Jones the Earl of Rochesler in the original cast , at Covent Garden . The season at Rochester was a short one , as my uncle Henry Wallack , who had taken the theatre as an experiment , had it for only a few weeks . This was my first professional engagement . My salary was still one pound a week ; and I was paid about as punctually as actors in small companies were at that time . Three pounds a week was a good salary in a country theatre , and five pounds was enormous . When we got to the larger provincial cities salaries were a little higher , but I very much doubt if any leading actor at Bath , Bristol , Liverpool , or Manchester ever received more than ten pounds a week in those days . My experience at another provincial theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was taken by a Mr. W. J. A. Abingdon , a barrister in very good practice and a rich man , who was wildly enthusiastic upon every subject connected with the drama . His particular craze was his fancy that he resembled Shakespeare , and he indulged his pride in having himself painted as the Bard of Avon , after Roubillac 's statue in Westminster Abbey , a portrait which was distributed broadcast over Southampton and the neighboring town of Winchester . I soon became a favorite with him , and as I was pretty careful in my study and acting , although very inexperienced , a short time after my joining his company he made me stage-manager ; and a pretty queer stage-manager I suppose I was ! This must have been about 1844 , because a little later I became a great Liverpool favorite . But to return We performed al ternate nights at Winchester and Southamp ton , and the company used to travel in a little omnibus with a lantern Charles Mathews in its corner . After playing in Southampton we had to go to Winchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night in those days , and had to write out our own parts , too . We were not provided with books , and studied by // the light of this lantern , arriving at our destination awfully tired in the middle of the night , or perhaps early in the morning . Sometimes we had but one rehearsal and sometimes two , seldom more ; and to this early discipline lowe the retentivepowers of memory which have been of such wonderful assistance to me ever since . One of the first important steps I ever took upon the ladder of fame was when I had the honor , and pleasure , of playing Benediele to Helen Faucit 's Beatrice at Manchester . She was one of the gentlest and sweetest actresses I ever met . She gave me more encouragement than I had ever received before , and the patience with which she rehearsed , for I was young and inexperienced then , was remarkable . She did what must have been very irksome to her and went over our scenes again and again with me , until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was through her kindness that I made something of a hit with the audience . I shall always remember her with feelings of the greatest gratitude on that account . Iplayed but that one Shakespearian part with her , because Beatrice was her only comedy character there except Rosalind , and as she appeared in tragedy all through the rest of the engagement Gustavus Brooke supported her . She is now Lady Martin . As Miss Faucit she was what I should call one of the most sympathetic actresses who ever walked the English stage . She combined a great deal of power with perfect pathos , and I can hardly recall another actress who did this in so great a degree . They say her Lady Jlacbeth was very impressive ; I know her Portia was . She not only played the comic portions admirably , but " the trial scenes ' was equally well done ; gentle and quiet , but majestic and powerful-wonderfully impressive . She came out first in London under her mother , Mrs. Faucit , who played what is called the " heavy lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas in Bulwer 's " Money " - at the Hayinarket , Covent Garden , and elsewhere , before she went starring on her own account . She was a very great favorite throughout Great Britain , particularly in Edinburgh . I first met Gustavus Brooke at this house . It was rather a small one and Brooke and I dressed in the same room . Off the stage , he had a particularly strong Lester Wailack ( from a photograph by Brady about 1870 ) . brogue . He was a perfectly reckless man , who did not care how his money went or what straits he might be in . He was an Irishman , one of the generous , kindhearted , whole - souled John - Brougham Irishmen . During that engagement at Manchester we acted together . I would often go into my dressing-room and find that certain very necessary articles of my wardrobe were missing , and one night in particular I remember I was playing JYlodus in the " Hunchback " while he was acting Master Walter , and Miss Faucit Julia . I went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a costume I was particularly fond of , a chocolate colored , plain , quiet sort of dress ; and I missed the tights belonging to it . Brooke said : " What is the matter , me dear boy ? " I said , " I can not dress-I ca n't find my tights . " " Why , " // said he , " I took the liberty to take your tights myself , they are on me . I could n't find my own . " Fortunately I did not go on till the second act , and by that time the whole theatre had been ransacked and I got somebody 's nether garments , and he carried through the performance with " Lester 's tights . " It was characteristic of Brooke that he would have been quite as willing that I should have taken his and have gone on himself without any . He was one of those reckless , generous creatures who would *7 give anything he had in the world to me , or to Lizzie Weston Davenport . anybody else he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , a little bit of a theatre , and he met with unqualified immense success . He came out in Othello . It is a singular thing , that Brooke made almost as great a hit as Edmund Kean did when he appeared as Shylocic . It was a tremendous triumph . He had been little heard of except as a favorite provincial actor . His success was instantaneous and complete ; but unlike that of Edmund or Charles Kean it was not followed up at all . The second part he played was Sir Giles Overreach in " A New Way to Pay Old Debts , " and although that was as consistently fine a piece of acting as his Othello , perhaps more perfect , it did not &gt; seem to strike the peo ple by any means so forcibly . From his first * *Y performance the thing * gradually simmered / down , so to speak , and that , I presume , was the reason he went to Aus tralia , where he made an immense reputation and is still lovingly reinem Doily Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tralia that he went to the bottom , poor fellow . I think the ship was called " The London . " Harry Edwards has the most affectionate recollection of him . Brooke had a most wonderful voice , a voice of tremendous power and at the same time of great melody , and with a great deal of variety in it . On one occasion he was acting with Forrest , our American tragedian . He was then a stock actor in one of the English towns in which Forrest was starring , and when someone said to him : " Brooke , look out , here is Forrest coming ; he has a powerful voice , a voice that will drown anything that was ever heard here ; " Brooke replied : " I 'll show him something if he tries it with me . " Forrest played Othello and Brooke Iago , and in the great scene in the third act where Othello lays hold of Iago , Forrest put forth the whole of his terrific and tremendous force , which he always did . The moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh Grace ! Oh Heaven defend me ! " etc. , in a manner that almost made the roof shake ; it absolutely seemed as if Forrest 's voice had been nothing . It astonished Forrest , and astonished everybody else . I suppose Brooke had the most powerful lungs except Salvini 's that were ever given to an actor . That is a very exhausting speech of Othello 's in this scene , and by the time Forrest was done he was pretty well pumped out and the other came in fresh . It was not a very wise act upon Brooke 's part , and contrary to his better judgment ; but he had become so worked up by the repeated warnings against Forrest 's tremendous voice , that he did it on the spur of the moment . Forrest certainly was never more surprised in the course of his professional life ; for it was seldom he met with a man whose utterance could compare with his own in volume and strength . My first intimate relation with Charles Mathews the younger was also during my Manchester engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen 's Theatre-what might be called a semi star  --  or asteroid . Mathews and his wife-formerly known as Madame Vestris-came there to play ; and of course I was very glad of the opportunity of acting with them , which I did in two or three pieces , receiving the kindest and warmest encouragement from them both . This is one of my pleasantest recollections ; one of those remembrances that make me appreciate the fact that a young man 's progress // may be very much injured or very much aided by the kindness or discouragement shown him by those who are higher in rank than himself . At all events , they did me a great deal of good . played in various cities throughout the country , and I remember his showing me the results of an engagement in one large town , which he invested in a peculiar and characteristic way . His net James Wallack ( the Elder ) The next I saw of Charles Mathews was when he came to this country in 1857 , after his wife 's death , and played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of Anthony Street . I met him very frequently at dinner at Boucicault 's house , and at my own . My father was a great invalid , and Charles used to go and visit him and sit by his bedside continually , and so we got to see a great deal of each other ; and it was perfectly remarkable then , as it was afterward , how lightly he took all the cares and vicissitudes of life . He seemed to go through the world as a grasshopper does ; when he found the ground a little rough he hopped and got over it . He was the most lightsome creature that can be imagined , and he never seemed to let care take hold of him . During this visit to America he profits were exactly ten cents , and this particular dime he put upon his watchchain and wore for many years as a charm . This visit ended with his marriage to the wife of " Dolly " Davenport , formerly Miss Lizzie Weston . Davenport was then at our theatre , Broadway near Broome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the stage door of the Metropolitan Theatre ( afterward the Winter Garden ) , where Mathews was playing an engagement . The usual result followed : there was a great deal of gossip , much controversy in the newspapers , with the inevitable " sunmering down ; " and Mathews and his wife almost immediately afterward left America for England . Thence he went for a long tour to India , Australia , and New Zealand . // // His last visit was made after my father 's death , and when I had become the sole manager of the house on Broadway and Thirteenth Street . He brought over his wife , who , from being a very handsome , dark-haired woman , had become a brilliant blonde ; as was the case with the majority of dark-haired women at that time . He opened at the Fifth Avenue Theatre , New York , and she played in one piece with him . I remember that was the time I produced " The Liar . " Mrs. Mathews caine to see it the first night , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play it . He replied , " My dear Lizzie , it is one of my big parts in London ; why should n't I play it here ? " She said , " Do n't think of it . " He wanted to find out why he was not to play it , and asked two or three friends , who told him that I had embellished it with new scenery and many effects that he never thought of , and perhaps , if he were to play it , the audience would miss these things , and as he had plenty of other parts it would be just as well if he did not invite the comparison . At last he wrote and told me he wished to see me , so I made an appointment and he came one day to my office , and said : " My dear Wallack , what is the reason I must wander about from place to place ? what is the reason I ca n't get any chance with you ? Here is the very theatre that suits me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply is that the only auxiliary I have is myself ; I have a very fine company , and when business is very dull I go on , and am a great help ; but a star theatre I can never make it . " " Will you have me in your stock company ? " he asked . " Are you joking ? " I returned . And he replied , " No , not at all , I shall be delighted ; think what you can give Harry Becketi. me , and if you come any where near what will suit me , nothing will be more charming than to find myself under the management of one I knew almost as a boy . " After duly considering the matter I wrote to him , saying he must make his own proposition , and that I would meet VOL . IV. - 43 his terms if I could . His reply was : " My dear Wallack , No ! No ! No ! " Upon which I wrote : " My dear Mathews , I will give you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied at once , " My dear Wallack , Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! " And that settled the matter . He was a member of my company all through the season . I had then revived " The Veteran , " to seventeen and eighteen hundred dollars a night , and had to defer his appearance . He came to me and said : " John , this is all wrong , I am taking your money and doing nothing . " I w . Farren. replied , " Charles , take it and do nothing , and thank Heaven you are so well off . " He asked : " Do you mind if I can make that money by playing an engagement at Brooklyn ? " I answered : " No , certainly not ; if you can relieve me of two or three of these five hundred dollars , I am willing . " And this he did , in a measure , by what he made there . He was very ill at that time , too . It was then that he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was the cause of my ultimately joining the Brooklyn Club , of which I have been a member twelve or fifteen years . I first brought him out in " London Assurance , " at my theatre . I played Charles Courtly , and he played Dazzle . Gilbert was Sir Harcourt , Miss Plessy Mordaunt was Lady Gay Spanker , and William Floyd was Dolly . Then he went through a round of his favorite characters . He played Puff in " The Critic " charmingly . Stoddart was the Don Whisleerandos , and his death was so excessively droll that Mathews said it was the first time this character had succeeded in making him laugh on the stage , to the neglect of his own " business . " He appeared also during the engagement in " Aggravating Sam , " one of his special favorites , and in his old part of Marplot in " The Busybody , " which I had frequently played on the same boards . I was sitting in his dressing-room one night , when he said : " John , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : " What do you mean ? " " Where to place you as an artist , " he went on . I was naturally very anxious to hear what he had to say on that point , so I said : " Do n't be bashful . " I thought perhaps he was going to be a little critical . " Say anything ; it must do me good more than harm . " He said : " I should call you a mixture of your father and myself . Of your father in melodrama a n d high comedy , and of myself in what we used in my younger days to call touch and go ' playing . " " Well , " I said , " that 's a pretty good mixture , and , seriously , the highest compliment I have ever received . " As a member of a stock company , in spite of his importance . as a star , a more genial or charming person can not be imagined , nor a more loyal subject . And here it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always found that the higher the rank of the artist , the more amenable he is to discipline . The troubles in this respect , at least those I have experienced , have always been caused by comparatively unimportant people . He said one day he had never seen an American yacht . I said , " Well , will you come down and have a little cruise with me on the Columbia ? " " For heaven 's sake , do n't ask me to sail in her . I have sailed all over the world during the last two or three years , and I am thoroughly George H. Barrett . sick of the water . " I said : " We wo n't quar rel about it , but come down and dine with me , and you might bring just a dressing-gown and a pair of socks , or something of the sort , because if it should rain very hard you had better sleep aboard , and not have that long journey back . " The yacht was then lying off Tompkinsville , Staten Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Are you seasick ? " " Oh , this is delicious , " he answered , as he lay in the cockpit , smoking a cigar . I had given orders quietly to get the anchor up , and before he knew where he was we were under way , and he did not leave that boat for three or four days . He said he never had a more delightful time in his life . A more charming table companion and more agreeable person than Charles Mathews could not possibly be . I have somewhere the speech he made ( which he sent me in print afterward ) at his benefit and last appearance on my stage . It was in a part called Sir Simon Simple , in " Not Such a Fool as he Looks . " I had acted in the first piece the Captain of the Watch , an original part of his which I first saw him play at Covent Garden . That was the last time I ever saw Charles Mathews . I got a most affectionate letter from his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she never could forget his description of how he was treated by me . After that Mrs. Wallack met him several times in London , and he was always most attentive and kind to her . On one occasion she went to see him in " My Awful Dad . " There was another piece played after it , and Mathews , when he was dressed , came into the box and asked Mrs. Wallack how she liked it . She was much pleased with it , so he said : " There is but one man , after myself , that can play this part , and that is John . I will make it a present to him . " He did so , and she brought out the manuscript . I saw that two long acts would never do , and I rewrote it , making it into three acts . Much of the business is mine , including the address to the jury . I did the latter in imitation of a barrister I had heard in London . That was how I came to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son admirably . But to return to Manchester and my early experiences there . Charlotte and Susan Cushman , with both of whom I afterward became very intimate , played " Romeo and Juliet " at the Queen 's in 1845 ; and were the cause of my going to London , that Mecca of all young Eng h*-*J*i Charlotte Cushman. // The Old Broadway Theatre , New York . lish actors . Susan was the Juliet , and Charlotte said to Mr. Sloane who was then the lessee of that theatre , " Who is your Jllierctttio ? " Sloane replied " There I think we shall be all right ; I have got young Wallack . " She asked " Whom do you mean by young Wallack ? I know Mr. James Wallack ; I have played with him , and have the greatest admiration for him . I know he has a son ; is he on the stage ? " " Yes , " said Sloane . " I do not see his name here . " " No , he calls himself Mr. Lester . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Cushman . " Yes , very inexperienced , but he is said to have a good deal of promise about him . " At the end of the first rehearsal without books , Charlotte Cushman put her hand on my shoulder and said : " Young gentleman , there is a great future before you , if you take care and do not let your vanity ran away with you . " After that we became great friends , and when she went to fulfil an engagement at the Haymarket she said to Mr. Webster : " Wallack is the coming young man of the day . " As I had often seen my father in the part of lilercutio , I suppose , for a youngster , it was a better performance than they expected ; and that was the commencement of my approach to London . Mr. Webster thought that he would very much like to get a young man who would hit the public , because Charles Mathews had just left him to go to the Lyceum Theatre . Webster had the Adelphi and the Haymarket both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me worked upon him , and he finally engaged me to play at the latter house . My first appearance in London was in a piece called " The Little Devil , " a two-act play which Mr. Mathews and his wife had been very successful in . Mr. Farren , Mr. Webster , and I consulted as to what would be best for my metropolitan debut ; and I said I had made some fame in this part of Mathews's. at Liverpool , but I had played in a different version from that of Mathews and Vestris . I wanted to play my own version , as I had my own little business , and all that ; but Mr. Webster declared that I should play in his , which was very poor ; and also that I should sing . I had never sung a note on the stage , and I told him it would in all probability kill my first appearance , by reason of the extra nervousness in singing a duet with Priscilla Horton ( afterward Mrs. German Reed ) , and particularly a drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only did Mr. Webster insist upon my doing this , which required a restudy ( there is nothing so difficult as studying the rearrangement of a play you have already learned ) , but he insisted upon my singing // the songs , and sent me on the stage after 11 o'clock at night , and after a five-act comedy . I was a good deal put out at this . I thought it would ruin my chances , and to a certain extent it did , the audience being tired and yawning , many leaving the theatre before I came on . So well did somebody manage , I wo n't say who , that after a few nights of this I did not act at all , and when I appeared again it was once more under unfair treatment , as I believe . Mr. Hudson , who was the leading comedian then , was taken ill and could not play Dazzle in " London Assurance " which had then been revived . Mr. Boucicault himself attended the rehearsals , and they cast me for Dazzie , a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige of Mr. Charles Mathews 's great name . I had not been allowed to play for some weeks , and I was put on the stage with Mr. James Wallack , Jr . Farren , Mr. Buck stone , and all these people around me who knew every turn and twist of the business of the comedy ; and I naturally appeared under the greatest possible disadvantages . I think that is about all I did do . In the meantime Mr. George H. Barrett , who had come to England to make engagements for a new theatre which was building on Broadway , corner of Anthony Street , New York , and which was to be called " The Broadway , " went to the Haymarket , saw me , and thought he had found the very thing he wanted for America . He came to my mother 's house and asked , " When does this season end ? " I told him , and he said , " Well , now , what are you getting here ? " " Six pounds a week , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I will give you eight , if you will go to the States . " It was a great temptation , because it secured to me the first line of comedy and because my father was then in America ; so I closed with him at once , and at the end of the Haymarket season sailed viA the Cunard line , which then went to Boston only . There I saw my father , who was just about to start for England . This was the cause of my coming to America as an actor . I opened the Broadway Theatre , playing Sir Charles Coldstream , fell through a trap on the first night and nearly got killed . The stage had been built in a very hurried manner . Jumping on the trap , it gave way and I went through , but fortunately had presence of mind enough to catch myself by my elbows . I picked myself up uninjured and had one of the greatest receptions I ever remember . I was the success of the evening , so the newspapers said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept by a Mrs. Black near Broome Street . Wallack 's Theatre , strangely enough , afterward stood on that very spot . The Broadway Theatre was built by , or for , one Colonel Alvah Mann . The first season was a losing one . There was a succession of managers , things were going very badly , and Mr. George Barrett finally gave up the stage management , which devolved upon Mr. James Wallack , Jr. , my cousin ; it then came into the hands of Mr. George Vandenhoff ; at last it came to Mr. William Rufus Blake , and then was produced Boucicault 's " Old Heads and Young Hearts , " with Mr. Blake as Jesse Rural . The drama , which had never been done here before , brought up the fortunes of the theatre again . The next season Mr. Blake was still stage-manager and we repeated various plays . Mr. Forrest had a very successful engagement there during which I played Cassio to his Othello . Then James Anderson played an engagement and I acted with him . I supported Forrest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was the first idea I got that I could do some serious work . The fortunes of the theatre went down once more until at last an actor named George Andrews got hold of a book which was exciting and interesting the whole town . It was Dumas 's " Count of Monte Cristo . " Andrews made a dramatization of it , and offered it as a holiday piece , to be brought out on Christmas night . Mr. Blake came to me and told me about it . I said it was // capable of making an excellent drama . He replied : " The drama is made ; and you must play Monte Cristo . " " Good Heavens , I can not ! " said I. " You must do this or the theatre will close , " he answered ; " we have no one else to do it . " I was in a horrible fright , for I had never attempted anything of the kind ; but I said : " Very well , I will try it and if I fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an immense successone of the first plays that rivalled " Richard Ill. " and " London Assurance " by a run of one hundred nights . Fanny Wallack , my cousin , played Haidee , and Mr. Fredericks played Fernand . HadGecrge Vandenhoff. away was in the piece and played Caderousse . It was the great hit of the season , and the thing that saved the theatre from bankruptcy . It was from Monte Cristo that I got what celebrity I ever had in melodramatic characters , and singular to say , most of the greatest successes I ever had were in parts which were a mixture of the serious and comic , like " The Romance of a Poor Young Man , " " Jessie Brown , " " Rosedale , " and " The Streets of New York . " I first met George Vandenhoff at the Broadway Theatre , where it seems he had made an engagement with Colonel Mann , in which he stipulated that he should not be held inferior to anyone in the company . In other words he was to be strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage management he advocated making a star theatre of it , and among other stars he engaged was my cousiu , Mr. James Wallack , Jr . The opening play was " Othello , " in which Wallack was cast for Othello , as a matter of course , and Yandenhoff for Jago . About half past six , the curtain being supposed to rise at seven , there was no Mr. Yandenhoff in the theatre . They sent a message to his lodgings or his hotel , or wherever he was , to know whether he was aware of the lateness of the hour . The messenger came back and reported that Mr. Vandenhoff was out VOL . IV. - 44 and had left no word as to when he would return . The time approached for the commencement of the performance , Mr. Wallack was waiting , dressed for Othello , I was waiting dressed for Cassio , which I was to play that night ; everybody was waiting , dressed for everything . No Mr. Yandenhoff , no message , until about five minutes before the curtain should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , explaining that as his name in the bills and advertisements did not appear in equal prominence with Mr. Wallack 's he did not intend to play at all . There was naturally a great deal of indignation expressed on the part of the management ; the audience were becoming impatient , and eventually Mr. Blake went upon the stage before the curtain to explain the cause of the delay . He spoke to this effect : " Ladies and gentlemen ; I am very sorry to appear before you as an arologist . We shall give you the play , but without Mr. Vandenhoff , who , not ten minutes ago , sent word that he would not act because his name did not appear in the bills in equal type with Mr. James Wallack 's . It has been left to the management to give you an acceptable substitute in the person of Mr. Dyott , who , at this singularly short notice , will appear as lago . Great applause . We have given you the best possible remedy for the disappointment , and we leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall appear before you again . " The result of this was a very successful performance of the tragedy , and a challenge from Mr. Vandenhoff to Mr. Blake . Mr. Thomas Placide consented to act as Mr. Blake 's second . The affair , however , - - was patched up by William Rufus Slake. the interference of mutual friends , and no blood was shea . Mr. Blake , off the stage as well as on , was a positive epitome of fun and humor . There was a gentleman in the company named Hind , who came to him one day with the pomposity which I have gene- 14 - // rally remarked prevails in a greater degree among the lesser luminaries of the stage than among the greater , and said : " Mr. Blake , I have observed an omission in the bills with regard to my name. * , Mr. Blake turned around from the managerial table , and gazed at him with some surprise . " Mr. Hind , what is the omission ? " " I have always been particular , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Hadaway. bill . " Mr. Blake , with out asking him what his initials were , said very solemnly : " Mr. Hind , the omission shall be rectified . " The consequence was that in the next bill in which the gentleman 's name occurred Mr. Blake put " The Character of so and so by Mr. B. Hind , " which of course caused a great deal of amusement in the company , and a great deal of indignation on the part of Mr. Hind , whose initials were T. J. , but who was called " Mr. Behind " ever after . On another occasion Mr. Blake had to deal with a gentleman of a somewhat higher style of ambition whom we will call Jones . On the 22d of February a patriotic play was produced which was concluded with the appearance of the figure of Washington surrounded by every sort of emblem of patriotism-rn fact , in a blaze of glory . Mr. Jones said to the stage-manager : " Mr. Blake , I have frequently played the part that you have cast me for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag of our nation , and I have always , in that particular scene in which I carried it , been accustomed to sing The Star Spangled Banner . " ' Mr. Blake replied : " But a song here is entirely out of place ; it will be an interruption to the course of the play , and on this occasion I can not consent to its introduction . We can not sacrifice the play on that account . " Mr. Jones replied : " Mr. Blake , if I am to play this part I must sing The Star Spangled Banner . ' My name has invariably been in the bills with the addition of this line : In which he will sing The Star Spangled Banner . " ' Mr. Blake persevered in his denial of the request , when Jones drew himself up to his full height , which , by the bye , was not above five feet four , and majestically said : " Mr. Blake , I wish it to be recorded that I insist upon being billed as singing The Star Spangled Banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the bill he wrote " The Character of so and so by Mr. Jones , in which he insists upon singing The Star Spangled Banner ! Thomas Placide.
