ARTICLE 111. - PROGRESS AND POVERTY IN POLITICS . EIGHT years ago Mr. George published his " Inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions , and of the increase of want with the increase of wealth , " together with " The Remedy . " Few authors have undertaken a more ambitions task . No man could set before him a more important problem or one the solution of which would be more likely to benefit the human race . If poverty could be abolished , and progress go on without it , little else would remain to be wished for in the way of temporal happiness on the earth . It is not surprising , therefore , that the author painted the results of his doctrine in glowing colors . " To remove want and the fear of want , " said he , " to give to all classes leisure and comfort and independence , the decencies and refinements of life , the opportunities of mental and moral development , would be like turning water into the desert . The sterile waste would clothe itself with verdure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would ere long be dappled with the shade of trees and musical with the song of birds . Talents now hidden , virtues unsuspected , would come forth to make human life richer , fuller , happier , nobler . . Consider the possibilities of a state of society that gave that opportunity to all ! Let imagination fill out the picture ; its colors grow too bright for words to paint . . . . Consider these things , and then say whether the change I propose would not be for the benefit of everyone , " ( page 423 . ) Yet the book was not entirely filled with rhetoric . It was a treatise on Economics . It discussed the laws which regulate wages , capital , distribution , population , and material progress . It was based in great part upon the doctrines of Ricardo and John Stuart MilL The reasoning was abstract and often ingenious . The dialectical power of the author was fascinating and seductive . The scientific method of the book excited the attention of scholars , while its beneficent aim attracted philanthropists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon all who read it , whether they agreed with its conclusions or not . // The book made its author suddenly famous . Mr. George was at that time forty years of age . He had been born in Philadelphia , where his father , a clerk in the custom-house , had struggled to give his large family the best opportunities that his scanty means would allow . Henry George , the oldest of the family , had at an early age gone to sea and worked before the mast on a ship bound to Australia and the East Indies . Upon his return home he entered a printing office , but in 1857 again shipped as an ordinary seaman to California . After his arrival there he first went to British Columbia with a party of miners , but being disappointed in the gold fields soon returned to California and again entered a printing office . Here he stayed until his twenty-first year , when he became a journeyman compositor . Seven years after that , in 1867 , he was appointed a reporter upon a daily paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor . In 1868 he was offered the editorship of another paper but lost this position on account of his opposition to the great Pacific Railway corporation . Tn 1871 he started , in company with two friends , the San Francisco Post , but dissolved his connection with the paper in 1875 . In that year he received an appointment to a state office , that of Gas Inspector , which has been described as being something of a sinecure . Whether that was the case or not , it was during his incumbency of that office that he obtained time to write the book which first made him famous . From the year 1879 to the present the doctrines of " Progress and Poverty " have been familiar to all who are interested in social problems . The book has been read by many to whom Political Economy is still " the dismal science , " and it has been circulated in cheap editions by the thousand among the classes to which it holds out such an alluring prospect . " Progress and Poverty " has become a classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by many who see in them a means of personal rescue from distress and want , but by many others who are convinced by the reasoning of the author . Clergymen , in the Catholic as well as in the Protestant church , have become his disciples , and business and professional men have gladly sat at his feet . // After the publication of " Progress and Poverty , " Mr. George traveled abroad , and took an active part in the Irish land agitation . He was known , however , simply as a man of letters , a theorist , an abstract thinker , until the fall of 1886 . In that year he entered suddenly upon a new career . The philosopher , the man of the closet , was suddenly put forward as a candidate for the mayoralty of New York , and thrust into the heat of an active and vigorous political campaign . The man who was known only as the ingenious and eloquent originator of an economic theory , so radical and so contrary tcr existing interests and prejudices that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly became the leader of a political party . It , therefore , becomes important to enquire what this party is , and what the tendency of Mr. George 's teachings in practical politics has hitherto been . His economic theories , which have already been fully discussed , become of minor importance when compared with his influence upon the problems of the day . The campaign of 1886 undoubtedly had its rise in the labor agitations which were going on all over the country in the beginning of that year . In the spring there occurred the great strike on the Southwestern System ; then came the home car strikes in New York City , while all over the country labor organizations multiplied rapidly , and the boycott was frequently used as a means of industrial coercion . For a time labor organizations seemed supreme . It was difficult in many cases for the employers to resist the pressure which was thus suddenly put upon them , and the very novelty of the weapon used made it formidable . In July , however , some of the leading men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Sing-Sing and served there for 100 days before being pardoned by Gov . Hill . It was out of this and other boycott prosecutions that the Henry George campaign grew . As the author of the history of this campaign says , in speaking of the working men , " They had battled blindly in strikes and boycotts , feeling the touch of a hostile hand they could not see ; but the prosecutions came to them like a flash of light in the darkness , revealing the source of their oppression in the law // and an all-potent remedy in the ballot . " * In other words , the labor organizations , finding that one of their most dreaded weapons was liable to be blunted and dulled by the law , determined to change that law , if possible . The first steps in this direction were taken by the Central Labor Union , an organization made up of delegates from the various trades-unions of New York . This organization , on July 11th , 1886 , appointed a committee on political action . This committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be attended by delegates from every trade and labor organization which had been in existence for six months prior to the call of the conference , the committee " believing that by united action on the . part of the workers , honest men can be elected to administer the affairs of government , and the laws can be enforced for rich and poor alike . " The conference was held on August 5th , and was attended by 402 delegates , representing 165 labor organizations , claiming a membership of fifty thousand people . The conference , after expressing itself in favor of independent action , adjourned to Augnst 19th , when it appointed a permanent organization committee of seven . As soon as political action had been decided upon , Mr. George 's name was suggested and received with great favor by the delegates . He was accordingly asked whether , in case he were nominated , he would contest the mayoralty of New York . In reply to this request Mr. George sent a long letter , dated August 26th , in which he stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would nevertheless consent to stand , provided thirty thousand citizens should , over their signatures , pledge themselves to vote for him . More than the requisite number of signatures were secured and he was nominated for mayor on the 23d of September . The platform which was adopted by the conference contained seven articles . The first , which is in the nature of an introduction , appeals to the statement made in the Declaration of Independence that " all men are created equal , " and condemns " the system which compels men to pay their fellow * " The George-Hewitt campaign , " compiled by L. F. Post and F. C. Leubuecher , p. 4. // creatures for the use of God 's gifts to all . " In the second sec. tion the party demands " the abolition of the system which makes such beneficent inventions as the railroad and telegraph a means for the oppression of the people , " and declares " the true purpose of government to be the maintenance of that sacred right of property which gives to everyone opportunity to employ his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The third section deals mainly with local reforms , and demands that the people of New York shall have full control of their local affairs ; that grand jurors shall no more be drawn from a single class ; that the procedure of courts shall be simplified , the officious intermeddling of the police with peaceful assemblages stopped , and the laws for the safety and sanitary inspection of buildings enforced ; that direct employment shall be preferred to contract work , and that equal pay shall be given for equal work without distinction of sex . The fourth article introduces Henry George 's land theory . It protests against the crowding of so many people into narrow tenements and 4emands the abolition of the taxes on buildings and their imposition upon land alone . The fifth section goes further and says that the enormous value given to the land of the city by the presence of a million and a half of people properly belongs to the community , and that it should be taken in taxation . This section also demands that the existing means of transit shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public benefit . The sixth section favors a constitutional convention and a reform in the machinery of elections . The seventh section is simply an exhortation , calling upon all citizens who desire honest government to join us in an effort to secure it , and to show for once that the will of the people may prevail even against the money and organization of banded spoilsmen . " The platform , it will be noticed , adopts Henry George 's theory in toto , but also advocates a number of other schemes , some of them of simply local importance and purely administrative in their character , others decidedly socialistic , as , for instance , the expropriation of the horse car lines . But nothing is said with regard to the boycott prosecutions , which , as already stated , were the original cause of the movement . // The nomination of Mr. George undoubtedly forced the nominations by Tammany Hall and the County Democracy of Mr. Hewitt , and by the Republicans of Mr. Roosevelt . Thus there was a triangular battle , but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of whom regarded the other as his principal opponent . It is needless to enter into the history of the campaign in detaiL A somewhat extended public correspondence took place between Mr. George and Mr. Hewitt , the former challenging Mr. Hewitt to a public debate and the latter declining it . Many speeches were made on both sides , and numerous out-of-door meetings held by the George party . The campaign on Mr. Hewitt 's side was waged mainly on the line of opposition to the disintegrating and somewhat socialistic views of Mr. George , while the latter devoted himself in the main to the advocacy of his land theory . Frequent references were made to municipal reforms , such as a better control of the police force the promotion of purity and honesty in administration , etc. , but most of Mr. George 's speeches seemed to lay the principal stress upon the abolition of private property in land , a measure upon the execution of which the mayor of New York could , of course , not exercise the slightest influence . The result of the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it gave him 68,110 votes as against 90,552 obtained by Mr. Hewitt and 60,435 obtained by Mr. Roosevelt . The campaign was , as Mr. George expressed it , a Bunker Hill for the labor party . It undoubtedly did more for its success than a victory would have done , for it gave it all the prestige of being able to command an enormous vote , while relieving it from the responsibility of putting into operation any of the numerous reforms which It had advocated in it platform . Steps were accordingly taken to make the organization per manent , and on the 6th of November , only four days after the election , a meeting was held for this purpose at Cooper Union . A central committee of three , consisting of John MeMackin , the Rev. Edward McGlynn , D.D. , and Professor David B. Scott , was appointed to act , until a national conference , to be called by it , should choose a permanent committee . // The platform was almost entirely taken up with the land question . To be sure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands purity of elections ; it also has a good deal to say about the brotherhood of man and social justice . But its pith lies in the section which says : " We hold that the value which attaches to the surface of the earth , by reason of the growth of population , belongs to society at large , and we propose , therefore , to abolish all taxation upon buildings , improvements , and all other things of human production , and by taxation on the value of land alone to provide for purposes of common necessity and benefit . " It also declares war on the system " which hands over public works to corporate control , and permits such beneficent agencies as the railroad and the telegraph to be made the means of robbing the producer , and of enabling railroad kings and stock gamblers to throttle business and dictate laws . " It will be noticed that , though the campaign really originated in the boycott convictions and in the aims of the labor organizations of New York , it gradually became detached from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy mainly upon the land question . The movement , however , is not over , though the polls are closed . One of the means of prosecuting the campaign was journalism , and two daily newspapers were established to aid Mr. George 's contest for the mayoralty . One of these was called the " Day " and the other the " Leader . " The " Day " went into eclipse at the end of the campaign , but the " Leader " still leads , and is apparently intended to occupy a permanent place among the dailies of New York . In addition to this , a small monthly paper , called the Tax Reformer , " is is sued to popularize Mr. George 's ideas , while Mr. George himself has begun the publication of a weekly newspaper called the " Standard , " the first number of which was issued on the eighth of January of this year . Thus both Henry George himself and the leaders of his party have had occasion to express themselves frequently upon the issues of the day , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical problems that are constantly pressing for solution in the world of labor . As regards the laud question , there is no doubt whatever as // to the practical measures which Henry George would adopt were he in a position to control legislation . That he has stated very distinctly in his book . His remedy for the poverty which exists is simple confiscation . In " Progress and Poverty " ( page 364 ) he says , " What I , therefore , propose , as the simple yet sovereign remedy , which will raise wages , increase the earnings of capital , extirpate pauperism , abolish poverty , give remunerative employment to whoever wishes it , afford free scope to human powers , lessen crime , elevate morals , and taste , and intelligence , purify government and carry civilization to yet nobler heights , is to appropriate rent by taxation ; " and again , in speaking of the claim of land owners to compensation , he says , ( page 326 ) : " By the time the people of any such country as England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disadvantages of individual ownership of land to induce them to attempt its nationalization , they will be sufficiently aroused to nationalize it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase . They will not trouble themselves about compensating the proprietors of laud . " He does not go quite as far as Proudhon , who said , " property is robbery , " but he does maintain that property in land is robbery . He says , " It is a fresh and continuous robbery , that goes on every day and every hour . It is a toll levied upon labor constantly and continuously , " ( page 327 ) . The practical aims , therefore , of Henry George are simply , in respect to land , to take the value of laud in the form of taxation without giving any compensation to its present owners . This same idea is carried out in the salutatory article of the " Standard , " in which he says : " What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual . " Though the " Standard " is published mainly to aid the theories of Mr. George , it is obliged also to take notice of questions of more immediate and practical value . In the second number of his paper , he denounced the conviction of Spies and the other Chicago anarchists and claimed that they were convicted " by a jury chosen in a manner so shamelessly illegal that it would be charity to suspect the judge of incompetency ; " and he says further : " An opinion more dangerous to society than // that men who teach unpopular doctrines may be silenced by illegal convictions of infamous crimes could hardly be conceived . " It is not necessary to discuss the evidence in the anarchist cases . Mr. George is perfectly right in demanding a fair trial , even for anarchists ; but the interesting part of the article is that he alludes to people who confessedly advocated murder as " men who teach unpopular doctrines . " There are strong words of condemnation for the haste and injustice of society , when alarmed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of as " an unpopular doctrine . " Shortly after the " Standard " had begun its publication , there occurred the strike against the Old Dominion steamship line and the coal strikes , accompanied by the general strike of the longshoremen and frei*ht handlers in New York . In speaking of these in the issue of February 5tl* , Henry George says : " I think it a fight in the dark ; the blind push of men squeezed beyond endurance . I think it the first passive form of a civil war which steel-clad forts and armor-plated ships can not guard us against  --  the kindling of passions and the arraying of forces that , aroused to full energy , may give cities to the flames and destroy our very civilization itself . " In the issue of February 12 he says , on the same subject : " To be sure , third parties , who have no direct interest in the quarrel , suffer , and frequently the greatest sufferers are the men who thus go out to help their fellows , but if the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing employers to hesitate before engaging in another such contest , are likely to be more decisive and effective . " " As for the morality of strikes , " he says , " It is simply that of any other application of coercive force ; " and again , " Admonitions are not wanting that in these industrial wars ( for they are nothing else ) there is a growing disposition to resort to more violent measures . And whether right or wrong , the growth of this disposition is natural . " And in speaking of the right of strikers to coerce others into stopping work , he says , " When our forefathers struck against England , they not merely struck themselves , but compelled every one else they could to join them , first by " moral suasion , " which amounted to ostracism , and then by such measures a*#**ring and feathering , harrying , and shooting . " // April , It seems somewhat strange that , in view of such sentences as these , which seem to favor the violence of strikes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which refused to dismiss the suit of the Old Dominion Company against the Knights of Labor for damage to their business , say : " Judge Brown 's opinion is , we are inclined to think , good law , and , what is still more important , it is certainly good sense . " But he goes on to say , " It is perfectly true , as an abstract proposition , that no one ought to be permitted to interfere with the legitimate business of another , or by going out of his own right to inflict or threaten injury or loss as a means of coercion . Yet it is also true that , under existing conditions , it is only by combining together to interfere with the legitimate business of others , and to coerce others by the fear of injury or loss , that workmen are at all able to resist the tendency to crowd wages down to the point of bare existence. ** Throughout the whole paper Mr. George shows this tendency to bring all the water he can to his own mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages anarchy or dynamite or even violence and coercion on the part of strikers , he certainly welcomes them as an argument in favor of his theory . One can not help contrasting such utterances as these with the expressions used by some other men who are prominent in the labor movement . Mr. Arthur , for instance , the Chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , distinctly denounces strikes and uses his influence against them , and has been the means , as is well known , of preventing the engineers from joining in many strikes in which other railroad men were engaged . This was notably the case during the great strike on the Southwestern System in t886 , when the locomotive engineers did their best to run trains in spite of the threats and violence of the Knights of Labor . One can not help contrasting Mr. George 's utterances , even , with those of Mr. Powderly , who , though not natnrally so conservative as Mr. Arthur , and though at times yielding to the pressure of his own society , has nevertheless often denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole period of the coal handlers ' strikes , did not write a line to prevent them or to urge the men to adopt more reasonable and more profitable // methods , but justified them by references to the Revolutionary War , while they were in progress , and , after they had failed , took them as a text for driving home his land theory . The " Leader " which is , as already stated , the official organ of the new labor party and calls itself the " Organ of Organized Labor " aided and abetted the coal strike to its utmost , and even claimed , when it was all over , and the men who had engaged in it were anxiously seeking employment in places that had already been filled by others , that the movement was on the whole a success . It is , of course , too early to pass a final judgment either on Mr. George or on the labor party , but we can safely put on record the direction in which he seems to be moving at present . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any degree the predatory character of his land doctrine as advocated in his book . With regard to the contest between the labor organizations and the employers , which have been so numerous during the past year , his position is on the whole favorable to violence and to interference with the personal liberty of those who are outside of the rank of organized labor . His position is no longer that of a philanthropist , advocating with earnestness and sincerity an extreme measure not likely to be adopted ; it is that of an agitator who , instead of exercising his powerful influence in the interests of harmony and good-will and self-restraint , as do many of the leaders of the better class of trades-unions , distinctly appeals to the more unruly and violent portion o* his constituency .
