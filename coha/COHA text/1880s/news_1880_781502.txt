txt Mr. TILDEN 'S enemies , after holding a wake over his political remains and burying him , are now engaged in blackening his memory . If they are sure that the old man is fairly out of politics , why do they not let him alone ? . Republicans , who believe and know that TILDEN is a power in affairs , may be excused if they continue to treat him with reference to this theory . But the Democrats have not only informed Mr. TILDEN , by formal resolution , that he has been retired , ' but they have been at the trouble of going to him to tell him that he is as good as dead , and that he need not attempt to rise again . If , then , he is so very dead , why does not the Democratic press let him rest in that silence which all civilized people accord to the defunct ? So far from this , however , the enforced silence of many of the managers of the party seems to have been unsealed by the repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of complainants drag forward again the cipher dispatches , and , forgetting that they pooh-poohed the whole business as a Republican invention , they insist that TILDEN conducted the whole conspiracy , was familiar with all its details , and selfishly put the responsibility therefor upon a poor dependent , who went uncomplainingly to his grave , weighted down with an obloquy which he might , at least , have divided with another if he had opened his mouth . Then , again , " the Tilden party , " which is TILDEN , is accused of demanding the most unheard-of concessions before their support of the Hancock ticket can be promised . It is alleged by Democrats that Cabinet places , the Federal patronage in NewYork , and the re-election of Speaker RAN DALL were among the concessions which were required as the price of Tildenism for FaNcocir . If these things had been said by Republicans , they would have been set down to party spite . Being of Democratic origin , they are more difficult to deal with . The Tilden party , however , have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the National Committee is concerned . We have Democratic authority for saying that as soon as HANCOCK was nominated , the men nearest to Mr. TILDEN took steps to secure the re-election of BARNUM . W bile the overjoyed anti-Tildenites were cheering for the success of the nominee , wild with joy to think they had at last " got rid of the old man , " the aforesaid old man was quietly at work with his slate and pencil , figuring out the means by which he couldleep his hold on the party machinery . It is well known that Gen. HANCOCK desired that Senator WALLACE should be Chairman of the National Committee . Usually , the wishes of a candidate , in these matters , determine the choice . But TILDEN was in the way . His choice was ex-Senator BAR-Num , and the Tilden party , it is reported on Democratic authority , " were even prepared to go to the extent of antagonizing HANCOCK himself . " But as the nominee was not prepared to precipitate a conflict , and he was not especially determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is known as " the Tilden gang , " and there was no open rupture . HANCOCK ' s friends congratulate themselves on having the Tilden men where they dare not skulk . They have pushed themselves to the fronts and they must fight or be openly disgraced . And it is cheerfully said by the anti-Tilden party that if HANCOCK should be elected he will be strong-minded enough to prevent the Tilden-Barnum coterie from running his Administration . And to this amiable and highly-esteemed leader of the Democratic Party the two Central Committees went , the other day , to tell him that his refusal to become a candidate for renomination was " an act of self-denying patriotism . " This is the first time in the history of American politics that a defeated candidate , or a man who has refused to be a candidate , has been complimented for his " selfdenial . " What did Mr. TILDEN deny himself ? The privilege of being again a candidate ? And if so , why was his act patriotic , as the Democratic committees declared it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at TILDEN 'S being finally out of the Presidential race . They even took occasion to remind him that he would be followed into his " retirement " by the inexpensive good wishes of his party associates . But , first , last , and all the time , they insisted that he was as good'as dead . He might as well tie up his chin , make his peace with all mankind , and climb up to his appointed shelf and wait for the last trump . No more fooling with politics for him . To their chagrin , he refuses to be dead . His hand is everywhere apparent . He has his axes to grind , his revenges to gratify . No man sees more clearly than Mr. TILDEN that in refusing to renominate him , in spite of his farewell letter , or in. consequence of that remarkable document , his party have thrown away the only political capital they had . TILDEN , and him defrauded , was the sole plank in their platform . In a moment of time this was made valueless . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to laugh at the absurd position of his party . Before the campaign is over , the men who went to bury him will be amazed at his activity .
