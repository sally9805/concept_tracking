txt When the two " sluggers " of the House went out into the lobby a day or two ago to polish each other off for hard . words that had passed between them everybody assumed that the branch of Congress nearest the people was asserting an indifference to dignity that the Senate could never be guilty of . But that was a mistake . The demoralizing effect of a session prolonged until the dog days was made apparent in the Senate this afternoon , just before the august body adjourned , in a parliamentary " scrapping match " between Mr. Ingalls , of Kansas , and Mr. Miller , of New-York . It was all about oleomargarine . Mr. Butler , of South Carolina , had been making a speech against taxing oleomargarine , and had taken up the section that permits the use of coloring matter in the manufacture of genuine butter . This he did not quite understand , but he thought it was an attempt to permit a fraud under cover of legislation . Mr. Ingalls , who was allowed . to interrupt Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed . in the preparation of honest dairy products . Then , in his deliberate and studied way , he took from a package a small vial containing a butter-coloring preparation made at Burlington , Vt. , and . with delightful humor he read the directions for its use , the cautionary labels and . admonitions , and finally dwelt upon the fact , asserted by the wrapper , that it would increase the value of every pound of butter at least 5 cents . The laughter during this speech was hearty and frequent , and . no one appeared to enjoy it more than Mr. Edmunds , who listened to Mr. Ingalls 's oft-repeated statement that this wonderful decoction of butter was manufactured at Burlington , Vt. , and then reached over to take in his hand and . examine the vial which Mr. Ingalls had held . in his hand . while he enacted his comedy . There was one Senator , however , who did not take the sarcastic speech on the honest dairyman 's use of coloring matter as ajoke . That was Mr. Ingalls 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plainly mad when he rose to speak . The Senators all around the semicircle opened their eyes and exchanged winks and nods as Mr. Miller went plunging at Mr. Ingalls , suggesting doubts as to his early training and comparing him to a peddler of quack medicines at a country fair . Then he referred to the Kansas Senator 's fondness for red neckties and patent leather shoes , likening that preference to the taste of butter consumers for a product of a uniform color . The mischievous Senators on both sides saw that a collision was inevitable , and they signified their willingness to let the unpleasantness develop . Mr. Butler had risen and was about to go on . " Sit down , Butler , " shouted one , and . " Hold on , give Ingalls a chance , " called out another . Mr. Butler subsided . Mr. Ingalls , who had taken a little promenade at the back of the Senate and returned to his seat with fire flashes in his spectacled eyes , got the floor and presently made things very lively for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York , " he began , " is very like the attempt of a hippopotamus to dance on a slack rope . But I do n't complain of that . " He had stood in the presence of products of the dairy with a feeling of terror at their strength , and of awe and reverence for their antiquity . Turning toward Mr. Miller ho hissed out the preface to his serious remarks with a statement that the Senator had seen fit to allude to his younger days , that provoked a personal reply . I have this to say in reply , " he declared , with distinctness , " that whatever I may have done , I have never gone before the Senate of the United States in behalf of a Pleasure in which I had the strongest personal interest , as the Senator from New-York has . He is in the dairy business , runs a dairy farm , has a herd of dairy cattle , and he puts his products in the market as the proceeds of Oak Hill or Oak Hill Creamery . He uses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Agriculture to get this measure out of it , affording him a chance to increase directly the prices of his own products . " The Kansas Senator rose from the bending position in which he had stood , with his hands both resting on his desk , and straightening his spare form he put one hand on each hip , with the elbows standing out aggressively . I did not make any reference to the Senator from New-York , " he went on , " nor to any one else , " and . he paused to hear an assertion to the contrary . " But , " he said , " if he desires or thinks it is possible to pursue this subject on personal grounds , I will not say who shall have the worst of it . : A. more shameful spectacle was never presented to the American people than this measure introduced in the other House under the leadership of a Chairman in the dairy business with herds and farins , and with products , that he sells in the markets , and on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chairman of the Committee of Agriculture , who is engaged in the same business , and . who is to profit if this bill can be forced through this body by the legislation he is seeking to promote . " He had . heard of greedy attorneys , working and voting improperly and indecently for laud grant railroads , " but , " said he , " if that is improper , how much more indefensible is it for the Chairmen of committees of the two Houses to present measures in which they have direct personal interests , and when argument is made against them , to descend into the arena of vulgar personality in order to make the passage of the bill less obnoxious . " Mr. Ingalls sat down after this last hot shot , and Mr. Butler rose to resume . Mr. Vance and Mr. Beck , noticing that Mr. Miller was slowly getting upon his feet , called out : " Hold on , Butler ; let ' em have it out " Mr. Butler rather reluctantly subsided again , and the Senators and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Miller . The reply of the New-York Senator evidently came from a man thoroughly angered . His face was white with indignation . His voice trembled as he spoke . It took two or three minutes for him to repress the temptation to burst upon the Kansas Senator . " He charges me with being directly interested in the measure , " he shouted . " Mr. President , I am proud of the fact that I was born and reared on a farm and of the fact that I now make my home on a farm . It is true that , for my delectation , I keep a few cows and horses , and that at some periods of the year I make butter and at some other periods I make cheese . " " That 's it , " said Mr. Beck , in an undertone . " He wants to increase the price of his butter . " " It is also true , " went on Mr. Miller , " that I have expended , $10 to improve for every one that I have earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one farthing to what I shall receive . Whatever butter there is raised on my farm sells at prices so high that they can not be affected by the competition of oleomargarine . I have no answer to the implication of the Senator from Kansas that I am influenced by base or corrupt motives . Having been born and lived among the dairy classes , whose farms are in the hands of the Sheriff , I felt called upon to vote in their behalf , and no sneers or implications that I am actuated by base or corrupt motives will affect me . I appeal from this infamous charge to my constituents and not to any man on this floor who makes the charges . " In a loud and . menacing tone and with great excitement he added : ? Those are words that he nor no other man dare speak to me outside these walls . " He intimated that the Senate Chamber might shield the man . who would assail him , but elsewhere there would be no protection for him . Mr. Butler rose with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " I had . no idea , " he said , " of stopping to let iu such heated controversy or to hear , as Mr. Miller had . suggested , that Mr. Ingalls and . I were engaged in a conspiracy . " Mr. Miller declared that that assertion was mere pleasantry . Mr. Butler assumed that many other things that had . been said hastily - would be forgotten , as soon as the Senators got out of the chamber , and soon after , ' without malting any further progress with the bill , the Senate adjourned . There is no probability that Mr. Miller and . Mr. Ingalls will resort to the Cobb-Laird sort of sets tlement of their controversy . *4* On . tae recommendation of the Committee on Rules the House of Representatives agreed today to hold a session this evening for the consideration of bills reported from the Post Office Committee . Some of these measures are of considerable importance , and it was hoped . that they - would be passed , but the sitting proved of small - value . Only one bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law relating to the issue of postal notes as to provide that such notes shall be payable at any , money order office authorized by the Postmaster-General to pay them , and also to empower the Postmaster-General to designate Post Offices for the issue of postal notes only , independently of money orders . This bill was passed without trouble , and the House then took up the bill to extend the free delivery system to all cities having a population of 10,000 and the Post Offices of which yielded a gross postal revenue for the fiscal year prior to the establishment of not leas than ** The bal had not * * Treasurer Jordan willitellthe Senate Finance Committee to-morrow why he believes that it would be bad policy to enact into law the Morrison surplus resolution . His arguments will be clear and strong , but , unfortunately , there is very little reason to believe that they will prove effective . The supporters of the resolution reckon with confidence upon the votes of six of the eleven members of the committee in favor of recommending its passage by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vance , and Voorhees , Democrats , and Messrs .

It is believed that the report of the committee - will be adopted by the Senate , but not until after a hard . fight . An attempt will be made to so amend the resolution as to make it impossible for the $100,000,000 held to secure the outstanding United States notes to be touched by carrying out its provisions , and various other modifications will be suggested ; but if the friends of the resolution are strong enough to carry it at all , they will brobably refuse to accept any amendment .

Among the Democrats who are counted as opposed to the measure are Messrs . , Gray , Gorman , and Wilson of Maryland , and the two South Carolina Senators , Butler and Hampton . Some of the Republican Senators expected to support the resolution are Messrs . Allison , Cullom , Blair , Bowen , Teller , and Jones of Nevada . It is not . certain , however , that Mr. Allison will vote for the measure in the Senate , as it is asserted that his vote in the committee will be east with a view to getting the matter in such shape that the Senate may dispose of it . It is possible that if the discussion of the resolution promises to be long enough to delay the adjournment of Congress , an agreement may be made to postpone its consideration until next Winter , but most of the Senators will be surprised . if the resolution does not go to the President within the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
