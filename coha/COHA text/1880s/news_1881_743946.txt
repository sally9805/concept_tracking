txt Dr. Bliss said to THE Teems 's correspondent at 10:30 to-night : " The President has made good progress - Wiley . He is improving slowly , of course , but certainly . His pulse is now 100 , and he is sleeping quietly . He is in a very nice condition every way . I gave him a bath , and he went to sleep instantly . He has partaken Liberally of food in good variety . He has had the breast of three reed birds minced fine , beefsteak , squirrel soup , bouillon , milk porridge , &c.,; besides the stimulating enemata . We have studied to present to him , without previously consulting him or asking his advice , as great a variety of nutritious diet as possible , and we find that the plan has acted welL " " Has he said anything more about his proposed removal ? " " He discussed it again and expressed his wishes about certain things that he wanted attended to . I may say that every one of the surgeons desire that he shall be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that we were unanimous to-day . We were also unanimous as to the locality to which we will take him . We consulted . with him and with Mrs. Garfield also on this point , and they both expressed their preference for Long Branch . That place also was our own choice . We are informed that the climate is very salubrious and that September and October are specially fine months on that coast . Befides , he can get many comforts and appliances there that he can get nowhere else . The house that has been selected is described As having very large rooms and plenty of them and as being provided with fire-places and radiators , so that we can regulate the temperalure there as well as here . " " Where is the house , Doctor ? " " It is one of the Elberon cottages , where he was before . " " What conclusion was come to as to the anode of transportation ? " " We decided upon rail , and it was further agreed that the arrangements in detail should be completed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start some fine morning without a great deal of notice . Of course , there will be some notice . We could not expect to get away without the fact being known . " " How will you carry him to the depot ? f ' " The railroad people have made propositions In regard to cars and other transportation details , and there has been some consultation with them . It has been suggested that it may be more convenient to lay a temporary track to the main track from the White House and at the other end to the cottage . Suppose , for instance , that when we were ready to start a rain-storm should set in , or suppose it should only threaten here , and when we arrived at the Branch we should find it coming down , we could not carry him a quarter of a mile from tha cars to the house . He would simply be cabined on the track . The surgeons will not take any such risks . The railroad company will be obliged to provide means of transshipment as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . I will say that if a temporary track were laid we could take him away much earlier than otherwise , In that case , I would as stem take him to the Sixth-street depot as to the track at the Washing-ten Monument . except that we will be less Likely to be annoyed by crowds in selecting the latter route . " Then you propose to go by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad , and not by the Baltimore and Ohio ? " " Yes , certainly . " " Doctor , it has been suggested that the long tunnel on the former road might prove a serious annoyance . Do you fear anything of the kind ? " " No , not at all . A Pullman car , with only three or four persons in it , even if closed up tightly for 15 or 20 minutes . will not cause much inconvenience . One proposition is to put the locomotive in the rear of the train . Another is to burn anthracite coaL and to Place the Presidential car three cars back . The railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is no reason wh ? we should nob follow their advice . They know best . " " How fast will you run ? " " The railroad men say that they can run a mile in one and a half minutes with much less oscillation than at any other rate . They promise to laud us at Elberon in six hours . " " Do you anticipate any annoyance from crowds at Baltimore . Philadelphia , and other large cities en route ? " " They might not know when to expect us . We will send a request along the line that no demonstration , such as cheering or noise of any kind , be made during our passage . Any other excitement incident to traveling I do not fear . The President himself expresses the utmost confidence in his ability to bear the ride . I do not suppose that the people will try to mob the train . " When will you start ? " " That has not been determined , except that it will be as soon as all arrangements are completed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that score . " " Is the President in condition to be removed to-morrow ? " " I should not consent to move him tomorrow . As be is gaining every day , why should we not keep him here until all cause for anxiety should cease to exist ? He might , of course , be safely transported at once , but there are certain local features of his case that are constantly improving , and he will consequently be in better shape a few days hence than now . " " Will all the surgeons accompany him ? " " Yes , that is , Dr. Hamilton , who went to New-York to-day , will not return unless we should not remove the President by Thursday . But Dr. Agnew and the other four surgeons will go on the train . " " Will the four attending surgeons remain at Long Branch ? " " They certainly will for the present . 1 should insist upon it , as I do n't think the time has come for throwing extra responsibility upon any of us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's journey , is it not ? ' " Yes , I suppose so . He wants to go to Mentor , and I suppose he will be taken there , say in four or six weeks , as the case may be , when he gets well enough to bear the journey . " " It was reported in New-York that the President was feeling a little worse this morning . Is that so ? " " He generally is worse there than here . I certainly did Rot observe anything of the kind . He has had a better day all through than yesterday . His pulse is now full and round , and he sleeps quietly and easily . When I left him he was lying on his side . " " Is the wound making any progress ? " " The wound is healing . It is evidently growing smaller . The outside is closing , but the process is slow , of course . There is granulation , but not so much as before the relapse . The important thing is that we can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . When Dr. Agnew returned the last time and saw the President , before examining the wound , he immediately said : He is better than when I went away . ' Three days ' absence enables a person to observe changes better than those who are constantly by a patient 's side . " What about the gland to-night ? " " That is doing splendidly . It is constantly decreasing in size and even healing . There was a little sloughing of the cellular tissue , as is common in inflictions of that character , but much . less than we expected . I cut off to-day some of the adherent core which is too tough yet to pull out . " " Will the President 's face be disfigured ? " " Not a bit . He will not even have a scar that will be noticeable . We ca n't sea the upper incision now unless we sponge it freely , and the other cuts will heal equally well . " " Will there be any danger of death ensuing on the journey to Long Branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " None whatever . He could not have a relapse without preliminary local excitement . Should such show itself we would not move him . If it develops in transit , it could not terminate fatally until we got there . " Dr. Boynton was asked to-night by Tan TIMES 'S correspondent how soon the removal will take place . Ho answered , " Certainly within 72 hours . The precise time , " he added , " will depend upon the ability of the railroad people to get the cars ready . They will decide that point when they come here . " This last allusion is to the pending arrival of VicePresident Cassatt , of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company , who is coming to-night for the purpose of arranging the details of transportation . The Doctor 's attention was called to the fact that he was quoted locally as saying that the President 's condition had not improved since Sunday . " I did say , " he responded , " that there had been no perceptible improvement in his condition since Sunday . He did gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at a stand-still , holding his own , which is all that we could ask . He is a very weak man yet . The gland has done splendidly . The swelling is now nearly gone . Another good thing is that this morning the wound was found to be discharging better . It had nearly dried up , but we got considerable pus from it this morning , and there was enough this evening to wet the dressing . The President had a bad morning . He was languid and depressed , but he has since recovered . I suppose the atmosphere , which was warm and hazy , had something to do with it . " It is understood that Dr. Hamilton will go to Lone Branch and look after the little details necessary to the President 's - comfort at that end of the route . A survey was made of the Baltimore and Potomac tracks near the Washington Monument this evening , with a view to measuring the curves necessary for the proposed temporary track . Preparations are going on busily at the White House for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday morning next . Dr:ieAgnew told a friend in this city to-day that he believed the President would ultimately recover .
