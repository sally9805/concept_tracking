txt The following extracts from a private letter received here from a gentleman residing in the town of Aiken , S. C. , will give an idea of the manner in which the Democrats carried Aiken and other counties in that State : " The Democrats , mostly mounted , were in town early , but were preceded by a large number of colored men , who were waiting for the poll to open . The Democratic Board of Managers controlled the poll and blockaded it by the erection of a hoard fence 20 feet in length in front of the window opposite which the ballot-box stood , the passage between the fence and window being only about two feet wide . The voters were required to press into the narrow passage thus formed in order to deposit their ballots . There was not sufficient room for two lines to form , and as a white man will not stand in the same line with negroes , a systematic crowding and pushing was started and maintained by the whites , the purpose being to provoke a collision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach the poll , and as each black man reached the window to deposit his ballot he was asked a number of irrelevant questions , merely for the purpose of consuming time , and when all the questions were satisfactorily answered the voter was informed that le must get a white man to identify him before his vote could be accepted . In this way the day was consumed , and when the time came for closing the poll hundreds of black men were turned away without having been given an opportunity to deposit their votes . During the day five colored men were stabbed in the back while quietly standing . in line awaiting their turn to vote . The Democrats had drawn up directly opposite the poll a large cannon , and the threat was frequently made that if the colored people raised any disturbance they would be swept from the street . In this town ( Aiken ) there were 1,104 votes cast , of which 719 were given to the Democrats and 385 to the Republicans . This is the first the Democrats have received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown by the fact that the census just taken shows that the entire population is only 2.045 . A number of Democrats voted as many as five times , some of those guilty of the crime being well-known business men . " The returns for the county indicate that a total of 4,972 Democratic votes were cast , and that the majority for the Democratic ticket is 3,483 , a number far in excess of their bona fide vote . At many polling-places in the county there were no Republican ballots cast , for the reason that the Democrats forcibly took the Republican tickets from the ticket-bearers and burned them . One United States Supervisor was beaten and driven from the poll , and others were driven away by threats of personal violence . * * * Honest Democrats of the N'orth would blush to witness the practices of their Southern allies . A young lawyer , end a Democrat , from New-York , who is here for the benefit of his health , was so shocked at the brutality exhibited by the Democrats in this county on election day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a letter to Senator Conkling describing and denouncing the shameful proceedings of South Carolina Democrats .
