txt The dispatches from Europe reiterating Mr. Blaine 's determination not to be a candidate for President do not entirely destroy the hope of Blaine mon that be will yet be the candidate . but Moy shake the confidence of some of his admirers in their own belief that ho did not mean all that he wrote in his Florence letter . Mr. Phelps , who Insisted from the first that Mr. Blaine meant to be understood as refusing to accept a nomination now insists just as positively that the Republicans have the very serious task ou their hands of deciding upon the man who is to lead the fight In November . Judging from the utterances of seine New-York Republicans that choice is not a difficult one to determine . These men are outspoken in their opinion that the convention in Juno can not do bettor than choose Mr. Hiscock . The Republicans who have heard this anti who have also beard of the visit to this city of Mr. Thomas C. Platt are not disposed to be overpleased because Mr. Platt has given the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recommendation . Mr. Platt was here two or three days . If be consulted any considerable number of Republieans as to the advisability of booming " Hiscock , the Sherman men , who had expected to send a strong body or delegates to Chicago for the Ohio stateentau , have not been advised of what bas been said or done . Last night , just before Air . Platt 's visit ended , Mr. Hiscock gave a ( limier to seven guests , and three persons at the table have been named as men who may be upon the Republican national ticket . It could not have been au anti-Sherman consultation . for Mr. Hiscock had Mr. Sherman on his right hand and Mr. Hale on his left . The other guests were Mr. Manderson , Mr. Jones of Nevada , Mr. Ingalls , and Mr. W. W. Phelps . Mr. Ingalls has been recently quoted as having an opinion of Mr. Hist:lock as a candidate . and it has been : matter of conjecture as to whether the President pro tent of the Senate Wad prevailed upon to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to give his conviction as to what the result would be in New-York it her junior Senator should be honored with the first place . The fact that Mr. Hiseock was for a short time an active and effective ally of the Democratic Party , and that he even went so far , iu some of his campaign speeches for Greeley , us to declare that ho had " burned his bridges , " is not regarded as any more likely to prove offensive to Republicans than it is in the case of Mr. Chauncey M. Depew . Of course , if Mr. Hiscock is nominated , it will be upon a stout protection platfortu , which will be acceptable to New-York and New-Jersey high tariff men . It will then be necessary , perhaps , to complete the ticket with a candidate from the West who will make a protectionist platform palatable to the Republicans who believe the tariff may be reduced without ruining American industries . Democrats here who read in the Sun of to-day some extracts form the private letter of " A Democratic Observer iu Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could identify the " W. P. T. , " who signs it . 110 says : " I have been here for five days . I have had but one Rica , and that has been to learn public Sella. men t . I have talked with scores of members , both Democrats and Republicans , and with hundreds of Democrats from all parts of the country . Outside of the Federal officials there is not a particle of enthusiasm for President Cleveland . There is a deep-seated fear his renomination will shipwreck the Democratic Party . The masses . both in the South mud Southwest , want to see the Democracy break away iron " Clevelandism , " i.e. , free trade and the reign of the hated Mugwump . At this critical hour for Democracy all eves are turned to the Imperial State of ow-York . Thu honor ann interest of the Democratic Party are in its keeping . The Cleveland strikers say there is no fight , that all is lovely ; that the man of destiny has no opposition . They know this is false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 a game of bluff . An open campaign of 30 days would end Cleveland . " The questions asked about " W. P. T. " are pointed . Is he the saute " W. P. T. " who voted in Kansas for Hayes for President iu 1876 and for Garfield in iSSOI Is he the same " W. P. T. " who bragged of having " led the Republican revolt " for St. John in ISS2 1 Is he the same " W. P. T. " who was first suspected of being a Democrat in 18s44 and who has fur some time been trying to convince the Agricultural Department that he ought to be put in charge of the collection of statistics in Kansas1 If he is the man he is supposed to be , it is known hero that this not easily pleased recent convert , who is not a rock-ribbed " veteran observer " of the Suit 's favorite stripe , has been threatening thatif he did not get the appointment he had sought he would " make it hot , for Cleveland in Kansas . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ho should have acquired so positive au aversion for " the hated mugwump , " unless he assumes that all inugwunips are like himself , Cleveland men , " for revenue only , " and all playing a " game of bluff . " Acting Secretary Thompson to-day signed orders for the dismissal and reduction of eateries of assistant custodians , janitors , elevator conductors , and laborers in all the public buildings under the Treasury Department , about 50 in number . This action was rendered necessary by the condition of the appropriation for this service , and beeausu of the failure of Congress to make provisions for a deficiency which otherwise would hard occurred . Secretary Fairchild informed the proper officers of the House early in the season that the service could not be maintained on tae present basis for the remainder of the present fiscal year unless an additional appropriation was made . Ills recommendation was unheeded , however . and it became necessary for him either to reduce expenses or to create a deficiency . He derided on the former course and to-day 's action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . In New-York alone 23 persons are dismissed and the salaries of 13. others are reduced . All elevator conductora are dropped and most of the janitors and assistant custodians . The custodians are instructed to readjust the remainitig force so as to secure the best possible care amtprotection of the public buildings . The order takes effect Martel 1 . It will make a , reduction in expenses of $7,500 a month , or 4 ; 30,000 for the remainder of the fiscal year . Frequent protests have been made in the Senate against the practice of the House of Representatives in holding heel ; the big annual appropriation bills until the last few days of a session , Nyhtin they must be rushed through by the Senate with no chance for careful scrutiny . This year the Senate intends to try to du away with this scandal by . forcing the Holum to give it eulticient time to consider the appropriations which must receive its ( question to become law . With tuts end in view , the Committee on Rules reported to-day an amendment to the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill tor consideration until it had the bill under consideration at least live days , The Urgent Deficiency bill is alone excepted from this rule . The proposed amendment went to toe calendar , and there is no doubt that it will be adopted in time to give the Douse fair warning that it must send over its appropriation bills before the last week of the session . Senators Mitchell of Oregon and Blair of NewHampshire are likely to fill less space in the Congressional Record in the future than has been the ease iu the past . The Committee on Rules of the Senate has recommended the adoption of such modifications of the present rules as will largely do away with the reading of petitions and memorials by Senators , who thus get the documents into the Record , where they do not belong , and whore they serve no other purpose than to flatter the persons who sign them and win their favor for the Senators who procure their publication . Messrs . Blair and Mitchell easily lead all other Senators in this respect , and it is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-Senators with petitions and memorials that the new rule has been proposed . The Rules Committee is warranted in believing that its recommendation will be agreed to by a large majority . In 1883 H. H. Warner , the celebrated Rochester manufacturer , bought an island in Saginaw Bay of Timothy Jerome of Saginaw , Mich. , for $7,000 . The island contained something over 100 acres . Adjacent to this purchase is a large and swampy island of nearly 700 acres , amt ever since his purchase of the 100-acre island , known as Masson , Warner has been endeavoring to establish the fact that the 700 acres was au accretion to the 100 . In the Fortyeighth Congress a bill was introduced by the Rochester representative to confirm Warner 's title to the entire island . The State of Michigan , which claims to own the island as swamp land , and the Lansing Gun Club , which has for years been shooting on the Marsh Middle Ground , which is the geographical name for the alleged aocreated land , through the Michigan delegation , succeeded In defeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is worth from $50,000 to $100,000 , the Lansing Gun Club standing ready to buy it for any sum between these figures as soon as the State declares it in the market As soon as the Forty-eighth Congress expired the contest was resumed In the General Land Office , the State of Michigan asking for a survey to establish the fact whether the 700-acre island was or was not a marshy accretion of the Warner purchase . The survey sent omit reported that it was an accretion . At once the contestants filed a series of affidavits , claiming that the Island was hundreds of years old , had elm trees 2 feet in diameter , and had grown crops of hay from the time of the settlement of the State . The rival claimants disagree as to the existence of a channel between Maison and the alleged accretion , and the Lansing Gun Club claims that Warner had men engaged to fill up the channel . Ex-Congressman Cobb of Indiana , who was Chairman of the Public Lands Committee in the Forty-eighth Congress , has been Warner 's attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision giving Warner the 700 acres as accreted land . This morning the entire Michigan delegation called on Secretary Vilas , denounced the decision roundly , and succeeded in securing a prondee of a hearing before that officer on behalf of the State . There is a fair prospect that the now fisheries treaty between the United States and Great Britain will be discussed by the Senate in open session . To bring this about will require a radical change In the present rules governing the star chamber sittings of the Senate . Swill a change has been provided for and will be reported by the committee to-morrow . If adopted it will place it iu the power of a majority of the Senate to remove the Mlunction of secrecy from a treaty immediately after its receipt from the President or to open the doors and admit the public at any stage of the discussion of a treaty . There is little reason to doubt that a majority of the Senators would be glad to have the fisheries treaty taken up in public . Some Senators , however , see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the executive sessions , and these will make as hard a fight as they can against any change in that direction . Meanwhile the resolution for open consideration of Executive nominations remains mulcted upon . and its friends are growing more and more impaid ent of the delay . The members of the Ways and Means Committee are being overrun to-night with anxious inquiries about the tariff bill , and are in vain trying to quiet apprehensions by declarations that it is not , yet ready for submission to the public . There is no probability that It will be brought into the House before Thursday . There will be no meeting of the committee to-morrow , so that there will be no opportunity to submit it before the next meeting , which will ho held on Thursday . The Democratic members will probably submit it to the Whole Committee and report it to the House on the same day . It will then be recommitted and the Republicans will have a chalice to make their minority report , Some of the Democratic members arc of the opinion that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the committee for discussion . They suppose that the Republicans will want to make a bill of their own . if they know just what they want to do they do not need any time . If they can not tell what they want until the Democrats have reported their bill it must be concluded that they have not begun their bill , and await an opportunity to , frame one for fighting purposes rather than fer any purpose of reducing tariff taxes . It is understood that the Democrats have decided to reduce sugar to 92 per cent. , finding that the Louisiana Democrats will not agree to vote for any cut whatever . Rice is to bo made three-quarters of a cent . a pound all around , against the protests of the rice growers , who insist that they can not stand so great a cut . Coal will probably not be changed , but will remain at 75 cents . The reduction to be effected Is estimated to exceed $60,000,000 , but to be less than $75,000,000 . While it is not positively stated or deeided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to accept the office of Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey , which has been filled by Mr. Frank M. Thorn as Acting Superintendent while the President has been looking for a man possessed of the necessary scientific knowledge for the permanent appointment .
