txt Sir John Macdonald arrived home to-day from England , and in reply to an address of welcome made a brief speech . Much disappointment is expressed at his failure to say anything about reciprocity or a renewal of the fisheries treaty with the United States , and the inference is that he has received no assurance whatever oh those subjects . He said that when he got to England he found the elections going on and the Ministers all away from London . When he met them he was informed that their position as a Ministry was very uncertain , and they were not disposed to undertake any important business . He said the British public regarded the Pacific Railway not only as a colonial work , but as one of the highest imperial importance in that it placed England in a much stronger position than she had occupied for many years in the matter of communication with distant colonies and dependencies . Sir John had occasion to see the military authorities concerning the Canadian Pacific , and to urge upon them the importance of aiding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case of war-as transports , or oven as ships of war , and at the same time of such speed and capacity as would be a means of at once developing Asiatic trade by way of the Canadian Pacific Rahway . They agreed that the termini of the road were Liverpool and Hong Kong , and that on both the Atlantic and Pacific . in order to make this route what it ought to be , there must be lines of steamers . Sir John said the British authorities were proud of the manner in which the Canadian troops had suppressed the outbreak in the Northwest . They believe that Canada is now a source of strength instead of a source of weakness to the empire .
