txt Secretary Chandler to-day awarded the contracts for building the Chicago , the Boston , the Atlanta , and the Dolphin , the three cruisers and the dispatchboat , to Mr. John Roach , the lowest bidder . Ile Secretary , dressed in white duck , panted with the heat as be stretched his feet out on the polished wood floor of his hot office , looked across his glasses at the portrait of ex-Secretary Robeson on the wall , and declared in a sort of ninety-four-in-the-shade voice : " Yes , I 've awarded all the contracts to Mr. Roach , and I believe he can perform them . There was no reason why he should not have them all . He was the lowest bidder in every instance . I am satisfied that he has the facilities for doing the work , and the Government is so fully protected that I do n't see how the contracts can fail . " A good deal of surprise is expressed because Mr. Roach was able to bid so much lower than anybody expected he would . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidder , when a number of persons compete for Government contracts , that the saceesiful man or men can not do the work properly or profitably . This was the case when the Homer Lee Company secured the contract for the postal notes , carrying it off from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . It is understood that Mr. Roach has made a close estimate of the cost of material and labor to be used in the construction of the new ships . The steel he expects to get at 5 cents a pound , and the labor is estimated at the rate of 3 cents for each pound of steel put into the ships . According to his estimate , he can build the four ships for $2,440,000 , and make 5 per cent . profit out of his contracts . A variety of reasons are given to account for Mr. Roach 's success in gettMc , the contracts , and for his confidence in his ability to supply the material and build the ships in the time specified in the contracts . It is said that , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has already made contracts ' with steel men for large quantities of steel ' to be furnished at 5 cents a , pound . Some of the other bidders , it is understood , had made provisional contracts under which they had offered 4 or 5 cents , depending upon the figures at which they secured the contracts for building the cruisers . Haying secured his contracts for supplying the material , Mr. Roach was in a position to bid very closely , and so secured all the work . He is represented as being very confident of his ability to do all that he has promised unless some disaster should overtake him . The Navy Department will exercise the most careful supervision over the work and will strive to have it so prosecuted that it will bear the criticism of a hostile Democratic House , if the Democrats should elect to criticise the contracts or the work done under them . Mr. Roach is especially pleased , because he was the lowest bidder tor all of the ships , and says that that fact ought to make it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the appropriation among them .
