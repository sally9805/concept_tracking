txt It is just one year to-day since Gen. GRANT breathed his last on the quiet top of Mount . His great services to the country were then universally acknowledged and it was admitted that the people of this Republic owed him a debt of gratitude which there was no way of paying . The most that they could do was to provide a fitting memorial which should commemorate to all generations his illustrious service to the country and be a testimony of their reverent remembrance . By his own desire and the choice of his family this city was designated as the perpetual resting- place of his mortal remains . A noble site for the purpose was set apart by the municipal authorities and the hero sleeps on the banks ' of the great river whose mouth is the chief gateway to the western continent . But nothing could make local his fame or the duty of providing a monument to his memory . That duty is national , and it is fitting that the people of the country and . the Government should join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the work of raising funds for the purpose has been embarrassed by a seeming indifference on the part of the people , especially those outside of the city of New-York . Local jealousies , which ought to have - been subdued in view of the circumstances which determined the choice of a resting place and the national character of the memorial , have prevented earnest efforts in other cities to raise contributions for the fund . These should have subsided ere this , and it is to be hoped that something will be done to awaken a renewed interest , both here and in other parts of the country , in the work of raising a monument to the memory of one who has such a strong claim upon the generous gratitude of the Nation . It is altogether proper that the Government should take part in this work . It would still be the action of the people through their chosen representatives . Early in the present session of Congress a bill was introduced providing fora Government contribution of $250,000 for this purpose , to be expended under the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Monument Association , on condition that an . equal ' amount should be raised by that association . This bill has long been neglected , but is on the regular calendar of the House of Representatives , and a little zealous effort and . ' a patriotic forbearance from objection would bring it up for action . It ought to ' take little time to pass it through both houses , and it would be a graceful celebration of'the first anniversary of the death of one who figured so conspicuously in military and civil life during the most eventful period of our history . There certainly can be no popular objection - to this appropriation of the people 's money . On the contrary , we have no doubt there would be universal approval . This contribution would . serve to stimulate the efforts of the association here to complete the fund as speedily as possible , and would afford a new incitement of public interest . Nearly one-half the amount that would remain for the association to raise has been *already subscribed , and the residue ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved prospects for making the fund complete . The fact thatthree-fourths would then be provided for would also'justify the Executive ' Committee and the Government commission in at once setting , about the task of obtaining a fitting design for the memorial . If that could once be decided on so that the people could form a definite idea of the purpose for which they were contributing , theirinterest would be greatly increased , and if the design was such as to commend itself to their admiration there would be no further difficulty in raising the funds . Congress should pass the bill before the session ends , as a proper token of the gratitude of the Nation as represented in the Government , as an act of'the people themselves in carrying out an object which they have at heart , as a stimulus to voluntary private contributions , and asS a substantial means of carrying the movement forward to a point which will admit of the adoption of definite plans for the monument . There could . be no more graceful ending of the first session of Congress after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union .
