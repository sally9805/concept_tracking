txt How happy are the Esquimaux ! It is cool where they live . While we are sweltering with the thermometer in the nineties the Esquimau is rubbing his frozen nose with snow and is trying to warm himself with draughts of whale oil . We can manage to keep alive only by sitting still in the shadiest place we can find , but the Esquimau finds lawn tennis at midday a pleasant method of quickening his circulation . Think for a moment how easy - it is for the Esquimau to freeze himself to-day by simply sitting still on his front piazza for fifteen minutes ; and how limitless is the supply of ice that is all around him . The Harvard Professor who thinks that the Garden of Eden was situated at the north pole is undoubtedly right . ADAM and EYE ' were Esquimaux , and their idea of gardening was nothing more than harvesting ice with a view to a possible rise of the thermometer . That Paradise , must have been a place where ice and snow were abundant and the thermometer never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just at present . If it had really been situated under the burning sun of Mesopotamia our first parents would have been only too glad to get out of it , though they would probably have lacked the energy to meddle with the forbidden fruit . If Mr. MELVILLE really wants to go to the north pole now is the time for him to organize a personally conducted expedition . At least five hundred thousand people are now ready to pay him a thousand dollars apiece if he will lead them to a climate where they can enjoy the unspeakable luxury of freezing to death . Those of us who can not go to the north pole must stay at home and try to avoid a sunstroke . There are several little books , written by medical men , which tell us just what we must do in hot weather to protect ourselves against sunstroke , and it is a duty which a conscientious journal owes to the public to give these directions a wide publicity . To begin with , we must not drink anything that contains alcohol , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sun in its fiendish effort to strike us down . Also , we must not drink water , milk , or any other beverage , for when the stomach is weakened by extreme heat liquids interfere with digestion , and by thus weakening the system predispose it to sunstroke . Bathing in cold water should be avoided because it produces a shock , and bathing in warm water is bad because it is weakening . We must not eat animal or vegetable food because of the weakness of our digestive powers , and we must not wear thick clothes because they are heating , nor thin clothes because the latter do not protect the body from the sun . Of course it is dangerous to venture in the sunshine , but it is equally dangerous to remain in the shade , for many persons have been sunstruck in the shade and even when lying asleep at night . All exertion must be avoided , but at the same time it is a matter of supreme importance that the physical strength should be kept up , for if this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sunstruck can either observe these few simple rules , for each one of which there is abundant medical authority , or they can go and die quietly . The latter would probably be the easier and more satisfactory plan .
