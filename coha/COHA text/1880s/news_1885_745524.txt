txt Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH certainly does not intend to make the Government of which he is a member ridiculous . And yet the essential absurdity of its position with reference to Egypt . could not have been more clearly put than it was put in an expression of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer made use . " Our policy , " he said , " is to gradually give security and freedom to Egypt 's independent action in the future . " Considering that the English interference in Egypt has thus far been confined to refusing any " independent action " whatever to the Government of the country , this suggestion that when Egypt has learned to swim she may venture into the water seems hopeless enough . But , in fact , the English policy in Egypt is incapable of being made the subject of any statement that does not convict ' it of absurdity . The only national interest England ever had in Egypt was the protection of the Suez Canal , in which she was more interested than other European nations simply in virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holder of shares . It . is evident that her interference has gone far beyond the limit prescribed by her interest . The explanation is that the action of the Government has been determined by the importunity of those individual Englishmen who held Egyptian securities , the price of which they desired the British Government to advance . England has under this stimulus appointed herself a receiver of Egypt . The large language of Sir MICHAEL HICKSBEACH about security and freedom and independence means merely that when the property is placed upon such a basis that it will pay operating expenses and leave something over for the bondholders the receiver will turn it over again to the stockholders . . That date seems a long way off . In the meantime England can do nothing with reference to Egyptian affairs except to muddle them . It is only fair to say , however , that one English party is no more responsible than the other for this state of affairs , since nobody but a few Radicals advocates the true solution of the Egyptian question , which is that England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really has no business .
