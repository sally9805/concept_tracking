txt The Signal Service Seacoast Telegraph line was repaired yesterday , and Information has been obtained showing that the storm - which prevailed along the North Carolina coast on Saturday last was one of the most destructive that has visited that section for years . At Kitty Hawk the force of the storm blew away the apparatus for measuring the velocity of the wind at the signal station , and the observer there reports that the fury of the storm was almost indescribable . He estimates the velocity of the wind at his station as about 125 miles an hour , and states that the damage to shipping in that vicinity must be unsusually heavy . The telegraph line south of Kitty Hawk is entirely wrecked ; the poles were thrown out of the earth , broken into match wood , carried out to sea , or blown no one knows whither . Among the vessels known to have been damaged by the storm are the following : The American barkentiue Walter S. Massey sprung a leak off Chicanicomico , N. C. , anchored iu comparative shelter and signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baker Salvage Company has been notified and a steamer has been dispatched to the relief of the vessel ; the steamer Eaglet , or the North Carolina Dispatch Company , Is reported ashore in Cove Sound , high and dry , and the tug William F. Taylor , of Norfolk , and the steamer Annie , of the North Carolina Dispatch Company , are reported ashore near Cherry Point , Neuse River , 18 miles below New-Berne , N. C. The Baker Salvage Company 's steamer Victoria J. Peed was sighted yesterday morning with a wrecking schooner in tow , bound south , and about eight miles south of Kitty Hawk . It is thought that other and perhaps more serious shipping casualties will be reported when telegraphic communication with Hatteras shall have been restored .
