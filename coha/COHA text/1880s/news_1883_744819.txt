txt A singular story has just been made public of the stealing of the stone contributed by the Pope to the Washington Monument . It was in 1854 , when the Know-nothing movement had been stimulated by the then recent and enormous immigration , especially of Irish Catholics , that nine patriots determined to vindicate republican institutions by stealing this stone , which they sunk in the Potomac . It appears that the guardians of the monument knew that the stone had disappeared , but the general public has hitherto remained in ignorance of that fact , and assumed that the Pope was represented , along with the other potentates , in the masonry of the remarkable structure . One question , however , remains to be cleared up . Was or was not the stone blessed ? If it was not , the omission is not of so much moment , and the Holy See is simply " out " the cost of the stone , But if it was blessed , the consequences of dumping it into the Potomac may be very serious both to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commission of theological experts to determine the precise effect upon the stability of the monument and the prosperity of the American people of leaving out a blessed ashlar from a monument to a heretic . If the river were dragged and the stone recovered , we might recover from the effects of the rash act committed by the bold blasphemers of 1854 . If the stone can not be found , the present successor of Saint PETER might perhaps be induced to contribute a new stone , and bless it none pro tune .
