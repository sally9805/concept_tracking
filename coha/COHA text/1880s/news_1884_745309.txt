txt The surgeons of the Jefferson College Hospital , in this city , have been very much Interested recently in a somewhat unusual case that has been in their hands for treatment . It is that of a man who may be described as a human barometer . So far , however , from boasting of his power to foretell cnanges in the weather , the patient , whose name is Frederick Guyer , went to the hospital in hopes that the surgeons might cure him of his malady . During the war Guyer was Captain of Company D , Ninth New-York Volunteers . Early in the morning of the second day 's fight in the Wilderness he was struck by a Mini ? rifle ball , which penetrated his right leg , three inches above the knee . The engagement was so hot at the time that his comrades could render him no further attention than to place him under a tree somewhat out of the direct lino of fire , and there he remained for 36 hours ; when a change of front by the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken prisoner . The rebel surgeon into whose hands ho fell insisted upon amputating his leg , and the opefation was roughly performed by candlelight , the limb being taken off at the thigh . ? Six or seven days after that , " said Capt . Guyer to THE TIMES 'S correspondent this morning , " I began to feel severe pains in the stump , and have never been wholly free from suffering since . The sensation is apparently in the foot . I have never felt any pain that seemed to come from the thigh , or , indeed , from anywhere above the ankle . There is usually a twitching sensation , such as a man experiences in an electric bath , at the point where the great toe joins the foot . Sometimes there is a similar feeling in the little toe ; then again there is a burning sen- sation across all of the toes , and occasionally a pain in the heel . Before my treatment in the liospital I could always tell by the increased severity of the pain when we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a north or northeast wind began to blow , but when there was a big storm coming my toes would begin to ache three or four days in advance , and as the storm approached the pain would become so intense as to almost set me crazy . You remember the big electric storm we had three years ago , when the aurora filled the sky at Want and all the telegraph wires were disarranged. 1 was living then in West Twentyeighth-street , New York , and felt the storm coming three days before it appeared . 1 suffered more at that time than on any other occasion . The pain grew more severe as tho storm approached , seemed to vary with its distance and its fluctuations , and reached a climax just before it broke . Then the painful sensations began to pass away , and in a few hours , while the storm was still raging , I was at ease again . I could always foretell any change in the weather , either from fair to stormy or from stormy to fair , and could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight magnitude affected me but slightly , while a general storm was announced by its unpleasant forerunners according to its magnitude , and , similarly , I knew by the relief from pain when clear weather was coming . Since leaving the hospital I have been comparatively free from pain , though I still feel occasional twitches . " The operation performed on Capt . Guyer was as remarkable as his disease . It consisted of the removal of a number of large bulbous formations from the stumps of the nerves . Bulbs about the size of the middle finger or the average man 's hand and nearly an inch long were cut off from the greater and lesser sciatic nerves , and smaller formations were removed from other nerves . In all six of these abnormal growths were found and removed . The patient was kept in the hospital four weeks , and was discharged about two weeks ago , though ho still reports periodically for examination and treatment . The wounds made by the scalpel are healing nicely , and the doctors think that when the inflammation subsides no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 years old , of slender build , and , aside from his peculiar malady , is in good health . He has never worn an artificial leg , but has always used crutches . Dr. John H. Brinton , the operating surgeon , is preparing a monograph on the case for publication in a medical journal .
