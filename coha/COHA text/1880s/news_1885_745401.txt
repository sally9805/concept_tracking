txt In pursuance of a resolution passed by the Board of Education at a meeting held the first Wednesday in this month , Commissioners SELIGMAN , DEVOE , and BEARDSLEE conferred with Mayor GRACE last Tuesday " as to the most advisable and expeditious manner of acquiring funds for the construction of new buildings . " The Mayor in his January message devoted considerable space to the consideration of school matters , and stated , among other things , that during 1884 nearly 8,000 children were unable to gain admission to our public schools because of lack of room . The main pressure is in the wards of the upper part of the city , whither the daily increasing population of this great city has been tending for some years past . Last year the Legislature authorized the issue of $2,000,000 school bonds bearing 3 per cent . interest , the money obtained for the bonds to be used in the purchase of sites and in the erection of schoolhouses . The low rate of 3 per cent . per-annum prevented their rapid sale ; in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 were sold at par . Then came the constitutional amendment , limiting the indebtedness of all cities containing more than 100,000 inhabitants , which prevented altogether the sale of these bonds . Had the Legislature fixed the rate of interest of the school bonds at 3 1-2 per cent. , ( as was done with the aqueduct bonds which were sold by the city the other day , ) instead of 3 per cent. , the whole $2,000,000 might have been sold priorto the adoption of the constitutional amendment , with the result of hundreds of additional classrooms being thrown open to the children . Mayor GRACE has rendered his opinion to the effect that the city of New-York has outstanding bonds to the amount of nearly $15,000,000 over and above what the constitutional amendment allows , and that under the existing condition of . affairs no more , whether school bonds or any others , can now be issued , except bonds for water purposes . He arrives at this conclusion by maintaining that the bonds held in the sinking fund form a portion of the city 's indebtedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation Counsel coincides with the Mayor in this latter view , others who have given the subject thought do not , and it is to be hoped that so important a matter will soon get to the Court of Appeals , and there receive a speedy decision , so that we may know what our indebtedness is . The Court of Appeals would at the same time have to decide whether the cancellation of certain bonds in the sinking fund would violate the obligation of a contract . One method by which money , could now be obtained by the Board of Education for increased school facilities would be by securing the passage of a bill by the present Legislature opening the tax levy . But the attempt to carry out such a scheme , as Mayor GRACE explained at the conference between himself and the School Commissioners , would encounter his earnest opposition . . The members of the Board of Education , however , seem anxious to get the money now , and , judging by a resolution passed at last Wednesday 's meeting , they may appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failing to get their demand satisfied at present , the Commissioners will appear before the Board of Estimate and Apportionment the latter part of this year and demand a cash appropriation for their very worthy purpose , unless , by some legal construction or by some cancellation of bonds in the sinking fund , they should in the meantime be placed in a position to offer their school bonds to investors .
