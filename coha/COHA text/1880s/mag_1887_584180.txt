By James Russell Soley . THE decrepit condition of the navy has been for some time a subject of concern and a source of humiliation to the country . Its extraordinary development during the civil war was not productive of any permanent benefit . Its expansion at that time was due to the pressure of urgent necessity , and the measures adopted were makeshifts , suited only to the demands of the moment . The next fifteen years were marked by a steady process of deterioration . In 1881 , however , with the appointment of the first Advisory Board , a reaction set in , and the earnest efforts made during the last five years in Congress , in the Department , and in the service have at last begun to bear fruit . But the results that have been accomplished so far , though they make a good beginning , are only a beginning , and the danger is that the country , through a mistaken estimate of its wants , will be satisfied to stop at the elementary stage . It is therefore desirable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our naval policy really are , and how far , in the light of past experience , the navy falls short of them . The one broad proposition that lies at the root of the whole matter is that the navy exists for war . It has its uses in time of peace , some of them important uses . It performs its part in the police of the ocean , and it protects American interests , chiefly by the exercise of moral force , in disturbed countries . There is no doubt that the entire want of a naval force for these purposes would work much mischief to our interests abroad . But if these were all the duties of the navy , or even its chief duties , a much smaller and less expensive fleet would be sufficient-certainly there would be no need of an establishment including seven great dockyards , with a cabinet minister at its head , and costing from twelve to eighteen millions a year . The real use of this great establishment is to provide the country with an instrument for waging war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to occupy and train its energies with a view to the crisis which it is ultimately to meet . Indeed , so important is it that the navy should have this constant professional occupation and training during peace , that it would be desirable to create employments with this special object if the ordinary wants of the government failed to supply them . As the navy is not maintained merely as an ocean police , or as a conventional ornament of international intercourse , but mainly for war , the question may pertinently be asked , and it is repeatedly asked , especially by inland statesmen , whether the United States really need an establishment of this kind for war purposes . It is said that our isolated position and our traditional policy of avoiding political alliances give us an international status very different from that of European nations ; while our immense preponderance in the western world , in resources , in population , and in area , should exempt us from all danger at the hands of our comparatively feeble neighbors . It would seem , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendly relations for two reasons : first , because we do not cultivate the rivalries and animosities that excite hostility , and , secondly , because foreign nations are afraid of us . There is a grain of truth in this reasoning , but a much larger proportion of error . If we carry it to the length of neglecting to provide the means of national defence , and conducting our foreign relations with a comfortable sense of security , based on the policy which conscientious nations ought to pursue toward ourselves , we shall be living in a fools ' paradise , from which the angel with the flaming sword will some day rudely cast us out . No state , whatever its position or its traditional policy , is secure against an invasion of rights . The rights of private , individuals in a // community are guaranteed by the law , and enforced by the government . In the international system , where states are the individuals , the law defines rights with more or less exactness ; but in the absence of a common superior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always swerved by national bias , and their enforcement is left to the individuals themselves . The relations of states are therefore those of individuals in an unorganized community , where interests are divergent , and where each man enforces his own rights by the principle of vis major . Under such conditions the most long-suffering individual would find it difficult to avoid disputes , for he would ultimately reach a point where further yielding would mean the loss of independence . A state that pursued a uniform policy of concession would very soon reach that point . Moreover , international relations are so interwoven through commercial and other interests that no state , however isolated its geographical position , can wholly escape controversy . Where the private citizen is only liable to private quarrels , the state , or the government which represents it , being the trustee of the interests of all its citizens , must be ready to act for their protection and in their behail , by making their just quarrels its own . An invasion of their rights is an invasion of its own rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind its opponent lies a popular sentiment which neither can easily control . With such heavy responsibilities and such imperfect guarantees , a government that neglects preparation invites aggression , for it can only assert its rights effectually by showing a capacity to enforce them . The question as to the immediate or remote probability of war , at any given time , is a matter of futile speculation , as our history amply proves . During the last hundred years we have been at war six times , counting the French hostilities in 1798-an average of one war to every sixteen or seventeen years . The causes that brought about the old wars are no longer operative-French spoliations have ceased , the Tripolitan and Algerine pirates have been swept from the seas , England no longer asserts a right of impressment , there is no territorial controversy with Mexico . But other causes that may operate with equal force in the future are not far to seek . We have come to the verge of war twice since the Rebellion-in 1865 and in 1873  --  and both times unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our own excellent state of preparation . In the event of a general European war , which is always impending , unarmed neutrals would suffer , as they did in 1806 ; and even without such a war there is danger at all times of an invasion of rights , or a collision of interests , which no compromise could adjust , and before which the friendly demonstrations of the centennial period would disappear like the smoke of the saluting guns that accompanied them . The second theory upon which our supposed immunity is based , that foreign nations , whatever their interests or sentiments , will be afraid to go to war with us , is a colossal delusion . In spite of its resources in reserve , the country is more vulnerable to-day to a sharp and s*udden blow than it was hail a century ago . Future wars will be of short duration ; they will come when least expected ; and the state that is prepared to strike a blow at the outset will inflict an injury that no belated exertions will avail to repair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aggression . Unless the force is actual , unless the effective army and navy are prepared for immediate resistance , and are commensurate in some degree with the position of a state in the international system , other states care little for it and its reserve power in the background . It is a physical impossibility that the reserve power should be brought into effective play within any reasonable time after war has begun , as war is carried on to-day  --  a fact of which the military and naval authorities in foreign states are fully aware , and which they take into account in their calculations . I venture to assert , from what is known of the methods of administration prevailing , for instance , in Germany , with which state it is most unlikely that we should have a serious cause of dispute , that the General Staff at the German Admiralty know to a nicety // what we could accomplish in a war with that power ; and in all probability they have a plan of operations with the details of the campaign already prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the worse in our effective force , and ready to be put in operation at a few hours ' notice . Apart from the probability of actual war , the necessity of an armed force is manifest as an element , although an unrecognized element , in international negotiation . To recur to our illustration , the private individual in an unorganized state of society , though he might keep out of quarrels by uniform conciliation , would find his volition and his action constantly fettered by his inability to assert his rights through the only ultima ratio known to the community around him . So it is with the state . In the controversies of nations it is not the just cause that prevails , but the just cause aided by the strong arm . It has not been the habit with us Americans to think much of this silent factor in international negotiation . But with our friends , the Great Powers , it lies rooted in every question of foreign policy ; and the other powers are coming rapidly to the same view , as may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased efficiency of their naval armaments . A certain sense of decency may deter states from unjust aggressions toward their diminutive or feeble neighbors , but there is nothing to restrain them in a dispute with a great . rival that refuses to protect its rights by maintaining an adequate force . The executions at Santiago de Cuba , in 1873 , would never have taken place if we had had a respectable squadron at the time in West Indian waters ; and it must be clear to everyone that the nagging and offensive policy of the British provinces toward our fishing-vessels would not be continued for a day if we had a really efficient fleet . As the Secretary of the Navy said in his report of last year : " This country can afford to have , and it can not afford to lack , a naval force at least so formidable that its dealings with foreign powers will not be influenced at any time , or even be suspected of being influenced , by a consciousness of weakness on the sea . " VOL. 1-15 It is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular mind , for otherwise we should not have two out of the seven great departments of the Government employed in carrying them out . But in the popular mind , and in Congress , which reflects it , the notion of a fighting force is chiefly represented by the army ; while the navy is regarded doubtfully as a conventional , though possibly a useful , adjunct in military operations . Yet this country above all others , except England , must look to its navy to meet the most urgent demands of belligerent operations . Its position is such that neither it nor its enemy is likely to present a vulnerable land frontier . Whether its wars are offensive or defensive , the attack will be made from the sea , and will be met on the sea or at the sea-coast , whichever party attempts to strike the first blow . The land forces would sooner or later bear a most important part , but an invasion of any foreign territory , except Mexico or Canada , would be impossible without a supporting squadron , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible by our ability to concentrate a sufficient maritime force . In any case , therefore , the indispensable element of attack and of defence would be the fleet . It may fairly be assumed from what has been said that the llJnited States need a navy , and that , to be of any real use , it must be capable of instantaneous conversion-that is , in the space of a few days-into an instrument for waging effective war . To see how far the establishment may fall short of this requirement , we have only to look at our experience in 1861 . At that time our enemy had a sea-coast of three thousand miles , full of vulnerable points , nearly all his important cities were within striking distance from the sea , and he began . the contest without a single armed yessel afloat , so that both our seaports and our merchantmen had complete immu-* nity from attack . The land campaign , in which two armies composed of raw . levies held each other in check , was practically at a standstill . Could a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing an efficient . // fleet , and for striking a succession of blows of the kind that paralyzes an enemy ? In spite of these conditions , the naval war for the first half-year was a lamentable failure . The new administration came in on the 4th of March , and the outbreak of war from that moment was only a question of days . Yet the first , the very first , naval operation was on the 28th of August , when Commodore Stringham attacked the forts at Hatteras Inlet . It was an exploit requiring no great force-indeed , as an operation it was mere pastime-yet it had been nearly six months in preparation , and another six months elapsed before it was followed up by Goldsborough 's expedition to the Sounds . The important results of these two operations only show how much might have been done at the outset with a properly prepared fleet . Except for the blockade , which was hardly efficient until autumn , the attack at Hatteras Inlet represents all that was accomplished by the naval administration during its first eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions were favorable , it is easy to see what would have happened during the same period in a war with a maritime enemy . Our so-called ships-of-war , when they got to sea , would have been aunihilated , our arsenals and dockyards would have been destroyed , our commerce extinguished , and our sea-coast cities either bombarded or laid under heavy contribution . The failure of the navy in 1861 was due to the neglect of the one cardinal principle , which should pervade and vitalize the whole naval establishment , that the navy exists only for war . The fundamental defect extended through every detail of administration-personnel , organization , material . It was shown in the persounel by the absence of any real training for war , and by the failure to select , beforehand , the best men in the service for its responsible commands . It was shown in the organization by the want of an authorized military agency , prepared to direct the operations of the fleet during war , or engaged in directing them during peace in such a manner that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , by the failure to provide for the enlargement of the navy through the establishment of a naval reserve . It was shown in the material by the fact that though the fleet was being gradually modernized , by the construction of ships and guns that were excellent for the time , the process was going on so slowly that out of a list of ninety vessels less than twenty were of real use for fighting purposes . The lesson of 1861 touches us so closely that we can not afford to neglect it . The navy then underwent its only real test , the test of battle , and it was unable to supply the history of the war with a single creditable event for nearly six months . The navy of to-day can only be fully judged by the same test . In the light of our experience in 1861 , is the fleet , in personnel , in organization , and in material equipment , prepared to stand the trial ? It has been the fashion in certain quarters to abuse the personnel of the navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no useful purpose and feeding at the public crib , the older members holding comfortable billets , where their only duty is to d-raw their monthly pay , and the younger engaged in pleasure trips in foreign countries or lingering about Washington , where their time is taken up with various forms of social frivolity . For one who knows them as they really are , it is hard to find words to characterize , with sufficient force and indignation , the grossness and malignity of these caricatures . As a matter of fact , the officers of the navy , to-day , form a body of patient , hard-working , earnest men , of singular resource and adaptability , eager and efficient in the performance of duty . Their life is a trying one , and the difficulties with which they must contend are unknown in ordinary civil occupations . A large part of the officer 's career is passed under the closest restraints of military discipline . The ordinary wear and tear of professional service tells upon the mind and body to an extent far greater than in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vie d'int*rieur , which forms the balance-wheel of so many overworked hu // man machines , is , at best , broken , fitful , interruipted . On board the ship at sea , where the physical horizon is unobstructed , the mental horizon is narrowed down to companionship for three years with a dozen or a score of men in the same profession , saturated with the same ideas , absorbed in the same occupations , surrounded and cramped by the same routine . The officer may have his books , but the conditions of shiplife are unfavorable to study . He visits other countries , but he can not reap the benefits that come from foreign travel ; he is tied to the ship , he skims the coast and puts in at the seaports , he is always confined by the limitations of the cruise . If he goes on leave , after the binding restraints of ship-life , what he needs and must have is relaxation , pure and simple . It is a rare man who would get much else from such short and infrequent holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his career , especially of the first half , he is cut off from that general and broadening intercourse with men in other occupations , that stimulating metropolitan atmosphere , that eternal movement of thought and of affairs which rubs away the sharp edges of prejudice and tradition , and which makes the great centres of activity , in whatever direction-intellectual , artistic , commercial  --  the only places in which a man can acquire breadth of view and mental vigor-rn which he can mcublcr l'esprit , as the French say-in this nineteenth century . Great as are the barriers to an allround development , those in the way of professional development are even greater , but with this difference , that while the former are inseparable from the profession , the latter can to some extent be remedied . The first of these lies in the fact that the officer 's career is chiefly spent in preparation for his real business , and that the real business , to which all the preparation has been directed , is in the nature of a sharp crisis , which comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our navy to-day , who has been seventy years in the service , has seen only six years of actual war ; and out of the total of seven hundred and fifty line officers on the active list , six hundred have seen no war service whatever . In the course of twenty years even this small proportion of veterans will have disappeared from the list . The long intervals of peace are not periods of rest . They are periods of training . But the effect of an occupation where the whole effort is directed , not to final results , but to results which are only preparatory to the final results , which at best only serve to get the machine in working order until the moment comes when it may do its work , is in itself a source of discouragement . In civil occupations the strain of *effort and the stimulus of results accomplished are spread out over the labors of each year and month , if not of each day and hour ; but the officer , accomplishing no results , refreshed by no encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for a sharp spasm of intense activity , to be followed only by fatigue and reaction . Although this peculiar difficulty is inherent in the naval career , it may be partly obviated by opening to naval officers all those branches of governmental employment which , while closely allied to their professional work , form in themselves a worthy object of effort . It may be still further remedied by making a more living subject of that art of war which should be the main object of their attention . It is to meet this want that the schools of application which exist to-day in most foreign services have been established ; and to this end , also , are directed the admirable fleet exercises , or manoeuvres , such as those of the English Navy in Bantry Bay and at Milford Haven , not for routine drills , but for practice carried on as nearly as possible under the actual conditions of battle . In this respect we have not been altogether stationary . The establishment of the War College two years ago at Newport was certainly one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted since the close of the war . Like the torpedo station , which , however , deals with only one branch of naval science , it is a school of application for officers . Being an establishment of a most original character , , it was wisely decided not to engraft it // on the Naval Academy , an elementary school with which it has nothing in common , and whose deeply-rooted traditions , excellent as they are for the Academy , would have made it a mere course for resident graduates . This is perhaps not the place to dwell much upon the work that the College is doing ; it is enough to say that its lectures and discussions upon the art of war , conducted by special students who are neither amateurs nor dilettanti , include the exact treatment of such subjects as military and naval strategy , the critical examination of naval campaigns , practical gunnery , the evolutions of combat , coast defence and the attack of coast defences ; while others are in preparation upon the resources of foreign navies , the plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the problems in construction presented by the modern conditions of naval war . It only remains to supplement these discussions by exercises , with guns and with vessels , in the best harbor to be found on our coast for the purpose . To this duty the Home Squadron , temporarily increased by the addition of every available vessel , may be devoted each summer , and the maneuvres so conducted would be the one event of importance in the operations of the year . Even with such an enlargement , the training of our officers will still be incomplete as long as they are compelled to work with obsolete tools . Their ships and guns are twenty years behind the standard of foreign navies , and they know that with such weapons the attempt to carry out their vocation would be a hopeless struggle . One of our vessels , not long ago , being in the neighborhood of a French flagship , was visited in turn by the admiral and the captain . As the admiral was taking his leave , on the quarter-deck , he paused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , les vieux canons I " A few hours later the captain , pausing in the same spot , remarked in the same contemplative manner , " Ah , l'ancien syst*me I Nous l'avons eu . " How can anything be looked for in the American navy when its present is everybody else 's past ? Or what right have we to expect that our officers will take their profession seriously when the policy of neglect has made it such a burdensome farce ? Or , finally , if in spite of all their discouragement they still go manfully through the treadmill of routine , how are they to learn to use the tools that have never been put into their hands ? The third and last obstacle to a sound and normal development of the naval personnel , the most harmful , and at the same time the most difficult to reach , is the system of promotion by seniority . In every civil occupation , and in most military and naval services , advancement in the profession , barring the accidents of luck , is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , ability and effort count for nothing . Through all the seven hundred steps of advancement in the line , priority of the date of entry , or , with those of the same date , priority of academic rank , fixes unalterably the relative position of officers . The head of the class of 1890 is always at the heels of the last man of the class of 1889 . No zeal or capacity or eager attention to duty will help him to pass above his weaker comrade ; and no shirking or dulness or misconduct will remove the other from his place , if he can stand his pro forma examinations and avoid incurring court-martit*l . The same blank prospect stares the meritorious officer in the face after he reaches the period of command . No matter what he does for the benefit of the service or the country-whether he fills one of the many positions of administrative trust with signal ability , or conducts a brilliant series of researches and experiments , or leads an expedition through danger and difficulty to final achievement-his performance is barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to effort and the crown of success ; unless , indeed , he receives the thanks of Congress upon the recommendation of the President , a distinction so marked that it is rightly reserved for the most eminent services in war . The consciousness of work well done is in ordinary cases all that the officer has for his efforts , and few men will be satisfied to put forth their energies merely for this . Gradually a brooding lethargy creeps over his mind , until at last he sinks into // apathetic indolence and a mechanical performance of the routine of duty . The willingness , nay the very ability , to assume responsibility in an emergency is lost , for no one will take risks where there is no prospect of a compensating benefit . Such was the condition of the personnel at the beginning of the last war , and the signs are not wanting of a tendency in the same direction now . Conceive for a moment the situation of any great civil organization , that of the Pennsylvania Railroad , for instance , under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places by a permanent tenure , promoted strictly in the order in which they entered , each one regarding it as an indefeasible right that he should forever be the superior of all those who had ever been his juniors , and all forever debarred from any recompense for capacity or effort . With such a system it is safe to say that in ten days the organization would go to pieces . It is objected that considerations of social or political influence would occasionally make bad promotions . The experience of the army , where promotion by selection obtains to a limited extent , is against such a theory . The promotions are perhaps not absolutely the best that could be made , but they are never bad ; while with a system of promotion by seniority they must often be bad . It is also said , and truly , that a system of selection would cause disappointment and heartburnings . But what disappointment of inferior men who are passed over is to be compared with the bitterness of soul of the man who , conscious of his worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle of life and sinking into apathy from the want of recognition ? Would the railroad company abstain from promoting a good man because of the heart-burnings and jealousies of the unpromoted ? The remedy lies largely in their own hands . The company is only following out the law of nature and of society-that force , character , talents , zeal have their price in the market of life , and that the man who has them can obtain a reward which is denied to less capable or less active competitors ; while the navy , disregarding this wholesogie and normal rule , would reduce its members to a Procrnstean standard of irresolution , indolence , and mediocrity . If any further illustration is needed of the comparative merits of the two systems of promotion , it may be found in the operations of the first six months during our two greatest naval wars , those of 1812 and 1861 . The commanding officers in the first war had got their places through that most rigorous measure of selective promotion , the Peace Establishment Act of 1801 : the seventyfive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of age , and , with perhaps four exceptions , were totally unfit for service . The performances of these captains during the first six months-those of them who could be employed at all-in a war where their enemy was destitute of naval resources , are summed up in the trifling affair at Hatteras Inlet , the stupendous blunders at Norfolk and Pensacola , and the shameful panic at the Head of the Passes ; while the captains of the earlier war gave to the country during the same period a succession of six brilliant victories over the greatest naval power in the world ,  --  victories that astonished and delighted their countrymen as much as they astonished and mortified the enemy . In the matter of naval organization there are many points open to discussion , but of these there are two especially whose importance was shown in the opening events of the civil war . The first is the creation of a naval reserve . It is our policy , and a truly wise policy it is , to keep our standing force within the lowest possible limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the war broke out the Navy Department had but two hundred men available for immediate service in the home ports ; and another war might find us in nearly the same condition . In the course of the Rebellion the force of seamen , with the utmost difficulty and at great expense , was increased from seven thousand to fifty thousand ; and any war would compel us to treble or quadrnple the existing complement . To meet this increase we have nothing in the shape of an organized reserve . If // we had had no militia in 1861 to answer the President 's first call for volunteers , of what would our army have been composed ? Yet the navy needs its trained reserves even more than the army , for it must draw them from a small fragment of the population . The organization of a naval reserve is , therefore , a necessary element in naval efficiency . Its members , who will come from the seafaring populationthe merchant seamen , fishermen , watermen , and crews of coasters-should be enrolled , their residence and employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , be it ever so slight , with the standing force . At intervals they should receive training for short periods on board a man-of-war , enough , at least , to teach them the handling of guns and the drills of the ship . For the latter purpose the Home Squadron , temporarily enlarged and converted into a summer squadron of evolutions , would answer exactly . The navy , at the first sign of war , would then be capable of immediate expan4on , and the calling out of the naval reserve would be as simple as calling out the militia . The second point is one which lies at the very foundation of all naval administration . This administration is divided into two great branches : one concerned with the supply of materials-ships , guns , engines , equipments , stores , and so on ; the other , with the regulation and direction of the working establishment . About the first there is little to be said ; it is a matter of business , the direction of a branch of technical industry , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered for the navy by the eight business offices or bureaus of the Department . Its existing defects are pointed out in recent reports of the Secretary , and have excited no little comment , but they are not within the range of our present discussion . The second branch of administration , comprising the direction of the fleet , is as purely military as the other is purely civil , and requires , above all things , unity of purpose . In modern organizations , in most countries , it is in the hands of a body of officers who constitute the General Staff of the navy , with a chief of staff at their head . The chief of staff is the lieutenant of the secretary or minister in all that relates to the existing force , whether of men or of vessels . The duty of the general staff , in time of peace , is to keep itself and the force under it constantly up to the mark , in preparation for war ; and when the war breaks out it furnishes the responsible professional assistance required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval operations . It will readily be seen how indispensable such a branch of administration is to secure the one end and aim of the navy 's existence- that without which it becomes the merest sham-its immediate readiness and efficiency for war . It is the corner-stone of the whole structure . To be of any real service , the navy must have its plan of operations ready , not six months after the war has begun , but before the war begins . The Secretary of the Navy can not evolve such a plan himself , nor is it any part of his business . His duty is to know the policy of the Government , to be able to discern the coming crisis , and to see to it that his coadjutors are always bending their energies to meet it . When the crisis comes , the initial plan must be ready . It must be a comprehensive plan , mcluding attack , if need be , and defence from the enemy 's supposed attack ; involving measures of mobilization , concentration , the rapid preparation of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordinary ; the increase of the fleet by the addition of suitable vessels from private service , and of suitable men-that is , seafaring men-from private occupation . It must be a well-digested plan , not devised on the spur of the moment , under the pressure and anxiety of hostilities threatened or begun , but based upon an accurate and intimate knowledge of the naval resources of both belligerents , which can only be obtained by long and laborious investigation . In the early period of its history there was no such branch of administration at the Department . The first of our great wars , that of 1812 , began when there were only twenty ships in the navy , and its organization was still of the simplest character . But these ships , // owing to the wise foresight of Washington and his advisers , who recognized that a navy exists only for war , were the best of their class afloat ; and there being little demand at that time for foreign service , most of them were in the home ports . The plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the navy were sent to sea in charge of vessels , and they were left , in the main , to decide upon a course of action for themselves . There was no opportunity for concerted action by fleets , and as a matter of fact the ships never acted in concert . Their captains , Bainbridge , Hull , Decatur , Porter , Stewart , Biddle , Blakely-all of them young men , some of them very young , and all of them capable menwere genuine rovers of the seas ; they were the Drakes , the Hawkinses , the Grenvilles , of this Tudor period of American naval history . Even on the lakes , where alone we had squadrons , everything , from laying the keel of the vessels to firing the last gun before the enemy surrendered , was left to the young commodores in command . Upon the expansion of the force toward the close of the war , and during the period immediately following it , it became necessary to substitute a definite scheme of organization in place of the system , or want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a board of three officers was appointed , styled the Navy Commissioners , who had charge of all the work of the Department- " performing , " as the law said , " under the secretary , all the ministerial duties of his office . " As a substitute for a general staff the board would certainly have been found defective , if it had been tried by the test of actual war , since the civil organization of a board , implying equality among the members , can never answer for a staff , the first requisite of which is military subordination . As an office of supply the board failed completely , especially toward the end of its existence , when the introduction of steam complicated this branch of its work . In 1842 it was replaced by the bureau system , which , with some expansion , has continued until the present time . The bureaus , as originally organized , proved efficient for the business of supply , but they were incapable of directing the actual establishment , and the latter , in the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The navy , as a working force , was entirely without naval direction . There was no responsible officer at the Department , with a body of responsible subordinates , to supervise the detail and training of officers , the enrolment , assignment , and training of seamen , the disposition of the vessels , the organization of a reserve , the formation of plans for naval operations , not only against all enemies in general , but against each probable or possible enemy in particular , the determination of the requirements of the fleet in order to keep it abreast of modern invention , and finally , as the groundwork of the whole system , the collection of naval intelligence-that is , precise information in regard to naval development abroad , to the military and naval resources of foreign states , to their means of attack and defence , and to the strength of their fortifications : everything , in short , beyond the manufacture or purchase of materials , that goes to make a navy efficient for the prosecution of war . The effect of this half-reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Department was suddenly plunged into war , and no one at the Department had the faintest idea what was to be done , nor , indeed , was there anyone whose business it was to have such an idea . As to the chiefs of bureaus , the duty of one was to manage the navy yards , of another to construct vessels , ' of a third to build guns , of a fourth to supply provisions . None of them had anything to do with the conduct of naval operations . To have asked it of them would have been very much as if the Pennsylvania Railroad , to recur to our former illustration , should call upon the engineer of the shops at Altoona to furnish a summer schedule for excursion travel at outlying points of the road . Soon after he came to the Department , Mr. Welles , realizing his inability to grapple with the situation , called to his assistance Captain Fox , a man of considerable executive capacity , who had formerly been an officer of the navy . // Fox was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short time he became the professional adviser of the secretary in all that related to the conduct of the naval war . He was ultimately appointed assistant secretary , but his duties were essentially of a military character . As the chief of staff , which was what he really became , he had an herculean task before him . The Department had no office organized for staff work ; it contained no information upon which such an office could act ; it had not even any machinery by which the information could be procured , and much less classified and digested . At this critical moment , when the fate of the nation was trembling in the balance , when that very contingency of war had arisen , to meet which was the purpose of its existence , the navy , an establishment which had . been maintained for sixty years for the service of a state embracing thirty millions of people , was found by its secretary to be entirely destitute of any organized means of conducting the operations of war , except five bureaus of supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks , who knew as little of naval campaigns as they did of Hindu mythology . It was live months after the administration came in , five weary months , before it could even secure the passage of a law providing for an assistant secretary and the appointment of Fox to the office . Five months were required to accomplish this first step in the necessary organization for war  --  and during the whole time , as far as any established authority went , the navy continued under its Pina ore system of administration . It would be interesting to follow out the difficulties that were encountered by the new official , who was called an assistant secretary , but who was really the chief of staff , and see how they were met . Boards were organized to satisfy the various exigencies of the moment . One of these boards , composed of Captains Dupont and Davis , the Superintendent of the Coast Survey , audMajor Barnard , of the engineers , devoted itself to getting up the plan of a campaign . The device was ingenious , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . So little did the Navy Department know of the defensive capacity of the coast of its own country , that it was compelled to have a board in session for months , in consultation with the director of its coast survey and an army engineer , while the war was in progress , to ascertain where it might strike an effective blow , and that , too , with an enemy that was powerless on the sea . Another board of three naval officers proceeded early in August to study the subject of iron-clads , which had been used with effect five years before in the Black Sea , but of which so little was known at the Department that it took the board until the middle of September to reach a conclusion ! When Fox left the Department , at the close of the war , his attributions as chief of staff fell for a time into a species of decay ; but since then the bureaus , whose number was increased during the war to eight , have been given or have possessed themselves of various functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign to their legitimate business of supply . It should be added that this course was forced upon them by the absence of any properly organized office to do the work . Thus the Bureau of Engineering has obtained a quasi-supervision of the engineer force on board ship ; the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing becomes a sort of guardian of the interests of the paymasters ; the Bureau of Equipment , by a curious jumbling together of attributes , takes charge of the recruiting of seamen ; the Bureau of Ordnance directs gunnery drills on ship-board , with which , as far as its ordinary duties are concerned , it has no more to do than the superintendent of a gun-foundry ; the detail of officers falls to the chief of the Bureau of Navigation , doubtless because the others already have their share ; the training of officers and men is in part conducted independently , and in part divided between Ordnance , Navigation , and Equipment ; while an independent board of inspection has been organized to take a look at the condition of vessels proceeding to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been taken to improve the system . In the summer of // 1882 an office was established at the Navy Department called the Office of Naval Intelligence , to collect and systematize information upon the actual resources of foreign navies and the actual demands of naval war . Its work has been supplemented by correspondents in the cruising-ships , and by energetic naval attaches in Europe . It was created by a purely ministerial act , without any noise or flourish , but it contains the germ of a revolution in our naval administration . It is the first recognition in practice of the necessity that the administration should be prepared to carry on war . Of the work accomplished by the office during the four years of its existence , work that has been performed wholly by junior officers of the navy , it would be difficult to speak too highly ; upon every subject other than the manufacture and supply of materials , which last is within the province of the bureaus , it has become the reservoir of naval intelligence of the Department ; not a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact , minute , always kept up to date , are not drawn upon , and the only wonder is that the organization was ever able to do without it . With the first war it can hardly fall to be recognized for that which it is in fact , though not in namethe nucleus of a most efficient working staff . Only one more step is needed to complete the system  --  a measure which was in substance recommended by the Secretary of the Navy in his report of last year . Take away from the bureaus of supply the staff duties , or military duties , which have been parcelled out among them , the detail of officers , the recruiting and traiuing of seamen , the movements of vessels , the gunnery drills and practice , the collection of naval interngence , the higher training of officers for war , whether with books and lectures and war-games , or with ships , guns , and torpedoes , and weld them together in a single organization . It makes no difference whether we call it a bureau of personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general staff ; it will be a general staff whatever name it goes by , and it will give to the navy the one thing which it lacks to make it an efficient working machine . The question of naval material is much more difficult now than it was in 1861 . Before 1840 the science of naval construction had been nearly stationary for two hundred years . The next two decades were marked by rapid and radical changes , but the close of the period still showed the prevalence of a single definite opinion as to the requisites of a typical man-of-war . But since 1861 the rush of invention , for it can be called nothing less , has produced a multiplicity and complexity of types and of accessories , presenting a problem of which the most dextrous minds have as yet been unable to grasp the key . The evidence of the technical experts is conflicting . The result in the mind of the layman is utter bewilderment , and a conviction of the " anarchy , " as a recent French treatise has well called it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the comparative merits of the gun , the ram , and the torpedo , and whether they are best united in a single organism or made the predominant feature in specially adapted structures ; of armored , partly armored , and unarmored ships , of broadside batteries and turret batteries , of barbette guns and casemate guns , of steam with full sail-power and steam with limited sail-power , of single screws and twin screws , of sheathed bottoms and unsheathed bottoms , of big torpedo-boats and little torpedo-boats . He finds that these minor points and many others like them , are vital elements in determining the qualities which the new structure will possess-her speed , handiness , flotation , stability , draft , power of attack , vulnerability , and , by no means least , her cost ; and back of all these details lies the broad question of the general necessities of our naval policy , the demands which future wars may make upon the navy . This involves a knowledge of the size , character , and distribution of the forces of our probable enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the attack is to be met , repelled , perhaps returned , the vulnerable points on our coast , the supply of coal abroad , the requirements of blockade service , of the prevention of contraband trade , of the destruction of an enemy 's commerce and the protection of our own , // and , finally , the capacity of the merchant marine to afford a reserve  --  the whole question , in short , of naval strategy , under the conditions found in the situation of the United States . In order that the Secretary of the Navy , who presents the scheme , and Congress , which provides the money , may be enabled to act , it is necessary to have an authoritative opinion from experts who have come to a substantial agreement upon both these questionsthe general demands of our naval policy , and the specific way in which they are to be met . The first is pre-eminently a question for the general staff . The second involves the elaboration in detail of a definite programme , and can only be accomplished by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dealt with by a single man . The details not coming within the province of the board are filled out by the bureaus . The board can not expect to escape criticism-no board could expect that . But its conclusions , being the result of a general agreement , at least as far as the outside world knows-for its duty is to present to the world a decision , not a discussion-should receive , while awaiting Congressional action , the assent and support of individuals , and the latter must sink for the moment their individual hobbies . No Congress will vote money to carry out the recommendations of a board , when their ears are stunned by a chorus of dissentient voices proceeding from the service itsell . The first Advisory Board made majority and minority reports , which was enough of itself to kill any project . The decisions of the second board called forth violent opposition , and though the discussion was instructive to the service , it was wellnigh destructive of the plan . Until this freedom of speech , always irresponsible and sometimes unreflecting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only way of curbing it , the efforts of the Department will be neutralized , and the acqulsition of a modern navy will be indefinitely postponed . In regard to the types to be selected for the modern fleet , it is only necessary to say a word . In the present experimental condition of naval science , we can not afford to pin our faith to any extreme theory . We can not rely for the protection of our cities upon forts , or floating batteries , or torpedoes alone-we must have them all . For the composition of our fleets we must have vessels in considerable numbers , and we cannot satisfy our wants with two or three monster ironclads , even if professional opinion was more united than it is as to their efficiency . Seagoing ironclads there must be of some kind , and swift cruisers , and swifter gunboats of light draft , carrying one or two heavy guns , and torpedo-boats , the swiftest of all . At the present time the navy does not contain a single modern representative of these four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest of its seagoing fleet is composed of thirty-four ships , mostly of wood , of an obsolete type , with obsolete guns ; ships which have neither strength for combat nor speed for escape , and which are decaying so rapidly that in six years less than ten of them will be able to keep the sea . There are also fourteen oldfashioned monitors , whose armor and guns are unserviceable , and a dozen sailmg-vessels , a few of which are useful for training purposes . Among these sixty vessels there are no seagoing ironclads of any kind , no modern ironclads for harbor defence , no modern cruisers , no modern gunboats , or rams , or torpedoboats ; nor do any of the vessels carry modern guns . In short , as far as war is concerned , they are sixty names , and nothing more . I have said that we have one modern cruiser , the Atlanta . The Chicago and Boston , also modern steel cruisers , are approaching completiom By recent legislation provision has been made for two armored ships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one dynamite-gun vessel , and one torpedo-boat . The larger of these vessels can hardly be built in less than two years . Provision has also been made for the completion of the five doubleturretted monitors , which should be efficient vessels for coast defence . This represents a respectable beginning , but nothing more . If we are to have a modern navy , the policy of constructing new ships must be steadily persisted // in , so that each year may show a considerable addition to the fleet . In the ten years preceding the civil war , twenty screw-steamers were built for the navy , and the impression prevailed that by reason of these additions the country had a really powerful fleet . It was one of the many lessons taught by the first year of the war , that a fleet of ninety ships is not formidable , when seventy out of the nominal total are obsolete for purposes of war . To-day we are worse off than in 1861 , for at the present rate of decay of our wooden ships , which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall shortly lose even our nominal total , and the new constructions will be our only ships afloat ; unless we go back to the ruinous policy of rebuilding old hulks , under the name of repairs , which until 1882 was in fashion . In the one matter of modern torpedo-boats , which are not costly vessels , we are pitiably defective . The Endicott board decided that one hundred and fifty were necessary for purposes of harbor defence ; as yet we have but one even projected . In the matter of guns , the Ordnance Bureau in recent years has been making steady progress , and has accomplished results which have excited a4miration abroad as well as at home ; but the whole fleet must be armed anew , and so inadequate are the resources of our steel-works that we are compelled to go abroad for our materials . It is the part of wisdom to study the lessons of the past , and to learn what we may from the successes or the failures of our fathers . The history of the last war is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close has the navy been in a condition so favorable for their application . At least their meaning can not fail to be understood . They show clearly that , if we would have a navy fitted to carry on war , we must give some recognition to officers on the ground of merit , either by the advancement of the best or , what amounts to nearly the same thing , by the elimination of the least deserving ; that we must give them a real training for war , in modern ships and with modern weapons ; that the direction of the establishment , in so far as it has naval direction , must be given unity of purpose , and the purpose to which it must be directed is fighting efficiency ; that a naval reserve of men and of vessels must be organized , capable of mobilization whenever a call shall be made ; and , finally , that a dozen or a score of new ships will not make a navy , but that the process of renewal must go on until the whole fleet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . Until this rehabilitation can be accomplished , the navy will only serve the purpose of a butt for the press and a foot-ball for political parties ; and its officers , a body of men whose intefligence and devotion under a proper system would be equal to any trust , will be condemned to fritter away their lives in a senseless parody of their profession .
