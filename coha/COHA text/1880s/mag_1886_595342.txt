Twenty-three years ago the banks of the Tennessee witnessed a remarkable occurrence . There was a wage of battle . Heavy blows were given and received , and the challenger failed to make his cause good . But there were peculiar circumstances which distinguished the combat from other trials of strength in the rebellion : An army comprising seventy regiments of infantry , twenty batteries of artillery , and a sufficiency of cavalry , lay for two weeks and more in isolated camps , with a river in its rear and a hostile army claimed to be superior in numbers twenty miles distant in its front , while the commander made his headquarters and passed his nights nine miles away on the opposite side of the river . It had no line or order of battle , no defensive works of any sort , no outposts , properly speaking , to give warning , or check the advance of an enemy , and no recognized head during the absence of the regular commander . On a Saturday the hostile force arrived and formed in order of battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half of the unguarded army , advanced upon it the next morning , penetrated its disconnected lines , assaulted its camps in front and flank , drove its disjointed members successively from position to position , capturing some and routing others , in spite of much heroic individual resistance , and steadily drew near the landing and depot of its supplies in the pocket between the river and an impassable creek . At the moment near the close of the day when the remnant of the retrograding army was driven to refuge in the midst of its magazines , with the triumphant enemy at half-gunshot distance , the advance division of a rei*nforcing army arrived on the opposite bank of the river , crossed , and took position under fire at the point of attack ; the attacking force was checked , and the battle ceased for the day . The next morning at dawn the reinforcing army and a fresh division belonging to the defeated force advanced against the assailants , followed or accompanied by such of the broken columns of the previous day as had not lost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy from the captured camps and the field of battle . * 7-**J* / I , // 750 Such are the salient points in the popular conception and historical record of the battle of Shilob . Scarcely less remarkable than the facts themselves are the means by which the responsible actors in the critical drama have endeavored to counteract them . At society reunions and festive entertainments , in newspaper interviews and dispatches , in letters and contributions to periodicals , afterthought official reports , biographies , memoirs , and other popular sketches , the subject of Shiloh from the first hour of the battle to the present time has been invaded by pretensions and exculpatory statements , which revive the discussion only to confirm the memory of the grave faults that brought an army into imminent peril . These defenses and assumptions , starting first , apparently half suggested , in the zeal of official attendants and other partisans , were soon taken up more or less directly by the persons in whose behalf they were put forward ; and now it is virtually declared by the principals themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the battle , and that the blood of more than two thousand of its members shed on that field was a gratuitous sacrifice . With the origin of the animadversions that were current at the time upon the conduct of the battle , the Army of the Ohio had little to do , and it has not generally taken a willing part in the subsequent discussion . They commenced in the ranks of the victims , and during all the years that have given unwonted influence to the names which they affected , the witnesses of the first reports have without show of prejudice or much reiteration firmly adhered to their earlier testimony . It does not impair the value of that testimony if extreme examples were cited to illustrate the general fact ; nor constitute a defense that such examples were not the general rule . I have myself , though many years ago , made answer to the more formal pleas that concerned the army which I commanded , and I am now called upon in the same cause to review the circumstances of my connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the Army of the Ohio . WHEN by the separate or concurrent operations of the forces of the Department of the Missouri , commanded by General Halleck , and the Department of the Ohio , commanded by myself , the Confederate line had been broken , first at Mill Springs by General Thomas , and afterward at Fort Henry and at Fort Donelson by General Grant and the navy , and Nashville and Middle Tennessee were occupied by the Army of the Ohio , the shattered forces of the enemy fell back for the formation of a new line , and the Union armies prepared to follow for a fresh attack . It was apparent in advance that the Memphis and Charleston railroad between Memphis and Chattanooga would constitute the new line , and Corinth , the point of intersection of the Memphis and Charleston road running east GENERAL THOMAS J. WOOD . ( COPIED FROM AN ENGRAVING , BY PERMISSION OF 0 . VAN NOSTRAND . ) GENERAL THOMAS L CRITTENDEN . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BEADY. ) // and west , and the Mobile and Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main point of concentration . While this new defense of the enemy and the means of assailing it by the Union forces were maturing , General Halleck 's troops , for the moment under the immediate command of General C. F. Smith , were transported up the Tennessee by water to operate on the enemy 's railroad communications . It was purely an expeditionary service not intended for the selection of a rendezvous or depot for future operations . After some attempts to debark at other points farther up the river , Pittsburg Landing was finally chosen as the most eligible for the temporary object ; but when the concentration of the enemy at Corinth made that the objective point of a deliberate campaign , and the co5peration of General Halleck 's troops and mine was arranged , Savannah , on the east bank of the river , was designated by Halleck as the point of rendezvous . This , though not as advisable a point as Florence , or some point between Florence and Eastport , was in a general sense proper . It placed the concentration under the sbelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined force at liberty to choose its point of crossing and line of attack . On the restoration of General Grant to the immediate command of the troops , and his arrival at Savannah on the * 7th of March , he converted the expeditionary encampment at Pittsburg Landing into the point of rendezvous of the two armies , by placing his whole force on the west side of the river , apparrently on the advice of General Sherman , who , with his division , was already there . Nothing can be said upon any rule of military art or common expediency to justify that arrangement . An invading army may , indeed , as a preliminary step , throw an inferior force in advance upon the enemy 's coast or across an intervening river to secure a harbor or other necessary foothold ; but in such a case the first duty of the advanced force is to make itself secure by suitable works . Pittsburg Landing was in no sense a point of such necessity or desirability as to require any risk , or any great expenditure of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not safe alone , it had no business there ; but having been placed there , still less can any justification be found for the neglect of all proper means to make it secure against a superior adversary . General Grant continued his headquarters at Savannah , leaving General Sherman with a sort of control at Pittsburg Landing . Sherman 's rank did not allow him the command , but he was authorized to assign the arriving regiments to brigades and divis ions as he might think best , and designate the camping-grounds . In these and other ways he exercised an important influence upon the fate of the army . The movement of the Army of the Ohio from Nashville for the appointed junction , was commenced on the night of the * 5th of March by a rapid march of cavalry to secure the bridges in advance , which were then still guarded by the enemy . It was followed on the *6th and successive days by the infantry divisions , McCook being in advance with instructions to move steadily forward ; to ford the streams where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roads , such as building bridges over streams which were liable to frequent interruption by high water , to leave only a sufficient working party and guard for that purpose ; to use all possible industry and energy , so as to move forward steadily and as rapidly as possible without forcing the march or straggling ; and to send forward at once to communicate with General Smith at Savannah , and learn his situation . When the cavalry reached Columbia the bridge over Duck River was found in flames , and the river at flood stage . General McCook immediately commenced the construction of a frame bridge , but finding , after several days , that the work was progressing less rapidly than had been expected , I ordered the building of a boat bridge also , and both were completed on the 3oth . On the same day the river became fordable . I arrived at Columbia on the 26th . General Nelson succeeded in getting a portion of his division across by fording on the 29th , and was given the adGENERAL ALEXANDER McD . McCDDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM NELSON . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BEADY . ) General Nelson had an altercation with General Jefferson c . DaYis in the Gait House , Louisville , Kentucky , on the morning of Septemher 29 , a86s . General Davis shot General Nelson , who died almost instantly-EOIToR. vance . Most of his troops crossed by fording on the 3oth . The other divisions followed him on the march with intervals of six miles , so as not to incommode one another-in all five divisions , about thirty-seven thousand effective men . On the first day oF April , General Tialleck and General Grant were notified that I would concentrate at Savannah on Sunday and Monday , the 6th and 7th , the distance being ninety miles . On the 4th General Nelson received notification from General Grant that he need not hasten his march , as he could not he put across the river before the following Tuesday , but the rate of march was not changed . After seeing my divisions on the road , I // left Columbia on the evening of the 3d , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chief of staff and an orderly , leaving the rest of my staff to follow rapidly with the headquarters train . Nelson had already arrived and gone into camp , and Crittenden was close in his rear . We were there to form a junction for the contemplated forward movement under the command of General Halleck in person , who was to leave St. Louis the first of the following week to join us . General Grant had been at Nelson 's camp before my arrival , and said he would send boats for the division " Monday or Tuesday , or some time early in the week . " " There will , " he said , " be no fight at Pittsburg Landing ; we will have to go to Corinth , where the rebels are fortified . If they come to attack us we can whip them , as I have more than twice as many troops as I had at Fort Donelson. , , I did not see General Grant that evening-probably because he was at Pittsburg Landing when I arrived , but he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing breakfast at Nelson s camp Sunday morning , when the sound of artillery was heard up the river . We knew of no ground to apprehend a serious engagement , but the troops were promptly prepared to march , and I walked with my chief of staff ; Colonel James B. Fry , to Grant 's quarters at Savannah , but he had started up the river . I there saw General C. F. Smith , who was in his bed sick , but apparently not dangerously ill . He had no apprehension about a battle , thought it an affair of outposts , and said that Grant *ad sixty thousand men . This would agree approximately with the estimate which Grant himself made of his force , at Nelson 's camp . As the firing continued , and increased in volume , I determined to go to the scene of action . Nelson only waited for the services of a guide to march by land . The river bottom between Savannah and Pittsburg Landing was a labyrinth of roads from which the overflows had obliterated all recent signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was with great difficulty that a guide could be obtained . The artillery had to be left behind to be transported by water . After disposing of these matters and sending orders for the rear divisions to push forward without their trains , I took a small steamer at the Landing and proceeded up the river , accompanied only by my chief of staff . On the way we were met by a descending steamer which came alongside and delivered a letter from General Grant addressed to the " Commanding Officer , advanced forces , near Pittsburg , Tenn. , " and couched in the following words : VoL . XXXI. - 78 . " PITTsBuRG , April 6 , 1862. - GEN. : The attack on my forces has been very spirited since early this morning . The appearance of fresh troops on the field now wOuld have a powerful effect , both by inspiring our men and disheartening the enemy . If you will get upon the field , leaving all your baggage on the east bank of the river , it will be a move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rebel forces are estimated at over one hundred thousand men . My headquarters will be in the log building on the top of the hill , where you will be furnished a staff-officer to guide you to your place on the field . " Respectfully , &amp;c . U. S. GRANT , Maj.-Gen . " About half-way up we met a stream of fugitives that poured in a constantly swelling current along the west bank of the river . The mouth of Snake Creek was full of them swimming across . We arrived at the Landing about one o clock . I inquired for General Grant and was informed that he was on his headquarters boat , nearly against which we had landed . I went on board , and was met by him at the door of the ladies ' cabin , in which there were besides himself two or three members of his staff . Other officers may have entered afterward . He appeared to realize that he was beset by a pressing danger , and manifested by manner more than in words that he was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there was nothing in his deportment that the circumstances would not have justified without disparagementto the character of a courageous soldier . Certainly there was none of that masterly confidence which has since been assumed with reference to the occasion . After the first salutation , and as I walked to a seat , he remarked that he had just come in from the front , and held up his sword to call my attention to an indentation , which he said the scabbard had received from a shot . I did not particularly notice it , and after inquiring about the progress of the battle and requesting him to send steamers to bring up Crittenden 's division , which was coming into Savannah as I left , I proposed that we should go ashore . As we reached the gangway I noticed that the horses of himself and his staff were being taken ashore . He mounted and rode away , while I walked up the hill ; so that I saw him no more until the attack occurred at the Landing late in the evening . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a totally incorrect version of the place , manner , and substance of the interviewhas been used to give a false impression of the state of the battle , and a false coloring to personal traits which are assumed to have had the issue in control . On the shore I encountered a scene which has often been described . The face of the bluff was crowded with stragglers from the battle . The number there at different hours has been estimated at from five thousand in the morning // to fifteen thousand in the evening . The number at nightfall would not have fallen short of fifteen thousand , including those who had passed down the river , and the less callous but still broken and demoralized fragments about the camps on the plateau near the landing . At the top of the bluff all was confusion . Men mounted and on foot , and wagons with their teams and excited drivers , all strug*ling to force their way closer to the river , were mixed up in apparently inextricable confusion with a battery of artillery which was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The increasing throng already presented a barrier which it was evidently necessary to remove , in order to make way for the passage of my troops when they should arrive . In looking about for assistance I fell upon one officer , the quartermaster of an Ohio regiment , who preserved his senses , and was anxious to do something to abate the disorder . I instructed him to take control of the teams , and move them down the hill by a side road which led to the narrow bottom below the landing , and there park them . He went to work with alacrity and the efficiency of a strong will , and succeeded in clearing the ground of the wagons . It proved before night to have been a more important service than I had expected , for it not only opened the way for Nelson 's division , but extricated the artillery and made it possible to get it into action when the attack occurred at the Landing about sunset . It is now time to glance at the circumstances which had brought about and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UPON learning on the 2d of April of the advance of the Army of the Ohio toward Savannah , General Sidney Johnston determined to anticipate the junction of that army with General Grant 's force , by attacking the latter , and at once gave orders for the movement of his troops on the following day . It was his expectation to reach the front of the army at Pittsburg Landing on Friday , the 4th , and make the attack at daylight on Saturday ; but the condition of the roads , and some confusion in the execution of orders , prevented him from getting into position for the attack until three o'clock on Saturday . This delay and an indiscreet reconnoissance which brought on a sharp engagement with the Federal pickets , rendered it so improbable that the Union commander would not be prepared for the attack , that General Beauregard advised the abandonment of the enterprise , to the success of which a surprise was deemed to be essential . General Johnston overruled the proposition , however , and the attack was ordered for the following morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering the front of the Federal position . Hardee commanded the first line , Bragg the second , and Polk and Breckinridge the third , the latter being intended as a reserve . // The locality on which the storm of battle was about to burst has often been described with more or less of inaccuracy or incompleteness . It is an undulating table-land , quite broken in places , elevated a hundred feet or thereabout above the river ; an irregulartriangle in outline , nearly equilateral , with the sides four miles long , bordered on the east by the river , which here runs nearly due north , on the north-west by Snake Creek and its tributary , Owl Creek , and on the south , or southwest , by a range of hills which immediately border Lick Creek on the north bank , two hundred feet or more in height , and sloping gradually toward the battle-field . In these hills rise the eastern tributaries of Owl Creek , one of them , called Oak Creek , extending halfway across the front or south side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek , which runs in the opposite direction into Lick Creek a mile from its mouth . Other short , deep ravines start from the table-land and empty into the river , the principal among them being Dill 's Branch , six hundred yards above the Landing . Midway in the front , at the foot of the Lick Creek hills , start a number of surface drains which soon unite in somewhat difficult ravines and form Tillman 's Creek , or Brier Creek . It runs almost due north , a mile and a quarter from the river , in a deep hollow , which divides the tableland into two main ridges . Tillman 's Creek empties into Owl Creek half a mile above the Snake Creek bridge by which the division of Lew . Wallace arrived . Short , abrupt ravines break from the main ridges into Tillman 's Hollo* and the broad surface of the west ridge is further broken by larger branches which empty into Owl Creek . Tillman 's Hollow , only about a mile long , is a marked feature in the topography , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburg Landing is three-quarters of a mile above the mouth of Snake Creek , and two and a quarter miles below the mouth of Lick Creek . Shiloh Church is on Oak Creek two miles and a half south-west of Pittsburg Landing . The table-land comes up boldly to the river at the Landing and for a mile south . Beyond those limits the river bend*away from the highland , and the bottom gradually widens . The principal roads are the River road , as it will here be called , which crosses Snake Creek at the bridge before mentioned , and running a mile west of Pittsburg Landing , obliquely along the ridge east of Tillman s Creek , crosses Lick Creek three quarters of a mile from the river at the east end of the Lick Creek hills ; the Hamburg and Purdy road , which branches from the River road a mile and two-thirds in a straight line south of Pittsburg Landing , and extends north-west four hundred yards north of Shiloh Church ; and two roads that start at the Landing , cross the River road two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Hamburg and Purdy road nearly opposite the church . In the official reports these various roads are called with some confusion , but not altogether inaccurately , Crump 's Landing road , Hamburg road , Corinth road or Purdy road , even over the same space , according to the idea of the writer . The Corinth road from the Landing has two principal branches . The western branch passes by the church , and the eastern passes a mile east of the church into the Bark road , which extends along the crest of the Lick Creek hills . The military maps show many other roads , some of them farm-roads , and some only well-worn tracks made in hauling for the troops . In some places the old roads were quite obliterated , and are improperly represented on the maps , as in the case of the River road , which is not shown on the official map between McArthur 's and Hurlbut 's headquarters , immediately west of the Landing . It is shown on Sherman 's camp map , and its existence is not doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest part of the ground was in forest , sometimes open , sometimes almost impenetrable for horsemen , with occasional cleared fields of from twenty to eighty acres ; and these variations operated in a signal manner upon the fortune of the combatants . There was not a cleared field within the limits of the battle that has not its history . We may now locate the troops in their encampments , for there is where the battle found them , and its currents and eddies will frequently be discovered by the reference to certain camps in the official reports . The camp map which I received from General Sherman will serve as a useful guide , subject to some necessary modifications , to make a field sketch agree with an actual survey . But the regimental camps did not always conform to the lines laid down for the brigades and divisions . Sometimes they were in front , sometimes in rear of the general line . I have not pretended generally to introduce these variations into the map which I have prepared to accompany this article . Starting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. H. L. Wallace , in the space bounded by the river , Snake Creek , the River road , and the right-hand road leading west from the Landing . Along that road are , in this order , the camps of the Twelfth , Seventh , Fourteenth and Second Iowa , and the Fifty-second and Ninth Illinois . At the point where that road crosses the River road , // in the south-west angle of the intersection , are the headquarters of General McArthur . On the east side of the River road , north of McArthur are , first , the Fourteenth Missouri , called " Birge 's Sharpshooters " ( not on the Sherman camp map ) , and next the Eighty-first Ohio . The Sixteenth Wisconsin has been assigned to Prentiss 's division since the Sherman map was made , and the Thirteenth Missouri has probably taken that ground . All these points are particularly mentioned in the reports of the battle and have been verified . On the left-hand road where it crosses the River road , three-quarters of a mile from the Landing , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigade between the road and the river , and the line of the two other brigades bearing off to the north-west . I have located the Third Iowa , of that division , on the ground just in front of which Crittenden 's division was first formed in line Monday morning , because it was stated to me at the time that General Prentiss was killed at that camp ; the fact being that near that point Prentiss was captured and W. H. L. Wallace mortally wounded . At the fork of the River road and the Hamburg and Purdy road , is the camp of Sherman 's Second Brigade , commanded by Colonel Stuart , two miles *rom the division to which it belongs , and one mile from Hurlbut 's division . On both sides of the eastern Corinth road half a mile south of the Hamburg and Purdy road , is Prentiss 's division ( the Sixth ) of two brigades . It is not shown on the Sherman map . Stretching across the western Corinth road at the Church , along Oak Creek , are the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Hildebrand 's brigade being on the east side of the road , Buckland 's next on the west side , aM McDowell'snexton Buckland 's right . Only one regiment ( the Sixth Iowa ) of McDowell 's brigade is shown on the Sherman map . The official reports and other authority locate the First Diyision ( McClernand 's ) as follows : The right of the Third Brigade is at the point where the western Corinth road crosses the Hamburg and Purdy road , five hundred yards 7 , // from the church , and the left is two hundred yards from Hildebrand 's brigade , which is thus obliquely in its front . The other twobrigades , on a general line starting from the right of the Third , form an obtuse angle with the Third , and are along the ridge nearly parallel with Tiiman 's Creek , the extreme right being not far from the bluff overlooking Owl Creek bottom . The First Brigade is on the east side of the adjacent field instead of the west side , as the Sherman map , according to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not show the field . It remains to be added that three of the five divisions were for that period of the war old and experienced troops . Hurlbut 's Third Brigade belonged to the Army of the Ohio , and had been sent to ret*nforce Grant before Donelson . Eight other regiments were furnished by me for the first movement up the Tennessee , and remained with Grant 's army . Sherman 's division , one of the newest , had been under his command more than a month , and ought to have been in a tolerably efficient state of discipline . Prentiss 's division , composed largely of raw regiments , had only been organized a few days ; yet it was posted in the most exposed and assailable point on the front . The effective force at the date of the battle , exclusive of Lew . Wallace 's division , which was at or near Crump 's Landing , six miles below , is stated by Gen. // eral Sherman at 32,000 men ; by General Grant at 33,000 . General Wallace left two regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Landing , and joined the army Sunday evening , with , as he states , not more than *ooo men . I proceed now , in the light of the official reports and other evidence , to explain briefly what happened : the object being not so much to criticise the manner of the battle , or give a detailed description of it , as to trace it to its actual condition at the close of the first day , and outline its progress during the second . With this object the question of a surprise has little to do . I stop , therefore , only to remark that each revival of that question has placed the fact in a more glaring light . The enemy was known to be at hand , but no adequate steps were taken to ascertain in what force or with what design . The call to arms blended with the crash of the assault , and when the whole forest on the rising ground in front flashed with the gleam of bayonets , then General Sherman , as he reports , " became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined attack . " Yet among the more watchful officers in the front divisions , there was a nervous feeling that their superiors were not giving due heed to the presence of hostile reconnoitering parties , though they little imagined the magnitude of the danger that impended . On Saturday General Sherman was notified of these parties . He answered that the pickets must be strengthened , and instructed to be vigilant ; that he was embarrassed for the want of cavalry ; his cavalry had been oi*1ered away , and the cavalry he was to have instead had not arrived ; as soon as they reported he would send them to the front and find out what was there . In one of his brigades the regimental commanders held a consultation , at which it was determined to strengthen the pickets . These are curious revelations to a soldier 's ear . Prentiss 's vigilance gave the first warning of the actual danger , and in fact commenced the contest . On Saturday , disquieted by the frequent appearance of the enemy 's cavalry , he increased his pickets though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large force . Early Sunday morning one of these picketguards , startled no doubt by the hum of forty thousand men half a mile distant , waking up for battle , went forward to ascertain the cause , and soon came upon the enemy 's pickets , which it promptly attacked . It was then a quarter-past five o'clock , and all things being ready , the Confederate general , accepting the signal of the pickets , at once gave the order to advance . Previously , however , General Prentiss , still apprehensive , had sent forward Colonel Moore of the Twenty-first Missouri , with five companies to strengthen the picket-guard . On the way out Colonel Moore met the guard returning to camp with a number of its men killed and wounded . Sending the latter on to camp and calling for the remaining companies of his regiment , he proceeded to the front in time to take a good position on the border of a cleared field and open fire upon the enemy 's skirmishers , checking them for a while ; but the main body forced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself among the number . All this occurred in front of Sherman 's camp , not in front of Prentiss 's . This spirited beginning , unexpected on both sides , gave the first alarm to the divisions of Sherman and Prentiss . The latter promptly formed his division at the first news from the front , and moved a quarter of a mile in advance of his camp , where he was attacked before Sherman was under arms . He held his position until the enemy on his right passed him in attacking Sherman , whose left regiment immediately broke into rout . He then retired in some disorder , renewing the resistance in his camp but forced back in still greater disorder , until at nine o'clock he came upon the line which Hurlbut and W. H. L. Wallace were forming half a mile in rear . Upon the first alarm in his camp , which was simultaneous with the attack upon Sherman , McClernand rapidly got under arms , and endeavored to support Sherman 's left with his Third Brigade , only two hundred yards in rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted order still farther to the rear and left , to oppose the enemy 's columns pouring in upon his left flank through the opening on Sherman 's left ; but his Third Brigade was forced back with the fugitives from Sherman 's broken line by the advancing enemy , and endeavored with only partial success to form on the right of McClernand 's line , which at first was formed vith the left a little south , and the center north of the Corinth road . Before the formation was completed the line was compelled to retire by the pressure on its front and left flank , with the loss of six pieces of artillery , but it re-formed three hundred yards in rear . Hildebrand 's brigade had now disappeared in complete disorder from the front , leaving three pieces of artillery in the hands of the enemy . Buckland formed promptly at the first alarm , and in order to keep the enemy back endeavored by Sherman 's direction to throw a regiment beyond Oak Creek , which covered his front at a distance of two hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordering the stream the enemy was // encountered on the hither side . Nevertheless the brigade resisted effectively for about two hours the efforts of the assailants to cross the boggy stream in force . The enemy suffered great loss in these efforts , but succeeded at last . Before being quite forced back , Buckland received orders from Sherman to form line on the Purdy road four hundred yards in rear , to connect with McClernand 's right . Orders were also given to McDowell , who had not yet been engaged , to close to the left on the same line . These orders were in effect defeated in both cases , and five pieces of artillery lost by faults in the execution and the rapid advance of the enemy . Sherman 's division as an organized body disappeared from the field from this time until the close of the day . McDowell 's brigade preserved a sort of identity for a while . Sherman reports that at " about 10:30 A. M. the enemy had made a furious attack on General McClernand 's whole front . Finding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank of the enemy , forced him back some distance , and then directed the men to avail themselves of every cover-trees , fallen timber , and a wooded valley to our right . " It sounds like the signal to disperse , and a little after one o'clock the brigade and regiments are seen no more . Some fragments of the division and the commander himself attached themselves to McClernand 's command , which now , owing to its composite and irregular organization , could hardly be denominated a division . The contest which raged in McClernand 's camp wa* of a fluctuating character . The ground was lost and won more than once , but each ebb and flow of the struggle left the Union side in a worse condition . In his fifth position McClernand was driven to the camp of his First Brigade , half of his command facing to the south and half to the west , to meet the converging attack of the enemy . His nominal connection with the left wing of the army across the head of Tillman 's Hollow had been severed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that formed it . Another reverse to his thinned ranks would drive him over the bluff into Owl Cr&amp;k bottom , and perhaps cut him off from the river . He determined , therefore , between two and three o'clock to retire across Tillman 's Hollow in the direction of the Landing . That movement was effected with a good deal of irregularity , but with the repulse of a small body of pursuing cavalry , and a new line was formed on the opposite ridge along the River road , north of Hurlbut 's headquarters . I shall have occasion farther along to remark upon the display of force on the right of this line in 759 the vicinity of McArthur 's headquarters . The movement must have been completed about three o'clock . Leaving the right wing , as it may be called , in this position prior to the attack of four o'clock , which drove it still farther back , we will return to the current of events in the left wing . With Stuart on the extreme left , as with the other commanders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was soon compelled to fall back from his camp to a new position , and presently again to a third , which located him on the prolongation and extreme left of the line formed by Hurlbut and W. H. L. Wallace , but without having any connection with it . As soon as the first advance of the enemy was known , these two commanders were called upon by those in front for support . In the absence of a common superior itwas sent forward by regiments or brigades in such manner as seemed proper to the officer appealed to , and after that was left to its own devices . It seldom formed the connection desired , or came under the direction of a common superior . Indeed , the want of cohesion and concert in the Union ranks , is conspicuously indicated in the official reports . A regiment is rarely overcome in front , but falls back because the regiment on its right or left has done so , and exposed its flank . It continues its backward movement at least until it is well under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who then must also needs fall back . Once in operation , the process repeats itself indefinitely . In a broken and covered country which affords occasional rallying points and obstructs the pursuit , it proceeds step by step . On an open field in the presence of light artillery and cavalry , it would run rapidly into general rout . This outfianking , so common in the Union reports at Shiloh , is not a mere excuse of the inferior commanders . It is the practical consequence of the absence of a common head , and the judicious use of reserves to counteract partial reverses and preserve the front of battle . The want of a general direction is seen also in the distribution of Hurlbut 's and Wallace 's divisions . Hurlbut sent a brigade under Colonel Veatch , to support Sherman 's left ; Wallace sent one under General McArthur to the opposite extreme to support Stuart ; and the two remaining brigades of each were between the extremes - Wallace on Veatch 's left but not in connection with it , and Hurlbut on McArthur 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was two miles to the left of Sherman 's division to which he belonged . When the three Confederate lines were brought together successively at the front , there was , of course , a great apparent // mingling of organizations ; but it was not in their case attended with the confusion that might be supposed , because each division area was thereby supplied with a triple complement of brigade and division officers , and the whole front was under the close supervision of four remarkably efficient corps commanders . The evils of disjointed command are plainly to be seen in the arrangement of the Federal line , but the position of the left wing after the forced correction of the first faulty disposition of Hurlbut 's brigades was exceedingly strong , and in the center was held without a break against oft-repeated assaults from nine o'clock until five o'clock . From twelve until two it was identical with the second position taken by Nelson and Crittenden on Monday , and it was equally formidable against attack from both directions . Its peculiar feature consisted in a wood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by open fields , and with open but sheltering woods in front and rear . The Confederates gave the name of Hornets ' Nest to the thicket part of it on Sunday , and it was in the open ground on the east flank that General Sidney Johnston was killed . On this line , between and under the shelter of Hurlbut and W. H. L. Wallace , Prentiss rallied a considerable force , perhaps a thousand men , of his routed division at nine o'clock , and fought stubbornly until near the close of the day . By three o'clock the withdrawal of the right wing , accompanied by Veatch 's brigade , exposed Wallace 's right flank , which also partially crumbled away ; and the retirement of Stuart about the same hour before the strong at4ack brought against him , and of Hurlbut at four o'clock under the same powerful pressure upon his left flank , left Prentiss , and Wallace with his remaining regiments isolated and unsupported . Still they held their ground while the enemy closed upon eachflank . As they were about being completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mortally wounded in the attempt at five o'clock . Some of his regiments under Colonel Tuttle fought their way through the cross-fire of the contracting lines of the enemy , but six regiments of the two divisions held fast until the encompassment was complete* and one by one with Prentiss , between half-past five and six o'clock , they were forced to surrender . This gallant resistance , and the delay caused by the necessary disposition of the captives , weakened the force of the attack which McClernand sustained in his seventh position on the River road at four o'clock , and retarded the onward movement of the enemy for nearly three hours after the retirement of the right wing from the west side of Tillman 's Creek . Before the incumbrance of their success was entirely put out of the way the Confederates pressed forward to complete a seemingly assured victory , but it was too late . Jackson 's brigade , and the Ninth and Tenth Mississippi of Chalmers 's brigade crossed Dill 's ravine , and their artillery on the south side swept the bluff at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hurlbut had hurriedly got into line in rear of the reserve artillery five hundred yards from the river , but from there to the Landing-there was not a soldier in ranks or any organized means of defense . Just as the danger was perceived Colonel Webster , Grant 's chief of artillery , rapidly approached Colonel Fry and myself . The idea of getting the battery which was standing in park into action was expressed simultaneously by the three , and was promptly executed by Colonel Webster 's immediate exertion . General Grant came up a few minutes later , and a member of his escort was killed in that position . Chalmers 's skirmishers approached to within one hundred yards of the battery . The number in view was not large , but the gunners were already abandoning their pieces , when Ammen 's brigade , accompanied by Nelson , came into action . The attack was repelled , and the engagement ended for the day . In his report of April 9 , to General Halleck , General Grant says of this incident : " At a late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy to turn our left and get possession of the landing , transports , &amp;c . This point was guarded by the gun-boats Tyler and Lexington , Captains Gwin and Shirk , U. S. Navy , commanding , four twenty-pounder Parrott guns , and a battery of rifled guns . As there is a deep and impassable ravine for artillery or cavalry , and very difficult for infantry , at this point , no troops were stationed here , except the necessary artillerists and a small infantry force for their support . Just at this moment the advance of Maj. - Gen . Buell 's column ( a part of the division under General Nelson ) arrived , the two generals named both being present . An advance was immediately made upon the point of attack and the enemy soon driven back . In this repulse , much is due to the presence of the gun-boats Tyler and Lexington , and their able commanders , Captains Gwin and Shirk . " My own official report is to the same effect . In a calm review of the battle , not unfriendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence , General Hurlbut said : " About six p. m. this movement ( for a final attack at the Landing ) was reported to General Hurlhut . He at once took measures to change the front of two regiments , or parts of regiments , of which the Fifty-fifth Illinois was one , and to turn six pieces of artillery to bear upon the point of danger . At that instant , he being near the head of the Landing road , General Grant came up from the river , closely followed by Ammen 's brigade of Nelson 's division . Information of the expected attack was promptly given , and two of Ammen 's regiments deployed into line , moved rapidly forward , and after a few sharp exchanges of volleys from them , the enemy fell back , and the bloody series of engagements of Sunday at Pittsburg Landing closed with that last repulse. " // The reports of all the officers who took part in the action at the Landing , Nelson , Ammen , and the regimental commanders , fully sustain the main point in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement in his CENTURY article . I have myself never described the attack at the Landing as " a desperate effort " of the enemy ; but I have said that the condition of affairs at that point made the occasion critical . We know from the Confederate reports that the attack was undertaken by Jackson 's and Chalmers 's brigades as above stated ; that the reserve artillery could effect nothing against the attacking force under the shelter of Dill 's ravine ; that the fire of the gun-boats was equally harmless on account of the elevation which it was necessary to give the guns in order to clear the top of the bluff ; and that the final assault , owing to the show of resistance , was delayed . Jackson 's brigade made its advance without cartridges . When they came to the crest of the hill and found the artillery supported by infantry , they shrank from the assault with bayonets alone , and Jackson went in search of co5peration and VOL . XXXI. - 79. support . In the meantime the attack was superseded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . The attack was poorly organized , but it was not repelled until Ammen arrived , and it can not be affirmed under the circumstances that the action of his brigade in delaying and repelling the enemy was not of the most vital importance . Had the attack been made before Nelson could arrive , with the means which the enemy had abundantly at hand , it would have succeeded beyond all question . As fast as Nelson 's division arrived it was formed in line of battle in front of Grant 's troops , pickets were thrown across Dill 's ravine , and the dawn of another day was awaited to begin the second stage in the battle ; or speaking more correctly , to fight the second battle of Shiloh . Let usin the meantime examine more in detail the condition in which the first day had left General Grant 's command , and its prospects unaided for the morrow . THE evidence relied upon to refute the accepted belief in the critical condition of PITTSBURG LANDING .

T shall examine these data upon the evidence of the official reports and my own observation . The official map was prepared after the arrival of General Halleck at Pittsburg Landing , by his topographical engineer , General Thom . The topographical part of it was made from an approximate survey , and though not strictly accurate , is sufficiently so for an intelligent study of the battle . For the errors in the location of the troops General Thom can not be supposed to be responsible , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from the statements of others ; but in what is given and what is withheld they are of a very misleading nature . They consist , first , in the extension of Grant 's line on the evening of the 6th a full half-mile to tbe west of its true limit-placing Hurlbut 's division on the front actually occupied by McClernand , McClernand on and four hundred yards beyond Sherman 's ground , and Sherman entirely on the west side of Tiliman 's Hollow on the right of the camping-ground of McClernand 's division , and within the lines occupied by the Confederates . On the morning of the 7th the place , from left to right , McClernand , then Sherman , then Lew . Wallace , along the bluff bordering Owl Creek bottom , all west of Tillman 's Creek , and on ground which we did not possess until after four hours of fighting ; followed on the left by Hurlbut 's division ; thus occupying a solid front of a mile and a third , in comparison with which the undeveloped * , f*ont of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give no account of the positions during the battle , in which the right of that army was substantially in contact with Wallace 's division on the extreme right . They give two of its positions , * . one in the first formation before its front was developed , and the other at the close of the day , when Grant 's troops had taken possession of their camps again , and mine had been withdrawn from the ground on which the y fought . These two positions are taken from my official map , but not the intermediate positions shown on that map . On the copy of the Thom map published with General Grant 's article in the February number of THE CENTURY ( 1885 ) , it is stated that " the positions of the troops were indicated in accordance with information furnished at the time by Generals Grant , I3uell , and Sherman . " It would be presumed that Grant and Sherman , the latter especially , in consequence of his intimate relations with Halleck 's headquarters , were consulted about the location of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their information was the guide . If any information of mine was adopted , it was only through the map that accompanied my report , and with reference to the position of my own troops . Nineteen years after the ba4ttle General hi PITTSBURG LANDING , VIEWED FROM TIlE FERRY LANDING ON THE OPPOSITE SNORE . ( FROM A RECENT PHOTOGRAPH. ) // Sherman revised the official map , and deposited his version with the archives of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee for historical use . Ostensibly it accepts the topography of the Thom map , but modifies the positions of the troops in the most radical manner . On the Thom map the line of battle Sunday evening is represented as being along the right-hand road leading west from the Landing , with the reserve artillery and Nelson 's and Crittenden 's divisions on the left , and Hurlbut , McClernand , and Sherman in the order mentioned , toward the right . The modification of this position of the troops by the Sherman edition , may be described as follows : Looking west over the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river marked " Buell . " No part of my army is represented on the west bank . On the west side of the river , four hundred yards back from the Landing and parallel with the river , is a line one hundred yards long marked " Grant . " Extending back from the river along Dill 's Branch , is a line half a mile long marked " Detachments . " This might mean the Reserve Artillery . From the outer extremity of the " Detachments " is a line two-thirds of a mile long running west , but swelling in the center well to the south , with its right resting on Tillman 's Creek , and marked " Hurlbut . " On the right of Hurlbut extending in the same west course , and entirely on the west side of Tillman 's Creek , is a double line one-eighth of a mile long marked " McClernand . " Then commencing one hundred yards north-west of McClernand 's right and extending due north , along the edge of the field in front of the camp of McClernand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile long marked " Sherman . " On the right of this line are three houses covered in front by a sort of-demilune and wing , between which and the main Sherman line is a bastion-like arrangement . The demi-lune figure General Sherman designates as a " strong flank , " and says it was occupied by Birge 's Sharpshooters . Off to the right is seen Lew . Wallace 's division crossing Snake Creek bridge , and marching toward the demi-lune by a road which had no existence in fact or on the original Thom map . At the angle between Sherman and McClernand is a ravine which extends into the camp of McClernand 's division , and along the sides of this ravine from the right and left respectively of McClernand and Sherman are two dotted lines terminating in a point at the head of the ravine . In his speech submitting his map to the society , General Sherman explains how that horn-like projection was formed , with other particulars , as follows : " In the very crisis of the battle of April 6 , about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Snake Creek bridge to the forks of the Corinth and Purdy road , there occurred an incident I have never seen recorded . Birge 's Sharpshooters , or Squirrel Tails , ' occupied the stables , granaries and house near the bridge as a strong flank . My division occupied a double line from it along what bad oncebeen a lane with its fences thrown down , and the blackberry and sassafras bushes still marking the border of an open cotton-field in front , and the left was in a ravine near which Major Ezra Taylor had assembled some ten , or twelve guns . This ravine was densely wooded and extended to the front near two hundred ABOVE THE LANOINO-THE STORE , AND A PART OF THE NATIONAL cEMETERy .

I ordered the colonel of one of my regiments to occupy that ravine to anticipate the enemy , but he did not quickly catch my meaning or comprehend the tactics by which he could fulfill my purpose . I remember well that Colonel Thomas W. Sweeny , a one-armed officer who had lost an arm in the Mexican War and did not belong to my command , stood near by and quickly spoke up : I understand perfectly what you want ; let me do it . ' Certainly , ' said I , Sweeny , go at once and occupy that ravine , converting it into a regular bastion . ' He did it , and I attach more importance to that event than to any of the hundred achievements which I have since heard saved the day , ' for we held that line and ravine all night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And yet it will be seen that this new line , prepared with such elaboration of detail and introduced with such richness of anecdotal embellishment , was a thorough delusion ; that Birge 's Sharpshooters were not there , and that General Sherman was in a different place ! Setting aside historical accuracy , however , the advantage of the revised arrangement is obvious . It extended General Grant 's territory a half mile to the south , fully as much to the west , taking in Tillman 's Hollow , one-third of McClernand 's captured camp , and a large part of the Confederate army , giving a battle front of two miles and a half instead of one mile , and requiring no greater power of imagination to man it than to devise it . In presenting his map to the society , General Sherman said : " The map as thus modified tells the story of the battle ! " There can be no doubt that General Sher man 's position will carry unhesitating credence to his naked assertion in the minds of a considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers will say , that until the accuracy of the official map is disproved , it must be accepted as the standard representation of the battle . It is proper , therefore , to cite the proof which rejects both , and establishes a materially different version . The investigation may be confined , for the present , to the location of the Federal line of battle on Sunday evening . The other errors in the maps will be developed incidentally as the general subject progresses . Moreover , the inquiry will be directed specifically to the Sherman map , as that includes the faults of the Thom map as well as its own peculiar errors . It is unnecessary to remark upon the exclusion of Nelson 's leading brigade from the west bank of the river on the Sherman map . Its presence there at the time in question is as notorious as the battle itself . The distance from the Landing to Dill 's Branch is six hundred yards . Sherman places his " Detachments , " I. e. , the " Reserve Artillery , " exactly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards north of it . During the engagement the Confederates passed the ravine and reached the crest of the hill on the north side . After the engagement Nelson 's division occupied the ravine , and his pickets held ground beyond it during the night . None of Grant 's troops were ever in that position .

The reader will be spared the impression of some irrelevancy if he will keep these additional objects in mind . Of the position of General Hurlbut 's division , the next on the right of the " Detachments , " that officer says in his official report : " On reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in forming line of hattie in rear of the guns . " That brought his division on the line of the right-hand road leading back from the river , but not entirely to the right of the artillery where the Thorn map places it . He adds : " I passed to the right and found myself in communication with General Sherman , and received his instructions . In a short time the enemy appeared on the crest of the rid*ge , led by the Eighteenth Louisiana , " etc . " General Sherman 's artillery also was rapidly engaged , and after an artillery contest of some duration , the enemy fell back . " . . . " About dark the firing ceased . I advanced my division one hundred yards to the front , threw out pickets , and officers and men bivouacked in a heavy storm of rain . About twelve p. m . General Nelson 's leading columns passed through my line and went to the front , and I called in my advance guard . " The next division in the regular order is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe the presence of General Sherman , with at least a portion of his command , in communication with Hurlbut 's right . General Sherman , it will beremembered , locates this division ( McClernand 's ) on the west side of Tillman 's Creek . We trace its retrogression step by step , from its permanent camp , across Tillman 's Hollow , at the close of the day , by the following extracts from General McClernand 's report : " Continuing this sanguinary conflict until several regiments of my division had exhausted their ammunition , and its right flank had been borne back , and it was in danger of being turned , the remainder of my command also fell back to the camp of the First Brigade . Here the portion that had first fallen back re-formed paralleiwith the camp , and fronting the approach of the enemy from the west , while the other portion formed at right angles with it , still fronting the approach of the enemy from the south . . . . It was two o'clock when my fiftb line had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ( the enemy ) moved a considerable force by the right flank , with the evident intention of turning my left . To defeat this purpose , I ordered my command to fall bach in the direction of the Landing , across a deep hollow and to re-form on the east side of anotherfield , in the shirts of a wood . This was my sixth line . Here we rested a half hour , continuing to supply our men with ammunition , until the enemy 's cavalry were seen rapidly crossing the field to the charge . Waiting until they approached within some thirty paces of our line , I ordered a fire , which was delivered with great coolness and destructive effect . First halting , then wavering , they turned and fled in confusion , leaving behind a number of riders and horses dead on the field . The Twenty-ninth Illinois Infantry , inspired by the courageous example of their commanding officer , Lt. - Colonel Ferrell , bore the chief part in this engagement . . . . In the meantime , under cover of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field yielded by our forces , the enemy continued his endeavors to turn the flanks of my line , and to cut me off from the landing . To prevent this I ordered my left wing to fall back a short distance and form an obtuse angle with the center , opposing a double front to the enemy 's approach . Thus disposed , my left held the enemy in check , while my whole line slozoly fell bach to my seventh position . Here Ire-formed the worn andfamishing remnant of my division , on favorable ground along a north and south road , supported on my right byfragmeuts of General Sherman 's division , and on my left by the Fourteenth Illinois and Twenty-fifth Indiana under command of Colonel Veatch , acting brz*adier-general . " The identity of this seventh position of General McClernand is determined by the following extracts . Colonel Marsh , commanding McClernand 's Second Brigade , says : " At this time , my command having been reduced to a merely nominal one , I received orders to fall a short distance to the rear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commands , and commands which should attempt to pass . In obedience to this , though with some difficulty as regarded portions of some commands , whose officers seemed little inclined to halt short of the river , . . . I had gathered quite a force , and formeda line near the camp of the Sciond Division , concealing my men in the timber facin6 an open field . I here requested Colonel Davis , of the Forty-sixth 767 BRIGAnIER-OENERAL WILLIAM N.

He promptly and cheerfully responded . . . In a short time General McGlernand , with portions of the First and Third Brigades of his own division , and two regiments of Ohio troops , came up and formed on the left of the line I had already established . " Colonel Davis , of the Forty-sixth Ill. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nmmunition exhausted , the men tired and hungry , and myself exhausted , having lost my horse in the first engagement , and compelled to go on foot the balance of the time , and finding myself within one-half mile of my regiuzental encampment , I marched my men to it and got dinner for them . Calling my men into line immediately after dinner , I formed them upon the rlyht of the brigade commanded by Colonel C. C. Marsh , at his request , in front and to the left of my camp , where we again met the enemy on Sunday evening . " Colonel Engelmann , of the Forty-third Illinois , whose report in many respects is a remarkably clear and interesting one , says : " NYc now fell back by degrees ( from McClernand 's sixth position ) , and a new line being formed , we found ourselves posted between the Forty-sixth Illinois and the Thirteenth Missouri , ourposition being midway between the encampments of the Forty sixth and Ninth Illinois . " Colonel Wright , Thirteenth Mo. , of MeArthur 's brigade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's division , says : " After advancing and falling back several times , the regiment was forced to retire , with all the others there , to the road which crosses the Purdy road at right angles The " Purdy road " here mentioned is the continuation of the right-handroad leading from the Landing . The camp of the Ninth Illinois was in the north-east angle of the intersection of that road with the River road , and General McArthur 's headquarters were in the south-west angle of the same intersection . The camp of the Forty-sixth Illinois was located in the south-east angle of the intersection of the River road and a middle road leading west from the Landing , about five hundred yards from McArthur 's headquarters . These reports plainly identify General McClernand 's seventh position , of which General Sherman formed part , with the River road between McArthur 's and Hurlbut 's headquarters . It is a full half-mile in rear of the position given to Sherman 's division on the Thom map , and of the position which General Sherman assigns to himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek intervening . The struggle which drove General McClernand from his seventh position is described by that officer as follows : " The enemy renewed the contest by trying to shell us from our position . . . . Advancing in heavy columns led by the Louisiatsa Zouaves to break our center , we awaited his approach within sure range , and opened a terrific fire upon him . The head of the VICINITY OF THE HORNETS NEST . " ( FROM RECENT PHOTOORAPHS . ) The stump in the field on the right is said to maric the spot where General Aihert Sidney Johnston was killed . The point of woods heyond the field is supposed to he the place which the confederates called the " Hornets ' Nest . " The " peach orchard " was a little to the left of the field in the middle ground , aud hehind the house which is across the road from the field in which General Johnston was killed. - EOIToR. near General il/cA rthur 's headquarters .

This second success of the last two engagements terminated a conflict of ten and a half hours ' duration , from 6 o'clock a. m. to * : 30 o'clock p. m. and probably saved our army , transports and all , from capture . Strange , however , at the very moment of the flight of the enemy , the right of our line gave way , and immediately after , notwithstanding the indignant and heroic resistance of Colonel Veatcb , the left , comprising the Fourteenth Illinois and Twenty-fifth Indiana was irresistibly swept back by the tide of fugitive soldiers and trains seeking vain security at the Landing . Left unsupported and alone , the Twentieth and Seventeenth Illinois , together with other portions of my division not borne back by the retreating multitude , retired in good order under the immediate command of colonel Marsh and Lieutenant-Colonel Wood , and re-formed under my direction , the right restingneartheformer line , and the left at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comprising portions of regiments , brigades , and divisions , was soon formed on this nucleus by the efforts of General Sherman , myself and other officers . Here , in the eighth position occupied by my division during the day , we re'sted in line of battle upon ourarms , uncovered and exposed to a drenching rain during the night . " This last position would locate MeClernand , excepting his First Brigade , perhaps three hundred yards south of , and obliquely with reference to the right-hand road leading from the Landing , facing a little to the west . His First Brigade is traced to within half a mile of the river , where it was rallied by its commander " in front of the camp-ground of the Fourteenth Iowa , " on the road to the Landing . It did not join the division again until after the battle , but acted in connection with my troops . Colonel Veatch , who was on McClernand 's left with the Fourteenth Illinois and Twenty-fifth Indiana in the seventh position , fell back in rear of the reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he belonged . The space along the road in rear of McClemand was filled in with various fragments which constituted Sherman 's command , including at last Buckland 's two regiments . General Sherman describes Colonel Sweeny as being with him . No doubt some of Sweeny 's men also were there . It was the camp-ground of his brigade - the camp of his own regiment , the Fifty-second Illinois , being immediately on the road . Two of his regiments were captured with Prentiss , and the remainder had been driven back from W. H. L. Wallace 's right and virtually broken ip . One of his regiments , the Fiftieth Illinois , was sent in the morning to support Colonel Stuart on the extreme left , and shared the fate of the sufferers in that quarter . The space along the road between Sherman and Huribut was occupied by the remnant of Colonel Tuttle 's brigade and a portion of McClernand 's First Brigade which united itself to Tuttle . It was Tuttle 's camp-ground . Two of his regiments had been captured with Prentiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 8o. and Forty-third Illinois it is inferred that those two regiments did not move from their position on the River road in the last falling back . But that , if certain , is not important . They were at any rate substantially on the general line above indicated . The same , in a careless reading , might be presumed of the Forty-sixth Illinois , which was immediately on the left of the Forty-third . The report of that regiment says : " The regiments both on my right and left fell back , but my line did not waver under the fire of the enemy . " But it evidently fell back at last , for the report continues : " After breakfast on Monday morning , still retaining my position on the right of Colonel Marsh 's brigade , I moved with him until I reached and went beyond the ground of our last engagenient of Sunday , where our pickets were driven in , " etc . It remains now to determine the question of the extreme right of the general line . General Sherman says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , that Birge 's Sharpshooters were immediately on his right and constituted the extreme right of the line . The official report of that regiment shows that during the afternoon it occupied a " 5osition near Colonel McArthur 's headquarters " in an oten field . Its camp was in its rear along the opposite or east side of the River road . This would fix General Sherman 's right at the cross-roads near McArthur 's headquarters . It is more than a mile from the Snake Creek bridge . Other evidence confirms these positions . The official reports of Lew . Wallace 's division show that he marched along the River road from the bridge , and formed in line of battle , facing Tillman 's Creek in front of the camp of Birge 's Sharpshooters and the Eighty-first Ohio , the right of the division being in front of the latter , and the left in front of the fQrmer ; and that it came in actual contact with the " Sharpshooters , " who occupied their camp that night and received the new-comers with cheers . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book entitled " From Fort Henry to Corinth , " page 163 . He was present and commanded the right regiment of Lew . Wallace 's division on that occasion . The position thus assigned to Wallace must have taken his left well up to the cross-road at McArthur 's headquarters , and covered the entire field toward the north ; for the distance from the cross-road to the right of the camp of the Eighty-first Ohio was only half a mile . It is particularly to be observed that in no report , either from Sherman 's division or from Lew . Wallace 's , is there any mention of actual contact or of any definite proximity of these two divisions on the evening of the sixth , or earlier than ten o'clock on the morning of the // seventh . The inference is , that at the time of Wallace 's arrival and subsequently , no part of Sherman 's division was on the River road , or anywhere along the heights of Tiliman 's Creek north of McArthur 's headquarters . General Sherman , in his report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landing shortly after dark , and formed his line to my right and rear . " That relative position could only exist by assuming that Sherman 's command was on the road leading to the landing east of McArthur 's headquarters , and nearly at right angles with Wallace ,  --  a supposition which is strengthened by the condition indicated in Sherman 's revised map , that Birge 's Sharpshooters were on his right - not entirely in his front , as they would have been if his front had been on the River road . It is also sustained by General Buckland 's statement in the " Journal of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee " for i88i , p. 82 : " About dark , " he says , " General Wallace 's division commenced arriving , and formed to the right of my brigade . " Buckland states in his report and in the " Journal " that he lay " on the road . " If he had been on the River road , XVallace would have come in contact with him , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front - not in rear or on his right . Buckland seems to know nothing about Birge 's Sharpshooters . The probable explanation is that when he came along the road from the bridge they were on the west side of the road , in the field near McArthur'sheadquarters . After Lew.Wallace arrived and formed in front of them , they probably re*red to their camp on the east side of the road . The explanation of Buckland 's position is that , after the retreat across Tillman 's Creek from the west side , he found himself , as he says , near Snake Creek . bridge " late in the afternoon , after the repulse of the right of the line , " entirely apart from the rest of the army , and that to reestablish his connection with it he started on the road to the Landing , where one of his regiments actually went and remained over night ; and that he came upon the outer flank of the new line where General Sherman soon after found him , east of McArthur 's headquarters , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between Birge 's Sharpshooters and the rest of the line . The Confederate reports mention a considerable appearance of force in a camp opposite their extreme left in the afternoon , evidently referring to McArthur 's camp . The student of the reports will not be misled by this appearance . It was caused by the force that clustered with Sherman on McClernand 's right near McArthur 's headquarters ; by the Ninth Illinois , Eighty-first Ohio , and Birge 's Sharpshooters , all belonging to McArthur 's brigade ; and by the movement of Buckland 's regiments from the bridge as already explained . The Sharpshooters and the Eightyfirst Ohio had been posted at the bridge , and returned to their camps probably at the time of the retreat from the west side of Tillman 's Creek . The Ninth Illinois had during the morning been engaged on the extreme left under its brigade commander . It had lost two hundred and fifty men out of five hundred and fifty , and was ordered to its camp " to replenish cartridge-boxes , clean guns , and be ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered " to support the right wing of General Sherman 's division , " as the report expresses it , and in the subsequent engagements retired to within half a mile of the Landing . Birge 's Sharpshooters retained their position at or in front of their camp . The movements of the Eighty-first Ohio are not very clearly defined , but in the advance next morning , it is found on McClernand 's left . The " ten or twelve guns " mentioned by General Sherman in his map-pr&amp;sentation speech as being near a ravine on his left , Sunday afternoon , were Taylor 's battery , as it was called , though commanded by Captain Barrett , and Bouton 's battery . The former had retired for ammunition from McClernand 's camp , probably to near McArthur 's headquarters , but afterwards evidently went near the river , where it received " one lieutenant and twenty-fourmen with three horses " from Fitch 's battery . Bouton 's battery was taken into action in the field in front of McClernand 's right about four o'clock , and was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both the battery and the support went back toward the river , for in the advance next morning the support is found on McClernand 's left , and the battery was brought into service with McCook in the afternoon . Sherman had no artillery with him on Monday until about ten o'clock . Major Taylor then brought up three pieces of an Illinois battery under Lieutenant Wood , not belonging to Sherman 's command . The final retreat from McClernand 's seventh position , Sunday evening , undoubtedly carried with it all of the fragments connected with Sherman near McArthur 's headquarters , along the road toward . the river , where I found him about dark , excepting Birge 's Sharpshooters , the Thirteenth Missouri , and the Forty-third Illinois . The latterbelonged to McClernand 's Third Brigade , but remained with the Thirteenth Missouri Sunday night . After crossing Tillman 's Creek next morning , both were brought into line on McClernand 's left , and // did not form with Sherman , though the Thirteenth Missouri subsequently joined him . My own observation as to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence of the reports . In the dusk of the evening after the close of the engagement on Sunday , I walked out with my chief-of-staff ; following the road and the line of the troops . My object was to gain information by which to determine the forn*ation of my divisions , and I not only observed all that I could see at such an hour , but I made inquiry as I passed along . I came to Huribut 's left five hundred yards from the river ; I passed to the front and came to troops that answered as McClernand 's , and which I supposed at the time to constitute his division , but which were probably his First Brigade only ; I passed to the front of these troops , and when I turned in toward the road again , I came upon Sherman 's line , as it happened , not far from where he was , and I was conducted to him . It was then growing dark . I judge the distance to have been about threequarters of a mile from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , and I think now that it was near the camp of Colonel Sweeny 's regiment , the Fifty-second Illinois , that I found General Sherman . The impression made upon my mind by that interview has remained as vivid as the circumstances were peculiar . I had no thought of seeing General Sherman when I set out , but on every score I was glad to meet him , and I was there to gain information . By what precise words I sought and he gave it , I would not pretend at this day to repeat . It is sufficient for the present to say that I learned the nature of the ground in front ; that his right flank was some three hundred yards from us and that the bridge by which Lew . Wallace was to cross Snake Creek was to his right and rear at an angle , as he pointed , of about forty degrees . I do not know whether I asked the question , but I know now that it was a mile and a quarter from his flank , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in advancing Wallace would approach by his right and rear . I also see now that I was mistaken in supposing that these sever*d commands retained a regular organization and had distinct limits ; whereas they were in fact much intermixed . Of course we talked of other incidental matters . In all his career he has , I venture to say , never appeared to better advantage . There was the frank , brave soldier , rather subdued , realizing the critical situation in which causes of some sort , perchance his own fault chiefly , had placed him , but ready , without affectation or bravado , to do anything that duty required of him . He asked me what the phins were for the morrow . I answered that I was going to attack the enemy at daylight , and he expressed gratification at my reply , though apparently not because of any unmixed confidence in the result . I had had no consultation with General Grant , and knew nothing of his purpose . I presumed that we would be in accord , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , and I did not look upon him as my commander , though I would zealously have obeyed his orders . General Sherman allowed me to take with me the map of which a fac-simile accompanies this article . I never imagined that in the future it would have the interest which now attaches to it , and after the battle it was laid aside and forgotten . Within two years after that meeting , quite contrary opinions developed themselves between General Sherman and myself concerning the battle of Shiloh , and his Memoirs give a different account of the interview above described . He says that he handed the map to my engineer-officer , Captain Michler , who , in fact , was not present , and complains that it was never returned to him . He says that I grumbled about the stragglers , and that he feared I would not bring my army across the river . One would suppose that his fears would have been allayed by the fact that at that very moment my troops were arriving and covering his front as fast as legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retreat described in the reports of McClernand and Sherman , from the west to the east side of Tillman 's Creek , there was a quite thorough disintegration of divisions and brigades , lacking nothing b*it the pressure of a vigorous pursuit to convert it into a complete rout . In its seventh position , McClernand 's division recovered some force , and preserved a recognized organization ; but not so with Sherman 's . Indeed , in that division the disorganization occurred , as has already been stated , at an earlier period . In Hildebrand 's brigade it was almost coincident with the enemy 's first assault . With McDowell 's it commenced with the unsuccessful attempt to form line of battle along the Purdy road , and was complete very soon after one o'clock ; and these two brigades never recovered their aggregation again until after the battle . With Buckland 's brigade also it occurred at the miscarriage at the Purdy road about ten o'clock , but it was not so thorough as in the other brigades-at least it was afterwards partially repaired during th' first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the retreat from his camp about ten o'clock , " We formed line on // the Purdy road , but the fleeing mass from the left broke through our lines , and many of our men caught the infection and fled with the crowd . Colonel Cockerill became separated from Colonel Sullivan and myself , and was afterward engaged with part of his command at McClernand 's camp . Colonel Sullivan and myself kept together , and made every effort to rally our men , but with very poor success . They had become scattered in alt directions . We were borne considerably to the left , but finally succeeded in forming a line , and had a short engagement with the enemy , who made his appearance soon after our line was formed . The enemy fell back , and we proceeded to the road where you ( General Sherman ) found us . At this point I was joined by Colonel Cockerill , and we there formed line of battle and slept on our arms Sunday night . Colonel Sullivan being out of ammunition , marched to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support a battery at that point . " It is only after a close examination of the records that we can understand the full significance of the following passage in General Sherman 's report : " In this position we rested for the night . My command had become decidedly of a mixed character . Buckland 's brigade was the only one with me that retained its organization . Colonel Hildebrand was personally there , but his brigade was not . Colonel McDowell had been severely injured by a fall from his horse , and had gone to the river , and the three regiments of his brigade were not in line . The Thirteenth Missouri , Colonel Crafts J. Wright , had reported to me on the field , and fought well , ret%ining its regimental organization , and it formed part of my line during Sunday night and all of Monday ; other fragments of regiments and companies had also fallen into my division , and acted with it during the remainder of the battle . " It thus appears that from about one o'clock until the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road from the bridge to the Landing , not a single regiment of his division excepting Cockerill 's , and not one prominent individual representative of it excepting that officer and Colonel Hildebrand , was present with him . The only body of troops besides Cockerill 's regiment having any recognized organization was the Thirteenth Missouri , which belonged to another division . All the rest were squads or individual stragglers . In all the official reports , not a regiment or part of a regiment is described as being with him at this juncture or for several hours before . Of the nine regiments that composed the three brigades under his immediate command at the church , only five rendered reports , and three of these were from Buckland 's brigade . The division did not exist except in the person of its com mander . Such is the story of the official reports . The number of men present could not have been large . Less than one thousand , including Buckland 's two regiments after they were found , would have told the number that lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This explains the close relation of McClernand and Sherman during the last five hours of Sunday , and the identity of their experiences . General Sherman has nothing to report of his own command distinctively . Everything is conjunctive and general as between McClernand and himself . " We held this position , General McClernand and myself acting in perfect concert . " " General McClernand and I , on consultation , selected a new line . " " We fell back as well as we could . " " The enemy 's cavalry charged us , and was handsomely repulsed . " General McClernand 's account of this incident has been quoted on a preceding page . When Colonel Hildebrand lost his brigade , it is not with General Sherman that he is identified , but with McClernand , on whose staff he served part of the day . Hildebrand seems to have been active , but not under the direction of his division commander . " About three o'clock , " he says , " I assumed command of a regiment already formed of fragmentary regiments . I marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sharpshooters in defeating the enemy in an attempt to flank our rear . " This movement was evidently made from McClernand 's and Sherman 's seventh position , and the troops assisted were Birge 's Sharpshooters . General Sherman makes no mention of this significant if not important occurrence . His right flank was threatened , and the regiment of Sharpshooters posted in the field near McArthur 's headquarters met and , in conjunction with Hildebrand 's temporary regiment , repelled the danger . We have in the official reports a good clue to the condition of McClernand 's division also . It was in a far better state . It was shattered and worn , but it was represented by at least some recognized following of regiments and brigades . One of the brigades had five hundred men , and another , the commander reports , was " merely nominal , " not long before McClernand took up his seventh position . In the last collision , one of the brigades became entirely separated from the division , and did not return to it until after the battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of men that rested that night under McClernand 's colors . Hurlbut 's division was in a somewhat better condition than either of the others . Its loss in killed and wounded was greater than // McClernand 's , but it had not like the latter been affected in its organization by oft repeated shocks sustained in a cramped and embarrassing position , and his command had received some accessions from the driftings of other divisions . The estimate which he makes of his force is wholly fallacious . It could not have stood on the space which he occupied . There may have been two thousand men in his line on the night of the 6th . These three divisions , if they may be so called , and Tuttle 's command , with Birge 's Sharpshooters on the extreme right , and the reserve artillery on the left , which , according to General Grant 's report , consisted of " four twenty-pounder Parrott guns and a battery of rifled guns , " constituted the line of battle , which extended a mile from the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crowded together about the river and the camps on the plateau , and with proper effort could have been fitted for good service ; but no steps to that end were taken . The defect in the command that opened the way for the disaster , facilitated its progress at every stepthe want of a strong executive hand guided by a clear organizing head . Some of these fragmentary commands sought places for themselves in the advance next day . The remnant of the Second Division under Colonel Tuttle was one of these . Indeed it deserves a higher name . It presented itself to me on the field without orders , and rendered efficient service with my divisions . There may have been fifteen hundred or two thousand men of these unrecognized commands that went to the front n Monday without instructions . Seven thousand men at the utmost besides Lew . Wallace 's five thousand , were ready Sunday night to take part in the struggle which was to be renewed in the morning . Of the original force seven thousand were killed or wounded , three thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks and hopelessly disorganized , and about thirty pieces of artillery were in the hands of the enemy . The physical condition of the army was an exact type of its moral condition . The ties of discipline , not yet of long enough duration or rigidly enough enforced to be very strong , were in much the largest part of the army thoroughly severed . An unbrol*en tide of disaster had obliterated the distance between grades , and brought all men to the standard of personal qualities . The feeble groups that still clung together , were held by fQrce of individual character more than by discipline , and a disbelief in the ability of the army unaided to extricate itself from the peril that environed it , was , I do not hesitate to affirm , universal . In my opinion that feeling was 773 shared by the commander himself . A week after the battle the army had not recovered from its shattered and prostrated condition . On the 14th , th*ree days after Halleck 's arrival , he instructed Grant : " Divisions and brigades should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all stragglers returned to their companies and regiments . Your army is not now in condition to resist an attack . " We are told that the enemy had stragglers too . Yes , every cause which demands effort and sacrifice will have them ; but there is , a difference between the straggling which is not restrained by the smile of fortune , and that which tries to elude the pursuit of fate - it is the difference between victory and defeat . The Confederates in their official reports make no concealment of their skeletons , but when the time for action arrived they were vital bodies , and , on Sunday , always in sufficient force to do the work at last . General McClernand , it will have been observed , ascribes the breaking up of his seventh position to a panic among the troops , but the other reports show a different reason . Colonel Veatch on McClernand 's left says : " Our men were much encouraged by the strength of our position , and our fire was telling with terrible effect . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy ) , when we were surprised by his driving back the whole left wing of our army , and advancing close to our rear near General Hurlbut 's headquarters . A dense mass of baggage wagons and artillery crowded upon our ranks , while we were exposed to aheavy fire ofthe enemy bothin front andrear . " General Hurlbut thus describes the crisis at that stage of the battle : " I had hoped to make a stand on the line of my camp , but masses of the enemy were pressing rapidly on each flank , while their light artillery was closing rapidly in the rear . On reaching the 24-pounder siegeguns in battery near the river , I again succeeded in forming line of battle in rear of the guns . " We see here that there was a stern cause for the falling back . It was the tide of defeat and pursuit from the left wing of the army , and was compulsory in the strictest sense . How fortunate that it did not set in an hour earlier , and strike in flank the disorganized material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tillman 's Creek ! How more than fortunate that the onward current of the victor was obstructed still an hour longer by the unyielding tenacity of the remaining regiments of W. H. L. Wallace and Prentiss ! From the self-assuring interview in which , according to one of General Sherman* s reminiscences , it was " agreed that the enemy had expended the furor of his attack " at four o'clock , and General Grant told the " anecdote of his Donelson battle , " that officer was aroused by the renewal of the din of the strife , and made his way to the river through // the disorganized throng of his retreating army . While those mutual felicitations were in progress , the enemy , a mile to the left , was disarming and marching six captured regiments to the rear . Thus disembarrassed , his furor revived , and manifested itself at last at the very Landing . What worse state of affairs than this could have existed when at noon General Grant wrote : " If you will get upon the field , leaving all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a move to our advarhtage , and possibly save the day to us . " Under the circumstances here described , General Grant and General Sherman have said that reinforcements other than Lew . Wallace 's division were in no wise necessary at the close of the first day , and that , without reference to them , General Grant would have assumed the offensive and defeated the Confederate army next morning . Those who study the subject attentively will find no ground to accept that declaration as regards either the purpose or the result . The former indeed presents an intangible question which it would seem to be useless to discuss . At the time it is alleged to have been entertained , the reinforcements were actually at hand , and their presence gives to the announcement the semblance of a vain bctast , which could never have been put to the test of reality . That with the reinforcements from my army , General Grant confidently expected that the enemy would be defeated the following day , it is impossible to doubt ; but it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate front , and the evidence establishes that General Grant had not determined upon or had not promulgated a plan of action in the morning . Not an order was given or a note of preparation sounded for the struggle which , with or without his assistance , was to begin at daybreak . To my certain knowledge , if words and actions were not wholly misleading , General Sherman when I saw him on the night of the 6th , did not consider that any instructions had been given for battle , and if he had such instructions he did not obey them . His report sustains the impression which I derived from our interview . " At daylight on Monday , " he says , " I received General Grant 's orders to advance and . recapture our original camps . " Then only it was that he dispatched several members of his staff to bring up all the men they could find . Is that the way in which General Sherman would have acquitted himself of the obligation of orders received the day before to engage in battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other division commanders are to the same effect . General McClernand says : " Your ( General Grant 's ) order of the morning of the 7th for a forward movement , " etc . The hour of the delivery of this order is indicated approximately by the following passage in the report of Colonel Marsh : " At daylight on Monday morning the men in line were supplied with some provisions . While this was being done firing opened on our right , afterwards ascertained to come from a portion of General Lew Wallace 's command . Directly afterwards , firing commenced to our left and front , both artillery and musketry , supposed by me to be a portion of General Buell 's command , who , I had been informed during the night , had taken position on our left and considerably in advance . I now received orders from General McClernand to throw out skirmishers and follow with my whole command . " We must presume that General McClernand proceeded to the execution of General Grant 's order as soon as it was received , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Nelson . General Hurlbut says : " On Monday , about eight a. in. , my division was formed in line close to the river bank , and I obtained a few crackers for my men . About nine a. in. , I was ordered by General Grant to move up to the support of General M cClernand . " Colonel Tuttle , commanding the Second Division , acted without any orders . He says : " On Monday morning I collected all of the division that could be found , and such other detached reginXents as volunteered to join me , and formed them in column by battalion closed in mass as a reserve for General Buell . " The action of General Lew . Wallace was not the result of orders , but proceeded from his own motion on discovering the enemy in his front at daylight across Tillman 's Hollow . While that action was in progress , General Grant came up and gave Wallace " the direction of his attack . " Nelson had been in motion an hour , and was sharply engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's official reports of the battle are in accord with the subordinate reports upon this question . In his first telegraphic announcement of the battle to General Halleck , he says : " Yesterday the rebels attacked us here with an overwhelming force , driving our troops in from their advanced position to near the Landing . General XVallace was immediately ordered up from Crump 's Landing , and in the evening , one division of General Buell 's army and General Buell in person arrived . During the night one other division arrived , and still another to-day . This morning , at the break of day , I ordered an attack , which resulted in a fight , which continued until late this afternoon , with severe loss on both sides , but a complete repulse of the enemy . I shall follow to-morrow far enough to see that no immediate renewal of an attack is contemplated . " In his more detailed report of April 9th he says : " During the night ( Sunday ) all was quiet , andfeeling that a great moral advantage would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered // as soon as day dawned . The result was a gradual repulse of the enemy at all parts of the line from morning until probably five o'clock in the afternoon , when it became evident that the enemy was retreating . Before the close of the action the advance of General T. J. Wood 's division arrived in time to take part in the action . My force was too much fatigued from two days ' hard fighting and exposure in the open air to a drenching rain during the intervening night , to pursue immediately . Night closed in cloudy and with heavy rain , making the roads impracticable for artillery by the next morning . General Sherman , however , followed the enemy , finding that the main part of the army had retreated in good order . " Several points worthy of note present themselves in these dispatches of General Grant . There is still , at the close of the second day , the impression of the enemy 's overwhelming force , which the day before he " estimated at over one hundred thousand men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reinforcements to the number of twenty-five thousand fresh troops , that " a great moral advantage would be gained by becoming the attacking party . " There was , then , a question in.his mind , namely , to attack , or to await attack ; it was necessary to consider all the advantages , moral and * ) hysical ; he concluded to secure the former at least , and accordingly gave the order , not on Sunday but on Monday at break of day , ** to attack . The severity of the contest on Monday is affirmed in both dispatches ; it was of such a nature as to prevent an immediat* pursuit , which at any rate he would only make the next morning after the battle , far enough to see that no immediate renewal of the attack was contemplated . The pursuit was made on that plan , and found " that th' main part of the army had retreated in good order . " If the fact were not duly authenticated , one would wonder whether these dispatches were actually written by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance overhis own signature , " Victory was assured when Wallace arrived with his division of five thousand effective veterans , even if there had been no other support ! " With this tedious but necessary review of the results of the first day , I take up the story of the second . THE engagement was brought on , Monday morning , not by General Grant 's orcter , but by the advance of Nelson 's division along the River road in line of battle , at the first dawn of clay , followed by Crittenden 's division in column . The enemy was encountered at * : *o o'clock , and a little in advance of Hurlbut 's camp Nelson was halted while Crittenden came into line on his right . By this time the head of McCook 's division came up and was formed on the right of Crittenden . Before McCook 's rear brigade was up the line moved forward , pushing back the enemy 's light troops , until Nelson and Crittenden reached the very position occupied by Hurlbut , Prentiss , and W. H. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy was found in force . McCook was on the north side of the western Corinth road , and eventually swept across half of McClernand 's camp and released his headquarters . " The Hornets ' Nest " was in front of Crittenden 's left brigade ; and " the peach orchard " and the ground where Albert Sidney Johnston fell were in front of Nelson . Without following the vicissitudes of the struggle in this part of the field , I enter with a little more detail , but still cursorily , upon the operations of Grant 's troops , which have not been connectedly explained in any official report . The action here was commenced by Lew . Wallace , one of whose batteries at halfpast five o'clock opened fire on the enemy , who was discovered on the high ground across Tillman 's Hollow . There is some diversity of statement among the official reports as to the priority of artillery firing in front of Nelson and Wallace . Colonel Hovey , who was in immediate support of Wallace 's battery , gives the priority to Nelson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left , gives it to Wallace . But this is unimportant . Nelson was in motion three-quarters of an hour before that time , and had been engaged with the enemy 's light troops . The first artillery fire was from the enemy , Nelson his advance ; but while the firing was in progress General Grant came up , and gave him his " direction of attack , which was formed at a right angle with the river , with which at the time his line ran almost parallel . " The enemy 's battery and its supports having been driven from the opposite height by the artillery of Wallace , the latter moved his line forward about seven o'clock , crossed the hollow , and gained the crest of the hill almost without opposition . " Here , " he says , " as General Sherman 's division , next on my left , had not made its appearance to support my advance , a halt was ordered for it to come up . " Wallace was now on the edge of the large oblong field which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigade . The next of Grant 's commands to advance was McClernand 's . The orders to that effect have already been cited , and their execution is explained by Colonel Marsh , into whose brigade what was present of McClernand 's division seems to have merged . He says : " Moving steadily forward for half a mile , I discovered a movement of troops on the hill nearly a quarter of a mile in front . Dispatching scouts to ascertain who they were , they were met by a message from Colonel // Smith , commanding the left brigade of the Third Division ( Wallace 's ) , informing me that he would take position on the right and wait my coming up . " Sherman , it thus appears , was not yet in motion . Huribut moved out about nine o'clock , and formed one brigade on McClernand 's left . When Lew . Wallace advanced across Tillman 's Hollow , followed next on the left by McClernand , the force opposed to him fell gradually back upon re*nforcement* beyond the field on the edge of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's left then clinging a little to the bluffs of Owl Creek in that quarter , but yielding without a very stubborn resistance , chiefly because of McCook 's vigorous pressure along the western Corinth road , until it fell into a general line running through the center of McClernand 's camp , and nearly parallel with the Hamburg and Purdy road . This swinging back of the enemy 's left , and the direction of the Owl Creek bluffs , naturally caused a change in the direction of Wallace 's front , until about ten o'clock it faced south at right angles to its direction in the beginning . A sharp artillery contest and some infantry fighting had been going on all the time . It was at ten o'clock , according to Sherman 's report , that McClernand formed line obliquely in rear of the camp of his First Brigade , to advance against the enemy 's position . Here for the first time Sherman 's division appears in the movement , from which its absence at an earlier period is mentioned by both McClernand and Wallace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its movements , is as follows : " *t daylight I received General Grant 's orders to advance and recapture our original camps . I dispatched several members of my staff to bring up all the men they could find , and especially the brigade of Colonel Stuart , which had been separated from the division all the day before ; and at the appointed time the division , or , rather , what remained of it , with the Thirteenth Missouri and other fragments , marched forward and reoccupied the ground on the extreme right of General McClernand 's camp , where we attracted the fire of a battery located near Colonel McDowell 's former headquarters . Here I remained patiently waiting for the sound of General Buell 's advance upon the main Corinth road . About ten a. m. the heavy firing in that direction and its steady approach satisfied me , and General Wallace being on our right flank with his *vell-conducted division , I led the bead of my column to General McClernand 's right , formed line of battle , facing south , with Buckland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its right in the woods , and thus advanced slowly and steadily under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery . " The contest thus inaugurated in and around McClemand 's camp involved the whole of Grant 's available force and McCook 's division of the Army of the Ohio , and continued with great violence from ten until four o'clock . The significant facts connected with it are , the narrowness of the space covered by the interior divisions ,  --  McClernand 's , Hurlbut 's , and Sherman 's ,  --  the lapping over them by McCook , so as to form , in fact , a connection with the division of Wallace on the extreme right , and the decisive part ascribed to McCook 's division in that part of the field in the reports of McClernand , Wallace and Sherman . McClernand says : " Here one of the severest conflicts ensued that occurred during the two days . We drove the enemy back to the edge of a field . . . where reserves came to his support . Our position at this moment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunately the Louisville Legion , forming part of General Rousseau 's brigade , came up at my request and succored me . Extending and strengthening my line , this gallant body poured into the enemy 's ranks one of the most terrible fires I ever witnessed . Thus breaking his center , he fell back in disorder , and thenceforth he was beaten at all points . " General Wallace mentions particularly an important service rendered to the left of his division at a crisis in its operations , by one of McCook 's regiments . Colonel McGinnis , of the Eleventh Indiana , whose regiment was on Wallace 's extreme left , describes this incident as follows : " At 2:30 o'clock I discovered that the Federal forces on our left were falling back and the rebels advancing , and that they were nearly in rear of our left flank . I immediately notified you ( the brigade commander ) of their position , changed front with our left wing , opened our fire upon them , and sent to you for assistance . During this the most trying moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall back if it got too hot for us .... Fortunately and much to our relief , at this critical moment the Thirty-second Indiana , Colonel Willich , came up on our left , and with their assistance the advancing enemy was compelled to retire . " General Sherman says : " We advanced until we reached the point where the Corinth road crosses the line of McClernand 's camp , and here I saw for the first time the well-ordered and compact columns of General Buell 's Kentuckyforces , whose soldierly movements at once gave confidence to our newer and less-disciplined forces . Here I saw Willich 's regiment advance upon a point of water-oaks and thicket behind which , I knew the enemy was in great strength , and enter it in beautiful style . Then arose the severest musketry fire I ever heard , which lasted some twenty minutes , when this splendid regiment had to fall back . This green point of timber is about five hundred yards east of Shiloh Meeting House , and it was evident that here was to be the struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . . . . This was about two o'clock p. m . . . . Willich 's regiment had been repulsed , but a whole brigade of McCook 's division advanced beautifully , deployed , and entered this dreaded woods . . . . Rousseau 's brigade moved in splendid order steadily to the front , sweeping everything before it . " This occurred in front of Sherman , who was between McClernand and Wallace , for he says : " I ordered my Second Brigade . . . to form on its right , and my Fourth Brigade , Colonel Buckland , on its right , all to advance abreast with this Kentucky brigade . " Of the action of McCook 's division , General Sherman further says : " I concede that General McCook 's // splendid division from Kentucky drove back the enemy along the Corinth road , which was the great central line of this battle . " The conclusion to be drawn from these several reports is that at this stage of the battle McCook 's division reached across and practically connected the Army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme right of Grant 's force , and that its steady valor and effective service , not without the cooperation of McClernand 's , Huribut 's , and Sherman 's commands , decided the issue of the conflict on that portion of the field . The result , however , was not brought about without the concurrence of decisive action , at other points . While the battle was going on in McClernand 's camp , it raged with great fury from an earlier hour in front of Nelson and Crittenden on the left , and vigorously but with less destructive effects in front of Wallace on the right . As soon as the enemy 's right began to yield , the splendid batteries of Mendenhall and Terrill directed an enfilading fire upon the Confederate batteries playing fiercely upon McCook , and they were soon silenced . General Sherman ascribes that result to the action of two pieces of artillery to which he says he gave personal direction , but it is probable that he mistook the principal cause . A Confederate view of the contest in front of Nelson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose brigade at a certain stage of the battle ( about one o'clock ) was moved with Anderson 's brigade to their right , in front of Crittenden . The report describes the conflict at this poiwt as terrific , the ground being crossed and recrossed four times in the course of it . I refer to it , chiefly because in some accounts of the battle it has erroneously been identified with McCook 's front , where Trabue 's brigade was first engaged . XVithout going further into details in which the official reports abound , it may be sufficient to add briefly , that at four o'clock the flag of the Union floated again upon the line from which it had been driven the previous day , and General Grant 's troops at once resumed their camps . What more need be said ? Must I sketch the scenes with twenty thousand of the soldiers of the Army of the Ohio left out of their place in the combat , as it is described by ( ieneral Grant and his own officers ? Shall I not , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substantiate a view of the case which unbiased intelligence is forbidden to deny ? But if the Army of the Ohio had not arrived , and General Grant had remained on the defensive , what then ? Some of those who frankly acknowledge the reality of their discomfiture on Sunday , like now to believe with natural pride and the difficulties that beset them then far in the past , that they would have been more successful the second day ; and it has been argued that the withdrawal of the Confederates from their advanced positions on the night of the 6th threw doubt upon the final result . A newspaper interviewer has even said for General Grant that they were then preparing to retreat . The inconsistency of that observation is evident . A general who stops to fight a fresh army is not likely to have had it in contemplation to flee before one that he had already defeated on the same ground . The published reports show that the withdrawal on Sunday night did not proceed from any faltering of the Confederate commander . On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the fruit would certainly be gathered the following day . His confidence in that respect was shared in the fullest manner by his entire army , backed by a particularly able body of high officers . All demanded to be led against the last position : not one doubted the result . We can imagine the effort such an army would have put forth when animated by such a spirit . With the usual apologies for defeat on Monday , they rated their strength at 20,000 men , but with the fruits of victory in view , it will be safe to say they would have brought at least 25,000 into action ; and it has been claimed that 25,000 , according to the Confederate method of computation , would have been equal to about 28,000 according to the Federal method . Their relative strength would have been materially increased by the large accession of captured cannon . They had also improved their condition by exchanging their inferior arms for better captured ones . Comparatively , the enemy was in a more efficient state than before the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ooo - not more . That force could not on such ground have ventured to cover a line of more than a mile - its left at the river and its right near the ravines of Tillman 's Creek . The high ground beyond the creek would have enfiladed it , and the ravines would have afforded a lodgment and shelter for the enemy . Dill 's ravine on the left might also have proved an element of weakness , and though that flank could not be turned , the peculiar advantage of position that aided the Union troops on the left so much on Sunday would not have existed on Monday. - The field of action in front was a uniform wooded surface . Nowhere in history is the profane idea that // in a fair field fight , Providence is on the side of the strongest battalions , more uniformly sustained than in our Civil War . It presents no example of the triumph of 15,000 or even 20,000 men against 25,000 . It affords some such instances where the stronger force was surprised by rapid and unexpected movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of skill against chosen positions strengthened by the art of defense ; but nowhere else . The weaker force is uniformly defeated or compelled to retire . In this case the missiles of the assailant would have found a target in the battle-line of the defense and in the transportation and masses of stragglers crowded together about the Landing . The height of the bluff would have rendered the gun-boats powerless  --  the example of Belmont could only have been partially repeated , if at all  --  the bulk of the defeated force must have laid down its arms . There are those who have met the question with the argument that General Grant 's personal qualities were a guarantee for his triumph . That is a poor sort of logic , and there are thousands of patriotic citizens , not unfriendly to General Grant , who would draw back in alarm from the contemplation of any contingency that would have deprived the Union cause of its superior numbers at more than one period of his career . IN the usual extravagant newspaper disl ) atches from the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant and his staff which were assumed to have decided the fate of the day on Monday , or at ' least to have given a crowning touch to the victory . It would be a satire to reproduce that statement in its original form at this time . Its adoption , however , by various books and sketches , and especially the reference to such an incident by General Grant in his recent CENTURY article , makes it properly an object of inquiry . Such an act as leading a charge is a conspicuous incident rarely resorted to by the commander of an army . General Grant in some former newspaper interview is made to assume that General Sidney Johnston lost his life under such circumstances , from which he ai*ues the failing fortune of the Confederate attack on Sunday . General Johnston 's conduct in that affair is described in the Confederate reports . It was an outburst of impatient valor not caused by any crisis in the battle , though an attack at a certain point had been repulsed . He did not lose his life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were achieved at a later hour . XVe likewise naturally look in the official reports for a circumstantial account of the charge said to have been led by General Grant , for no colonel of a regiment is likely to overlook the honor of having been led in a charge by the commander of the army . In the report of Colonel Veatch of Hurlbut 's division there occurs the following passage : " Maj.-Gen . Grant now ordered me forward to charge the enemy . I formed my brigade in column of battalions , and moved forward in double-quick through our deserted camps and to the thick woods beyond our lines in pursuit of the retreating enemy , following until we were in advance of our other forces , and were ordered to fall back by General Buell . " It is proper to remark that I witnessed this movement . I was in advance on the line toward which it was made , and understand its bearing . It does not answer the description of a charge led by General Grant , since he is not said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rousseau occurs the following : " When thus repulsed , the enemy fell back and his retreat began ; soon after which I saw two regiments of government troops advancing in double-quick time across the open fields in our front , and saw that one of them was the First Ohio , which had been moved to our left to wait for ammunition . I galloped to the regiment and ordered it to halt , as I had not ordered the movement , but was informed that it was advancing by order of General Grant , whom I then saw in rear of the line with his staff . I ordered the regiment to advance with the other , which it did some two or three hundred yards farther , when it was halted , and a fire was opened upon it from one of our camps , then occupied by the enemy . The fire was instantly returned , and the enemy soon fled , after wounding eight men of the First Ohio . " There is in the official reports no other mention of such an occurrence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not satisfy the description , since it appears that General Grant was not taken into the enemy 's fire ; and there is nothing in it which fills the definition of a charge . The professional soldier at least understands that the term implies something more serious than a movement of troops upon the field of battle , even at a rapid pace , in the presence of an enemy . But putting out of the question all appropriate distinctions in the use of terms , there was nothing in the occasion or in these simple movements which promised any advantage , or entitled them to the slightest prominence . The enemy had retired from the last line , and was believed to be in retreat ; but he had withdrawn in good order , and it is known that he halted a half-mile beyond , fully prepared to repel a careless pursuit . The topographical feature of larger fields and intervening woods made the left and left-center of the battle-field more difficult for attack than the ground about McCler // nand 's camp , as was illustrated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in immediate contact , were kept at a greater distance apart , and were more screened from the observation of each other . The resistance , quelled for the moment , would be renewed unexpectedly by reinforcements or on a new line with increased vigor , and did not always allow the assailant to retain the advantage he had gained . Nelson and Crittenden were working their way step by step over this difficult ground , when the cheers of victory commenced on the right where the enemy could be better observed . It was my misfortune to know nothing about the topography in front , and when at that moment the enemy on the left was found to be yielding readily to our advance , it was my mistake to suppose that the retirement was more precipitate and disordered than proved to be the case . On that supposition Nelson was ordered rapidly to the lower ford of Lick Creek , by which I supposed a part of the enemy had advanced and would retreat , and was thus out of position for the state of the case as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made through thick woods , and his division had become a good deal scattered ; but a brigade of Wood 's division came up just then and was pushed forward on the eastern Corinth road . It soon came upon and engaged the enemy 's skirmishers , and was attracting a flank fire from a battery a considerable distance off on the right . The orderly withdrawal of the enemy was now discovered , and indicated that a ! ingle brigade unsupported would be insufficient for a pursuit . Wood 's brigade was therefore halted while its skirmishers occupied the enemy 's cavalry , and ordeis were sent to McCook and Crittenden to form on the new line . Just at that moment a feeble column was seen to the right and rear of Wood 's brigade , moving in a direction which would bring it into the flank fire of the enemy 's artillery on the right . I therefore ordered it to be halted until other dispositions were made ; but misapprehending the object of the order , or deeming perhaps that enough had been done for one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant 's troops , retired to its camp . Following the same example , and most probably with General Grant 's authority , McCook 's division had started to the river . Before these misconceptions could be corrected , and- my divisions got into position , night came on , and the time for a further forward movement passed for the day . Indeed , while my troops were being called up , I received from General Grant , who had retired to the Landing , the following letter : " HEADQUARTERS Disr . OF W. TENN. , PITTSBURG , April 7 ' 1862 . Major-General D. C. Buell , Gen. : When I left the . field this evening , my intention was to occupy the most advanced position possible for the night , with the infantry engaged through the day , and follow up our success with cavalry and fresh troops expected to arrive during my last absence on the field . The great fatigue of our men-they having been en - gaged in two days ' fight , and subject to a march yesterday and a fight to-day-would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival of the expected reenforcements . My plan , therefore , will be to feel out in the morning , with all the troops on the outer lines , until our cavalry force can be organized ( one regiment of your army will finish crossing soon ) , and a sufficient artillery and infantry support to follow them are ready for a move . Under the instructions which I have previously received , and a dispatch also of to-day from Major-General Halleck , it will not then do to advance beyond Pea Ridge , or some point which we can reach and return in a day . General Halleck will probably be here himself to-morrow . Instructions have been sent to the division commanders , not included in your command , to be ready in the morning either to find if an enemy was in front , or to advance . Very respectfully , Your obedient Servant , U. S. Grant , Major-General Commanding . " This letter implies the hypothesis expressed also in General Grant 's dispatch of the same evening to General Halleck , that the enemy might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . I make no comment on that point further than to contrast it with the later pretensions with which the battle has been reviewed by General Grant and his friends . The idea is again indicated in his orders to his division commanders on the eighth : " I have instructed Taylor 's cavalry to push out the road toward Corinth to ascertain if the enemy have re treated hould they be retreating , I want all the cavalry to follow them . " Something in the same vein , which I would by no means be understood as dwelling upon censoriously , is seen in a dispatch of the next day to Halleck " I do not " he says " like to suggest , but it appears to me that it would be demoralizing upon our troops here to be forced to retire upon the opposite bank of the river , and unsafe to remain on this many weeks without large reimforcements . " The passage is chiefly noteworthy as showing that the fault of Shiloh was not in an excess of rashness or contempt for the adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet pointed out a means of security other than in rei*nforceinents or retreat . The introduction of the evidence is not to be ascribed to any motive of disparagement . It is entirely pertinent to the subject under consideration . General Grant has recently admitted that a pursuit ought to have been made , and vaguely intimates that somebody else than himself was responsible that it was not done . The reason given in hisletter to me is , of course , insufficient . General McCook may have told him that his men were hungry and tired ; but if the order had been issued , both McCook // qwq son and Rawlins arrived and informed him of the urgency of the occasion , n&amp; just censure could be cast upon his conduct . The reports of those officers imply that he did not do so , but McPherson , who was most likely to be correct , is least positive on that point . It would probably be easy in any of the armies to point to similar examples of a lack of ardent effort which led to grave disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been attended with serious consequences if any emergency had arisen . It was a defect in the discipline which it was not possible at that time to remedy completely . MUCH harsh criticism has been passed upon General Lew . Wallace for having failed to reach the field in time to participate in the battle on Sunday . The naked fact is apt to be judged severely , and the reports made a year afterward by General Grant 's staffofficers - the report of Colonel Rawlins especially- are calculated to increase the unfavorable impression . But some qualification *f that evidence must be made , on account of the anxiety produced in the minds of those officers by their peculiar connection with the exciting circumstances of the battle . The statement of Rawlins is particularly to be received with reservation . They found Wallace on a different road from the one by which they expected him , and assumed that he was wrongfully there . Rawlins pretends to give the words of a verbal order that would have taken him to a different place . Wallace denies that version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was on the road to and not far from the i ! pper ford of Owl Creek , which would have brought him on the right flank of the *Federal line , as it was in the morning , and as he presumed it still to be . It would have been at least an honest if not a reasonable interpretation of the order that took him to a point where the responsibility and danger were liable to be greatly increased . The impression of Major Rowley , repeated more strongly by General Grant in his CENTURY article , that when found he was farther from the battle-field WHEN this article was urged upon me by the recent revival of the discussion , I was advised by friends in whose judgment I have great confidence , to write an jintersonal account of the battle . The idea was perfectly in harmony with my disposition , but a moment 's reflection showed me that it was impracticable . It would ignore the characteristics which have made the battle of Shiloh the most famous , and to both sides the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personality . The battle might be called , almost properly , a personal one . It was ushered in by faults that were personal , and the resistance that prolonged it until succor came was personal . This does not pretend to be a history of it , but only a review of some of the prominent facts which determined its character and foreshadowed its result . Even // this fragmentary treatment of the subject would be incomplete without a revision of the roll of honor . The task is not difficult , for the evidence is not meager or doubtful . It says of McClemand , that , crippled at the start by the rudeness of the unexpected attack and the wreck of the division in his front , before he had time well to establish his line , he struggled gallantly and long with varying fortune to keep back the columns of the enemy ; and though he failed in that , he was still able to present an organized nucleus which attracted the disrupted elements of other divisions : of Hurlbut , that he posted the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner at first , but with judgment to afford prompt shelter to the defeated division of Prentiss , and maintained his front with some serious reverses to his left flank , for seven hours and until his left was turned , with a greater list of mortality than any other division sustained : of W. H. L. Wallace , that , never dislodged , he sacrified his life in a heroic effort with Prentiss to maintain his front between the enemy and the Landing : of Prentiss , that with the rawest troops in the army his vigilance gave the earliest warning of the magnitude of the danger , and offered a resolute resistance to its approach ; that , though overwhelmed and broken in advance , he rallied in effective force on the line of Hurlbut and Wallace , and firmly held his ground until completely surrounded and overpowered : and of Sherman , that he too strove bravely , but from an early hour with a feeble and ineffective force , to stay the tide of disaster fo* which his shortcoming in the position of an advanced guard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement of General Halleck that he " saved the fortune of the day on the 6th . " On the contrary it shows , that of all the division com manders , not one was less entitled to that distinction . This will be a strange and may seem like a harsh utterance to many readers , but it is the verdict of the record . The similar indorsement of General Grant a year later that he held the key-point to the Landing is equally alien to the evidence , and still further without intelligent meaning . If the key-point was any other than the Landing itself , it was on the left where the attack was strongest and the resistance longest maintained . Into the list of brave men in the inferior grades - captains and even lieutenants who for the moment led the wrecks of regiments and brigades , and field-officers who represented brigades and divisions , and who poured out their lives on the field or survived its carnage - I can not here pretend to enter , though it is a most interesting chapter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ? The record is silent and tradition adverse to any marked influence that he exerted upon the fortune of the day . The contemporaneous and subsequent newspaper accounts of personal adventure are alike destitute of authenticity and dignity . If he could have done anything in the beginning , he was not on the ground in time . The determining act in the drama was completed by ten o'clock . From Sherman 's report and later reminiscences we learn that he was with that officer about that hour , and again , it would seem , at three and five o'clock , and he was with Prentiss between ten and eleven ; but he is not seen anywhere else in front . We read of some indefinite or unimportant directions given without effect to straggling bodies of troops in rear . That is all . But he was one of the many there who would have resisted while resistance could avail . That is all that can be said , but it is an honorable record . AIRDRIE , Ky. , June , 1885 . D. C.
