txt Mr. Dorman B. Eaton , of the Civil Service Commission , in response to an inquiry to-day as to the enforcement of the civil service rules by the new Administration'said : " Vacancies are being regularly filled under the rules . There is not the least sign of the examinations being arrested or of the rules being disregarded . When Congress at the session just closed made an increased appropriation for carrying on the work of the commission from July 1 , 1885 , to July 1 , 1886 , it knew the policy of the incoming President , and must have expected the work of the commission to go on . That work does go on regularly , and I feel sure that it will go on . Very many of the office seekers , who lingered here some time after the 4th of March , seem to have reached the same conclusion and have returned home . Since that date examinations have been held at Cincinnati , Nashville , Memphis , Brooklyn , New-York , and Washington . Applicants have been given notice of examinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Examinations and appointments go on as heretofore in the customs service and for clerical positions in Post Offices . Excessive numbers are applying to be examined , especially for service at Washington , under the belief that arbitrary and partisan removals are being made or are soon to be made . I have heard of no case of such removals and do not believe that any such removals will be made . There will doubtless be some removals for good cause , but not enough to give places to half of those seeking to be examined . The old-time partisan proscription is not , in my opinion , to be renewed . Our politics are now more civilized , and a Pound public opinion is more formidable . Within the last 10 days the commission has made certifications for filling 11 vacancies in the departments at Washington , which is about the usual rate , and five promotions and four permanent appointments after probation have been made from among those selections under the rules . Several of these cases were in the Treasury Department . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
