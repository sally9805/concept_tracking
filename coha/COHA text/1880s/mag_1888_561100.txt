" To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune ; but to read andwrite comes by nature . " IT seems always to have been a popular belief that acting is the one art , the one profession that requires no preliminary training , no preparatory study . The painter must be taught to draw , to understand the value of colors , must learn the laws of perspective and of optics . The musician must study harmony and thorough-bass , and by patient practice acquire technical skill . The poet must know the rules of grammar and the laws of metre ; but a man is asked to step upon the stage and be an actor from that moment , without any other preparation than a desire to be an actor . Now , however , the time seems to have come when many see the absurdity of such a view , though even yet there is a strong prejudice against anything like a systematic course of dramatic training . A young would-be actor seeking advice is sure to be told by nine persons out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can ; the stage is the best school . " In the old days of universal stock companies , in theatres where a different play was produced every week , undoubtedly it was a most excellent school . But the young actor of to-day who is ambitious to grow in his art finds it very slow work while under the necessity of traveling through the country playing one part , of twenty or thirty lines , for a whole season . Such a situation does not offer very brilliant opportunities for development of the great art of dramatic expression . And even if the conditions were the same as in the days of our fathers , why would it be such a preposterous thing to give our young actors their elementary training in schools and colleges instead of on the stage before a long-suffering and patient public ? Surely in institutions devoted to this purpose , under efficient // management , it could be accomplished more thoroughly and in much less time than through the slow aud painful experiences of unguided effort . Geuius , of course , will assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own needs better than any one else cau know them ; but even it , as a general thing , gains much by being directed in its infancy . And then most actors , like most other men and women , are not geniuses , and mere talent is not capable of reaching its highest development unaided . Those who oppose the idea of dramatic training invariably argue , with an ignorance of facts which is remarkable , that none of the great actors of the past or present ever had any . They seem to imply that these actors were born with all their technical skill of expression as well as the great motive power of their genius . Let ns see how much truth there is in this supposition . Rachel was a pupil of the Paris " Conservatoire , " and during all the period of her success she was a careful and patient student under her old master , Sanson . As soon as she began to grow careless of study the falling off in her art was marked . Garrick was an untiring worker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he continued during his whole career . Edmund Kean , as a little boy , received constant instruction and drilling from the woman who took the place of his mother . When he grew to manhood he tramped the country for miles during the day studying the parts he was to play in the evening . The case of Adelaide Neilson is a striking proof of the beneficial results of training . When she made her first important appearance in the Easteru States , artistically , she was an absolute failure , though her beauty drew large audiences . Her great but crude , uncultivated genius had not acquired through study the ability to rightly apply its power . She immediately recognized this fact and placed herself under the direction of different teachers , and ever afterwards studied her parts with some one competent to assist her . She died young , but she has left her name in the records of the stage as one of its most brilliant memories . Surely her example is worthy of consideration . Sarah Bernhardt was a pupil of the Paris " Conservatoire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are sufficient to prove that even actors of genius do not spring // straight out of the arms of nature fully equipped for their work any more than do other artists , than do scientists , diplomatists , business men . Every one has some preliminary training to go through , whatever may be his or her line of occupation , before he or she can become even a professor of it  --  the actor no less than any one else . The ground is constantly taken that an actor is but doing on the stage at night what he has been doing off it all day . He is expressing emotions he has been feeling , repeating actions he has been reiterating all his life . To be an actor he has only to do what he and every other man in the world has been doing since he was born ,  --  a perfectly easy and simple matter surely ! If so why can not every man and woman on the face of the earth be an actor ? Why are many actors so bad ? Why can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ease and naturalness with which he can do it in the parlor or in the kitchen ? Because acting is an art and not mere nature ; because a person must be taught or teach himself how to sit on a chair when he would do it to consciously produce a particular effect , and not just because he happens to feel like it . To repeat the simplest action of every-day life upon the stage , and give it the appearance of spontaneity and naturalness , requires the presence of a particular element which is absent from the same action when it is the expression of an ordinary impulse . In the one case it is done with premeditation as a detail in the working out of a fixed design ; in the other it is not anticipated or expected or simulated , and , besides , it is not watched by a thousand critics . It is just as reasonable to expect a man to be an actor without training as to expect him to read without knowing the alphabet . Everybody , but the exceptional individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can make a noise more or less musical . But the finest natural voice in the world will not give a woman the position of prima donna or a man that of first tenor if the voice is not cultivated . They must know how to modulate it , to pitch it , to sustain it , to use it . Surely if there is anything in the world one ought to know how to use without being shown how it is the voice . We talk more than we do anything else , and yet even in ordinary conversation there is not one person in a thousand , or in five thousand , who knows how to use his voice as he should . // If the actor is to trust so entirely to nature , what is the necessity of stage management ? Why can not the characters move about the stage with the unpremeditated ease of impulse with which they would move about a drawing-room ? In tragic moments of real life people express themselves forcibly and very much to the point , and will form pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , and careful study of the most minute effects when all the actors have to do is to wait for the situation and then just be themselves , and trust to luck not to walk over each other , or to die in the place where the stage manager would think the leading lady ought to faint or the agonized lover ought to kneel and call down vengeance from heaven ? Such a performance would be likely to resemble an exhibition of parlor charades , where everybody speaks at once and moves at once , and there is a great deal of animated confusion and very little meaning . The question is frequently discussed as to whether an actor should so identify himself with his part as to feel the emotions he is expressing , or should merely portray them outwardly , remaining untouched himself . In other words , whether he should feel his part or think his part . The general opinion would seem to be that the actor who feels can not think , and the actor who thinks can not feel . Is not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination of intensity of feeling and vigor of thought that makes the great actor ?  --  a combination so rarely found in any proportions approaching an even balance as to account for the rarity of genius on the stage ? The actor while on the stage is two distinct persons , acting and reacting upon each other , and the degree of harmony with which this is done marks the greatness of his talent or genius . It seems unquestionable that the more completely an actor can imbue himself with the feeling of his part , the more every fibre of his being thrills responsive to the situation he is in and to the words he speaks , the grander and truer will be his performance . But wait . The controlling element of mind must step in , or the only thing to do with such actors as are carried along on the passion of the character they are representing would be to hang them for manslaughter or shut them up in lunatic asylums . For instance , when Desdemonct is to be smothered , the mental man interposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not a // case of actual murder . Feel as agonized , as frenzied as you can , but I do n't intend to let you kill the lady who is playing Desdemona . " Throughout the whole action of a play , stage effects and smoothness of representation require that each bit of stage business shall be done in a certain specified spot . If an actor has to faint , to fall , to die , he must do it always in one particular place and nowhere else , or he would disturb the whole action of the scene . Now the two men in him , the emotional man and the mental man , are both acting separately but at the same time and in perfect unison . The emotional man trembles , turns cold , pleads , the tears start to his eyes , his voice shakes and he falls . The mental man realizes where he is , at what time he must stagger across the stage , when he must reach the place where he sinks and dies . This independent and harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asides of actors , while in the fervor of some scene , to those on the stage near them . An amusing instance of the kind is told of a lady and gentleman who thoroughly and cordially disliked each other , and yet were obliged to appear constantly together in parts requiring the assumption of the deepest mutual affection . " One night , when he was playing at love she was to rush into his arms ; being a true artist she did her work with energy , and between speeches he muttered : You need not swallow a man . ' She replied : You are too bitter a dose . ' While holding her in fond embrace , wrapped in a delicious transport , he growled in a whisper : Do n't lean so hard against a man . ' With her head in tender repose upon his breast she retorted You are paid for holding me and I intend you shall earn your salary . " ' Jules Clar6tie , the well-known writer of the French press , in an article published s*veral years ago in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling her audiences to the shuddering point by the tragic intensity of her acting , " a moment later behind the scenes will make every one laugh , even down to the firemen . " Her rehearsals of the great quarrel scene between the sisters in " Frou-Frou " were interrupted by bursts of merriment from Froit-Fron herself ; and it was while at supper on one occasion that " she arranged the death of Madame de Sartorys. " // This power to feel and yet keep the mind standing outside of the feeling is possessed by all to some extent , but should be so by the actor in a pre-eminent degree . Is not the high development of this faculty one of the most important elements of dramatic talent ? A very striking example of the separate action of the actor 's emotional and mental centres is found in the experience of Talma at his mother 's death-bed . lie was a man of deep affections and he was devotedly attached to his mother . Her loss was to him a bitter and terrible grief , and yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful sorrow of the hour , watching the life fade from her eyes , his mind involuntarily and during the very intensity of his suffering , was noting the outward signs of the passage of her soul from the body as a sludy to be used in the exercise of his art . This throws much light on the actor 's ability to feel his part intensely , to be the person he represents and at the same time to be himself to the extent of knowing what he is doing and how he is doing it  --  to feel and to know . If he only knows , he is cold , and can do nothing more , at best , than interest our intellects . If he only feels , he loses control of himself , and , consequently , loses control of his audience . lie breaks the magnetic current by which he kept his hand on their pulse and swayed them consciously at his will . In studying a character an actor must get an intellectual understanding of it and he must get the feeling of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general bearing and tendency of expression . His feeling will bring him into sympathy with it , and prompt natural and spontaneous movements , gestures , modulations of voice , the propriety of which his mind must then decide upon . But it is impossible to absolutely separate the work of the two . They unite and second and check and complete each other . It is the harmonious union of these two elements , the masculine and the feminine , that creates an artistic performance . The same thing is true in regard to all other arts . But the actor 's emotional nature can act more independently of his mentality than can that of the poet , the novelist , the painter . Their emotional realization of their subject must find expression more immediately througli the channel of the intellect , and they must use the artificial instrument of pen or brush to give it life . The actor 's // own body is his instrument and look , gesture , pose and voice are his means of expression . When an actor says " I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face , his hands , his limbs , his whole body , as a man who is uttering his own personal feeling would do . The novelist , when one of his characters has the same words to speak , does not go through a similar pantomime while writing them-if he did and any one saw him , he might reasonably be taken for a lunatic . The emotion does not manifest itself by this direct and natural means , but is more dependent on his mental action for its expression . A great advantage other artists possess over the actor is the time and opportunity they have to pass judgment upon their work , and correct it before finally giving it to the public . The actor does his work in the presence of his audience . No matter what the preliminary study of his part has been , it can only take life in the theatre , and it must stand as it then is. lie can not go back and efface errors and make improvements . Of course the more spontaneous or intuitive is the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performance , the iruer , easier and more natural will be the result . The mind of genius in any line of work , instinctively finds the best way of expressing itself . The intuitive faculty is the highest , the most precious an actor can possess , and a course of study that would in any way interfere with or check it would be far worse than none at all . But there are certain things the actor must know and may be taught without incurring this danger  --  the technicalities of his art . Unless he has a thorough knowledge of these his talent or genius must be hampered , as a musician 's would be by untrained fingers and an imperfect understanding of his instrument . Acting is an art whose successful following requires rare natural gifts , devoted love , and conscientious work . The latter element is quite as necessary as the other two . In acting , as in singing , sculpture , painting , poetry , the subtle element of the ideal is its heart and centre and life , and representations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in verse , are not photographic copies of nature as we actually see it ( though nature , of course , must be the foundation to build upon ) , but suggestions of its typical beauty , truth , strength , love ; with the deep contrast of their reverse-vice , falseness , weakness , hate . The actor who would represent the ideal , needs the training , the discipline , the // study of an artist . He must have soniething besides natural dramatic ability . In proportion as his intuition-that is his talent or genius-is developed , it will tell him what to do , but it is just as important then for him to be able to do it . He must have skill and finish of execution , as well as imagination to conceive , and soul to feel . He must have perfect knowledge of effects , perfect control of his voice and body , absolute command of himself in every situation . And this is what he can be taught . It all can be learnt and has been learnt by many on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process not be made much easier , quicker , and surer in schools , where the first and most arduous part of the work can be gotten over , and from which young actors can go out not so wholly ignorant of the elements of their art as they now are ? In such schools , if properly organized and intelligently conducted , the body can be trained to a flexibility that will always respond to the will of the actor ; he can learn to acquire the essential control of his facial muscles ; his voice can be cultivated he can be taught to sit , to stand , to walk as he must sit and stand and walk on the stage ; awkwardness of movement , faultiness of intonation and of reading can be corrected ; mannerisms can be checked . He can be taught the elements of repose . He c ' n have actual stage practice through rehearsals and public performances that should be as strict as in a professional company . By such means it is surely possible , without in any way interfering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide and direct it towards its highest expression . Must not such a course of instruction with this end in view , and not that of elocutionary declamation , be a benefit to any aspirant to histrionic fame and a boon to the audiences before whom he may appear ? It would result in raising the requirements necessary to be possessed by our actors . It would keep ignorant and energetic hope from harassing the public . It would clear the stage of the host of uneducated , inefficient persons , who have rushed to it from all sorts of motives but that of appreciation or love of the art . And the public will gladly pay for the finished and artistic performance . We now go to the theatre to see Mr. Booth as Iliamlel , not to see the play of " Hamlet ' * this is a halcyon joy none of us , in our wildest imaginings , have ever expected . Occasionally we may be surprised by a more or less possible Oyhelia , but when // have we seen the guilty queen , striving to drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revel , quivering under the heart-breaking reproaches of her murdered husband 's son ? When have we seen the partner of her crime in all the alternate bravado and fear of his hideous act ? When have we seen Horatio , Laer1e* , Rosemcrantz , Gu'ildenstern ? How can Hamlet 's thoughts , words , deeds in relation to these characters have any meaning for us unless the actors make them the real people Shakespeare meant them to be ? A well constructed play of Shakespeare is a unity . Every individual in it is connected with and dependent upon every other individual ; every situation springs from or leads up to every other situation . It is a growth . What becomes of this unity when we see a fine actor in the leading part surrounded by a " support " who so distort the characters they assume as to make it painful to watch , to hear them , or even to feel that they are there ? The star is perhaps a genius , or at any rate a man of talent , and a trained actor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managerial speculation ) . What a wide , what a mournful distance lies between his finished performance and the crude and wooden impersonations of his colleagues ! To understand , to appreciate , to enjoy a play it must be presented to us as a harmonious entity that we may judge of it as a whole . If the life is left out of every character but the leading one , if the illusion is broken every time anybody else speaks or moves , what impression of unity do we get ? And how can we hope for anything better while actors have no opportunity of obtaining an artistic training , and often no sense of its necessity ? Of course cvery one is not blessed with an equal amount of talent , but every one can cultivate whatever amount he does possess , with the result of doing much more acceptable work than hc can otherwise possibly accomplish . Many persons may have ( Iramatic ability in a marked degree , . and , simply through lack of training , never fulfill the promise it gives . The material is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . in time they often become careless or indifferent , and so long as their audiences put up with inferior work they are quite easy about letting them have it . If we can make our actors realize that more is expected of them , it will stimulate them to give more . And this must be not only artistically but morally beneficial . Their *clf-respect will be appealed to , and they will grow jealous of the // dignity of their art and of their own position as its followers . The class of persons who will then enter its ranks will be better , and they will bring into the theatre with them intelligence and refinement . Will not all this tend to remove from the actor 's calling the prejndice still existing against it in the minds of many provincial persons , to give him as an individual that place in the public regard to which , as a follower of one of the noblest arts in the world , lie is so justly entitled ? And will not this , in its turn , improve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbued with a proper pride in their art and regard for their position as its disciples , will no longer consent to lend their talents to performances that are degrading to themselves and demoralizing to their audiences . Let us train our actors-let us give them the same advantages we give to the followers of all other arts , of all other professions . Why should actors alone be expected , while still inexperienced , untaught novices , to grapple unassisted with the difficulties of their vocation ? Let us give them an opportunity to equip themselves for their work  --  to get the dramatic education which the existing system of traveling companies certainly does not furnish . Will not this also be aiding the growth of those sweet , beautiful and high qualities of heart and soul which are possessed by all whose temperament is such as to lead and fit them to become actors ? As things are the actor finds his hopes of advancement met so often by almost insurmountable obstacles that , unless he has rare talent and untiring perseverance , there is great danger of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic development arrested , or turned back to the drudgery of imitation .
