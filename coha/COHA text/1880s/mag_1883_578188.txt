TN CARLYLE 'S COUNTRY . THERE was no road in Scotland or England which I should have been so glad to have walked over as that from Edinburgh to Ecclefechan , - a distance covered many times by the feet of him whose birth and burial place I was about to visit . Carlyle as a young man had walked it with Edward Irving ( the Scotch say " travel " when they mean going afoot ) , and he had walked it alone , and as a lad with an elder boy , on his way to Edinburgh college . Lie says in his Reminiscences he nowhere else had such affectionate , sad , thoughtful , and in fact interesting and salutary journeys . " No company to you but the rustle of the grass under foot , the tinkling of the brook , or the voices of innocent , primeval things . " " I have had days as clear as Italy ( as in this Irving case ) ; days moist and dripping , overhung with the infinite of silent gray , - and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had the world and its waste imbroglios of joy and woe , of light and darkness , to yourself alone . You could strip barefoot , if it suited better ; carry shoes and socks over shoulder , hung on your stick ; clean shirt and comb were in your pocket ' ; omnia mea mecumporto . You lodged with shepherds , who had clean , solid cottages ; wholesome eggs , milk , oatmeal porridge , clean blankets to their beds , and a great deal of human sense and unadulterated natural politeness . " But how can one walk a hundred miles in cool blood without a companion , especially when the trains run every hour , and he has a surplus sovereign in his pocket ? One saves time and consults his ease by riding , but he thereby misses the real savor of the land . And the roads of this compact little kingdom are so inviting , like a hard , smooth surface covered with sand-paper ! How easy the foot puts them behind it ! And the summer weather , - what a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every breath one draws has a cool , invigorating core to it , as if there might be some unmelted , or just melted , frost not far off . But as we did not walk , there was satisfaction in knowing that the engine which took our train down from Edinburgh was named Thomas Carlyle . The cognomen looked well on the toiling , fiery-hearted , iron-browed monster . I think its original owner would have contemplated it with grim pleasure , especially since he confesses to having spent some time , once , in trying to look up a ship-master who had named his vessel for him . 1-Lere was a hero after his own sort , a leader by the divine right of the expansive power of steam . The human faculties of observation have not yet adjusted themselves to the flying train . Steam has clapped wings to our shoulders without the power to soar ; we get bird's-eye views without the bird 's eyes or the bird 's elevation , distance without breadth , detail without mass . If such speed only gave us a proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only mated to an equal leisure in the glance ! Indeed , when one thinks of it , how near railway traveling , as a means of seeing a country , comes , except in the discomforts of it , to being no traveling at all ! It is like being tied to your chair , and being jolted and shoved about at home . The landscape is turned topsy-turvy . The eye sustains unnatural relations to all but the most distant objects . We move in an arbitrary plane , and seldom is anything seen from the proper point , or with the proper sympathy of coordinate position . We shall have to wait for the air ship to give us the triumph over // 821 space in which the eye can share . Of this flight south from Edinburgh on that bright summer day , I keep only the most general impression . I recall how clean and naked the country looked , lifted up in broad hill slopes , naked of forests and trees and weedy , bushy growths , and of everything that would hide or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a universe of grass , as in the arctic regions it might be one of snow ; the mountains , pastoral solitudes ; the vales , emerald vistas . Not to be entirely cheated out of my walk , I left the train at Lockerby , a small Scotch market town , and accomplished the remainder of the journey to Ecclefechan on foot , a brief six-mile pull . It was the first day of June ; the afternoon sun was shining brightly . It was still the honeymoon of travel with me , not yet two weeks in the bonnie land ; the road was smooth and clean as the floor of a sea beach , and firmer , and my feet devoured the distance with right good will . The first red clover had just bloomed , as I probably would have found it that day had I taken a walk at home ; but , like the people I met , it had a ruddier cheek than at home . I observed it on other occasions , and later in the season , and noted that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bloom longer . All grains and grasses ripen slower there than here , the season is so much longer and cooler . The pink and ruddy tints are more common in the flowers also . The bloom of the blackberry is often of a decided pink , and certain white , umbelliferous plants , like yarrow , have now and then a rosy tinge . The little white daisy ( " gowan , " the Scotch call it ) is tipped with crimson , foretelling the scarlet poppies , with which the grain fields will by and by be splashed . Prunella ( self-heal ) , also , is of a deeper purple than with us , and a species of crane's-bill , like our wild geranium , is of a much deeper and stronger color . On the other band , their ripened fruits and foliage of autumn pale their ineffectual colors beside our own . Among the farm occupations , that which most took my eye , on this and on other occasions , was the furrowing of the land for turnips and potatoes ; it is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fields in this island look as if finished with a pencil instead of * plow , - a pencil and a ruler in this case , the lines were so straight and so uniform . I asked a farmer at work by the roadside how he managed it . " Nh , " said he , " a Scotchman 's head is level . " Both here and in England , plowing is studied like a fine art ; they have plowing matches , and offer prizes for the best furrow . In planting both potatoes and turnips the ground is treated alike , grubbed , plowed , cross-plowed , crushed , harrowed , chainharrowed , and rolled . Every sod and tuft of uprooted grass are carefully picked up by women and boys , and burnt or carted away ; leaving the surface of the ground like a clean sheet of paper , upon which the plowman is now to inscribe his perfect lines . The plow is drawn by two horses , instead of by one , as with us ; it is n long , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth each way . In opening the first furrow the plowman is guided by stakes ; having got this one perfect , it is used as the model for every subsequent one , and the land is thrown into ridges as uniform and faultless as if it had been stamped at one stroke with a die , or cast in a mould . It is so from one end of the island to the other . Four miles from Lockerby I came to Mainhill , the name of a farm where the Carlyle family lived many years , and where Carlyle first read Goethe , " in a dry ditch , " Froude says , and translated Wilhelm Meister . The land drops gently away to the south and east , opening up broad views in these directions , but it does not seem to be the bleak and // windy place Froude describes it . The crops looked good , and the fields smooth and fertile . rrhe soil is rather a stubborn clay , nearly the same as one sees everywhere . A sloping field adjoining the highway was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast ; the farmer , a courteous but serious and reserved man , was sprinkling some commercial fertilizer in the furrows from a bag slung across his shoulders , while a boy , with a horse and cart , was depositing stable manure in the same furrows , which a lassie , in clogs and short skirts , was evenly distributing with a fork . Certain work in Scotch fields always seems to be done by women and girls , - spreading manure , pulling weeds , and picking up sods , - while they take an equal hand with the men in the hay and harvest fields . The Carlyles were living on this farm while their son was teaching school at Annan , and later at Kircaldy with Irving , and they supplied him with cheese , butter , ham , oatmeal , etc. , from their scanty stores . A new farm-house has been built since then , though the old one is still standing ; doubtless the same Carlyle 's father refers to in a letter to his son , in 1817 , as being under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your mother was very anxious to have the house done before he came , or else she said she would run over the hill and hide herself . " From Mainhill the highway descends slowly to the village of Ecelefechan , the site of which is marked to the eye , a mile or more away , by the spire of the church rising up against a background of Scotch firs , which clothe a hill beyond . I soon enter the main street of the village , which in Carlyle 's youth had an open burn or creek flowing through the centre of it . This has been covered over by some enterprising citizen , and instead of a loitering little burn , crossed by numerous bridges , the eye is now greeted by a broad expanse of small cobble-stone . The cottages are for the most part very humble , and rise from the outer edges of the pavement , as if the latter had been turned up and shaped to make their walls . The church is a handsome brown stone structure , of recent date , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with the little village in its front . In the cemetery back of it , Carlyle lies buried . As I approached , a girl sat by the roadside , near the gate , combing her black locks and arranging her toilet ; waiting , as it proved , for her mother and brother , who lingered in the village . A couple of boys were cutting nettles against the hedge ; for the pigs , they said , after the sting had been taken out of them by boiling . Across the street from the cemetery the cows of the villagers were grazing . I must have thought it would be as easy to distinguish Carlyle 's grave from the rest as it was to distinguish the man while living , or his fame when dead ; for it never occurred to me to ask in what part of the inclosure it was placed . Hence , when I found myself inside the gate , which opens from the Annan road through a high stone wall , I followed the most worn path toward a new and imposing-looking monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of my fine emotion was a good deal dulled against the marble when I found it bore a strange name . I tried others , and still others , hut was disappointed . I found a long row of Carlyles , but he whom I sought was not among them . My pilgrim enthusiasm felt itself needlessly hindered and chilled . How many rebuffs could one stand ? Carlyle dead , then , was the same as Carlyle living ; sure to take you down a peg or two when you came to lay your homage at his feet . Presently I saw " Thomas Carlyle " on a big marble slab that stood in a family inclosure . But he turned out to be a nephew of the great Thomas . // However , I had struck the right pint at last ; here were the Carlyles I was looking for , within a space probably of eight by sixteen feet , surrounded by a high iron fence . The latest made grave was higher and fuller than the rest , but it had no stone or mark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , a stone or monument of some kind has been put up . A few daisies and the pretty blue-eyed speedwell were growing amid the grass upon it . The great man lies with his head toward the south or southwest , with his mother , sister , and father to the right of him , and his brother John to the left . I was glad to learn that the high iron fence was not his own suggestion . His father had put it around the family plat in his life - time . Carlyle would liked to have had it cut down about half-way . The whole look of this cemetery , except in the extraordinary size of the head-stones , was quite American , it being back of the church , and separated from it , a kind of mortuary garden , instead of surrounding it and running under it , as is the case with the older churches . I noted here , as I did elsewhere , that the custom prevails of putting the trade or occupation of the deceased upon his stone : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or farmer , eLc . A young man and his wife were working in a nursery of young trees , a few paces from the graves , and I conversed with them through a thin place in the hedge . They said they had seen Carlyle many times , and seemed to hold him in proper esteem and reverence . The young man had seen him come in summer and stand , with uncovered head , beside the graves of his father and mother . " And long and reverently did he remain there , too , " said the young gardener . I learned this was Carlyle 's invariable custom : every summer did he make a pilgrimage to this spot , and with bared head linger beside these graves . The last time he came , which was a couple of years before he died , he was so feeble that two persons sustained him while he walked into the cemetery . This observance recalls a passage from his Past and Present . Speaking of the religious custom of the Emperor of China , he says , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuality ) visit yearly the Tombs of their Fathers ; each man the Tomb of his Father and his Mother ; alone there in silence with what of worship ' or of other thought there may be , pauses solemnly each man ; the divine Skies all silent over him ; the divine Graves , and this divinest Grave , all silent under him ; the pulsings of his own soul , if he have any soul , alone audible . Truly it may be a kind of worship ! Truly , if a man . can not get some glimpse into the Eternities , looking through this portal , through what other need he try it ? " Carlyle 's reverence and affection for his kindred were among his most beautiful traits , and make up in some measure for the contempt he felt toward the rest of mankind . The family stamp was never more strongly set upon a man , and no family ever had a more original , deeply cut pattern than that of the Carlyles . Generally , in great men who emerge from obscure peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap , or is completely metamorphosed ; but Carlyle keeps all the paternal lineaments unfaded ; he is his father and his mother , touched to finer issues . That wonderful speech of his sire , which all who knew him feared , has lost nothing in the son , but is tremendously augmented , and cuts like a Damascus sword , or crushes like a sledgehammer . The strongest and finest paternal traits have survived in him . Indeed , a little congenital rill seems to have come all the way down from the old vikings . Carlyle is not merely Scotch ; he is INorselandic . There is a marked Scandinavian flavor in him ; a touch , or more than a touch , of the rude , brawling , // bullying , hard-hitting , wrestling viking times . The hammer of Thor antedates the hammer of his stone-mason sire in him . He is Scotland , past and present , moral and physical . John Knox and the Covenanters survive in him : witness his religious zeal , his depth and solemnity of conviction , his strugglings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : *behold that melancholy retrospect , that gloom , that melodious wail . And especially , as I have said , do his immediate ancestors survive in him , - his sturdy , toiling , fiery-tongued , clannish yeoman progenitors : all are summed up here ; this is the net result available for literature in the nineteenth century . Carlyle 's heart was always here in Scotland . A vague , yearning homesickness seemed ever to possess him . " The Hill I first saw the Sun rise over , " he says in Past and Present , " when the Sun and I and all things were yet in their auroral hour , who can divorce me from it ? Mystic , deep as the world 's centre , are the roots I have struck into my Native Soil ; no tree that grows is rooted so . " How that mournful retrospective glance haunts his pages ! His race , generation upon generation , had toiled and wrought here amid the lonely moors , had wrestled with poverty and privation , had wrung the earth for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , kindred with it . How strong the family ties had grown in the struggle ; how the sentiment of home was fostered ! Then they were men who lavished their heart and conscience upon their work ; they builded themselves , their days , their thoughts and sorrows , into their houses ; they leavened the soil with the sweat of their rugged brows . When his father , after a lapse of fifty years , saw Auldgarth bridge , upon which he had worked as a lad , he was deeply moved . When Carlyle in his turn saw it , and remembered his father and all he had told him , he also was deeply moved . " It was as if half a century of past time had fatefully for moments turned hack . " Whatever the Carlyles touched with their hands in honest toil became sacred to them , a page out of their own lives . A silent , inarticulate kind of religion they put into their work . All this bore fruit in their distinguished descendant . It gave him that reverted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead called to him from their graves . Nothing deepens and intensifies family traits like poverty and toil and suffering . It is the furnace heat that brings out the characters , the pressure that makes the strata perfect . One recalls Carlyle 's grandmother getting her children up late at night , his father one of them , to break their long fast with oaten cakes from the meal that had but just arrived ; making the fire from straw taken from their beds . Surely , such things reach the springs of being . It seemed eminently fit that Carlyle 's dust should rest here in his native soil , with that of his kindred , he was so thoroughly one of them , and that his place should be next his mother 's , between whom and himself there existed such strong affection . I recall a little glimpse he gives of his mother in a letter to his brother John , while the latter was studying in Germany . His mother had visited him in Edinburgh . " I had her , " he writes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ship vanished ; and she looked over the blue waters eastward with wettish eyes , and asked the dumb waves when he would be back again . ' Good mother . " To see more of Ecclefeciian and its peol ) le , and to browse more at my leisure about the country , I brought my wife and youngster down from Lockerby ; and we spent several days there , putting up at the quiet and cleanly little Bush Inn . I tramped much about the neighborhood , noting the birds , the wild flowers , the people , the farm occupations , etc. : going one afternoon to Scotsbrig , // where the Carlyles lived after they left Mainhill , and where James Carlyle *1ied ; one day to Annan , another to Repentance Hill , another over the hill toward Kirtlebridge , tasting the land , and finding it good . It is an evidence of how permanent and unchanging things are here that the house where Carlyle was horn , eighty-seven years ago , and which his father built , stands just as it did then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In going up to the little room where he first saw the light , one ascends the much-worn but original stone stairs , and treads upon the original stone floors . I suspect that even the window panes in the little window remain the same . The village is a very quiet and humble one , paved with small cobble-stone , over which one hears the clatter of the wooden clogs , the same as . in Carlyle 's early days . The pavement Comes quite up to the low , modest , stonefloored houses , and one steps from the street directly into most of them . When an Englishman or a Scotchman builds a house in the country , he turns its hack upon the hi*hway , or places it several rods distant , with sheds or stables between ; or else he surrounds it with a high , massive fence , shutting out your view entirely . In the village he crowds it to the front , continues the street pavement into his hall , if he can , allows no fence or screen between it and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and open as possible . Hence village houses and cottages are far less private and secluded than ours , and country houses far less public . The only feature of Ecciefechan , besides the church , that distinguish*s it from the humblest peasant village of an hundred years ago is the large , fine stone structure used for the public school . It confers a sort of distinction upon the place , as if it were in some way connected with the memory of its famous son . I think I was informed that he had some hand in founding it . The building in which he first attended school is a low , humble dwelling , that now stands behind the church , and forms part of the boundary between the cemetery and the Annan road . From our window I used to watch the laborers on their way to their work , the children going to school , or to the pump for water , and night and morning the women bringing in their cows from the pasture to be milked . In the long V June gloaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On two occasions , the first in a brisk rain , a bedraggled , forlorn , deeply - hooded , youngish woman , came slowly through the street , pausing here and there , and singing in wild , melancholy , and not unpleasing strains . Her voice had a strange piercing plaintiveness and wildness . Now and then a penny would drop at her feet . The pretty Edinburgh lass , her hair redder than Scotch gold , that waited upon us at the inn , went out in the rain and put a penny in her hand . After a few pennies had been collected the music would stop , and the singer disappear , - to drink up her gains , I half suspect , but do not know . I noticed that she was never treated with rudeness or disrespect . The boys would pause and regard her occasionally , but made no remark , or gesture , or grimace . One afternoon a traveling show pitched its tent in the broader part of the street , and by diligent grinding of a hand-organ summoned all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The admission was one penny , and I went in with the rest , and saw the little man , the big dog , the happy family , and the gaping , dirtyfaced , but orderly crowd of boys and girls . The Ecciefechan boys , with some of whom I tried , not very successfully , to scrape an acquaintance , I found a sober , quiet , modest set , shy of strangers , and , like all country boys , incipient naturalists . If you want to know where the bird's-nests are , ask the boys . I-fence , one Sunday afternoon , meeting a couple // of them on the Annan road , I put the inquiry . They looked rather blank and unresponsive at first ; but I made them understand I was in earnest , and wished to be shown some nests . To stimulate their ornithology I offered a penny for the first nest , twopence for the second , threepence for the third , etc. , - a reward that , as it turned out , lightened my burden of British copper considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood , and I suspect had just thea been making Sunday calls upon their feathered friends . They turned about , with a bashful smile , but without a word , and marched me a few paces along the road , when they stepped to the hedge , and showed me a hedgesparrow 's nest with young . The mother bird was near , with food in her beak . This nest is a great favorite of the cuckoo , and is the one to which Shakespeare refers : - " The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long That it had its head bit off by its young . " The bird is not a sparrow at all , but is a warbler , closely related to the nightingale . Then they conducted me along a pretty by-road , and parted away the branches , and showed me a sparrow 's nest with eggs in it . A group of wild pansies , the first I had seen , made bright the bank near it . Next , after conferring a moment soberly together , they took me to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of the bank . Then we wheeled up another road , and they disclosed the nest of the yellow yite , or yellow-hammer , a bird of the sparrow kind , also upon the ground . It seemed to have a little platform of coarse , dry stalks , like a door-stone , in front of it . In the mean time they had showed me several nests of ' the hedge-sparrow , and one of the shelfa , or chaffinch , that had been " harried , " as the boys said , or robbed . These were gratuitous and merely by the way . Then they pointed out to me the nest of a tom-tit in a disused pump that stood near the cemetery ; after which they proposed to conduct me to a chaflinch 's nest and a blackbird 's nest ; but I said I had already seen several of these and my curiosity was satisfied . Did they know any others ? Yes , several of them ; beyond the village , on the Middlebie road , they knew a wren nest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and that would he enough ; the coppers were changing pockets too fast . So through the village we went , and along the Middlebie road for nearly a mile . The boys were as grave and silent as if they were attending a funeral ; not a remark , not a smile . We walked rapidly . The afternoon was warm , for Scotland , and the tips of their ears glowed through their locks , as they wiped their brows . I began to feel as if I had had about enough walking myself . " Boys , how much farther is it ? " I said . " A wee bit farther , sir ; " and presently , by their increasing pace , I knew we were nearing it . It proved to be the nest of the willow wren , or willow warbler , an exquisite structure , with a dome or canopy above it , the cavity lined with feathers and crowded with eggs . But it did not contain eighteen . The boys said they had been told that the bird would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common wren that lays this number , even more . What struck me most was the gravity and silent earnestness of the boys . As we walked back they showed me more nests that had been harried . The elder boy 's name was Thomas . He had heard of Thomas Carlyle ; but when I asked him what he thought of him , he only looked awkwardly upon the ground . I had less trouble to get the opinion of an old road-mender whom I fell in with one day . I was walking toward Repentance Hill , when he overtook me with his " machine " ( all road vehicles in Scotland are called machines ) , and insisted upon my getting up beside him . He had a little white pony , " twenty // one years old , sir , " and a heavy , rattling two-wheeler , quite as old I should say . We discoursed about roads . Had we good roads in America ? No ? Had we no " metal " there , no stone ? Plenty of it , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned the art of road-making yet . Then he would have to come " out " and show us ; indeed , he had been seriously thinking about it ; he had an uncle in America , but had lost all track of him . He had seen Carlyle many a time , " but the people here took no interest in that man , " he said ; " he never done nothing for this place . " Referring to Carlyle 's ancestors , he said , " The Carls were what we Scotch call bullies , - a set of bullies , sir . If you crossed their path , they would murder you ; " and then came out some highlycolored tradition of the " Ecclefechaa dog fight , " which Carlyle refers to in his Reminiscences . On this occasion , the old road - mender said , the " Carls " had clubbed together , and bullied and murdered half the people of the place ! " No , sir , we take no interest in that man here , " and he gave the pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he himself took a friendly interest in the school - girls whom we overtook along the road , and kept picking them up till the cart was full , and giving the " lasLies " a lift on their way home . Beyond Annan bridge we parted company , and a short walk brought me to Repentance Hill , a grassy eminence that commands a wide prospect toward the Solway . The tower which stands on the top is one of those interesting relics of which this land is full , and all memory and tradition of the use and occasion of which are lost . It is a rude stone structure , about thirty feet square and forty high , pierced by a single door , with the word " Repentance " cut in Old English letters in the lintel over it . The walls are loop-holed hero and there , for musketry or archery . An old disused graveyard surrounds it , and the walls of a little chapel stand in the rear of it . The conies have their holes under it ; some lord , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it ; and Time 's initials are scrawled on every stone . A piece of mortar probably three or four hundred years old , that had fallen from its place , I picked up , and found nearly as hard as the stone , and quite as gray and lichen-covered . Returning , I stood some time on Annan bridge , looking over the parapet into the clear , swirling water , now and then seeing a trout leap . Whenever the pedestrian comes to one of these arched bridges , he must pause and admire , it is so unlike what he is acquainted with at home . It is a real viaduct ; it conducts not merely the traveler over , it conducts the road over as well Then an arched bridge is ideally perfect ; there is no room for criticism , not one superfluous touch or stroke ; every stone tells , and tells entirely . Of a piece of architecture , we can say this or that , but of one of these old bridges this only : it satisfies every sense of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision of mathematics . The older bridges , like this over the Annan , are slightly hipped , so that the road rises gradually from either side to the key of the arch ; this adds to their beauty , and makes them look more like things of life . The modern bridges are all level on the top , which increases their utility . Two laborers , gossiping on the bridge , said I could fish by simply going and asking leave of some functionary about the castle . Shakespeare says of the martlet , that it " Builds in the weather on the outward wall , Even in the force and road of casualty . " I noticed that a pair had built their nest on an iron bracket under the eaves of a building opposite our inn , which proved to be in the " road of casualty ; " for one day the painters began scraping the building , preparatory to giving it a new coat of paint , and the " procreant cradle " w&amp;s knocked down . The swIll- // March , lows did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again next morning before the painters were . The Scotch , by the way , make a free use of paint . They even paint their tombstones . Most of them , I observed , were brown stones painted , white . Carlyle 's father once sternly drove the painters from his door when they had been summoned by the younger members of his family to give the house a coat " o ' pent . " " Ye can jist pent the bog wi ' yer ash-baket feet for ye 11 pit nane o ' yer glaur on ma door . " But the painters have had their revenge at last , and their " glaur " now covers the old man 's tombstone . One day I visited a little overgrown cemetery about a mile below the village , toward Kirtlebridge , and saw many of the graves of the old stock of Carlyles , among them some of Carlyle 's uncles . This name occurs very often in those old cemeteries ; they were evidently a prolific and hardy race . The name Thomas is a favorite one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstones of eight Thomas Carlyles in the two graveyards . The oldest Carlyle tomb I saw was that of one John Carlyle , who died in 1692 . The inscription upon his stone is as follows : " Heir Lyes John Carlyle of Penerssaughs , who departed this life ye 17 of May 1692 , and of age 72 , and His Spouse Jannet Davidson , who departed this life Febr. ye 7 , 1708 , and of age 73 . Erected by John , his son. ** The old sexton , whom I frequently saw in the churchyard , lives in the Carlyle house . He knew the family well , and had some amusing and characteristic anecdotes to relate of Carlyle 's father , the redoubtable James , mainly iilustrative of his bluntness and plainness of speech . The sexton pointed out , with evident pride , the few noted graves the churchyard held ; that of the elder Peel being among them . He spoke of many of the oldest graves as " extinct ; " nobody owned or claimed them ; the name had disappeared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graves in these old burying places appear to become " extinct " in about two hundred years . It was very rare to find a date older than that . He said the " Carls " were a peculiar set ; there was nobody like them . You would know them , man and woman , as soon as they opened their mouths to speak ; they spoke as if against a stone wall . ( Their words hit hard . ) This is somewhat like Carlyle 's own view of his style . " My style , " he says in his note-book , when he was thirty-eight years of age , " is like no other man 's . The first sentence bewrays me . " Indeed , Carlyle 's style , which has been so criticised , was as much a part of himself , and as little an affectation , as his shock of coarse yeoman hair and bristly beard and bleared eyes were a part of himself ; he inherited them . What Tame calls his barbarisms was his strong mason sire cropping out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blood , a master builder working with might and main . No more did the former love to put a rock face upon his wall than did the latter to put the same rock face upon his sentences ; and he could do it , too , as no other writer , ancient or modern , could . I occasionally saw strangers at the station , which is a mile from the village , inquiring their way to the churchyard ; but I was told there had been a notable falling off of the pilgrims and visitors , of late . During the first few months after his burial , they nearly denuded the grave of its turf ; but after the publication of the Reminiscences , the number of silly geese that came there to crop the grass was much fewer . No real lover of Carlyle was ever disturbed by those Reminiscences ; but to the throng that run after a man because he is famous , and that chip his headstone or carry away the turf above him when he is dead , they were happily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day down to Annan . Irving 's name still exists there , but I believe all his near kindred have disappeared . Across the street from the little house where he was born , this sign may be seen : " Edward Irving , Flesher . " While in Glasgow , I visited Irving 's grave , in the crypt of the cathedral , a most dismal place , and was touched to see the bronze tablet that marked its site in the pavement bright and shining , while those about it , of Sir this or Lady that , were dull and tarnished . Did some devoted hand keep it scoured , or was the polishing done by the many feet that paused thoughtfully above this name ? Irving would long since have been forgotten by the world had it not been for his connection with Carlyle , and it was probably the lustre of the latter 's memory that I saw reflected in the metal that bore Irving 's name . The two men must have been of kindred genius in many ways , to have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold upon reality ; his written word has no projectile force . It makes a vast difference whether you burn gunpowder on a shovel or in a gun barrel . Irving may be said to have made a brilliant flash , and then to have disappeared in the smoke . Some men are like nails , easily drawn ; others are like rivets , not drawable at all . Carlyle is a rivet , well beaded in . He is not going to give way , and be forgotten soon . People who differed from him in opinion have stigmatized him as an actor , a mountebank , a rhetorician , but hc was committed to his purpose and to the part he played with the force of gravity . Behold how he toiled ! He says , " One monster there is in the world : the idle man . " He did not merely preach the gospel of work ; he was it , - an indomitable worker from first to last . How he delved ! How he searched for a sure foundation , like a master builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the rock ! Each one of his review articles cost him a month or more of serious work . Sartor Resartus cost him nine months , the French Revolution three years , Cromwell four years , Frederick thirteen years . iNo surer does the Auldgarth bridge , that his father help build , carry the traveler over the turbulent water beneath it than these books convey the reader over chasms and confusions , where before there was no way , or only an inadequate one . Carlyle never wrote a book except to clear some gulf or quagmire , to span and conquer some chaos . No architect or engineer ever had purpose more tangible and definite . To further the reader on his way , not to beguile or amuse him , was always his purpose . He had that contempt for all dallying and toying and lightness and frivolousness that hard , serious workers always have . lie was impatient of poetry and art ; they savored too much of play and levity . I-us own work was not done lightly and easily , but with labor throes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weltering flood and chaos . The spirit of struggling and wrestling which he had inherited was always uppermost . It seems as if the travail and yearning of his mother had passed upon him as a birth-mark . The universe was madly rushing about him , seeking to engulf him . Things assumed threatening and spectral shapes . There was little joy or serenity for him . Every task he proposed to himself was a struggle with chaos and darkness , real or imaginary . lie speaks of " Frederick " as a nightmare ; the " Cromwell business " as toiling amid mountains of dust . I know of no other man in literature with whom the sense of labor is so enhanced and terrible . That vast , grim , struggling , silent , inarticulate array of ancestral force that lay in him , when the burden of written speech was laid upon it , half rebelled , and would not cease to struggle and be inarticulate . There was a plethora of power : a channel , as // Antagonism. through rocks , bad to be made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book was to be written . What brings joy and buoyancy to other men , namely , a genial task , brought despair and convulsions to him . It is not the effort of composition , - he was a rapid and copious writer and speaker , - but the pressure of purpose , the friction of power and velocity , the sense of overcoming the demons and mud-gods and frozen torpidity , he so often refers to . Hence no writing extant is so little like writing , and gives so vividly the sense of something done . He may praise silence and glorify work . The unspeakable is ever present with him ; it is the core of every sentence ; the inarticulate is round about him ; a solitude like that of space encompasseth him . His books are not easy reading ; they are a kind of wrestling to most persons . Yet his style does not labor , like that of a dull and heavy man . It is like a road made of rocks : when it is good , there is nothing like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ! March , In Past and Present , Carlyle has unconsciously painted his own life and character in truer colors than has any one else : " Not a May-game is this man 's life , but a battle and a march , a warfare with principalities and powers ; no idle promenade through fragrant orange groves and green flowery spaces , waited on by the choral Muses and the rosy Hours : it is a stern pilgrimage through burning sandy solitudes , through regions of thick-ribbed ice . lie walks among men ; loves men with inexpressible soft pity , as they can not love him ; but his soul dwells in solitude , in the uttermost parts of Creation . In green oases by the palm-tree wells , he rests a space ; but anon he has to journey forward , escorted by the Terrors and the Splendors , the Archdemons and Archangels . All heaven , all pandemonium , are his escort . " Part of the world will doubtless persist in thinking that pandemonium furnished his chief counsel and guide ; but there are enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the future .
