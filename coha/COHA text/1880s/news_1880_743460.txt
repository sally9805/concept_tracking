txt The improvement made in marine steamengines a few years ago by the introduction of what is known as the compound engine is likely to be supplemented by another invention which is practically a development of the same principle . Mr. LOFTUS PERKM 'S , the deviser of the compound marine engine , has constructed a new machine , by the aid of which he proposes to cross the Atlantic in a small steamer of 70 tons , called the Anthracite . The governing idea in the compound engine is that when steam has been heated equivalent to a pressure of , say , 40. pounds to the square inch , it needs but a very slight addition of fuel to increase the pressure to 120 or 160 pounds . These engines , therefore , have two cylinders , a small one , in which the steam is confined at a high pressure , and a larger one , in which , as it is needed , it is allowed to expand itself . In consequence of this . contrivance , the consumption of coal on our ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same propelling power can be obtained by a daily consumption of 40 tons of fuel as was formerly secured by burning 100 tons per diem . What Mr. PERKINS has now done has been to carry this principle yet further . Why stop , he seems to have reasoned , at 160 pounds pressure ? When this degree of heat has been obtained , it is an easy matter to increase it to a pressure of 500 pounds , and then you have at command vastly greater power . The obstacle in the way of applying this system to the ordinary compound engine was that the difference between the pressure of steam in the storage and working cylinders was too great for its easy transmission from one to the other , and to overcome this he has had recourse to an intermediate cylinder , that is , the steam on the Anthracite is heated in the boilers up to a temperature equivalent to a pressure of 500 pounds to the square inch , and then passes into a cylinder 8 inches in diameter , thence into a cylinder 16 inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 inches , where it acts directly in propelling the vessel . It will at once be seen that this constitutes an immense economy of force , conceding , as all who have looked into the matter must , that the great outlay in fuel is in raising the heat of the vapor to its ordinary ? working degree . By Mr. PERIKESS 'S new method this force is increased tenfold , with but a relatively slight addition to the heating medium . One possible defect in this arrangement that will readily suggest itself to the reader is the intense strain which a pressure of this kind must put upon the boilers of an ocean steamer , Ad their consequent liability to explosion . Steam , at a tension of 500 pounds to the square inch , is an enormous force to be confined , and the explosion of a large boiler under these conditions would make short work of the stoutest ship that ever floated . But this is a contingency that Mr. PERKINS has not overlooked , and to meet it he has constructed a boiler for his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horizontal tubes welded up at each end and connected together : by small vertical pipes , the whole having been tested to stand a strain of 2,500 pounds to the square inch , though whether the trial was by steam or cold-water pressure is not stated . However , the claim that he makes is that the subdivision is such that if an explosion should occur it could not do material damage , for it would of necessity be confined to one of the numerous horizontal tubes , and from this vent the steam would readily escape . This is a matter that can be tested better by experience than by theoretic reasoning ; while at the same time it must be admitted that the theory seems a sound one , although by this subdivision there might be a considerable waste of heat . But when the Anthracite has made her trip across the Atlantic to this port , the data for judgment will be supplied that is now wanting . The immediate advantage to us of this improvement is in the prospect it holds out of greatly reducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessen the expense of . carrying a cargo across the Atlantic is a direct gain to the people of this country . The saving made does not go to any perceptible extent to the owners of the steam-ships , for they are compelled by keen competition to content themselves with a certain moderate return on their investments . Those who are benefited are the consumers of the merchandise carried and the producers who , in con : sequence of low freight rates , can send their wares to markets that , under other conditions , would not be opened to them . It is not easy to make a close estimate of the gain , but it is safe to say that if the compound ? engine had never been invented we should not now have anything approaching our present hold on the English market , and if the 500 tons of coal that the faster steamers now burn on an Atlantic voyage , and the 300 tons that the freight-boats consume , can be reduced respectively to 200 and 100 , with a corresponding reduction in the number of coal-heavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sufficient to permit us to sell our grain in Liverpool with profit at lower prices than ever before , and to ship it and other articles to . markets that are not now open to us . Americans , no less than the English , have good reason for hoping that Mr. PERKINS 'S latest invention will prove a success .
