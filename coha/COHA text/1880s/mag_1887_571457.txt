ARTICLE IH. - PATRICK HENRY . Patrick Henry . By MOSES ColT TYLER . American Statesmen Series . l2mo. , pp. 397 . Boston and New York : Houghton , Muffin &amp; Co . WHILE the name Patrick Henry is one of the best known of the names of those who were conspicuous in the epoch of the birth of the nation , the man Patrick Henry is one of the least known . No boy who gets a fair common school educa* tion fails to become acquainted with the speech which carries this bright glory from generation to generation , and every one keeps through life the conviction that his place is in the front rank of our patriots and orators . How many learn anything more of him , even so much as the salient facts that he was the author of the Virginia resolutions of 1765 which first embodied in authoritative expression the under-current of popular sentiment in the colonies regarding the motive of the Stamp Act ; that he was six times chosen Governor of Yirginia ; that he was a lawyer of such standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States ; that the same discriminating judge of men earnestly besought him to accept the position of Secretary of State in his cabinet ; that President John Adams appointed him one of the three Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic " with full powers to discuss and settle , by a treaty , all controversies between the United States and France , " at a critical juncture when wisdom and discretion of the highest order were requisite * Besides those who for some reason have made a special study of the events of the time in which he lived , very few , we venture to think , of the vast number of admirers of Patrick Henry 's great speech can tell so much of his career . And the number is still fewer of those who can give any full account of the course and incidents of his life , the quality of his genius and the traits of his character . // The information of most Americans on this subject is summed up in the knowledge , scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an eloquent patriot of Virginia who made one tremendous incendiary speech in behalf of armed resistance to Great Britain 's aggressions on the rights of the colonies . The man who exclaimed : " I know not what course others may take , but as for me , give me liberty or give me death ! " has a place in the admiration of all youth quite as high as that of him who wrote " We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . " It is not difficult to account for the prevalent lack of information concerning Patrick Henry . In the first place the theatre of his action was the State of Virginia . He was a member of the first Continental Congress in 1774 , and of the second in 1775 ; but almost immediately after the adjournment of the latter he was appointed by the Virginia Convention Commander-in-Chief of the military forces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence , he was chosen the first Governor of Virginia , in which office he served three years . At the end of that period he was again elected to the Congress , but declined the duty , and afterwards could never be induced to engage in the public service away from Virginia . Thus it happened that he had but brief part in the great affairs which made the continental congress illustrious , nor ever had an office in the national service , although he might have had the highest in either the legislative or judicial department , and a place near the highest in the executive department . His fame therefore obtains no conspicuousness or extension on account of a pedestal of high office . That it extended during his life beyond the confines of the commonwealth in which he was born is due solely to the power and brilliancy of a genius that attracted attention from afar . In many respects his position and circumstances were analogous to those of the men who were Governors of States during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their part in a manner demonstrating their possession of the highest qualities of statesmanship , and an ardor of // devotion to the common cause not inferior to that shown on any broader field of national affairs . The " war governors " have been almost a distinct order among our public men ever since . Most of them have had under the national government careers of honorable service ; but John A. Andrew , in respect of the limitations of his public service , and its quality also , resembles the eloquent Virginian of the earlier crisis of American patriotism . Furthermore , it has been the misfortune of Patrick Henry that he has not , until now , been presented to the apprehension of the generations succeeding his own in a clear light . He was himself singularly indifferent regarding his fame , so far as it depended upon the painstaking care public men often take to preserve and transmit to those who come after them the material for a just understanding of their acts . He seems to have been one of those who are content to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of perpetuating by their own care a true record of their part in affairs . His ambition does not appear to have been affected with distrust or jealousy . He shows no talent for insidious plotting in his own behalf , no habit of detraction . Ue died when Jefferson was in the mid course of his honors , and if he had any suspicion of that great man 's industry in backbiting , of which there is now a sorry accumulation of evidence , doubtless he regarded it with defiant contempt , trusting in the friends who appreciated and loved him to save his memory from harm . Conscious-he must have been conscious-of his extraordinary power and success in oratory , there is no evidence of an effort on his part to preserve any more enduring record of his triumphs than is furnished by the meagre journals of assemblies of which he was a member , and the reports of entranced listeners . And so it happens that of the speeches of the most IDemosthenic of American orators there is extant scarcely a fragment , perhaps not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their delivery . One result of his indifference has been that all biographical attempts , until Professor Tyler undertook the task , have been pervaded by an uncertain and shadowy quality which left the reader much in doubt whether they were more akin to history or to myth . Mr. Wirts ' Life of Henry had the advantages // and the disadvantages of being written , while many who were his active contemporaries in public life were still alive to give whatever information their recollection or their interest might prompt . There can be no question of Mr. Wirt 's diligence or of his serious purpose to do justice ,  --  no more question of these , than of the obvious fine writing with which in the paucity of definite and trustworthy information , parts of the work are padded out . How grossly he was misled in some eases , misled to the prejudice of his hero as well as of the truth , misled by those who ought to have known better and upon whose report he was justified in relying , Professor Tyler shows by indubitable proofs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , of which he says : " Anyone who will take the trouble to ascertain the enormous disadvantages under which Mr. Wirt wrote , and which , as we now know , gave him great discouragement , will be inclined to applaud him for making so good a book , rather than to blame him for not making a better one . " Yet this was the first and the last authority in literature entitled to serious consideration as an account of Patrick Henry 's character and career which his countrymen have had hitherto ; and it was written seventy years ago . IRecollecting what has been done in the interval for the fame of Henry 's great contemporaries , for Washington , Jefferson , and Madison , for John Adams and Samuel Adams , not to mention others , it is not strange that the popular notions regarding him who was their worthy compeer , have become somewhat vague and dim . If there has been long waiting for a just record , it is a compensating satisfaction to know that at last the work has been done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patient industry , the accessible sources of knowledge . Not only has he searched the mass of published matter relating to the epoch of the revolution , but he has been generously assisted by the possessors of yet unprinted material concerning those times , and especially by the descendants of Patrick Henry . The information he has thus gathered is more than merely additional to what was known before . It reveals new conditions and features , confirms some opinions that were only conjectures and overturns judgments that were believed to // be founded on ample evidence . One closes the book with assurance that now he knows what sort of a man Patrick Henry was , and what is better , with assurance that whatever mystery or errors regarding him may have existed hitherto , he appears not inferior or weaker , but worthier and more heroic in the clearer light . The fuller truth brings no mortification for his admirers . One just method of measuring great men is by what they actually achieve , not for themselves in the way of place or honors , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Let this test be applied to Patrick Henry 's statesmanship . In May , 1765 , he was chosen a member of the House of Burgesses ,  --  as the colonial legislative body of Virginia was called , - for the county of Louisa , to fill a vacancy . When he took his seat is not known . The first mention of his presence in the journal of the body is on the 20th of May . He had been in Williamsburg , then the capital , but twice previously , once five years before when he went to be examined for admission to the bar , and once earlier in the same session to argue an election case . He was a country lawyer with only a local practice , and could have known personally but few of his associates . It was in this same month that a copy of the Stamp Act was received in Virginia , and on the 29th of May , which was the 29th anniversary of his birthday , the House of Burgesses went into committee of the whole to consider what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , many of them veterans and used to undisputed sway , had any definite purpose or plan does not appear . But as soon as the house was in committee this rustic novice in statecraft , without having consulted them , rose and offered a series of resolutions which he had written on the blank leaf of a law book , resolutions so defiant and uncompromising that their character , even more than the audacity of their author in presuming to offer them , shocked the sense of propriety of the group who expected to formulate and direct the action to be taken . Upon these resolutions there was a terrific debate protracted through two days , characterized , in the language of Jefferson , who listened in the lobby , by " torrents of sublime eloquence from Mr. Henry , " // and in which nearly every one of the veteran leaders of public opinion in Virginia opposed the new member with all their power and all their art . The result was the passage of live of the resolutions . On the afternoon of that day Mr. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day the old leaders reasserted their influence sufficiently to rescind one of the resolutions regarded as most dangerous ; but the report of their passage was already on its way to the other colonies . These were the famous Virginia Resolutions , which greatly influenced the course of all the other colonies with referenee to the Stamp Act . From that date to the day of his death Patrick Henry , whenever he chose to do it , exercised a stronger influence in Virginia than any other citizen , and the occasions were rare when he did not bear down all opposition , no matter by what combination it was supported ; nor was he other than first in his own party in any contest . There was scarcely an important conference had , or action taken , by the patriots of Virginia , from the time when he burst upon their astonished apprehension as a natural leader of men , in which he did not have a leading part . His counsel in deliberation about what ought to be done was not less highly esteemed than his advocacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was a participant in the anxious conferences of the patriots at the time when the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor , wrote in a letter to Martin Cockburn : " He is by far the most powerful speaker I ever heard . . . . But his eloquence is the smallest part of his merit . He is , in my opinion , the first man upon this continent , as well in abilities as in public virtues . " The notion has obtained that in the continental congresses of which he was a member he did not figure as a man of capacity except in debate . This is due to misrepresentations of his conduct and standing by Mr. Wirt in his book , and Mr. Wirt 's information was obtained directly from Jefferson . But Jefferson 's opinion was not that of John Adams , who in a letter to Jefferson , written long after the occasion , said that " in the congress of 1714 there was not one member except Patrick Henry who appeared . . . sensible of the precipice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , and had candor and courage enough to acknowledge it . " The testimony of others and the journals of the body make it plain that Jefferson did less than justice to Henry in this particular . The list of important committees on which he served in either congress supplies convincing evidence that his associates regarded him as an eminently wise and practical man of affairs upon whom the severest drudgery of legislative business could safely be imposed . It always has been the the case , and probably it always will be the case , that men who have not the gift of eloquence are apt to comfort themselves with a notion that in other respects they are superior to the orator . Undoubtedly there are men whose only conspicuous nsefulness is that of rhetorical declamation , as there are men whose usefulness is most conspicuous in closet councils , or in writing novels , or in making money , or in posing in drawing rooms ; but some are intrnsted with more than one talent , and know how to use all they have with advantage and honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that may be consigned to the limbo where repose the notions that Cromwell was merely an ambitious hypocrite , and Washington a mediocre general and statesman who accomplished slowly and weakly things that were more honorable than difficult . It was in the interval between the first and second congresses that Henry made his famous speech in support of his own resolutions for arming the Yirginia militia . The second revolutionary convention of Yirginia met on the 20th of March , 1775 , and on the 23d Patrick Henry introduced the resolntions . They encountered a determined opposition , for what reason it has never been certainly discovered . The pretence that they were considered prematnre , when other colonies had already taken a similar course , and the congress had almost explicitly recommended it , does not seem adequate . In view of all the circumstances , Professor Tyler 's inference , from an analysis of the situation , that the motive of the opposition was a combination of hostility on the part of older politicians to Henry 's assumed leadership , and alarm at his manifest purpose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peaceful solution of existing difficulties , is not unreasonable . What he may have said when he brought forward the // resolutions is not known . The memorable speech was made in reply to those who opposed them , a formidable number , and decided their fate . Patrick Henry was chairman of the committee appointed in accordance with the resolutions to prepare a plan for organizing the militia , and among his associates were George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and Richard Henry Lee . They reported on the following day , the 24th , and their report was adopted on the 25th . On the 27th the Convention adjourned . The next we hear of the orator he is Captain Henry , marching at the head of a large body of the Virginia militia to demand from Governor iDunmore the , restitution of a quantity of powder that had been taken away from a colonial storehouse by him . The powder was not returned , but the Governor made haste to pay Captain Henry a satisfactory price for it . This affair happened not long after the Lexington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served the same purpose of precluding hope of a peaceable settlement with the mother country . Thus it is clear that from the beginning Patrick Henry was a man of deeds , an originator of policies , an organizer of designs , a leader in action , a practical statesman , not merely an advocate and debater . What Jefferson said to Webster fifty years afterward : " After all , it must be allowed that he was our leader in the measures of the revolution in Virginia , and in that respect more is due to him than to any other person . He left us all behind , " is much juster than the information he furnished to Mr. Wirt . It was natural that such a leader should be chosen the first Governor of Virginia under the constitution lie had an important part in framing . This office he held by successive elections for three years , the first three years of the war , and as long as the constitution permitted it to be held by one person without an interval . There is abundant testimony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least important being the constant confidence and reliance of Washington ; but a specific consideration of this period must be omitted here . One action of his , coming within the scope of the test now being applied , should be brought into view if many others are passed by . This is his opposition to the adoption of the constitution // of the United States , as framed by the convention of 1787 . It is unnecessary to discuss his motives . There can be no question that they were patriotic and honorable . Professor Tyler 's consideration of this matter is candid and satisfying . He feared , as many others then feared , that the scope of powers lodged by that instrument in the national authority involved peril to liberty and to the rights of the people because , in the first place , there was no definite and express enunciation and reservation of rights , and , in the second place , recent notorious incidents indicated a disposition on the part of the Northern and more powerful section to yield to a foreign power control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oppressive and unjustifiable sacrifice of vital interests of the Southern people . Upon Patrick Henry devolved the leadership of the opposition in the convention . The debate lasted twenty-three days , and on each of eighteen days Henry made at least one speech , and on some days two and three . At the organization of the convention the friends of the constitu tion counted on a majority of 50 votes in a total of 170 . At the end of the debate the constitution was adopted by a majority of but 10 votes , and this result was obtained only in connection with an express assertion of the understanding of Virginia that the State retained every power not expressly granted , and the passage of a resolution promising to recommend amendments to Congress . As soon as this action was accomplished Henry organized a campaign to elect members of Congress committed to favor a revision of the instrument . It must suffice to say that to the agitation which he prosecuted in Virginia and stimulated throughout the union is probably due the incorporation in the constitution of the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experience of a century has vindicated the wisdom of these express affirmations of State and individual rights , and likewise the sagacious statesmanship of those who insisted that such guarantees were essential for the public safety . Another proper test of the greatness of a public man and the substantial quality of his influence is a consideration of the opposition he encounters . He who succeeds by the default or incapacity of opposition establishes no firm title to the possession // of transcendent power . Patrick Henry 's triumphs were the rewards of conquering in hard battle opponents capable of contending on equal terms with the ablest in the land . There was no dearth of great men in Virginia when he maintained among them a confessed supremacy . In the House of Burgesses upon which he precipitated the resolutions on the Stamp Act , were Landon Carter , Richard Henry Lee , George Wythe , Edmund Pendleton , Benjamin Harrison , Richard Bland , and Peyton Randolph , the latter the King 's attorney-general in the colony . Three of these names appear among the signatures to the Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished and experienced in public life . Not one of them was privy to Henry 's intention , and so far as is known none of them supported , while most , if not all , were actively hostile to , the resolutions when presented . George Johnson , member for Fairfax , alone is mentioned by Jefferson as Henry 's supporter in the debate . When , in the second Virginia convention , he introduced his resolutions looking to an immediate arming of the militia , and was met with determined opposition by able leaders of opinion , he was not the obscure country lawyer with whom they contended ten years previous . He was as well known , and had as secure a place in public esteem as any among them , but nevertheless they challenged his leadership and were overthrown in a battle which in parliamentary annals was as brilliant and decisive as Austerlitz in the annals of war . And when he essayed to prevent the ratification by Virginia of the constitution of 87 , he encountered tremendous odds . James Madison , whose solid judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh distinction of his ascendant influence in the congress of sages by whom the constitution was framed , was pitted against him , and Madison was powerfully aided by the brilliant John Marshall , afterwards the great Chief Justice . Almost every eminently able man in Virginia , Washington and Jefferson excepted , was in the convention , and most of them ranged on Madison 's side . Jefferson , who sympathized in large degree with Henry 's convictions , but , notwithstanding , favored adoption as a present policy , was in France . Washington , although // not a member of the convention , exerted his great influence zealously and diligently in behalf of ratification . Against this array of forces Henry , barely more than a third of the convention siding with him at the beginning , made his fight . How nearly alone he made it , is shown by the fact that in the official report of the debate his speeches occnpy nearly a quarter of all the space . He did not succeed in preventing adoption , but he effected that the victory  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so conditioned as to secure subsequently the essential modifications he desired to secure in advance . So far as the struggle affords a criterion of the relative power of the contestants , the palm must be awarded to Patrick Henry . George Ticknor Curtis , in his " History of the Origin , Formation and Adoption of the Constitution of the United States , " says : " There has been , I am aware , a modern scepticism concerning Patrick Henry 's abilities , but I can not share it . - . - The manner in which he carried on the opposition to the constitution in the convention of Virginia , for nearly a whole month , shows that he possessed other powers besides those of great natural eloquence. ** Henry 's hostility to the Constitution was in no factious temper , nor did it arise from essential hostility to the idea of Union . He believed in a Union and desired it ; but it was not in his nature to welcome a form of Union which seemed to leave undefined and unsecured the rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured . Probably no debate over the Constitution which has since been had , exceeded in intensity of feeling and differences of profound conviction that of the Virginia Convention over its adoption . The culmination of the great controversy concerning slavery in the election of Abraham Lincoln hardly could have seemed more disastrous to the defeated party than did the adoption of the Constitution to Henry and his party . But with what a different spirit from that of the Southern leaders in 1860 he fronted the grievous fact ! Just before the vote was taken when the party of victory were trembling lest , through the desperation of this mighty tribune , their triumph might bring the woe of a civil war as its consequence , he spoke magnanimous and majestic words : " I beg pardon of this house for // having taken np more time than came to my share , and I thank them for the patient and polite attention with which I have been heard . If I shall be in the minority , I shall have those painful sensations which arise from a conviction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a peaceable citizen . My head , my hand , and my heart shall be at liberty to retrieve the loss of liberty , and remove the defects of that system in a constitutional way . I wish not to go to violence , but will wait with hopes that the spirit which predominated in the revolution is not yet gone , nor the cause of those who are attached to the revolution yet lost . I shall therefore patiently wait in expectation of seeing that government changed so as to be compatible with the safety , liberty , and happiness of the people . " Nor should it be forgotten that after the adoption of the amendments of 89 , he ceased ntterly from any designs of hostility aud from disparagemeuts . From his retreat in Virginia he watched with dignified and hopeful interest , and with constantly growing confidence , the operation and development of the new government under Washington 's guiding hand . When Jefferson was covertly preparing and openly encouraging embarrassments that imperiled success , and when , afterwards , he was secretly intriguing in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of 1798 , sowing the seeds of frightful strife , dragon 's teeth which nltimately sprang up armed men , Patrick Henry was giving loyal support to the administration and the Union in unwavering fidelity to his expressed intention . To him Washington earnestly appealed , representing the necessity , in the condition of public affairs , that he should re-enter public life in order to withstand and thwart the machination of the Jeffersonian party . " Your weight of character and influence in the house of representatives , " wrote Washington , referring to the Virginia legislature , " would be a bulwark against such dangerous sentiments as are delivered there at present . " It was in the same letter , and referring to the same conduct , that Washington wrote that expression of profonud prescience , the full significance of which we have since profoundly learned : " When measures are systematically and pertinaciously pursued , which must eventually dissolve the Union or produce coercion . " // In this fecundation and laying of the baneful egg of secession , Henry had no share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , made in response to Washington 's impressive appeal , and offering himself , an old man worn and snifering , as one willing to yield his remnant of life to his country 's service , he maintained " that the State had quitted the sphere in which she had been placed by the Constitution , and , in daring to pronounce upon the validity of federal laws had gone out of her jurisdiction in a manner not warranted by any authority , and in the highest degree alarming to every considerate man ; that such opposition on the part of Virginia to the acts of the general government must beget their enforcement by military power , and this would probably produce civil war . " In considering whether Patrick Henry possessed the qualities which place him in the rank of statesmen or was only an eloqnent orator on the themes of statesmanship , it deserves to be remarked that he made little use of his extraordinary power of speech , except in the argument of cases at law or the grander argument of the cause of liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift in strict subservience to his duties , something that the mere orator is hardly capable of doing . There is not in the entire record of his life , as known to us , an incident which suggests that he ever made a speech for display of his power , or on any topic not an immediate urgent question of serious consequence , in which there were other matters at stake than his own glory or advantage . He had no need to cultivate what is called stump-speaking , for he seems never to have desired any position as much as it was desired that he would accept it , unless his temporary military ambition may be considered an exception . Whoever was against him , the great body of the people of Virginia always were his admirers and never weary of showing their devotion . When he was not engaged in public duty or in the practice of his profession , he lived at a distance from the centers of public opinion and activity , remaining in remote seclusion for years together , cultivating his farm and enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sign of longing for the arenas of conflict , where he never appeared but to be // recognized as a leader and to augment his glory . Merely to court fame and feed the passion of ambition , he showed no more desire for opportunities to exercise his power over assemblies than Washington showed to exercise his talent for war . When the exigent call of duty had been satisfied , and the victory won , Freedom 's sword of deliverance and Freedom 's voice of thunder rested and rejoiced . Of many phases of Patrick Henry 's life and work , nothing is here said . No attempt is made to give a comprehensive view of the man , but simply to suggest , while calling attention to this fresh and valuable biography , some of his substantial and entirely valid , but almost forgotten , claims to be regarded and honored as a sound , sagacious , and accomplished statesman , endowed with extraordinary constructive and executive talents , which were exercised in a way that has made his permanent mark upon the organic fabric of our institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passions and sentiments of men . It should not be presumed from the one*sidedness of this presentation of a many-sided man that Professor Tyler 's work has a similar quality . His method is large and just ; his narrative is strong , full , engaging , and felicitous . It was a wanted service to the truth of history which he undertook , and he has produced an adequate , admirable picture , in which all the features of his subject are revealed with that combination of sincerity , appreciation and skill which makes a portrait to be itself the satisfying evidence of its fidelity .
