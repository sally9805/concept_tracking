THE experiment of reform , under the Civil Service Act of Jan. 16 , 1883 , has continued long enough to warrant some estimate of the new system . The provisions of the Act may be grouped under two heads first , those that prohibit political assessments and other interference with the liberty of the official and the freedom of elections ; second , those that make open examinations of character and capacity paramount tests for appointment , or , in other words , substitute a merit system of office for the old spoils system . We need spend no words concerning that intolerable system which the Republicans condemned too feebly and too late to avert a defeat , yet so emphatically as to leave a chance of regaining the reform sentiment , which their folly enabled the Democrats to capture in the last election . It is one of the curious anomalies of politics , that a party whose members of Congress , seeing that the old system was doomed , had the wisdom to surrender their long-cherished patronage ; that a party whose last President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmanship to enforce the merit system with fidelity ; that a party which had in its ranks much the larger number of the influential friends of reform - that such a party should first trust itself , in a doubtful struggle , to a leadership that cast suspicion on that policy and affronted that sentiment , and should then fail to demand the advocacy of that policy before the people until almost the day of election , when the defection of its adherents had become alarming and it was too late to recall them . I have conclusive evidence that the Republican National Committee entered the canvass intending to make the civil-service reform issue prominent in the debates before the people ; but over-confidence in leadership seems to have emboldened them to silence about what they did not relish , until the too-late speech of Mr. Blame in Brooklyn . There never was a // clearer case of defeat through too much faith in management and too little in the higher sentiments and in fidelity to principle . The leaders favored a reform only under compulsion . The strength of the reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters would repudiate the candidates rather than the principles of the party . It was not imagined that the Democratic leaders would have the wisdom and patriotism to carry forward a reform policy , as they are now doing , because they feel it to be both a duty and a guarantee of strength . There may be a great conflict in the Democratic party over the reform policy of its administration , but it will end , I believe , in a victory for the people standing for principle over the politicians grasping for spoils . But the practical results of a reform policy , and not the mistakes of those that have trifled with it , are my subject . The Civil Service Act prohibits officers and employees paid out of the national treasury from becoming the collectors or receivers of assessments , and the solicitation or reception of them in any office , navy-yard , fort , or arsenal of the nation . It is made penal to discharge , promote , or change the compensation of , or to degrade , any public servant by reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to secure a real liberty to those that have long been the victims of partisan extortion . The Act might well go further , as is the case with the laws of New York and Massachusetts , and forbid the demand of political assessments from any such officer or employee by any person whatever . A large part of the utility of these prohibitions has been the greater courage they have developed in the humbler officials for the defense of their rights . On the other hand , this high legislative condemnation of a familiar form of partisan plunder is causing the people to class it with lottery-ticket selling , gambling and robbery . The public mind more and more comprehends how inexpressibly unjust and disgraceful it has been for the great republic to leave its laborers and poor clerks at the mercy of the predatory extortion of its great officers and politicians . It is more clearly understood than formerly that salaries have been made exorbitant in order that large sums might be extorted therefrom for bribing voters and the public press without arousing a dangerous sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into effect have been far less then formerly . It was not without advantage that Mr. Hubbell , the last great national assessmentcollector , // secured a permanent place on the catalogue of objectionable politicians . He did much to make this whole business of collecting political assessments offensive . Only very callous politicians are ever likely to engage in it hereafter . The next generation will wonder as much that we allowed such a practice , as we do that the last generation tolerated slavery . It can not be said that the Act has wholly suppressed the prostitution of official authority for personal and party ends . In many ways such authority is still used for such purposes . A large part of this abuse can be arrested only by sounder views of right and duty on the part of the officer , and by the overpowering influence of entire publicity in administrative affairs . But who will deny that a great advance has been made in this direction within the past two years ? The demand that public office shall be treated as a public trust , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the views of the people . The public press , more effectively than before , arraigns the abuse of degrading minor officials into party henchmen , which has been the almost unchallenged abuse of two generations . The Act and Rules , in their whole spirit and scope , not only proclaim the increased strength of such an opinion , but declare it shall be heeded in the future . What greater limitation of the ability of an officer to use his authority effectively for personal and partisan ends can be made than the prohibition of demanding assessments ? What exclusion of the opportunities of enforcing servility so great as those provisions of the Civil Service Act and Rules under which more than 14,000 places have been made the prizes of superior merit , and are therefore placed beyond official favor or partisan influence ? He that wins his own place is never a henchman . To measure the extent of these new influences and of the changes they have wrought , we need but compare the terror in the departments and the political savagery shown by the thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the peaceful on-going of the public work under the present administration . The recognized danger to a party of making sweeping , proscriptive removals , and the general feeling , recognized by the Administration , that they are indefensible , are significant illustrations of the reform sentiment . Few politicians are now so blind as not to see that the demand , which they sneered at three or four years ago , that public office shall be treated as // a public trust , is to be a great political force in future elections . The old spoils system had three great sources of strength first , the plunder of the salaries of the public servants for filling the party treasury ; second , the use of the power of removal for compelling those servants to be party henchmen ; and third , the use of the power of appointment for bribing and rewarding for party ends those not in the public service . Such powers obviously add a vast and vicious force to all the venal influences in party politics . Capacity , fidelity , experience , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mercy of patronage-mongering demagogues leading on a host of hungry office-seekers . Only when , by the aid of the imagination , the significance of these facts is comprehended , can we have a real conception of the mediaeval savagery of the maxim that to the victor belongs the spoils . Its piratical spirit was plausibly mitigated by claiming that parties , conceded to be inevitable and useful in their sphere , could never prosper , if they could exist , without the funds and patronage thus secured . A theory that makes extortions and partisan patronage-mongering , rather than sound principles and devotion to the public interest , the source of party strength , is an affront to common sense and universal experience which carries its own refutation . Why did the Thpublican Party grow weaker the longer it acted on such a theory , and how did the Democratic Party carry a campaign under a reform candidate without federal officers to tax or to convert into henchmen ? Who now pretends that the IRepublican Party gained strength when , in 1873 , under the lead of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Grant for continuing the competitive examinations he had established ? As such examinations disregard political opinions , and substitute character and capacity for influence and partisan work , as the conditions of appointment , they naturally encounter the hostility of the whole politician and patronage-mongering class . These examinations have been so constantly misrepresented by the partisan press that they are still distrusted and grossly misunderstood . Many candid minds regard them as fanciful contrivances , having little regard for the needs of the service , for giving college-bred men or the literary class a monopoly of office-holding . Many people still believe that a patronage system // of appointments , based on the recommendations of politicians and members of Congress , has been giving us a competent public service . They are surprised when told that thirty years ago that system had become unendurable . The fact is , that in 1855 , a system of examinations , known as pass-examinations , was substituted by law for the patronage system . It has ever since been enforced in the departments , except where superseded by the competitive examinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service Act . These pass-examinations , though largely useful , had serious defects . Those only could take part in them to whom Congressmen , great officers and chieftains gave tickets of entrance , save in cases where mere personal interest or perhaps sympathy prevailed . Hence , aside from the latter , only adherents of the dominant party , and generally of the dominant faction of that party , were admitted . It was a feudal , bureaucratic , exclusive system , which brought in a class either dependent or easily made so . It discouraged the independent manhood and womanhood that it repelled from the service . It contributed to make the minor officials the feudal vassals of their superiors . The pass-examinations were like the competitive examinations in the subjects they covered , but they lacked essential conditions of efficiency . By examining only one person at a time , they allowed no comparison of merit and no opportunity for a selection of the best among the applicants . Pressure behind the single applicant generally forced him in . His monopoly of being examined excluded many more worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are based on common rights and are open to all on the same conditions . No test of political opinion , no favor of an officer or a politician , no influence of a party , is needed to give access to them . Every person of proper age and apparent qualification can enter them . If he lacks capacity , he will fail . If he has superior merit , he can win a place . Such a system defeats the old feudal monopoly of appointments . It suppresses patronage by enabling the citizen practically to put himself into office . It makes impossible the bartering of places for votes . It arrests the evil of filling the departments with fierce partisan henchmen pledged to fight the battles of their chiefs or party . It wins respect for the Government by presenting it before the people as having supreme regard for character and capacity , and as seeking to do justice to all citizens alike . It aims to do the public business on business // principles . It says to a party in power , " You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of their salaries , to keep you in power . " It says to the party not in power , " Make your contention on the basis of sounder principles and superior candidates . You shall not stimulate the partisan zeal of your followers , or draw into your ranks the hungry office-seekers , by offering the salaries and offices of this great republic as the spoils of your victory . " But what have been the practical effects of this merit system of examinations ? Have they been tried on a scale large enough to make the results decisive ? Taking no account of the salutary effects of this truly democratic system as enforced in Great Britain , where for twenty years its influence has been strong in the spirit of our institutions , its trial in the federal offices at New York for over six years might alone answer these questions . During no other six years of this generation has the public work been performed there with such economy and honesty as not to require an investigation by Congress . So strongly , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the city and State of New York , that a law was passed in 1883 which required its enforcement in the State and municipal service . Colonel Burt , the leader in applying it in the customs service , is now chief examiner under a New York Civil-Service Commission appointed by Governor Cleveland . Mr. Pearson , the leader in applying it to the postal service there , has the rare distinction of being the first postmaster appointed in our day for his merits as a postmaster , and not as a politician ; a fact as honorable to the President and the new administration as it is anspicious for the country . The examinations under the United States Commission are extensive and varied . The questions for testing the qualifications needed range from those suitable for a mere copyist to those suitable where a knowledge of science , law , history , laugnages , or the practiced arts are essential . They avoid what is needless , or merely theoretical . For a thorough trial of the new system , two conditions were essential : that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not so broad as to make a thorough supervision impossible . If successful , to extend the system would be easy . The examinations in the outset extended to the three great branches of the service , including 5,650 places in the departments at Washington , // more than 5,600 in the postal service , and nearly 2,600 in the customs service ; in all , to more than 14,000 places , known as the classified service , every vacancy in which must be filled from those certified under the Commission on the bases of superior merit as disclosed in the examinations . No mere workmen or laborers were included . As abuses were greatest in the largest offices , the customs and postal offices having fifty or more employees were included . At these post-offices almost half of all the postal clerks and carriers in the Union are employed , and at these customs offices five-sevenths of all the customs officials of the Union serve , and ninety-six per cent . of its customs revenue is collected . At Washington , 77 places , for which appointments are subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various technical reasons , are excepted from the examinations , but not otherwise from the rules . The filling of the classified service under the Act and Rules began July 16 , 1883 , and has continued without exception under the present as under the last administration . For that purpose more than 11,000 persons have been examined , and more than 225 separate examinations , in all parts of the Union , have been held . Of the 6,347 persons examined in the year ending Jan. 16 , 1885 , 5,525 were males and 822 were females . Of those examined , about two-thirds have been found competent for appointment . From those graded highest among them , nearly 2,600 have been appointed on certifications made under the Commission , each appointment being made for the probationary period of six months , and a permanent appointment depending on good conduct and efficiency during the probation . Those appointees unquestionably are about equally divided between the great parties . In but a single case has political discrimination in making an appointment been charged . An investigation showed it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily practicable . That has been done which their enemies have charged to be impossible and visionary . The useful effects of the merit system are decisively shown . At the end of the first year , President Arthur in a message declared the good results foreshadowed to have been more than realized . " The system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful public servants , and protecting officials from personal importunity . " In his message of January last , expressing as he declared the views of every member of his Cabinet , he " congratulated the country upon the success of the // labors of the Commission . " Accepting this view , Congress voted an increase of its clerical force . A committee of the last Congress , composed of eight Democrats and five Republicans , made a unanimous report , in which it declared itself " entirely satisfied with the thorough , conscientious , and non-partisan work " of the Commission , and declared that " the continuance of its work will in a large degree tend to eradicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last report of the Commission sets forth in great detail the results of its work , and this report it sends to those who request it . The new administration appoints those certified by the Commission , irrespective of their political opinions . Some special effects and conditions of the new system are worthy of notice . The theory of its enemies that it would fill the service with mere boys and girls , finds its answer in the fact that the average age of all those examined has been thirty years , thus showing an average period of nearly fourteen years of practical life between leaving the schools and entering office . The prediction that college-bred men would monopolize appointments , is answered by the facts that of 5,556 applicants as to whom the record is complete , the education was as follows 3,920 only in common schools ; 1,096 in part in high schools or academies ; 91 in part in business-colleges ; 449 in part in colleges . More than 70 per cent. , therefore , had only a public-school education . This friendly relation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no way can a nation do more to advance the dignity and success of the publicschools of the people than by making excellence , in the good character they develop , and the studies they teach , the tests for the honor and profit of holding its offices and enjoying its salaries . The youth of the country will be quick to see that the new system makes character and attainments more effective than partisan activity or flunkyism for securing appointments . It will be impossible for politicians to ridicule successfully the schoolmaster's-test , or to make that of the patronage-monger or the politician appear more reputable . It will never be possible to justify the taxing of all the people for educating all the children , and then to deny that superior excellence in that education is an irrelevant test for office . How effectively the tests of the meritsystem are in securing practical men for the public work , is shown // in the facts given in that report , that of the 109 in the departments at Washington who served their six months ' probation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more than 500 appointments under the rules there , only three were removed in a whole year ! Neither the Civil Service Law nor the Rules in any way limit the authority to remove , except that Rule 2 forbids removals for refusing to pay political assessments or to render political service . Every official in a department may be removed once a year or once a month , if the appointing power thinks it good policy to do so . It would raise less opposition to remove all the 600 appointed under the Rules , at Washington , than it would to remove twentyyrot6g*s of as many great officers or politicians . But a more enlightened public opinion has unquestionably put some salutary limits to the abuse of the power of removal . Most of the unjustifiable removals are made , not to get Anderson out , but to put Snooks in . The power to put in the Snookses of the lords of politics no longer exists , and therefore the worthy Andersons are not so likely to be removed while they are both faithful and efficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thus arrests the despotism and monopoly of the politician class , which destroys patronage by enabling the people to work their own way to office , which forbids more than two members of the same family being appointed to the departments at Washington , yet allows removals at discretion , is fatal to every form of bureaucracy ; I have no space for doing justice to the difficult work of the Commission in its more trying stages , now happily past , nor for indicating appropriate extensions of the examinations . The new system is permanently established . A merit service in place of a partisan service will be more and more demanded by States and cities . The people will triumph over the politician . Those seeking high office in the future will more heed the new power in politics . We are to have a new political science , the science of administration . The old spoils-system spirit is , however , still alarmingly audacious . I could fill an article with illustrations . These are samples : Not many weeks since , a young lady in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the office there , in my hearing , with putting her out of a laborer 's place , to make a place for his " own sweetheart . " The charge was not denied . That lady has since , by her merits , in an examination , // won a higher position . This advertisement is from a leading Washington journal , of April 17 , 1885 " I will give $500 for a position in any branch of the government service that wiji evade the Civil Service . Address Plato , Star office . " The member of Congress from the 21s1 Ohio district authorizes me to say that in two instances within a few weeks he has been offered one thousand dollars for his influence for procuring an office . I have a letter dated London , March 7 , 1885 , written by a merchant of that city named Charles 0 . Olson , to the Hon. Leopold Morse of Boston , in which an offer is made of $1,500 for procuring the consulship at Gothenburg , Sweden . Does any one imagine these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless , in view of such facts , to have the examinations extended ? DORMM* B. EATOI.
