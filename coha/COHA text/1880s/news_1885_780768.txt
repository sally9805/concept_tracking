txt The shrinkage in the assets of the estate of the late Archbishop Purcell through the investments of his speculative Assignee , John B. Mannix , is much larger than was anticipated last night . The inference then telegraphed was based upon the receipts and disbursements of the Assignee , as shown by his report filed in the Probate Court . It was learned to-day that this report was falsified . Mr. Mannix speaks of it as showing " apparent " receipts and disbursements. and admits that it is misleading . He will Bay very little as to the amount which he bas sunk , but intimated that it was about $175,000 .. One of his bondsmen says it is $100,000 , and another bondsman , Mr. H. Hoffman . thinks it will reach $215,000 . Gov . Hoadly , who is also on the bond , is said to be quite prostrated over the disclosure made to him , and an attach ? of his law officio is reported as saying ' that the Governor does not expect to get off for less than $100 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the estimates as to the shortage , which is reported to come from a trustworthy source , is that it will reach $550,000 . A bondsman , not here named , who was asked for a statement of the matter to-day by the hank with which ho does business , said that the shortage was much larger than the amount then reported , ( $215,000 , ) but he did not expect to be hurt much by it . for the reason that the bond could probably be beaten in the courts . It is known that since Thursday last , the day upon which the bondsmen ascertained the condition of affairs , they have held several meetings . Some of them have been reduced in fortune since they signed the bona , and if it is enforced they will be ruined . The bondsmen are Gov . Hoadly , $100,000 ? Mr. Clements , 550,000 ; Michael Walsh . $50,000 ? John Holland , $50,000 ; H. Hoffman , $50,000 ; Charles Stewart , $50,000 . Assignee Mannix says to-day that he was misunderstood as to the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved so disastrous . He had no such direction or authorization ; indeed , the court had no knowledge of the investments . He says he first put $31,000 of the Cincinnati , New-Orleans and Texas Pacific Railroad stuck at par and saw it depreciate to 15 cents . In order to retrieve this loss ho bought New-York Central , which also depreciated on his hands . Then he wont into stocks in Wall-street , dealing in margins , without any change of luck . Ho is an attorney of considerable practice , a Catholic , and until the revelation was made no one doubted his integrity . The only suspicion that has ever attached to him was that his loyalty to the church would prevent his pressing the suits in the interest of the creditors against the church property . It has been stated and denied , and stated again to-day that the contributions for the relief of Archbishop Purcell , which were made in other dioceses , particularly in New-York , and which were at the time reported to amount to about $80,000 , have gone with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance is placed , however , is that the fund thus raised is intact .
