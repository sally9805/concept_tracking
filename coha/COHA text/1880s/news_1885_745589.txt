txt There was yesterday received at the Navy Department from the Secretary of State a document which was marked in such a manner as to attract the attention of every official in the Navy Department who had an opportunity to see it . It was a communication forwarded to the Department of State by a United States Consul in one of the British ship-building ports announcing that the Consul had secured information exceedingly valuable from an international standpoint . Immediately upon the breaking out of the difficulty between tile Spanish and German Governments , growing out of the occupation of the Island of Yap by one of Bismarck 's gunboats , the emissaries of the Spanish Government had visited the ship-building centres of Great Britain , and had contracted for the immediate construction and armament of five cruisers for which they agreed to pay $8,000,000 . The vessels are to be built on the most approved modern designs . With the object of obtaining gi eat speed arrangements have been made to supply the cruisers with the most effective machinery that can be built in Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long range light guns . According to the Consul these vessels are all on the stocks and are being pushed rapidly toward completion . The name of the Spanish Government does not appear in the contract , but they are apparently being built for private parties or for sale to any one who may want them . The object of Spain , It is assumed , is so to build up her navy as to be able to cope with the more powerful one of Germany in case there should again be any outbreak or the Caroline difficulty ; and it is thought in diplomatic circles that in the event of the death of Emperor William Bismarck would certainly attempt once more to plant the German flag upon the island .
