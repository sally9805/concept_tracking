THE CHICKEN discovered sitting on a table , C. Two chairs . Chic . Chic . This ai n't no way for a fellow to be a going on , no how , a losing of his time , and the milling season a coming on . This here gov'ner of mine 's a green un , but it ai n't the right sort , he 's mean ; all I want 's a public-house , it ai n't much for following him about and offering to double up whosomdever he expressed a wish for to be a doubled up : here he comes  --  I 'm blowed if I do n't give him a hint . Enter TOOTS , R. 1st E. Toots . Toots . Alas , I may now say with the illustrious bard , that melancholy has marked me for its own . Existence is henceforward a worthless piece of the most intence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you 'd like to give this cove up along with it , Toots . Toots . Chicken , is that you ? my mental perceptions are fatally compromised , I did not see you . Chic . Chic . Well , but you hear me , do n't you ? what makes you so down in the mouth ? Toots . Toots . It is , as you say , Chicken , I am down in the mouth , or as I should more euphoniously express it , my vocal and nutritious medium is lamentably depressed , but that 's of no consequence , it 's the heart , Chicken , the seat of sensibility . When that is overturned , the mind has , as it were , nothing to sit down upon , and to speak metaphysically , it walks out , and leaves the premises to gloom . Chic . Chic . That 's all Greek to me , what 's the row ? that 's the way to come at it , is there anybody to be doubled up ? Toots . Toots . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is no one to be doubled up on my account , for cruel fate has done that office for me ; look upon me , Chicken , as a man , metaphorically doubled up , and indeed , I may go so far as to say , put to bed  --  but it 's not of the slightest consequence . Chic . Chic . Has Dombey been and gone and vexed you ? if he has , I 'll be down on the stiff'un . I think it 's within the resources of science to double him up . Toots . Toots . Chicken , you distress me , my nervous system is in such a shakey state , that I really think , if I could change places with a calf 's foot jelly , my condition would be vastly improved . Chic . Chic . Well , why do n't you tell a cove what ails you ? Toots . Toots . She 's married ; I bore the fatal intelligence with the manly fortitude of a  --  a  --  a  --  granite block , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful search were instituted for my heart , I conscientiously believe that the most likely place to discover that lacerated article would be in the leg of my boot . Chic . Chic . What if she is a going to be married ? is that a reason for a cove to fret hisself into a skilleton ?  --  look out for another , there 's as good fish in the sea as ever was caught . Toots . Toots . I wish you distinctly to understand , Chicken , that Miss Dombey is not a fish , and it betrays on your part the grossest ignorance to make so stupid an assertion . Chic . Chic . Then , why did n't you follow my advice and go in and win . Toots . Toots . Chicken , you 're absurd , how could I go in and win . Chic . Chic . You could n't , and I 'll tell you why  --  Toots . Toots . Do , Chicken . Chic . Chic . It 's just because you ai n't got not no pluck . Toots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your meaning obscure . Chic . Chic . Well , I ai n't a cove to chuck a word away , this is it , it 's mean . Toots . Toots . What 's mean ? Chic . Chic . It 's all mean , not to double ' em up , but to give in , without coming to the scratch . Toots . Toots . Chicken , you 're a perfect vulture ; your sentiments are atrocious . Chic . Chic . My sentiments is game and fancy , I ca n't a-bear a meanness . I 'm afore the public , and I 'm to be heard of at the bar of the Little Helephant , and no governor of mine must go and do vot 's mean , unless he has a hinclination to be doubled up . Toots . Toots . I see , I see through it all , you 're going to desert me now ; you , the Chicken , that I have had the satisfaction to be knocked about the head by , three times a week , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my fate , I never nursed a dear gazelle , etcetera , but it 's of no consequence . ( Knock , L. H.  --  Chicken opens door . ) Enter NIPPER . Nip . Nip . Thank you , Mr. Toots ,  --  pshaw ! if it ai n't that disreputable Chicken . Toots . Toots . Chicken , go and leave me to my solitude and my sufferings . Nip . Nip . Yes , go , and joy go with you , and if you could make convenient to never come back , I do n't think nobody 's eyes would be out of their heads with crying . Chic . Chic . Nobody need say go to me twice't , there 's nothing but meanness agoing on and I ca n't stand it . Toots . Toots . Chicken , you disgust me . Chic . Chic . Then there 's a pair of us , here 's a offer you spoke to me once't or twice't about the public life . Give me a fifty pound note , and I 'll marry that ' ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nip . Now did anybody ever hear the like , if it ai n't enough to make a body , I do n't know what . I can bear a great deal , but I 'm not a camel , nor if I knows myself am I a dromedary . Marry you indeed , go to the altar with a disrespectable Chicken , rather than that I 'd wear my hair up behind my ears , and wear coarse caps until death released me from my insignificance , that I would . Chic . Chic . Well , give me the fifty pun ' note , and let me go . Nip . Nip . For which I 'd sing , oh be joyful , and repeat the same every morning , noon , and night . Toots . Toots . Mr. Chicken , it is a melancholy consolation for me to observe that you have shown the , as I might call it , cloven-foot at last , there are fifty pounds . ( Giving it . ) And I regret very much at parting , to be obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short period of our acquaintance with anything approaching to satisfaction , but I suppose it 's of no consequence . Chic . Chic . Not much , all I 've got to say is that I hate meanness . ( Crosses L. H. ) And if anybody says I do n't , I 'll take the earliest opportunity to double him up . And if it was n't for the great respect I 've had for you , and this fifty pun ' note , dam'me , if I would n't double you up . Exit , L. H. Nip . Nip . A good riddance of bad rubbish , Mr. Chicken ; but dear Mr. Toots , my darling Miss Floy as was  --  Mrs. Walter Gay as is  --  Toots . Toots . Stop  --  Miss Nipper , that is , if you please , that name  --  I declare , if I did n't think it would compromise the dignity of my sex generally , I 'm sure it would wonderfully relieve me to faint away , just where I stand . Nip . Nip . Take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it will oblige you in the utmost degree Miss Nipper , I wo n't ! Nip . Nip . That 's right , indeed , Mr. Toots , I 'm sorry , for you . I may not be a summer cabbage exactly , but I have a heart . Toots . Toots . That 's a circumstance it would be ridiculous in me to question , Miss Susan ; although I am really in doubt as to whether I have now ; before my whiskers began to be observed by anybody but myself , I adored Miss  --  I mean  --  you know who  --  when I could be no longer kept out of my property and consequently came into it , I adored Miss  --  the aforesaid , and now that the banns have consigned her to Lieutenant Walters , and me to gloom , you know , I feel that the ground is cut from under me , and I have n't a single hope to cherish , or a leg , in short , to go upon . Nip . Nip . Well , now Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do say , there 's no use in trying to mend broken eggs , ' specially as hens is n't extinguished yet , not leastways as I knows on , so I would n't take it so much to heart . Toots . Toots . There 's a good deal of sense , Miss Nipper , in your observations , there really is . Nip . Nip . Well , now , rouse yourself , and do as Miss Floy  --  I mean  --  Toots . Toots . Spare me ! Nip . Nip . Nonsense , Mrs. Walter Gay wishes you to proceed at once with me to the lodgings of Captain Cuttle , and tell him that he must leave the residence of Mrs. MacStinger , and cast anchor , as the dear love says , with her and Walter  --  why what on earth are you staring at ? Toots . Toots . You , Miss Nipper , its a remarkable circumstance , I never observed it before , but you 're very good looking . Nip . Nip . Go along with you do . Toots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in being instrumental in procuring the slightest shade of gratification to Miss  --  has such a curious effect upon me , that it positively would n't be very repulsive to my feelings  --  to  --  to  --  kiss you  --  and I will too . ( He kisses her . ) Nip . Nip . Well , I declare , if he has n't ; go along with you  --  what next , I wonder ! Exit Toots and Nipper , L. H. SCENE II .  --  Cuttle 's Lodgings . Door 2 E. L. H.

What for ? why do n't you see it 's the only inhabitable island in this whole ocean of suds , you would n't have me paddling amongst the soap . Mrs. M. Mrs. M. It 's well for you to speak disrespectful of soap , as do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the other room and let the girl finish up ? Cut . Cut . Anywhere , anywhere ; but I do think , Mrs. MacStinger , that three times a week is amost too often to keep a fellow in hot water , but patience is a monument as will always be able to smile upon grief . Overhaul your proverbs of Shakspeare , and there you 'll find the obserwation . Mrs. M. Mrs. M. Well , I do say , there never was nor never will be a more ungratefuller Captain Cuttle than him that stands before me ;  --  am I a-toiling and a-working for myself , or , for who ?
