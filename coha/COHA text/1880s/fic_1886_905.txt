This etext was produced from the 1897 David Douglas edition by David Price , email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk THE GAROTTERS by William D. Howells PART FIRST SCENE I : MRS . ROBERTS ; THEN MR . ROBERTS At the window of her apartment in Hotel Bellingham , Mrs. Roberts stands looking out into the early nightfall . A heavy snow is driving without , and from time to time the rush of the wind and the sweep of the flakes against the panes are heard . At the sound of hurried steps in the anteroom , Mrs. Roberts turns from the window , and runs to the portiere , through which she puts her head . MRS . ROBERTS : ' Is that you , Edward ? So dark here ! We ought really to keep the gas turned up all the time . ' MR . ROBERTS , in a muffled voice , from without : ' Yes , it 's I. ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Well , hurry in to the fire , do ! Ugh , what a storm ! Do you suppose anybody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! Come quick , or you 'll certainly perish ! ' She flies from the portiere to the fire burning on the hearth , pokes it , flings on a log , jumps back , brushes from her dress with a light shriek the sparks driven out upon it , and continues talking incessantly in a voice lifted for her husband to hear in the anteroom . ' If I 'd dreamed it was any such storm as this , I should never have let you go out in it in the world . It was n't at all necessary to have the flowers . I could have got on perfectly well , and I believe NOW the table would look better without them . The chrysanthemums would have been quite enough ; and I know you 've taken more cold . I could tell it by your voice as soon as you spoke ; and just as quick as they 're gone to-night I 'm going to have you bathe your feet in mustard and hot water , and take eight of aconite , and go straight to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much at dinner , dear , and you must be sure not to drink any coffee , or the aconite wo n't be of the least use . ' She turns and encounters her husband , who enters through the portiere , his face pale , his eyes wild , his white necktie pulled out of knot , and his shirt front rumpled . ' Why , Edward , what in the world is the matter ? What has happened ? ' ROBERTS , sinking into a chair : ' Get me a glass of water , Agnes --  wine -- whisky -- brandy --  ' MRS . ROBERTS , bustling wildly about : ' Yes , yes . But what -- Bella ! Bridget ! Maggy !  - -  Oh , I 'll go for it myself , and I WO N'T stop to listen ! Only -- only do n't die ! ' While Roberts remains with his eyes shut , and his head sunk on his breast in token of extreme exhaustion , she disappears and reappears through the door leading to her chamber , and then through the portiere cutting off the dining- room . She finally descends upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small decanter of brandy in the other , and a wineglass held in the hollow of her arm against her breast . She contrives to set the glass down on the mantel and fill it from the flagon , then she turns with the decanter in her hand , and while she presses the glass to her husband 's lips , begins to pour the brandy on his head . ' Here ! this will revive you , and it 'll refresh you to have this cologne on your head . ' ROBERTS , rejecting a mouthful of the cologne with a furious sputter , and springing to his feet : ' Why , you 've given me the cologne to DRINK , Agnes ! What are you about ? Do you want to poison me ? Is n't it enough to be robbed at six o'clock on the Common , without having your head soaked in brandy , and your whole system scented up like a barber 's shop , when you get home ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Robbed ? ' She drops the wineglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully bestowing the flagon of cologne in the wood-box , abandons herself to justice : ' Then let them come for me at once , Edward ! If I could have the heart to send you out in such a night as this for a few wretched rosebuds , I 'm quite equal to poisoning you . Oh , Edward , WHO robbed you ? ' ROBERTS : ' That 's what I do n't know . ' He continues to wipe his head with his handkerchief , and to sputter a little from time to time . ' All I know is that when I got -- phew !  - -  to that dark spot by the Frog Pond , just by -- phew !  - -  that little group of -- phew !  - -  evergreens , you know -- phew !  --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Yes , yes ; go on ! I can bear it , Edward . ' ROBERTS : '  - -  a man brushed heavily against me , and then hurried on in the other direction . I had unbuttoned my coat to look at my watch under the lamp-post , and after he struck against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Waistcoat ! Yes ! ' ROBERTS : '  - -  found my watch gone . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' What ! Your watch ? The watch Willis gave you ? Made out of the gold that he mined himself when he first went out to California ? Do n't ask me to believe it , Edward ! But I 'm only too glad that you escaped with your life . Let them have the watch and welcome . Oh , nay dear , dear husband ! ' She approaches him with extended arms , and then suddenly arrests herself . ' But you 've got it on ! ' ROBERTS , with as much returning dignity as can comport with his dishevelled appearance : ' Yes ; I took it from him . ' At his wife 's speechless astonishment : ' I went after him and took it from him . ' He sits down , and continues with resolute calm , while his wife remains standing before him motionless : ' Agnes , I do n't know how I came to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I 've never thought that I had much courage -- physical courage ; but when I felt my watch was gone , a sort of frenzy came over me . I was n't hurt ; and for the first time in my life I realised what an abominable outrage theft was . The thought that at six o'clock in the evening , in the very heart of a great city like Boston , an inoffensive citizen could be assaulted and robbed , made me furious . I did n't call out . I simply buttoned my coat tight round me and turned and ran after the fellow . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Edward ! ' ROBERTS : ' Yes , I did . He had n't got half-a-dozen rods away -- it all took place in a flash -- and I could easily run him down . He was considerably larger than I --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh ! ' ROBERTS : '  - -  and he looked young and very athletic ; but these things did n't seem to make any impression on me . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward ! ' ROBERTS : ' Well , I wonder a little at myself . I do n't set up for a great deal of --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' But I always knew you had it ! Go on . Oh , when I tell Willis of this ! Had the robber any accomplices ? Were there many of them ? ' ROBERTS : ' I only saw one . And I saw that my only chance was to take him at a disadvantage . I sprang upon him , and pulled him over on his back . I merely said , " I 'll trouble you for that watch of mine , if you please , " jerked open his coat , snatched the watch from his pocket -- I broke the chain , I see -- and then left him and ran again . He did n't make the slightest resistance nor utter a word . Of course it would n't do for him to make any noise about it , and I dare say he was glad to get off so easily . ' With affected nonchalance : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell against me , and a scuffle like that does n't improve one 's appearance . ' MRS . ROBERTS , very solemnly : ' Edward ! I do n't know what to say ! Of course it makes my blood run cold to realise what you have been through , and to think what might have happened ; but I think you behaved splendidly . Why , I never heard of such perfect heroism ! You need n't tell ME that he made no resistance . There was a deadly struggle -- your necktie and everything about you shows it . And you need n't think there was only one of them --  ' ROBERTS , modestly : ' I do n't believe there was more . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Nonsense ! There are ALWAYS two ! I 've read the accounts of those garottings . And to think you not only got out of their clutches alive , but got your property back -- Willis 's watch ! Oh , what WILL Willis say ? But I know how proud of you he 'll be . Oh , I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call the police ? ' ROBERTS : ' I did n't think -- I had n't time to think . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' No matter . I 'm glad you have ALL the glory of it . I do n't believe you half realise what you 've been through now . And perhaps this was the robbers ' first attempt , and it will be a lesson to them . Oh yes ! I 'm glad you let them escape , Edward . They may have families . If every one behaved as you 've done , there would soon be an end of garotting . But , oh ! I ca n't bear to think of the danger you 've run . And I want you to promise me never , never to undertake such a thing again ! ' ROBERTS : ' Well , I do n't know --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Yes , yes ; you must ! Suppose you had got killed in that awful struggle with those reckless wretches tugging to get away from you ! Think of the children ! Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise , Edward ? Promise this instant , on your bended knees , just as if you were in a court of justice ! ' Mrs. Roberts 's excitement mounts , and she flings herself at her husband 's feet , and pulls his face down to hers with the arm she has thrown about his neck . ' Will you promise ? ' SCENE II : MRS . CRASHAW ; MR . AND MRS . ROBERTS MRS . CRASHAW , entering unobserved : ' Promise you what , Agnes ? The man does n't smoke NOW . What more can you ask ? ' She starts back from the spectacle of Roberts 's disordered dress . ' Why , what 's happened to you , Edward ? ' MRS . ROBERTS , springing to her feet : ' Oh , you may well ask that , Aunt Mary ! Happened ? You ought to fall down and worship him ! And you WILL when you know what he 's been through . He 's been robbed ! ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Robbed ? What nonsense ! Who robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : ' He was attacked by two garotters --  ' ROBERTS : ' No , no --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Do n't speak , Edward ! I KNOW there were two . On the Common . Not half an hour ago . As he was going to get me some rosebuds . In the midst of this terrible storm . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Is this true , Edward ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Do n't answer , Edward ! One of the band threw his arm round Edward 's neck -- so . ' She illustrates by garotting Mrs. Crashaw , who disengages herself with difficulty . MRS . CRASHAW : ' Mercy , child ! What ARE you doing to my lace ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And the other one snatched his watch , and ran as fast as he could . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Willis 's watch ? Why , he 's got it on . ' MRS . ROBERTS , with proud delight : ' Exactly what I said when he told me . ' Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got it on ?  --  ' Sh , Edward ! I WILL tell ! Because he ran after them and took it back again . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Why , they might have killed him ! ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Of COURSE they might . But EDWARD did n't care . The idea of being robbed at six o'clock on the Common made him so furious that he scorned to cry out for help , or call the police , or anything ; but he just ran after them --  ' ROBERTS : ' Agnes ! Agnes ! There was only ONE . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Nonsense , Edward ! How could you tell , so excited as you were ?  - -  And caught hold of the largest of the wretches -- a perfect young giant --  ' ROBERTS : ' No , no ; not a GIANT , my dear . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Well , he was YOUNG , anyway !  - -  And flung him on the ground . ' She advances upon Mrs. Crashaw in her enthusiasm . MRS . CRASHAW : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes ! I wo n't have it . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And tore his coat open , while all the rest were tugging at him , and snatched his watch , and then -- and then just walked coolly away . ' ROBERTS : ' No , my dear ; I ran as fast as I could . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Well , RAN . It 's quite the same thing , and I 'm just as proud of you as if you had walked . Of course you were not going to throw your life away . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I think he did a very silly thing in going after them at all . ' ROBERTS : ' Why , of course , if I 'd thought twice about it , I should n't have done it . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Of course you would n't , dear ! And that 's what I want him to promise , Aunt Mary : never to do it again , no matter HOW much he 's provoked . I want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary ! ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I think it 's much more important he should put on another collar and -- shirt , if he 's going to see company . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Yes ; go right off at once , Edward . How you DO think of things , Aunt Mary ! I really suppose I should have gone on all night and never noticed his looks . Run , Edward , and do it , dear . But -- kiss me first ! Oh , it DO N'T seem as if you could be alive and well after it all ! Are you sure you 're not hurt ? ' ROBERTS , embracing her : ' No ; I 'm all right . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And you 're not injured internally ? Sometimes they 're injured internally -- are n't they , Aunt Mary ?  - -  and it does n't show till months afterwards . Are you sure ? ' ROBERTS , making a cursory examination of his ribs with his hands : ' Yes , I think so . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cologne NOW ? Just think , Aunt Mary , I gave him cologne to drink , and poured the brandy on his head , when he came in ! But I was determined to keep calm , whatever I did . And if I 've poisoned him I 'm quite willing to die for it -- oh , quite ! I would gladly take the blame of it before the whole world . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Well , for pity 's sake , let the man go and make himself decent . There 's your bell now . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Yes , do go , Edward . But -- kiss me --  ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' He DID kiss you , Agnes . Do n't be a simpleton ! ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Did he ? Well , kiss me again , then , Edward . And now do go , dear . M-m-m-m . ' The inarticulate endearments represented by these signs terminate in a wild embrace , protracted halfway across the room , in the height of which Mr. Willis Campbell enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MR . AND MRS . ROBERTS WILLIS , pausing in contemplation : ' Hello ! What 's the matter ? What 's she trying to get out of you , Roberts ? Do n't you do it , anyway , old fellow . ' MRS . ROBERTS , in an ecstasy of satisfaction : ' Willis ! Oh , you 've come in time to see him just as he is . Look at him , Willis ! ' In the excess of her emotion she twitches her husband about , and with his arm fast in her clutch , presents him in the disadvantageous effect of having just been taken into custody . Under these circumstances Roberts 's attempt at an expression of diffident heroism fails ; he looks sneaking , he looks guilty , and his eyes fall under the astonished regard of his brother-in-law . WILLIS : ' What 's the matter with him ? What 's he been doing ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' ' Sh , Edward ! What 's he been doing ? What does he look as if he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIS : ' He looks as if he had been signing the pledge . And he --  smells like it . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' For shame , Willis ! I should think you 'd sink through the floor . Edward , not a word ! I AM ashamed of him , if he IS my brother . ' WILLIS : ' Why , what in the world 's up , Agnes ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Up ? He 's been ROBBED !  - -  robbed on the Common , not five minutes ago ! A whole gang of garotters surrounded him under the Old Elm -- or just where it used to be -- and took his watch away ! And he ran after them , and knocked the largest of the gang down , and took it back again . He was n't hurt , but we 're afraid he 's been injured internally ; he may be bleeding internally NOW -- Oh , do you think he is , Willis ? Do n't you think we ought to send for a physician ?  - -  That , and the cologne I gave him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head makes him smell so . And he all so exhausted he could n't speak , and I did n't know what I was doing , either ; but he 's promised -- oh yes , he 's promised !  - -  never , never to do it again . ' She again flings her arms about her husband , and then turns proudly to her brother . WILLIS : ' Do you know what it means , Aunt Mary ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Not in the least ! But I 've no doubt that Edward can explain , after he 's changed his linen --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh yes , do go , Edward ! Not but what I should be proud and happy to have you appear just as you are before the whole world , if it was only to put Willis down with his jokes about your absent-mindedness , and his boasts about those California desperadoes of his . ' ROBERTS : ' Come , come , Agnes ! I MUST protest against your --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But I should like to know what Willis would have done , with all his California experience , if a garotter had taken his watch ? ' WILLIS : ' I should have let him keep it , and pay five dollars a quarter himself for getting it cleaned and spoiled . Anybody but a literary man would . How many of them were there , Roberts ? ' ROBERTS : ' I only saw one . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' But of course there were more . How could he tell , in the dark and excitement ? And the one he did see was a perfect giant ; so you can imagine what the rest must have been like . ' WILLIS : ' Did you really knock him down ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Knock him down ? Of course he did . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Agnes , WILL you hold your tongue , and let the men alone ? ' MRS . ROBERTS , whimpering : ' I ca n't , Aunt Mary . And you could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled him over backwards . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' There , Willis ! ' WILLIS : ' And grabbed your watch from him ? ' ROBERTS : ' I was in quite a frenzy ; I really hardly knew what I was doing --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And he did n't call for the police , or anything --  ' WILLIS : ' Ah , that showed presence of mind ! He knew it would n't have been any use . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And when he had got his watch away from them , he just let them go , because they had families dependent on them . ' WILLIS : ' I should have let them go in the first place , but you behaved handsomely in the end , Roberts ; there 's no denying that . And when you came in she gave you cologne to drink , and poured brandy on your head . It must have revived you . I should think it would wake the dead . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' I was all excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that you had set the decanter here on the hearth , and put your cologne into the wood-box , you were perfectly calm , Agnes . ' He takes them up and hands them to her . ' Quite as calm as usual . ' The door-bell rings . MRS . CRASHAW : ' Willis , WILL you let that ridiculous man go away and make himself presentable before people begin to come ? ' The bell rings violently , peal upon peal . MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , my goodness , what 's that ? It 's the garotters -- I know it is ; and we shall all be murdered in our beds ! ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' What in the world can it --  ' WILLIS : ' Why do n't your girl answer the bell , Agnes ? Or I 'll go myself . ' The bell rings violently again . MRS . ROBERTS : ' NO , Willis , you sha' n't ! Do n't leave me , Edward ! Aunt Mary !  - -  Oh , if we MUST die , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugh ! What 's that ? ' The servant-maid opens the outer door , and uttering a shriek , rushes in through the drawing- room portiere . BELLA THE MAID : ' Oh , my goodness ! Mrs. Roberts , it 's Mr. Bemis ! ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Which Mr. Bemis ? ' ROBERTS : ' What 's the matter with him ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Why does n't she show him in ? ' WILLIS : ' Has HE been garotting somebody too ? ' SCENE IV : MR . BEMIS , MR . CAMPBELL , MR . AND MRS . ROBERTS BEMIS , appearing through the portiere : ' I -- I beg your pardon , Mrs. Roberts . I ought n't to present myself in this state -- I --  But I thought I 'd better stop on my way home and report , so that my son need n't be alarmed at my absence when he comes . I --  ' He stops , exhausted , and regards the others with a wild stare , while they stand taking note of his disordered coat , his torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been robbed --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Robbed ? Why , EDWARD has been robbed too . ' BEMIS : '  - -  coming through the Common --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Yes , EDWARD was coming through the Common . ' BEMIS : ' of my watch --  ' MRS . ROBERTS , in rapturous admiration of the coincidence : ' Oh , and it was Edward 's WATCH they took ! ' WILLIS : ' It 's a parallel case , Agnes . Pour him out a glass of cologne to drink , and rub his head with brandy . And you might let him sit down and rest while you 're enjoying the excitement . ' MRS . ROBERTS , in hospitable remorse : ' Oh , what am I thinking of ! Here , Edward -- or no , you 're too weak , you must n't . Willis , YOU help me to help him to the sofa . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I think you 'd better help him off with his overcoat and his arctics . ' To the maid : ' Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wits , undo his shoes . ' ROBERTS : ' I 'LL help him off with his coat --  ' BEMIS : ' Careful ! careful ! I may be injured internally . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , if you only WERE , Mr. Bemis , perhaps I could persuade Edward that he was too : I KNOW he is . Edward , do n't exert yourself ! Aunt Mary , will you STOP him , or do you all wish to see me go distracted here before your eyes ? ' WILLIS , examining the overcoat which Roberts has removed : ' Well , you wo n't have much trouble buttoning and unbuttoning this coat for the present . ' BEMIS : ' They tore it open , and tore my watch from my vest pocket --  ' WILLIS , looking at the vest : ' I see . Pretty lively work . Were there many of them ? ' BEMIS : ' There must have been two at least --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' There were half a dozen in the gang that attacked Edward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on my back --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Edward 's put HIS arm round his neck and choked him . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Agnes ! ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' I KNOW he did , Aunt Mary . ' BEMIS : ' And the other tore my watch out of my pocket . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' EDWARD'S --  ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Agnes , I 'm thoroughly ashamed of you . WILL you stop interrupting ? ' BEMIS : ' And left me lying in the snow . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And then he ran after them , and snatched his watch away again in spite of them all ; and he did n't call for the police , or anything , because it was their first offence , and he could n't bear to think of their suffering families . ' BEMIS , with a stare of profound astonishment : ' Who ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Edward . Did n't I SAY Edward , all the time ? ' BEMIS : ' I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; but you may be very sure that if there had been a policeman within call -- of course there was n't one within cannon-shot -- I should have handed the scoundrels over without the slightest remorse . ' ROBERTS : ' Oh ! ' He sinks into a chair with a slight groan . WILLIS : ' What is it ? ' ROBERTS : ' ' Sh ! Do n't say anything . But -- stay here . I want to speak with you , Willis . ' BEMIS , with mounting wrath : ' I should not have hesitated an instant to give the rascal in charge , no matter who was dependent upon him --  no matter if he were my dearest friend , my own brother . ' ROBERTS , under his breath : ' Gracious powers ! ' BEMIS : ' And while I am very sorry to disagree with Mr. Roberts , I ca n't help feeling that he made a great mistake in allowing the ruffians to escape . ' MRS . CRASHAW , with severity : ' I think you are quite right , Mr. Bemis . ' BEMIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . After escaping from Mr. Roberts they fell upon me . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I have n't a doubt of it . ' ROBERTS , sotto voce to his brother-in-law : ' I think I 'll ask you to go with me to my room , Willis . Do n't alarm Agnes , please . I -- I feel quite faint . ' MRS . ROBERTS , crestfallen : ' I ca n't feel that Edward was to blame . Ed -- Oh , I suppose he 's gone off to make himself presentable . But Willis -- Where 's Willis , Aunt Mary ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Probably gone with him to help him . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , he SAW how unstrung poor Edward was ! Mr. Bemis , I think you 're quite prejudiced . How could Edward help their escaping ? I think it was quite enough for him , single-handed , to get his watch back . ' A ring at the door , and then a number of voices in the anteroom . ' I do believe they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . He would be dreadfully shocked if he came right in upon you . ' She runs into the anteroom , and is heard without : ' Oh , Dr. Lawton ! Oh , Lou dear ! OH , Mr. Bemis ! How can I ever tell you ? Your poor father ! No , no , I CA N'T tell you ! You must n't ask me ! It 's too hideous ! And you would n't believe me if I did . ' Chorus of anguished voices : ' What ? what ? what ? ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' They 've been robbed ! Garotted on the Common ! And , OH , Dr. Lawton , I 'm so glad YOU 'VE come ! They 're both injured internally , but I WISH you 'd look at Edward first . ' BEMIS : ' Good heavens ! Is that Mrs. Roberts 's idea of preparing my son ? And his poor young wife ! ' He addresses his demand to Mrs. Crashaw , who lifts the hands of impotent despair . PART SECOND SCENE I : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dressing-room , that gentleman is discovered tragically confronting Mr. Willis Campbell , with a watch uplifted in either hand . WILLIS : ' Well ? ' ROBERTS , gasping : ' My -- my watch ! ' WILLIS : ' Yes . How comes there to be two of it ? ' ROBERTS : ' Do n't you understand ? When I went out I -- did n't take my watch -- with me . I left it here on my bureau . ' WILLIS : ' Well ? ' ROBERTS : ' Oh , merciful heavens ! do n't you see ? Then I could n't have been robbed ! ' WILLIS : ' Well , but whose watch did you take from the fellow that did n't rob you , then ? ' ROBERTS : ' His own ! ' He abandons himself powerlessly upon a chair . ' Yes ; I left my own watch here , and when that person brushed against me in the Common , I missed it for the first time . I supposed he had robbed me , and ran after him , and --  ' WILLIS : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIS : ' Ah , ha , ha , ha ! I , hi , hi , hi ! O , ho , ho , ho ! ' He yields to a series of these gusts and paroxysms , bowing up and down , and stamping to and fro , and finally sits down exhausted , and wipes the tears from his cheeks . ' Really , this thing will kill me . What are you going to do about it , Roberts ? ' ROBERTS , with profound dejection and abysmal solemnity : ' I do n't know , Willis . Do n't you see that it must have been -- that I must have robbed -- Mr . Bemis ? ' WILLIS : ' Bemis ! ' After a moment for tasting the fact . ' Why , so it was ! Oh , Lord ! oh , Lord ! And was poor old Bemis that burly ruffian ? that bloodthirsty gang of giants ? that -- that -- oh , Lord ! oh , Lord ! ' He bows his head upon his chair-back in complete exhaustion , demanding , feebly , as he gets breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to d-o-o-o ? What shall you s-a-a-a-y ? How can you expla-a-ain it ? ' ROBERTS : ' I can do nothing . I can say nothing . I can never explain it . I must go to Mr. Bemis and make a clean breast of it ; but think of the absurdity -- the ridicule ! ' WILLIS , after a thoughtful silence : ' Oh , it is n't THAT you 've got to think of . You 've got to think of the old gentleman 's sense of injury and outrage . Did n't you hear what he said -- that he would have handed over his dearest friend , his own brother , to the police ? ' ROBERTS : ' But that was in the supposition that his dearest friend , his own brother , had intentionally robbed him . You ca n't imagine , Willis --  ' WILLIS : ' Oh , I can imagine a great many things . It 's all well enough for you to say that the robbery was a mistake ; but it was a genuine case of garotting as far as the assault and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentleman . ' ROBERTS : ' He is . ' WILLIS : ' And I do n't see how you 're going to satisfy him that it was all a joke . Joke ? It WAS N'T a joke ! It was a real assault and a bona fide robbery , and Bemis can prove it . ' ROBERTS : ' But he would never insist --  ' WILLIS : ' Oh , I do n't know about that . He 's pretty queer , Bemis is . You ca n't say what an old gentleman like that will or wo n't do . If he should choose to carry it into court --  ' ROBERTS : ' Court ! ' WILLIS : ' It might be embarrassing . And anyway , it would have a very strange look in the papers . ' ROBERTS : ' The papers ! Good gracious ! ' WILLIS : ' Ten years from now a man that heard you mentioned would forget all about the acquittal , and say : " Roberts ? Oh yes ! Was n't he the one they sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Common ! " You see , it would n't do to go and make a clean breast of it to Bemis . ' ROBERTS : ' I see . ' WILLIS : ' What will you do ? ' ROBERTS : ' I must never say anything to him about it . Just let it go . ' WILLIS : ' And keep his watch ? I do n't see how you could manage that . What would you do with the watch ? You might sell it , of course --  ' ROBERTS : ' Oh no , I COULD N'T do that . ' WILLIS : ' You might give it away to some deserving person ; but if it got him into trouble --  ' ROBERTS : ' No , no ; that would n't do , either . ' WILLIS : ' And you ca n't have it lying around ; Agnes would be sure to find it , sooner or later . ' ROBERTS : ' Yes . ' WILLIS : ' Besides , there 's your conscience . Your conscience would n't LET you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , what do you suppose Agnes 's conscience would do when she came to find it out ? Agnes has n't got much of a head -- the want of it seems to grow upon her ; but she 's got a conscience as big as the side of a house . ' ROBERTS : ' Oh , I see ; I see . ' WILLIS , coming up and standing over him , with his hands in his pockets : ' I tell you what , Roberts , you 're in a box . ' ROBERTS , abjectly : ' I know it , Willis ; I know it . What do you suggest ? You MUST know some way out of it . ' WILLIS : ' It is n't a simple matter like telling them to start the elevator down when they could n't start her up . I 've got to think it over . ' He walks to and fro , Roberts 's eyes helplessly following his movements . ' How would it do to -- No , that would n't do , either . ' ROBERTS : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just thinking -- I say , you might -- Or , no , you could n't . ' ROBERTS : ' Could n't what ? ' WILLIS : ' Nothing . But if you were to -- No ; up a stump that way too . ' ROBERTS : ' Which way ? For mercy 's sake , my dear fellow , do n't seem to get a clew if you have n't it . It 's more than I can bear . ' He rises , and desperately confronts Willis in his promenade . ' If you see any hope at all --  ' WILLIS , stopping : ' Why , if you were a different sort of fellow , Roberts , the thing would be perfectly easy . ' ROBERTS : ' Very well , then . What sort of fellow do you want me to be ? I 'll be any sort of fellow you like . ' WILLIS : ' Oh , but you could n't ! With that face of yours , and that confounded conscience of yours behind it , you would give away the whitest lie that was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie ? Very well , then , I will lie . What is the lie ? ' WILLIS : ' Ah , now you 're talking like a man ! I can soon think up a lie if you 're game for it . Suppose it was n't so very white -- say a delicate blonde ! ' ROBERTS : ' I should n't care if it were as black as the ace of spades . ' WILLIS : ' Roberts , I honour you ! It is n't everybody who could steal an old gentleman 's watch , and then be so ready to lie out of it . Well , you HAVE got courage -- both kinds -- moral and physical . ' ROBERTS : ' Thank you , Willis . Of course I do n't pretend that I should be willing to lie under ordinary circumstances ; but for the sake of Agnes and the children -- I do n't want any awkwardness about the matter ; it would be the death of me . Well , what do you wish me to say ? Be quick ; I do n't believe I could hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what Mr. Bemis would be reasonable , even if I --  ' WILLIS : ' I 'm afraid we could n't trust him . The only way is for you to take the bull by the horns . ' ROBERTS : ' Yes ? ' WILLIS : ' You will not only have to lie , Roberts , but you will have to wear an air of innocent candour at the same time . ' ROBERTS : ' I -- I 'm afraid I could n't manage that . What is your idea ? ' WILLIS : ' Oh , just come into the room with a laugh when we go back , and say , in an offhand way , " By the way , Agnes , Willis and I made a remarkable discovery in my dressing-room ; we found my watch there on the bureau . Ha , ha , ha ! " Do you think you could do it ? ' ROBERTS : ' I -- I do n't know . ' WILLIS : ' Try the laugh now . ' ROBERTS : ' I 'd rather not -- now . ' WILLIS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Ha , ha , ha ! ' WILLIS : ' Once more . ' ROBERTS : ' Ha , ha , ha ! ' WILLIS : ' Pretty ghastly ; but I guess you can come it . ' ROBERTS : ' I 'll try . And then what ? ' WILLIS : ' And then you say , " I had n't put it on when I went out , and when I got after that fellow and took it back , I was simply getting somebody else 's watch ! " Then you hold out both watches to her , and laugh again . Everybody laughs , and crowds round you to examine the watches , and you make fun and crack jokes at your own expense all the time , and pretty soon old Bemis says , " Why , this is MY watch , NOW ! " and you laugh more than ever --  ' ROBERTS : ' I 'm afraid I could n't laugh when he said that . I do n't believe I could laugh . It would make my blood run cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd be in the spirit of it by that time . ' ROBERTS : ' Do you think so ? Well ? ' WILLIS : ' And then you say , " Well , this is the most remarkable coincidence I ever heard of . I did n't get my own watch from the fellow , but I got yours , Mr. Bemis ; " and then you hand it over to him and say , " Sorry I had to break the chain in getting it from him , " and then everybody laughs again , and -- and that ends it . ' ROBERTS , with a profound sigh : ' Do you think that would end it ? ' WILLIS : ' Why , certainly . It 'll put old Bemis in the wrong , do n't you see ? It 'll show that instead of letting the fellow escape to go and rob HIM , you attacked him and took Bemis 's property back from him yourself . Bemis would n't have a word to say . All you 've got to do is to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what if it should n't put Bemis in the wrong ? What if he should n't say or do anything that we 've counted upon , but something altogether different ? ' WILLIS : ' Well , then , you must trust to inspiration , and adapt yourself to circumstances . ' ROBERTS : ' Would n't it be rather more of a joke to come out with the facts at once ? ' WILLIS : ' On you it would ; and a year from now -- say next Christmas --  you could get the laugh on Bemis that way . But if you were to risk it now , there 's no telling how he 'd take it . He 's so indignant he might insist upon leaving the house . But with this plan of mine --  ' ROBERTS , in despair : ' I could n't , Willis . I do n't feel light , and I do n't feel confident , and I could n't act it . If it were a simple lie --  ' WILLIS : ' Oh , lies are never simple ; they require the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must stick to the truth , and throw yourself on Bemis 's mercy . ' ROBERTS , walking up and down in great distress : ' I ca n't do it ; I ca n't do it . It 's very kind of you to think it all out for me , but '  - -  struck by a sudden idea -- 'Willis , why should n't YOU do it ? ' WILLIS : ' I ? ' ROBERTS : ' You are good at those things . You have so much aplomb , you know . YOU could carry it off , you know , first-rate . ' WILLIS , as if finding a certain fascination in the idea : ' Well , I do n't know --  ' ROBERTS : ' And I could chime in on the laugh . I think I could do that if somebody else was doing the rest . ' WILLIS , after a moment of silent reflection : ' I SHOULD like to do it . I should like to see how old Bemis would look when I played it on him . Roberts , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIKE to do it . Now you go on and hurry up your toilet , old fellow ; you need n't mind me here . I 'll be rehearsing . ' MRS . ROBERTS , knocking at the door , outside : ' Edward , are you NEVER coming ? ' ROBERTS : ' Yes , yes ; I 'll be there in a minute , my dear . ' WILLIS : ' Yes , he 'll be there . Run along back , and keep it going till we come . Roberts , I would n't take a thousand dollars for this chance . ' ROBERTS : ' I 'm glad you like it . ' WILLIS : ' Like it ? Of course I do . Or no ! Hold on ! Wait ! It wo n't do ! No ; you must take the leading part , and I 'll support you , and I 'll come in strong if you break down . That 's the way we have got to work it . You must make the start . ' ROBERTS : ' Could n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' WILLIS : ' No ; they 'd be sure to suspect me , and they ca n't suspect you of anything -- you 're so innocent . The illusion will be complete . ' ROBERTS , very doubtfully : ' Do you think so ? ' WILLIS : ' Yes . Hurry up . Let me unbutton that collar for you . ' PART THIRD SCENE I : MRS . ROBERTS , DR . LAWTON , MRS . CRASHAW , MR . BEMIS , YOUNG MR . AND MRS . BEMIS MRS . ROBERTS , surrounded by her guests , and confronting from her sofa Mr. Bemis , who still remains sunken in his armchair , has apparently closed an exhaustive recital of the events which have ended in his presence there . She looks round with a mixed air of self-denial and self-satisfaction to read the admiration of her listeners in their sympathetic countenances . DR . LAWTON , with an ironical sigh of profound impression : ' Well , Mrs. Roberts , you are certainly the most lavishly hospitable of hostesses . Every one knows what delightful dinners you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your guests , by way of appetizer , are certainly unique . Last year an elevator stuck in the shaft with half the company in it , and this year a highway robbery , its daring punishment and its reckless repetition -- what the newspapers will call " A Triple Mystery " when it gets to them -- and both victims among our commensals ! Really , I do n't know what more we could ask of you , unless it were the foot-padded footpad himself as a commensal . If this sort of thing should become de rigueur in society generally , I do n't know what 's to become of people who have n't your invention . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , it 's all very well to make fun now , Dr. Lawton ; but if you had been here when they first came in --  ' YOUNG MRS . BEMIS : ' Yes , indeed , I think so too , Mrs. Roberts . If Mr. Bemis -- Alfred , I mean -- and papa had n't been with me when you came out there to prepare us , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , or gone through the floor . ' She looks fondly up into the face of her husband for approval , where he stands behind her chair , and furtively gives him her hand for pressure . ' YOUNG MR . BEMIS : ' Somebody ought to write to the Curwens -- Mrs . Curwen , that is -- about it . ' MRS . BEMIS , taking away her hand : ' Oh yes , papa , DO write ! ' LAWTON : ' I will , my dear . Even Mrs. Curwen , dazzling away in another sphere -- hemisphere -- and surrounded by cardinals and all the other celestial lights there at Rome , will be proud to exploit this new evidence of American enterprise . I can fancy the effect she will produce with it . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' And the Millers -- what a shame they could n't come ! How excited they would have been !  - -  that is , Mrs. Miller . Is their baby very bad , Doctor ? ' LAWTON : ' Well , vaccination is always a very serious thing -- with a first child . I should say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller would n't be able to be out for a week to come yet . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , how ridiculous you are , Doctor ! ' BEMIS , rising feebly from his chair : ' Well , now that it 's all explained , Mrs. Roberts , I think I 'd better go home ; and if you 'll kindly have them telephone for a carriage --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' NO , indeed , Mr. Bemis ! We shall not let you go . Why , the IDEA ! You must stay and take dinner with us , just the same . ' BEMIS : ' But in this state --  ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Oh , never mind the STATE . You look perfectly well ; and if you insist upon going , I shall know that you bear a grudge against Edward for not arresting him . Wait ! We can put you in perfect order in just a second . ' She flies out of the room , and then comes swooping back with a needle and thread , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' There ! I ca n't let you go to Edward 's dressing-room , because he 's there himself , and the children are in mine , and we 've had to put the new maid in the guest-chamber -- you ARE rather cramped in flats , that 's true ; that 's the worst of them -- but if you do n't mind having your toilet made in public , like the King of France --  ' BEMIS , entering into the spirit of it : ' Not the least ; but --  ' He laughs , and drops back into his chair . MRS . ROBERTS , distributing the brush to young Mr. Bemis , and the tie to his wife , and dropping upon her knees before Mr. Bemis : ' Now , Mrs. Lou , you just whip off that crumpled tie and whip on the fresh one , and , MISTER Lou , you give his hair a touch , and I 'll have this torn button-hole mended before you can think . ' She seizes it and begins to sew vigorously upon it . MRS . CRASHAW : ' Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . ' LAWTON , standing before the group , with his arms folded and his feet well apart , in an attitude of easy admiration : ' The Wounded Adonis , attended by the Loves and Graces . Familiar Pompeiian fresco . ' MRS . ROBERTS , looking around at him : ' I do n't see a great many Loves . ' LAWTON : ' She ignores us , Mrs. Crashaw . And after what you 've just said ! ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Then why do n't you do something ? ' LAWTON : ' The Loves NEVER do anything -- in frescoes . They stand round and sympathise . Besides , we are waiting to administer an anaesthetic . But what I admire in this subject even more than the activity of the Graces is the serene dignity of the Adonis . I have seen my old friend in many trying positions , but I never realised till now all the simpering absurdity , the flattered silliness , the senile coquettishness , of which his benign countenance was capable . ' MRS . ROBERTS : ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing but --  ' LAWTON : ' Pure envy . I own it . ' BEMIS : ' All right , Lawton . Wait till --  ' MRS . ROBERTS , making a final stitch , snapping off the thread , and springing to her feet , all in one : ' There , have you finished , Mr. and Mrs. Lou ? Well , then , take this lace handkerchief , and draw it down from his neck and pin it in his waistcoat , and you have --  ' LAWTON , as Mr. Bemis rises to his feet : ' A Gentleman of the Old School . Bemis , you look like a miniature of yourself by Malbone . Rather flattered , but -- recognisable . ' BEMIS , with perfectly recovered gaiety : ' Go on , go on , Lawton . I can understand your envy . I can pity it . ' LAWTON : ' Could you forgive Roberts for not capturing the garotter ? ' BEMIS : ' Yes , I could . I could give the garotter his liberty , and present him with an admission to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his family . ' LAWTON , compassionately : ' You ARE pretty far gone , Bemis . Really , I think somebody ought to go for Roberts . ' MRS . ROBERTS , innocently : ' Yes , indeed ! Why , what in the world can be keeping him ? ' A nursemaid enters and beckons Mrs. Roberts to the door with a glance . She runs to her ; they whisper ; and then Mrs. Roberts , over her shoulder : ' That ridiculous great boy of mine says he ca n't go to sleep unless I come and kiss him good-night . ' LAWTON : ' Which ridiculous great boy , I wonder ?  - -  Roberts , or Campbell ? But I did n't know they had gone to bed ! ' MRS . BEMIS : ' You are too bad , papa ! You know it 's little Neddy . ' MRS . ROBERTS , vanishing : ' Oh , I do n't mind his nonsense , Lou . I 'll fetch them both back with me . ' LAWTON , after making a melodramatic search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have a revelation to make in Mrs. Roberts 's absence . I have found out the garotter -- the assassin . ' ALL THE OTHERS : ' What ! ' LAWTON : ' He has been secured --  ' MRS . CRASHAW , severely : ' Well , I 'm very glad of it . ' YOUNG BEMIS : ' By the police ? ' MRS . BEMIS , incredulously : ' Papa ! ' BEMIS : ' But there were several of them . Have they all been arrested ? ' LAWTON : ' There was only one , and none of him has been arrested . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Where is he , then ? ' LAWTON : ' In this house . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Now , Dr. Lawton , you and I are old friends -- I should n't like to say HOW old -- but if you do n't instantly be serious , I -- I 'll carry my rheumatism to somebody else . ' LAWTON : ' My DEAR Mrs. Crashaw , you know how much I prize that rheumatism of yours ! I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roberts himself . ' ALL , horror-struck : ' Oh ! ' LAWTON : ' He went out without his watch . He thought he was robbed , but he was n't . He ran after the supposed thief , our poor friend Bemis here , and took Bemis 's watch away , and brought it home for his own . ' YOUNG BEMIS : ' Yes , but --  ' MRS . BEMIS : ' But , papa --  ' BEMIS : ' How do you know it ? I can see how such a thing might happen , but -- how do you know it DID ? ' LAWTON : ' I divined it . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Nonsense ! ' LAWTON : ' Very well , then , I read of just such a ease in the Advertiser a year ago . It occurs annually -- in the newspapers . And I 'll tell you what , Mrs. Crashaw -- Roberts found out his mistake as soon as he went to his dressing-room ; and that ingenious nephew of yours , who 's closeted with him there , has been trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CRASHAW : ' Willis has too much sense . He would know that Edward could n't carry out any sort of game . ' LAWTON : ' Well , then , he 's getting Roberts to let HIM carry out the game . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Edward could n't do that either . ' LAWTON : ' Very well , then , just wait till they come back . Will you leave me to deal with Campbell ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' What are you going to do ? ' YOUNG BEMIS : ' You must n't forget that he got us out of the elevator , sir . ' MRS . BEMIS : ' We might have been there yet if it had n't been for him , papa . ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I should n't want Willis mortified . ' BEMIS : ' Nor Mr. Roberts annoyed . We 're fellow-sufferers in this business . ' LAWTON : ' Oh , leave it to me , leave it to me ! I 'll spare their feelings . Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything . I 'll just step into the anteroom here . ' SCENE II : MR . ROBERTS , MR . CAMPBELL , AND THE OTHERS ROBERTS , entering the room before Campbell , and shaking hands with his guests : ' Ah , Mr. Bemis ; Mrs. Bemis ; Aunt Mary ! You 've heard of our comical little coincidence -- our -- Mr . Bemis and my --  ' He halts , confused , and looks around for the moral support of Willis , who follows hilariously . WILLIS : ' Greatest joke on record ! But I wo n't spoil it for you , Roberts . Go on ! ' In a low voice to Roberts : ' And do n't look so confoundedly down in the mouth . They wo n't think it 's a joke at all . ' ROBERTS , with galvanic lightness : ' Yes , yes -- such a joke ! Well , you see -- you see --  ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' See WHAT , Edward ? DO get it out ! ' WILLIS , jollily : ' Ah , ha , ha ! ' ROBERTS , lugubriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BEMIS : ' How funny ! Ha , ha , ha ! ' YOUNG MR . BEMIS : ' Capital ! capital ! ' BEMIS : ' Excellent ! ' WILLIS : ' Go on , Roberts , do ! or I shall die ! Ah , ha , ha ! ' ROBERTS , in a low voice of consternation to Willis : ' Where was I ? I ca n't go on unless I know where I was . ' WILLIS , sotto voce to Roberts : ' You were n't anywhere ! For Heaven 's sake , make a start ! ' ROBERTS , to the others , convulsively : ' Ha , ha , ha ! I supposed all the time , you know , that I had been robbed , and -- and --  ' WILLIS : ' Go on ! GO on ! ' ROBERTS , whispering : ' I ca n't do it --  ' WILLIS , whispering : ' You 've GOT to ! You 're the beaver that clomb the tree . Laugh naturally , now ! ' ROBERTS , with a staccato groan , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then I ran after the man --  ' He stops , and regards Mr. Bemis with a ghastly stare . MRS . CRASHAW : ' What is the matter with you , Edward ? Are you sick ? ' WILLIS : ' Sick ? No ! Ca n't you see that he ca n't get over the joke of the thing ? It 's killing him . ' To Roberts : ' Brace up , old man ! You 're doing it splendidly . ' ROBERTS , hopelessly : ' And then the other man -- the man that had robbed me -- the man that I had pursued -- ugh ! ' WILLIS : ' Well , it is too much for him . I shall have to tell it myself , I see . ' ROBERTS , making a wild effort to command himself : ' And so -- so -- this man -- man -- ma --  ' WILLIS : ' Oh , good Lord --  ' Dr. Lawton suddenly appears from the anteroom and confronts him . ' Oh , the devil ! ' LAWTON , folding his arms , and fixing his eyes upon him : ' Which means that you forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read a man 's symptoms at a glance . ' LAWTON : ' Yes ; and I can see that you are in a bad way , Mr. Campbell . ' WILLIS : ' Why do n't you advertise , Doctor ? Patients need only enclose a lock of their hair , and the colour of their eyes , with one dollar to pay the cost of materials , which will be sent , with full directions for treatment , by return mail . Seventh son of a seventh son . ' LAWTON : ' Ah , do n't try to jest it away , my poor friend . This is one of those obscure diseases of the heart -- induration of the pericardium -- which , if not taken in time , result in deceitfulness above all things , and desperate wickedness . ' WILLIS : ' Look here , Dr. Lawton , what are you up to ? ' LAWTON : ' Look here , Mr. Campbell , what is your little game ? ' WILLIS : ' I do n't know what you 're up to . ' He shrugs his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders and walking up the room abreast of Campbell : ' I do n't know what your little game is . ' They return together , and stop , confronting each other . WILLIS : ' But if you think I 'm going to give myself away --  ' LAWTON : ' If you suppose I 'm going to take you at your own figure --  ' They walk up the room together , and return as before . WILLIS : ' Mrs. Bemis , what is this unnatural parent of yours after ? ' MRS . BEMIS , tittering : ' Oh , I 'm sure I ca n't tell . ' WILLIS : ' Aunt Mary , you used to be a friend of mine . Ca n't you give me some sort of clue ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' I should be ashamed of you , Willis , if you accepted anybody 's help . ' WILLIS , sighing : ' Well , this is pretty hard on an orphan . Here I come to join a company of friends at the fireside of a burgled brother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Suddenly , after a moment : ' Oh , I understand . Why , I ought to have seen at once . But no matter -- it 's just as well . I 'm sure that we shall hear Dr. Lawton leniently , and make allowance for his well- known foible . Roberts is bound by the laws of hospitality , and Mr. Bemis is the father-in-law of his daughter . ' MRS . BEMIS , in serious dismay : ' Why , Mr. Campbell , what do you mean ? ' WILLIS : ' Simply that the mystery is solved -- the double garotter is discovered . I 'm sorry for you , Mrs. Bemis ; and no one will wish to deal harshly with your father when he confesses that it was he who robbed Mr. Roberts and Mr. Bemis . All that they ask is to have their watches back . Go on , Doctor ! How will that do , Aunt Mary , for a little flyer ? ' MRS . CRASHAW : ' Willis , I declare I never saw anybody like you ! ' She embraces him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But , my dear Willis --  ' WILLIS , clapping his hand over his mouth , and leading him back to his place : ' We ca n't let you talk now . I 've no doubt you 'll be considerate , and all that , but Dr. Lawton has the floor . Go on , Doctor ! Free your mind ! Do n't be afraid of telling the whole truth ! It will be better for you in the end . ' He rubs his hands gleefully , and then thrusting the points of them into his waistcoat pockets , stands beaming triumphantly upon Lawton . LAWTON : ' Do you think so ? ' With well-affected trepidation ' Well , friends , if I must confess this -- this --  ' WILLIS : ' High-handed outrage . Go on . ' LAWTON : ' I suppose I must . I shall not expect mercy for myself ; perhaps you 'll say that , as an old and hardened offender , I do n't deserve it . But I had an accomplice -- a young man very respectably connected , and who , whatever his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good reputation ; a young man a little apt to be misled by overweening vanity and the ill-advised flattery of his friends ; but I hope that neither of you gentlemen will be hard upon him , but will consider his youth , and perhaps his congenital moral and intellectual deficiencies , even when you find your watches -- on Mr. Campbell 's person . ' He leans forward , rubbing his hands , and smiling upon Campbell , ' How will that do , Mr. Campbell , for a flyer ? ' WILLIS , turning to Mrs. Crashaw : ' One ahead , Aunt Mary ? ' LAWTON , clasping him by the hand : ' No , generous youth -- even ! ' They shake hands , clapping each other on the back with their lefts , and joining in the general laugh . BEMIS , coming forward jovially : ' Well , now , I gladly forgive you both -- or whoever DID rob me -- if you 'll only give me back my watch . ' WILLIS : ' I have n't got your watch . ' LAWTON : ' Nor I. ' ROBERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I -- I have it , Mr. Bemis . ' He produces it from one waistcoat pocket and hands it to Bemis . Then , visiting the other : ' And what 's worse , I have my own . I do n't know how I can ever explain it , or atone to you for my extraordinary behaviour . Willis thought you might finally see it as a joke , and I 've done my best to pass it off lightly --  ' WILLIS : ' And you succeeded . You had all the lightness of a sick hippopotamus . ' ROBERTS : ' I 'm afraid so . I 'll have the chain mended , of course . But when I went out this evening I left my watch on my dressing- table , and when you struck against me in the Common I missed it , and supposed I had been robbed , and I ran after you and took yours --  ' WILLIS : ' Being a man of the most violent temper and the most desperate courage --  ' ROBERTS : ' But I hope , my dear sir , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Not at all -- not the least .
