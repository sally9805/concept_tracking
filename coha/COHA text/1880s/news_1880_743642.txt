txt The intense excitement prevailing here over the advance of elevator storage rates by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is on the increase , and the railroad 's action is denounced on all sides as an outrage which , if enforced , can not fail to be ruinous to the trade of the port . It is freely charged that the notice was given by the company purely for speculative purposes , and that the officers *of the road are bulling the market . Whether this is so or not , the feeling against the railroad company is very bitter , as was shown at the indignation meeting on ' Change to-day . Upon calling this meeting to order , President J. L Middleton suggested that a committee be appointed to prepare resolutions embodying the sense of the meeting . This was done , and resolutions were reported and adopted . In reporting them the Chairman  --  Mr. Yound ? said : " The grievance , designating it by no harsh term or terms , which we have assembled to consider , is one of no ordinary character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us one year ago . Self-respect and a proper estimate of the standing and character of the institution of which we are members , demand that some action be taken to obtain not only immunity , but that immunity which shall be permanent , from the inevitable results of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company Imposing upon wheat in their elevators a storage charge which they can not bear . Let as review the situation and its surroundings as briefly as we can . We are Slawarding nothing in saying that in no other department of commercial life has the labor , energy , and tact of merchants , not to mention the use of abundant sapital , met with such meagre reward as have our efforts to bring hither a very large proportion of the grain trade of the great West and of the Middle States . That we have succeeded abundantly ran be attested by reference to the record of the Corn and Flour Exchange . It was only last week that the annual report of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company depicted in glowing language the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation of grain to Baltimore , " and this pride was , perhaps , but natural when the present grain tonnage is contrasted with that of six years ago . Nowit has required increasing energy end industry and money to induce grain to come here , and must we be punished for our instrumentality in these contributions to the trade of the city 1 Even so it would seem . Possibly the rate of elevator storage has not contributed sufficiently to the glittering revenues of the great Short Line to the West , ' and these must be increased sixfold to make the next annual report of the company more dazzling and bewildering . Does it occur to the author of the edict that much of the grain is owned by persons residing outside of the city of Baltimore , and that curses loud and deep have already been telegraphed to us , with the assurance that as they can as readily reach other markets as this , they do not propose to leave any of their grain here to be taxed under the next annual infliction . " " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected to allude to the mitigating feature of the present edict  --  waiving the 810 per car per diem , while it was waiting further developments of terminal facilities . Within the past few weeks manufacturers and brother merchants in other lines of trade have organized an association , the purpose of which is to attract hither trade which has been passing on to neighboring cities . Their efforts will , doubtless , meet with abundant reward , and we bid them God speed while we can , but lament that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company proposes to scatter to the wind all the trade which we can attract to Baltimore . Shall we be driven out A the business ? That result seems inevitable . Rust we , can we , dare we sit down supinely and see that taken away which belongs to our correspondents in other States and to ourselves ? Does this demand vigorous protests ? Does it call for resistance . There is a remedy for it , and we shall be cowards if we seek not that remedy . There is that which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seek it ? " The preamble and resolutions were as follows : Whereas , The action of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , in notifying the Exchange that there will be an extra charge on wheat in Its elevators after the expiration of 10 UM , has greatly disturbed values and unsettled business , and is calculated to interfere with and embarrass the trade of the city , and is an effort to depress the value of all grain : which has been intrusted to its care , causing serious loss to the grain trade ; and 1V7cereas , The experience of a similar measure last year has taught us that damage to the trade of the city will extend over many months if the policy is persisted in ; and Whereas , The advanced rate of storage is imposed upon grain now in elevators , which was received , transported . and stored by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company with the implied agreement that it should be subject only to the usual and pubished rate , the trade had a right to expect that tho arbitrary and destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas , We think it vital to the interests of its grain trade that no one man or set of men shall have it in their power to suddenly depress values and practically confiscate the property of others for the avowed purpose of emptying elevators or for any other reason ; therefore . Resolved , That , on behalf of ourselves and those who have intrusted their property to our custody , we hereby protest against the action of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in advancing the rate of storage at its elevators as unnecessary . impolitic , unwise , and unjust , and calculated to work permanent injury to the grain trade of our city , with no corresponding advantage to the railroad company . Resolved , That a committee of five members be appointed to confer with proper authorities of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , and protest against the enforcement of the recent order , using their influence as representatives of the Exchange to have it withdrawn . and assuring the officers of the company of our hearty co-operation , and all legitimate efforts to relieve the blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest to the railroad company to avail itself of private storage warehouses , which are obtainable adjacent to its tracks upon tide-water , and that the committee be requested to co-operate to secure such storage capacity . The other resolutions urge the railroad authorities to order its Western agents to stop receiving grain for 10 days , until the blockade is relieved , and that if the Baltimore and Ohio authorities do not accede to these requests , the Directors to take steps to have the matter contested in the courts , and also to have a bill drawn up and presented to the Legislature to regulate elevator charges ; . also , that each member or firm in the association make up a statement of the amount of wheat each has stored in the elevators , that a detailed report of the losses by the order may be had . The committee appointed under resolutions to confer with the ? company consists of William S. Young , Charles D. Fisher , D. K rate , C. W. Baer , and 3 .
