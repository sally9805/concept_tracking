ARTICLE VII. - MANUAL TRAINING FOR BOYS IN THE PUBLIC SCIIOOLS. * AN old tradition of the iloheuzollern family requires that every son shall learn some handicraft . The present Crown Prince is a joiner ; one of his sons , if I am not mistaken , is a bookbinder ; and thus every member of that house . who ascends the throne of Prussia possesses , in addition to his military and literary education , a purely manual education in some mechanical art . If skill in joinery is thought essential to the education of a sovereign whose bank account is kept good by the income of estates and taxation , and the greater part of whose life is devoted to military , governmental , and ceremonial affairs , it would seem not extravagant to assume that a sovereign who earns his daily bread in the dull routine of industrial toil should be equipped with at least the rudiments of manual training , Yet it is only within a very few years that the question of supplying such an education to the fifty millions of sovereigns who rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save on an experimental scale , is still in the future . There is probably a good reason for this conservatism among our educators . Half a century ago the majority of the school children were the sons of farmers or small mechanics , who lived in the country towns . They attended school only a part of the year and were obliged to work with their parents the rest . In those days the family and the home made up what the school omitted . The boy was instructed by his father in whatever mechanical knowledge he himself possessed , while the girl gained , by assisting her mother , some acquaintance with * The author takes pleasure in ackowledging his indebtedness to Mr. Dutton , Superintendent of Schools of New Haven , to Messrs .

The common school supplied merely part of the child 's education and did its work well , because it did not pretend to supply more than a part . But the times have changed . The inhabitants of our cities , which in 1790 numbered only 3.3 per cent. , and which in 1820 had risen to but 4.9 per cent. , now form 22.5 per cent . of the population . The parents of a large proportion of our school children no longer live in the country , engaged in occupations in which each is his own master , but many of them live in crowded tenements in the cities and work in large factories , where they are called hands and count as merely human parts of the machines which they tend . Among this class of the population it is out of the question that the sons should get from their fathers any training whatever in the mechanical arts , while the girls must acquire but a very scanty knowledge of domestic economy from the pinched and cramped housekeeping carried on by their mothers . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new difficulty which has to be overcome by another advance , and it is undoubtedly true that the improvements in production which result from the introduction of steam power , and of machinery , and from the massing and specialization of labor , so characteristic of our time , have produced serious defects in the training of large portions of our population . The supplementary education which children formerly received at home is put beyond the reach of a large percentage of them at the present day , and though the common schools themselves make no change in their range of studies , though in their methods they may even make great progress , yet the change of circumstances is such that the children no longer get the kind of training that they used to have , and that they need . The state , whether for good or evil , finds itself called upon to enlarge its duties , in order to supply the wants of the young which the family no longer meets . And while those new conditions of industrial life are pressing their claims for recognition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining in the demand for a more physical and less abstract course of study . Thus the two interests , the pedagogic and the industrial meet on a common footing to urge a // change in the principles and methods of our public school system . That some kind of manual training is desirable , simply as a part of the general education of a child and not as a preparation for any particular career , is generally held by the most advanced thinkers of the day and has long been conceded by the practice of those who are able to afford it . Are not children whose parents have the requisite means constantly encouraged to engage in games and sports and the exercise of small handicrafts , which train the hand and the eye , perhaps without consciousness of effort on the part of the children ? As they grow older , does not every Christmas bring its quota of carpenter 's benches , printing presses , scroll saws , toy ships and engines , etc. , to develop the mechanical faculties of the boys , while the girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. ? If such exercises , pursued as a pastime , are thought useful and good , how much more valuable must they be when pursued with method . The whole tendency of modern education , since the days of Froebel , is to introduce more and more the training of the hand and the eye as a supplement to-nay , as the very groundwork of the training of the mind . It is claimed , and the claim seems reasonable , that such an education not only cultivates the skill of the members so trained , but that it aids materially in the acquisition of other knowledge ; that it develops observation ; that it assists especially the pupils who have little capacity for book-learning , but who frequently have decided mechanical aptitudes , by developing their latent faculties and giving them more self-reliance and courage ; and the knowledge gained of materials and processes is exceedingly useful to any one , whatever his future pursuit may be . But if some kind of manual training is a desirable element in any education , much more necessary is it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only justification for a gratuitous public school system , supported by taxation , is that it turns out good citizens and thus benefits society . A public school which strived simply to benefit the individual would be a failure , however great that benefit might be , unless // at the same time it benef1t*d society as a whole . A system might , for instance , be so framed as to give a boy an exaggerated and enthusiastic taste for reading ; it might lead him to spend all his spare moments in pouring other people 's thoughts through his own mind , but never incite him to take any interest in public affairs , or to contribute anything towards increasing the world 's stock of good and useful things . A public education which turned out human beings self-centered would be plainly indefensible , however much satisfaction the individuals immediately concerned might gain from it ; while that education is most valuable to society as a whole which cultivates the desire for creative work , the aptitude for cooperation , and a strict sense of what is right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual training is especially useful in a public school system . It develops a fondness for work ; it leads children to create , rather than to simply assimilate ; it strengthens the instinct of co-operation ; it brings out , in a more concrete and distinct manner than the dry maxims of abstract ethics , the difference between right and wrong ; and in doing this it incidentally gives the boys in our public schools educational elements which will be of especial use to them in the careers which they will necessarily follow . Let not this argument be misunderstood ; it is not claimed that the public schools ought to make carpenters or blacksmiths or farmers out of the boys ; on the contrary , they ought to preserve an absolute neutrality on the subject of the different trades and to carefully avoid being in any sense technical preparatory schools . But neither ought they to give a mental outfit out of harmony with these pursuits . If it is known that the majority of the children will necessarily engage in pursuits involving the use of their hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school ought to train these organs as well as the mind ; for , if it fails to do this , it is practically weakening the very means upon which the child will have to rely principally for his support . The fault can not be considered merely a negative fault of omission ; it is a positive fault , since too much attention given to one set of faculties weakens , not only relatively but absolutely , the other faculties . I am aware that some eminent educators do not take this view . A // distinguished authority recently said in one of our educational journals : " The critics of our educational system are never done with telling us that its results are to make the rising generation discontented with its lot , as if this were a defect rather than the greatest glory of an educational system . Man is immortal and has an infinite destiny ; this is the burden of religious teaching . In consequence of this Christian civilization strives towards heaven ; it subdues nature and makes natural forces toil for it and procures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drone out of his vocation and says to him : I do not want your mere bodily toil at any price ; I have a machine that can do such work better than the like of you can , and at less than you call starvation wages . Up , therefore , and acquire directive intelligence , so that you can direct and manage this machine and other machines , for presently we shall need no more mere hand labor but require all to be intelligent and directive . " * Whether Professor Harris 's view of Christian civilization is right or not , it certainly does not accord with the practice of the earliest Christians . The father of the founder of Christianity was a carpenter ; Paul was not ashamed of the trade of a tent-maker ; and Peter did not seem to consider himself degraded by going back to his fishing , even after he had acquired considerable prominence as a public exhorter . Peter did not even exercise as much " directive intelligence " as he might have done , for , instead of organizing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making up for its risks by a liberal insurance on his old boats , he was so imprudent as to personally encounter the perils of the waves , and did not hesitate , on one occasion , to jump into the water with his clothes on and help haul in the seine . The fact is that , though Christian civilization may strive towards heaven , the boys and girls who study in our schools usually live on the earth , and success in life on the earth is promoted much more by an ability and a willingness to grapple with the physical , concrete facts of our environment than by any attempt to soar above them through the magic of " direct . * Prof. W. T. Harris . in " Education " for May-June , 1883. // ive intelligence . " We already have as much " directive intelligence " as we can stand ; the number of speculators , organizers of schemes for making money out of government contracts , and other people who live by their wits , is quite large enough , and their careers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . There is no lack of incentive in this direction : let us rather look for the antidote . But perhaps this is not the kind of directive intelligence that Professor Harris has in mind . Perhaps he means the intelligence necessary to run a machine . If this is what he advocates , it may not be amiss to ask , if he has ever visited a cotton mill . Has he ever seen the large heads and stunted frames and pinched faces of the children who are exercising their " directive intelligence " in tending the spinning frames ? Has he ever seen the worn and haggard women , old before twenty , tending the looms ? If so , has he ever asked himself , whether the tending of a machine is or is not a more elevating occupation than the use of a tool ? The fact is that the benefits of most machines are conferred , not on those who tend them , but upon the consumer of their product , and it is precisely on account of the ever-increasing number of people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mannal education , which will give them other powers , and an intelligence , not directive but creative , is desired . Some machines , to be sure , require high intelligence , but those are precisely the ones that also require high manual skill . In short , if we try 40 elevate the lives of the children by shutting them off from manual training , we either condemn them to perform the most deadening kinds of mechanical work and prevent them from executing that which gives scope to thought and originality , or we drive them into the ranks of those who live by their wits . I do not say that boys should not be educated " out of their sphere , " because the phrase is misleading . But those who resent it as being something very horrible evidently do not understand what statisticians call the " law of great numbers . " I can not , for instance , predict that A. , B. , or C. will , during the year 1884 , forget to address a letter which he throws in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow limits how many undirected letters will be mailed in the post-offices of th' // United States . In the same way , I can not say that an individual boy is destined to be a day laborer , or a mechanic , or a bank president , or a poet , or a statesman , but I can say that of one million the great majority will become day laborers and mechanics , and a very small minority will become bank presidents , poets , and statesmen . This is a fact gained by observation . No one has the right to say that any human being has a sphere beyond which he ought not to step . But , on the other hand , no educator has the right to ignore the fact that the great mass of mankind are confined to a certain path in life by a law as relentless as that which keeps the planets in their orbits . There may be deviations to one side or the other of that path ; great social and economic catastrophes may even change its course . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men have to walk in it whether they like it or not , and it is no kindness to them to make them dissatisfied with what is inevitable . But the educational consideration is not the only one involved in this question . There is an economic side of the matter , which is of even greater importance , though it does not seem to have been as fully appreciated by those who have contributed to the discussion . It goes without saying that the boys who leave our public schools are very much influenced in their choice of an occupation , as far as they are able to exercise such a choice , by the ideas and aptitudes that they have imbibed at school ; for , though their general path is fixed , they can often choose what part of the path they will travel . If the instruction is such as to give a particular prestige to the study of books and to belittle the training of the hands , they will certainly enter upon life with a bias for occupations which exercise chiefly the brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual dexterity , and if they have acquired a slight acquaintance with tools , they will be more ready and more willing to adopt a mechanical career . Now we can hardly realize the responsibility that rests upon the managers of our public schools , unless we consider the immense body of human beings whose lives may be shaped more or less by their theories . The number of children enrolled in the public schools of the United States in 1881 was 9,860,333. // The great majority of these were in the lower grades . In New ilaven less than five per cent . of the children who enter the public schools graduate from the high school ; and President Thompson , of Rose Polytechnic Institute , states that some years ago he found the number of pupils in the high schools of Massachusetts to be less than four per cent . of the whole number. * It has been estimated by Superintendent llinsdale that of 108 pupils who enter the primary department in Cleveland , sixty complete the primary course , twenty the grammar school , four go as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one graduates from the high school . The average age of pupils withdrawing from the public schools of St. Louis is 13* years.t Thus , though a large number of pupils probably fall off on account of sickness or death , it may be fairly assumed that a majority leave the schools , because they are obliged to do something towards earning their own living . Over a million children between the ages of 10 and 16 years were engaged in some kind of lucrative work in 1880 . These children , in most cases , are obliged to do whatever offers itself first . They have , as a rule , no particular aptitudes beyond those that they have acquired at school , con* sequently they naturally go into occupations in which their school education is of most value , that is to say , those which do not require manual skill but simply an elementary education ; they become factory hands , office boys , etc. , while the more fortunate ones who can stay longer at school become clerks , book-keepers , salesmen , etc . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , while the market for skilled mechanics is often barely supplied and wages comparatively high , in spite of the large annual immigration from Europe . It can not , of course , be claimed that the public schools are alone responsible for this state of things . Social forces without doubt act very powerfully . Most people prefer an occupation which is clean and quiet , which involVes no great muscular exertion , and which enables them to wear good clothes , to one which is sooty and unpleasant and hard . But , if a given cause * High School Index , February 9 , 1884 , page 39. * Professor C. M. Woodward in " Education " for Jan. - Feb. , 1884. // tends to produce a certain effect , and if in any place we find both the cause and the effect present , it is only fair to assume that the effect is due , in part , at least , to the cause , even though other causes may also have contributed to produce it ; and even though but a small proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice of a pursuit by the training of the schools , yet the number of persons in the aggregate who are influenced thereby is very large . It must be remembered that the public schools have a power and hence a responsibility that private and self-sustaining schools do . not have . The law of supply and demand reacts upon the private schools immediately , and if there ceases to be a demand for the particular kind of education that they furnish , it shows itself speedily in their receipts , and a change is made to meet the new demand . But the pupils who attend the public schools have , as a rule , no choice ; they must take that education or none , and the managers have , therefore , no such test of the usefulness of their work . If , then , these schools have the power of influencing the careers of their graduates , as we have assumed , they have the power of influencing the rates of wages in large departments of industry , and they have a power upon which there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint excepting the wisdom and insight of the managers . The fact is that in our public school system we have a species of what would be called in Europe " state socialism "  --  a socialism of which its administrators are , perhaps , themselves not fully conscious , and the exercise of which is , for that reason , all the more beset with dangers . And the more the teachers of our schools codperate and hold conventions and contribute to periodicals and become acquainted with each othe9s methods , the greater , in short , the tendency towards uniformity in the public school systems of different States , the greater , of course , the results of any false policy that they may agree upon . Hence it is necessary to regard carefully all the effects , even remote , of the system and to correct the economic as well as the pedagogic evils that may be hidden in it . For that very reason , however , one must be especially cautious in making suggestions for practical execution in the // schools and especially slow about adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with an existing system , which , though it may have its faults , has yet served us well for many a decade , than to rush into new experiments , of whose dangers we are not yet fully aware . Let us , therefore , instead of endeavoring to suggest any specific change in our common school system , first look at some of the experiments which have tried to carry out , on a small scale , the general principles here advocated . The most important of the pioneers of manual instruction is the Free Workingman 's School , on Fifty-fourth street , New York . This is a private charity , but it aims to cover in its curriculum the years covered by the ordinary grammar schools and to give its pupils essentially the same education . It draws its pupils , too , from the same classes from which the grammar schools are mainly recruited . Thus , whatever results are reached in this school in New York will apply equally to grammar schools in other large cities . The principles and theories on which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adler in the Prince*on Review , but its practical methods are , we believe , not so widely known . The school was opened in 1879 . Its course is intended to cover eight years , but thus far only five classes have been organized ; three-eighths of the scheme exist , therefore , as yet only on paper . In the plan followed there , industrial or manual education begins with the very first year , that is to say , with children seven or eight years of age . The material they work upon is at first only clay , and their exercises are very simple ; they are employed chiefly in cutting small slabs of clay into geometrical forms with even edges , and in carving out upon the surface other geometrical forms . From these they are led to learn concretely and by actual trial a great many of the fundamental principles of Geometry . The clay work occupies two hours a week for the first two years . As the children 's hands become stronger and more skillful , they take up a harder material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the principles of plane Geometry ; in their pasteboard studies they are obliged to construct solids , and , having constructed // them , to analyze them and study their properties . This is a lesson in drawing as well as cutting , for they are obliged first to draw the objects and afterwards to reproduce them from their own drawings . After this the children are promoted to wood and again are obliged , while using the chisel and saw in the production of geometrical forms , to ascertain the mathematical truths which those forms illustrate . They are then led to perform more difficult manipulations , such as using a lathe in making handles for their tools , making wheels and carts , small pieces of furniture , and a variety of articles . In the latter years of the course , which have not as yet been entered upon , it is expected to initiate the scholars into the properties of iron , to teach them how to make various things out of metal , and even how to draw and construct from their own drawing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical side of man nal education ; the artistic side is cultivated simultaneously by free-hand drawing and modeling in clay , and all this goes on side by side with the regular studies of the common school system . At first sight one gets the impression that more is put upon the children than they can possibly master , but the principal of this school has assured me that under this system the children acquire more easily and more effectually than under the ordinary system , and that , far from being backward in their regular studies , they are actually assisted in them by the attention given to manual work . He says that a comparison between the pupils of this school and those of similar grades of the public schools shows that the former are not able to quote as many rules by memory as the latter , but that , when called upon to do anything that involves the application of the rule , they are very ready , while the latter are almost helpless . This is , probably , the most complete experiment in this direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it involves are rapidly being taken up by the managers of our public schools , and have been applied in a number of cases , though in a fragmentary and incomplete manner . Instruction in carpentry , was established in the public schools in Gloucester , Mass. , in the fall of 1880 , the necessary funds // July ; . being supplied by private benevolence . In December , 1881 , classes were organized in the Dwight School in Boston , and in New Haven two of the grammar schools ( the Dwight and Skinner Schools ) started similar classes last falL The methods followed in these three cities seem to be essentially the same ; a description of what is being done in New Haven will , therefore , serve equally well as a description of what is done in Boston and Gloucester . New methods of instruction have for some time found a home in the New Haven schools , a great deal of attention being devoted , especially in the yonnger classes , to object teaching , and the instruction in drawing being carried to a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of manual training . A further step was taken last fall , when two of the grammar schools were allowed to introduce instruction in the use of carpenters ' tools . As the school board appropriated only one hundred dollars for this purpose for the two schools , the experiment could not have been tried , were it not for the private enterprise and enthusiasm of the principals of these schools , assisted by the public spirit and skill of their respective janitors , who happen to be practical mechanics and are willing to take charge of the classes at a remuneration at which it would be impossible to engage a regular teacher . In each of these schools a portion of the basement has been set aside as a carpenter 's shop and fitted up with a dozen carpenters ' benches , each one equipped with a set of simple tools , chiefly hammers , saws , planes , chisels , bits , and braces . One of them has a turning lathe , which has been put in by the janitor . The equipment is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sufficient to accommodate more than a small fraction of the scholars . The principals , therefore , have adopted the plan of selecting twelve of the best pupils from the higher classes . This squad of twelve works in the shop for an hour on three days of the week ; a similar squad is selected to occupy the alternate days . The exercises are intended merely to give the boys a fair knowledge of the principal carpenter 's tools , the first lesson teaching them simply how to strike a square blow with a // hammer . For this purpose a board is ruled into squares , and the pupil is required to strike with a hammer in the center of one of these squares , the indentation made by the head showing whether the blow has been struck evenly and in the proper place . The next step is to learn how to drive a nail , to set a nail , and to do all kinds of fancy nailing . Little by little the pupil is taught to use a jack plane ; to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square edge on a board . Soon he learns the use of the chalk line , then of the saw . Then he learns how to chamfer ; he then begins to make mortises ; and thus , little by little , he masters the principal elementary operations of the carpenter . These classes have as yet been at work only a few months in our public schools , and yet the boys have already learned how to make picture frames , boxes , and other simple pieces of joinery with great neatness . While the members of this select class are working in the basement , their fellows are engaged in the regular school room exercises up-stairs , so that their gain in manual skill might , at first sight , seem to be made at the expense of a loss in the studies of the school . The principals have assured me , however , that no falling off has as yet been perceptible in the scholarship of the ' boys who work in the shop . As in most cases the best scholars are selected for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship ) , it is natural that they should be able to iuake up by extra study what they lose of the school room exercises . But it is the opinion of their teachers that they not only make up what they lose but more than make it up ; that is to say , that they do better in their studies for spending part of their time in manual labor . This judgment is confirmed by the statement made by the principal of the Dwight School , in Boston , at the end of the first year 's experiment of manual labor in that institution , He says : " I consider that the results go far to prove that manual training is so great a relief to the iteration of the school work , that it is a positive benefit , rather than a detriment , to the course of the other studies . " This verdict agrees also with the judgment of Mr. Bamberger , of the Workiugman 's School , in New York . It will // be noticed , however , that the experiment tried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on in New York , because only one set of tools is used by the children , only the larger children take part in the work , and , again , only a select few of those larger children ; so that manual training is in no sense an essential element of the instruction ; it is an appendage , rather than a part of the fiber , of the common school system . But , while the experiments that have been tried in the direction of manual training fully confirm the belief in its value , founded upon general principles , they also suggest certain dangers , which must be guarded against , and certain limitations , to which such training is necessarily subject . The greatest danger is that the instruction well be one-sided and will thus fall into the very error which we have criticised in the present methods . The experiments that have been tried in New Haven and Boston are not free from this criticism . If the pupils are instructed exclusively in the use of carpenters* tools , there can be no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters rather than anything else , and , though the effect of this may be very small in each individual , or even in each school , the effect , if the system were carried out all over the country , would undoubtedly be quite considerable , and the complaints which are now made against the competition of prison labor would soon be heard against the inordinate production of carpenters in our public schools . In order that the instruction should be free from this great danger , it should be carried on in a number of different materials and should be so incorporated with the other instruction as not to produce in the pupils the consciousness of any special training for special vocations . A serious limitation in any new move in this direction is the expense . The experiments that have been tried in New Haven have been carried out under especially favorable circumstances , the janitors of the schools in which manual training is given being willing to give their services for very little , and the plan being carried through by the public spirit of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general feature of our schools without large cost . Mr. Page , of the Boston Dwight // School , estimates the cost of instructing two hundred boys in the elements of joinery , two hours a week for one year , at $1,650 , or $8.25 for each pupil . If to this we add the interest on the plant required , we should have to allow an annual outlay of $8.50 for each pupiL On this estimate such training , if introduced into the public schools of New Haven for all boys between 10 and 16 years of age , would amount to nearly $20,000 a year , and even then we should take no account of the outlay necessary for increased room . At present the work in carpentering is carried on in a part of the basement not otherwise used . It is probable that the general introduction of such training would necessitate additional school room ; certainly , if it were introduced with anything like the completeness attained in the New York Workingman 's School , the necessary addition to our school accommodations would be very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate calculation of just what additional room would be needed , but the clay work iequires a room to itself , and so does the work in carpentering and turning , and it is very desirable that a separate room be set apart for drawing . These rooms can be made to do duty for a large number of pupils by allowing them to be occupied in rotation by different classes and thus kept in use the greater part of the day . But we should probably have to allow for every grammar school two or three additional rooms to be used exclusively for these purposes . It is not to be expected , therefore , that so radical a change will be introduced at once , and it is to be hoped that , before our public schools commit themselves irrevocably to industrial training , experience will have suggested methods by which its results may b* obtained at a less expense . There are many questions allied to this one and , in fact , intimately connected with it , that can not he enlarged upon within the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , like the Manual Training School of Washington University , Saint Louis , in which the boys are prepared distinctively foi the career of mechanics . ' The establishment of such schools as a part of the common school system has been discussed a good deal in Boston and met with much // July , favor there , such men as President Walker and Professors IRunkle and Ordway , of the Institute of Technology , strongly advocating the plan . A discussion of this subject would take us beyond our present limits . It must be noticed , however , that if the state endeavors to establish technical schools , it undertakes a task very different from that of managing the common schools , and one of which the justification is much more difficult . It is generally agreed that the State ought to furnish such an education as will turn out good citizens , but whether it ought at the same time to turn out good carpenters and good machinists , is another question . Another allied topic is the manual education of girls . This subject presents peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations open to women , outside of housekeeping and the care of a family , is comparatively smalL Of the 18,025,627 females over ten years of age returned in the census of 1880 , only 2,647,157 , or about one-seventh , were put down as having some gainful occupation , and of these nearly one million were household servants , while of the males about seven-niuths were earning money . The majority of women , therefore , are occupied with household duties in homes of their own , and we must assume that the education which will be of most value to the greatest number is an education framed with reference to such duties . To introduce any training in them into a public school is , however , a matter of great difficulty . The gentlemen who have with so much devotion and enthusiasm introduced manual training for boys into the public schools of New Haven have not shrunk from establishing a parallel course for girls , and while the twelve best boys are working at their carpenters ' benches in the cellar , the twelve best girls are engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in cooking , but as our school buildings are not yet furnished with the appliances of a first-class restaurant , these studies have necessarily been conducted by the girls in their own homes , and the school has acted simply in the capacity of an examining board . The examination then takes the form of a lunch served up to the school board and the friends of new methods in education by the young ladies of the school . While education in these branches is useful , the range which // it can occupy is necessarily limited , and the difficulties connected with its practical instruction are numerous . It is certainly very desirable that the girls who visit the public school should acquire a fondness and an aptitude for household duties . The matter is of vital social importance , the health and wellbeing of those who may become their husbands and of the children that they may bring into the world being dependent upon such knowledge to a degree that is , perhaps , not commonly appreciated by those who suffer most from its absence ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discussed in this place . When the problem of supplying the boys with the needed forms of manual training has been satisfactorily solved , our educators will be better prepared to attack the equally important problem of making good housewives of the girls .
