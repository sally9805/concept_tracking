txt School District No. 3 is situated . in a thickly-populated locality here . The majority of the parents of the pupils are members of the Roman Catholic Church . In this district last night an acrimonious annual sohool meeting was held , and a very lively election for School Trustees followed this after . noon . At the school meeting the Hon. James G. Lindsley , ex-Congresstuan , was unanimously chosen Chairman . The large cement works in which he is interested pays a heavy proportion of the taxes in the district . The main bone of contention was the fact that there never has been a fully-detailed account of expenses rendered , and also that the district supports a school over which three Franciscan Brothers are in control and in which pupils belonging outside of the district are permitted to attend and receive tuition free of charge . The opponents of tills course of procedure said that it . entailed an enormous extra expense upon the district and that it was contrary to the American school system . The friends of the brothers ' school maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter not being large enough to accommodate all the pupils who wish to attend . Mr. Lindsley , as Chairman , could of course take no part in the discussion and he is credited with having ruled fairly . At the election of Trustees this afternoon there was the largest attendance of voters on record . When the ballot box was opened it was found that it had been stalled , and an exciting , wordy war followed . It was finally decided to destroy the excess of ballots over the names on the registry list , which was done . The result of the election as declared to-night shows that the friends of the Franciscan Brothers are largely in the majority in the district . The opponents of the branch school say they will carry the matter before the State Superintendent of Public Schools . It is not alleged that the Franciscan Brothers are inefficient or that there is anything wrong with the school , but that the system is un-American and expensive .               @ @ @ @ @ @
