txt A Dublin dispatch says : " The appointment of Earl Cowper as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland has taken the public by surprise , but his property in Ireland and per ' sonal associations commend him to Irishmen , while the fact that he is reported as a politician of mild type will make him acceptable to the Conservative gentry . He is certain to meet with a respectful and generous reception from all classes . A majority of those who co-operate with the Liberals approve the selection of the Right Hon. William E Forster for the Chief Secretaryship for Ireland , while the Nationalists and Home Rulers , who remember his firm attitude rage rling obstruction , are not so well satisfied . His capacity for dealing with the education controversy , which is by no means settled , is likely to be tried severely . " Arrangements are making for a general meeting of Home Rulers in Dublin before the reassembling of Parliament , on the 20th inst. , to decide upon the respective merits of fixity of tenure and peasant proprietary , in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government at an early date . The Pall Mall Gazette in its issue this afternoon editorially says : " It will be our boast to judge each question on its merits as it rises ; to have neither party no programme , and to ' keep true to our old traditions of liberty and independence . " George Smith , of the firm of Smith , Elder &; Co. , and who owned the Pall Mall Gazette , assigned it to his son-in-law , Henry Yates Thompson , who was private secretary to the Viceroy in Ireland under the last Liberal Government . Mr. Greenwood 's letter explains that he was invited to continue as editor but with the condition that the principles of the paper must be those of Mr. Thompson . The letter continues : " Mr. Thompson proposed that the paper should give general support to the new Administration . As this is a vague expression , I advanced three questions , and asked how I should be expected to deal with them : The enfranchisement of the agricultural laborer ? It must be advocated , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately proclaimed ? It must be supported , was the reply . The disestablishment of the English Church ? It must be no longer opposed was the answer . If Mr. Thompson had anything to do with the Pall Mall . Gazette , it ap- peared to me unnecessary to inquire further . I declined to do anything of the sort , and so it is that by a transaction the nature of which ( though I have proprietorial rights in the journal ) I am not allowed to know anything at all of , I cease to be editor of the Pall Mall Gazette . As to the men who did me the honor to associate themselves with me , they go with me , all being men of conviction , and angry at and ashamed of what has been done . But we do not purpose to allow our independent little paper to ' be extinguished . Its spirit resides in us , and it shall soon reappear in new shape , and with all the latest improvements . " The House of Commons has appointed a committee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) elected for Northamp-ton , to make affirmation instead of taking the usual oath of members . Lord Charles Bruelnell-Bruce , ( moderate Liberal , ) re-elected to Parliament for Marlborough , has been appointed Vice-Chamberlain.
