txt The whole question of yacht design , accepting for the moment speed as the aim we seek , hinges upon obtaining the most favorable relation between resistance to passage through the water and the driving- power necessary to overcome that resistance . Whatever may be thought of the Scotch cutter Madge on other counts , the fact can no longer be disputed that she has shown a speed and weatherliness in smooth water and light winds at least equal to the sloop , while in even a quite moderate sea she so easily romped away from the pick of our light draughts that the palm must be awarded to the cutter . The principles followed by designers in Great Britain and the customs in vogue in our own building yards are radically different ; in fact , the very antipodes of one another . The Americans , influenced to a great degree by the necessities of river and bay sailing incidental to the sport in its infancy , have followed the plan of enlarging upon the model found suitable in youthful days . The open shifting-ballast boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " house , " offering accommodations limited in length and head-room . From this beginning additional wealth and leisure have combined in the production of larger craft , until finally the shoal wide model has been expanded into the stately sloops and schooners of the present fleet . The builders abroad have been led by other purposes . Accustomed from the very beginning to the demands of cruising at sea , their aim has been to produce as fast a vessel as they knew how consistent with that safety and stability which a real life at sea imperatively requires . While we , believing ourselves unfettered by any such considerations , have had speed and nothing but speed in view , the foreigner has had to face continually the far more difficult problem of combining Loth speed and safety . Under these circumstances , aided in a groat measure by the historic victory of the schooner America some thirty years ago , and more recently by the victories of the Sappho and Columbia , a profound faith in our superiority had grown up only to be very rudely shaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuously held that light displacement and light draught were the prime necessities for speed , and that no fixed keel amid ever hope to equal the centre-board in efficiency . It has been maintained  --  and favorite doctrines they were with the old school  --  that great virtues were inherent in boats " sailing upon their bottoms , " that wide , shoal boats could carry their sail longer than others , that they were drier , abler , and faster in a sea ; in short , that our sloop was perfection and that other types could not but be inferior in just so far as they differed from the American standard . Fortunately for the future of naval design in America , the Madge appeared in the nick of time , and by the exhibition she made of us in a short three days swept away all the musty nonsense of the old faith . Had the notions prevailing five minutes before the first races with the cutter been founded in truth , not only should the Madge have been beaten , but she should have been fairly sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , settled the matter , for it became evident at once that the little cutter was a wonder . So all our tenets upon which we had been building for thirty years slipped from under in scarce ten minutes . In the series of races which followed we have learned that narrow , deep boats are as fast , carry their sail longer , are better in a seaway , safer , easier , snugger than the sloop . To those versed in modern naval science the explanation of the cutter 's fine sailing is not hard to find . Experiments and investigations of the most exhaustive and delicate kind ' nave been made by the late Mr. FROUDE , tested in actual practice , and generally received among the shipbuilders and naval architects of Europe . These go to show that neither displacement nor draught are in any way an index of resistance , but that form and the area wet by the water are the real measures to be considered . ' The correctness of these deductions has again received most conclusive proof in the victories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molded , however , into a very fine form by adopting considerable depth and length and small beam . She is 38 feet 9 inches long on the load line , 7 feet 9 inches beam , and 6 feet G inches deep , virtually , it may be said , like an elongated match-box standing on edge . Owing to her small beam , little opposition is experienced by the water in passing around the body into the wake ; so much less than in the sloop that , while the latter was driving large waves off her bows . the cutter was passing through without creating as much as a ripple . The waves sent off from the sloop indicated clearly a waste of power , a useless plowing up of the water from below , and piling it above the natural level of the sea . It is probable that the area a wet skin in the cutter is larger than that of the sleep , and that the consequent excess of friction , the second principal element of resistance , was against the foreign boat . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for running , so the economy in wavemaking which the cutter displayed proved more than enough to make up for a loss from the other cause . This superiority becomes even morn apparent if we bear in mind that the cutter is driven with smaller sails than the sloop , the areas comparing as 9 and 11 respectively . The cutter 's topsail was larger by a quarter , but the difference will not materially modify the proportions given . The British designer has , therefore , carried the day in bringing about the most favorable relation between resistance and the driving power . His sails are smaller than ours , but he has far less to overcome in proportion . The snugger the rig the more preferable for other reasons as well . Can the cutter carry her sails as well as the wide-beamed sloop l Yes is the answer . The races can be cited in proof , In fair , whole-sail breezes the cutter actually heeled less than the sloop . In a lower sail blow she held on to her topsail to advantage when the sloop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light canvas . In a reefing wind the cutter heeled more , but at the same time showed more sail than the sloop , and , what is of more importance , left the latter rapidly in her wake . In a seaway , the boasted capacities of the sloop vanished . The cutter launched through everything , keeping up a high rate of speed , while the wide shoal craft was tossed and thrown about , a pitiful and helpless object . The cutter could readily beat off in a gale , when the sloop would drift and chop ashore . But the cutter was wet . She certainly was . There is , however , no difference between " wet " and " wetter . " The sloop was wet , her cockpit halffull of water , and things drowned out below . The cutter dipped her nose a trifle deeper , took a few buckets over the bows , and quietly ran it out over the lee quarter . The sloop was wet by - smashing into the sea  --  the cutter by gently dipping . There was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , no difference in " wetness . " The cutter shook all clear in an instant . The sloop had the sea sloshing about her decks and cockpit to a disagreeable extent . As to the question of pointing , the cutter was much the better of the two , as her sails are incomparable in style and fit . In the very important quality of weatherliness again was the cutter ahead . The vaunted superiority of the centre-board for hanging on found no support in fact . The cutter held her wind far better than any of her competitors . As a racing yacht the shoal wide centre-board sloop came out second best . There remains but one more comparison to make , the cruising efficiency of the two types . With a locker for cruising sails only , the length of the accommodations in the Madge can be taken at 30 feet . Those of the sloop would be practically confined to the length of the cabin-house , about 15 feet , or just onehalf that of her rival . In depth , the cutter has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is where she fails . Now add two feet to the beam of the Madge , and she would become practically as stiff in all weathers as the sloop , have ample floor in the cabin , double the available room down below , and three times the room on deck . Her draught ca n easily be reduced to 6 or 6 ; 4 feet , not a bit too much for legitimate yachting , and less than possessed by the modern keel sloop . In such shape she would be uncapsizable , retain her superiority in a sea , need cost no more , quality for quality , than the dangerous , overgrown , fair weather toys in vogue , whose days now seem numbered . Size for size , the cutter of narrow beam will carry the day in racing , and her sister of more moderate form exactly suits the wants of the cruising yachtsman . These are the types we should build up to in the future . These are the types we must build up to if we wish to retain our waning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup is not to leave our shores for a very long time to come .
