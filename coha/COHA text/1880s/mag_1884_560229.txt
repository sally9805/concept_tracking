Th a former paper the writer suggested a remedy for the evils of State repudiation , viz. : the assumption by the general Government of the debts of the delinquent commonwealths , with a brief and incomplete argument in its support . His object was to direct attention to the measure proposed , and elicit , as far as possible , an expression concerning it from those who usually give voice to public opinion . In that purpose he has been reasonably successful . It is a somewhat curious feature of the discussion that newspapers representing the German and other foreign elements among us should seem more sensitive to the honor of the country and more favorably inclined to the remedy proposed than the native or " English-speaking " journals , many of which have appeared to resent the imputation that we , as a nation , might be open to the charge of dishonesty because of so small a matter as a failure to pay between three and four hundred millions of public indebtedness . The most frequently urged objection was thus formulated by a New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how wide a door he would open into the national treasury . Why should the Government stop with the debts of the States ? Why not go on and help out defaulting towns and cities ? Why not take care of the debts of sundry weak-backed railway companies , whose creditors would be very glad of its interference ? Why not settle for the late enterprising firm of Grant &amp; Ward ? " In reply , it is enough to say that , in the cases of delinquent towns and cities and railway companies , and of such unfortunate houses as Grant &amp; Ward , the Government has already made ample provision in behalf of creditors . It has created courts , with judges and sheriffs and receivers , and thrown their doors wide open , that those having demands may come in and secure all they are entitled to receive . If it had done the same thing for creditors of defaulting States , to whom it is certainly under 563 // equal obligation , they would have no right to ask anything more . But here is where " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold unsatisfied claims against States no legal means of redress . Why this is so , it may be well enough briefly to explain . The popular idea is , that States can not be sued by individuals , because they are sovereign bodies , and as such enjoy the immunity resulting from that old legal fiction - a veritable relic of barbarism - that " the King can do no wrong . " The makers of our Government , however , entertained no such antiquated idea . They had no respect for kings and their traditional privileges . They provided that States could be sued on a money demand , like anybody else , as was decided by the United States Supreme Court , in 1792 , in the case of Chisholm vs . Georgia , 2d Dallas 's Reports . In that case , through Justice Wilson , the Court says : " A State , like a merchant , makes a contract . A dishonest State , like a dishonest merchant , refuses to discharge it . The latter is amenable to a court of justice , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned to answer the fair demand of its creditor , be permitted , Proteus-like , to assume a new appearance , and to insult him and justice by declaring , I am a sovereign State ? " That is precisely what nearly one-third of our States are now saying to their creditors . The ruling in the Chisholm case produced a sensation amounting almost to a panic . The people in that day were poor , and public burdens were oppressive . The general Government had assumed the legitimate debts of the States growing out of the war for national independence ; but numerous claims-like that of John Hook , so severely anathematized by Patrick Henry-remained unsettled , and the popular apprehension suggested innumerable suits and judgments against the States , to be followed by onerous taxes . To cut off these objectionable war-claims , , the Eleventh Amendment to the Federal Constitution , which inhibits an individual from suing a State , was hurriedly submitted and adopted . That was the only purpose of the measure ; the possibility of a State taking advantage of it as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a cowardly remedy , as well as most inequitable , since the State was still left with power to sue the citizen . To avoid the appearance of repudiation , an indirection and a technicality were resorted to , and an important permanent principle was sacrificed to a questionable expediency. // It will thus be seen that the government and people of the whole country , and not the government and people of the delinquent States merely , are responsible for the absence of a proper legal remedy in behalf of the holders of dishonored State paper , and for what must be admitted to be a serious defect in our organic national system . Every government is under obligation to protect the property of its subjects . Money demands are property . If we can not collect pecuniary debts that are justly due us , for lack of adequate legal machinery and power , we do not enjoy the benefits that a thoroughly good government would provide . The foregoing facts would seem to furnish a sufficient argument for the general Government 's standing between the creditor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for the same conclusion that should not be overlooked . First . That portion of the debt in question which is popularly known by the designation of " carpet-bag , " was really created by the general Government in the names of the States , through agents of its appointment . It was a fungus that grew under the shelter of the national authority . Most certainly the people of the States did not authorize it ; and it is , perhaps , not altogether uniatnral that they should object to taking care of it . Doubtless the States are legally bound for the payment of bonds that their organizations were used to create , and equitably bound , as they received most of the benefits ; but does that exempt the general Government from responsibility for its share of the business ? On which the greater obligation rests , may be a nice question ; but it is very plain that the bond-purchaser , who paid out his money in good faith , ought not to lose his investment because he has a valid claim on two parties instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the other should not for that reason be excused from doing so . Nor are the holders of the " carpet-bag " bonds the only losers through the general Government 's action in this matter . Those debts have caused heavy losses on other bonds . They have furnished the pretext for most of those outrageous robberies , under the names of compromises , settlements , and re-adjustments , through which perfectly valid claims have been cut down from forty to eighty-five cents on the dollar . They have done the repudiating States no harm , because they have not been paid , but , on the contrary , have been the means of reduc // ing their other debts . In fact , the " carpet-bag " bonds have been of immense service to the repudiation movement . Its leaders have used them to fire the souls of their followers - who have rarely troubled themselves with nice discriminations - against all State liabilities . They have used them to figure up a grand total of indebtedness , and so have worked on the fears or compassion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender their holdings at heavy discounts . They have used them to make apologists of outsiders , who have very generally supposed , from the clamor about " carpet-bag * bonds , that all , or nearly all , the discarded State obligations were of that description . But for the " carpet-bag " bonds , it is quite safe to say that most , if not all , of the derelict States would long since have resumed payment in full , as was done by Missouri , which was among the most heavily debt-laden States of the South , as well as one of the greatest sufferers from the war , but escaped a provisional government and a fresh bond issue at the close of the war . AS*econd . The proceeds of the rejected bonds have mostly been used in constructing railroads that have become necessary links in great national highways . These roads are as truly national worka as the Union Pacific , to build which , and a good many private fortunes with it , the Government supplied the money . The argument on this point has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article called out by the writer 's former paper , in the following words : " Most of the old State debts were contracted under the reign of the State-rights heresy , when it was held that only States could engage in works of internal improvement , and that every such improvement must begin and end within State lines . It is now known that such improvements derive their chief value as links only of larger chains that bind together States , countries , and even continents . " Third . That the general Government has , by means of official patronage bestowed upon active and notorious leaders in the repudiation movement , given essential aid and comfoit to that movement in all the defaulting States , and strengthened and widened the sentiment upon which it rests , is matter of history . Fourth . Without the protection of the general Government in the course they have taken , the States could not have repudiated to anything like the extent they have . No princi // pie of international law is better established than that when States contract debts with citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter have the right to compel payment , even with the sword . There have been plenty of recent practical illustrations of the doctrine ; the United States have furnished some of them , particularly in enforcing demands of their citizens against Central and South American republics . The Alabama business was an exemplification of the principle referred to . Only a short time ago , we almost got into serious trouble with another government over a shadowy guano claim in which one of our citizens was supposed to have an interest . Our States have issued their bonds and sold them to citizens of other countries . Why have they not been made to pay them ? Everybody knows it is because the general Government gives them its protection . But for that shelter , the State of Mississippi , which sold most of its bonds in England , would long ago have been under a British protectorate , in the interest of bond creditors , as Egypt is to-day . American States are the only sovereign or semi-sovereign powers in all the wide world that treat their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to respect . They are the only powers of that sort in all the wide world that dare to do so . Their position is most unique ; they can not be reached by the local law , and made to pay like other debtors that have the ability , because they are exempt from local law processes ; they can not be reached by the international law , because the general Government stands between them and their creditors ' governments . Secure behind the nation 's authority , they sit back and laugh to scorn the men whose money they have received , and who hold their sealed and solemn instruments . If responsibility and liability go hand in hand , as they are supposed to do , in what position does this state of things place our national Government ? Can it be instrumental in preventing creditors- citizens of its own country , to which it owes something , and citizens of other countries - from collecting their rightful dues , and incur no moral accountability ? Can it be honest and irresponsible , while furnishing a shield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered only propositions based on equity ; but there are motives of policy that should not be omitted . First . The public interest . Like all new countries in course of development , America has had to get much of her working // capital from abroad , and she must expect to do so for many years to come . The usury she will be compelled to concede will depend upon the condition of her credit- not so much for ability to pay , for that can hardly be questioned , as for the integrity of her people . Every American railway company , or canal company , or land-improvement company , that offers its paper in foreign markets , either because sufficient investment capital can there alone be found , or in the hope of obtaining cheap money , must pay forfeit for the damaged standing of the defaulting States ; and when we bear in mind that the funded indebtedness of our railways alone amounts to three and a half billions of dollars , and their capital stock to three billions , eight hundred millions more , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doubled , we can form some idea of what the penalty must be . If the delinquent communities sustained the loss , or the major portion of it , their misfortune would hardly be a subject for mourning ; but , unhappily , the principal damage falls on those sections of the country that supply the great projecting and constructing syndicates , as well as much of the capital they operate with , and which , knowing its value , try to maintain an untarnished record . The defalcation of Virginia and Tennessee does not hurt Virginia and Tennessee one-tenth as much as it hurts New York and Massachusetts , that faithfully pay every penny they owe . It is true that the world , in such cases , ought to discriminate sharply between the guilty and the innocent ; but it is just as true that it never has done so , and that it probably never will . Second . The national honor . Here , again , the world ought to draw the line impartially between those commonwealths that pay what they owe and those that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever take that trouble . The twelve States that are in default number nearly one-third of those composing the Union , and supply one-fourth of the population of the country , and when so many members of our national family forfeit their good names , the rest of the household must suffer from the relationship . The mere fact of non-payment by an indebted community is not all , nor the worst ; it is not half so damaging to the public credit as the methods that have been resorted to in the course of repudiation . The various successive steps taken by Virginia to cut down and get rid of her debt , make a record far more disreputable than a simple refusal to pay would have been . The latest expedient to which she has resorted is the // most disgraceful of all . That has been the monthly expenditure , by direction of her Legislature , of a large amount of money to buy in her outstanding compromised obligations . First she scales down her debt nearly half , and then , when she has so blackened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ftfty cents on the dollar , she buys it in at the current discount , using for the purpose money  --  the ability to raise which shows that she does not default through poverty - that ought to go to the interest of her bonds . What the national credit has suffered in the past , and is now suffering from repudiation methods , may be expected to continue as long as there is a dishonored State debt . There will be a continuous struggle between the wronged creditors and the defaulting commonwealths , the one trying to secure and the other to defeat a settlement , and each entirely too ready to appeal to sharp and demoralizing expedients , including overtures , more or less direct , to the cupidity of legislatures and courts . In fact , as long as there is a defaulted State bond in circulation , it is liable to be an instrument of speculation , litigation , corruption , and scandal . Third . The public morals . It is not to be supposed that the States can , year after year , pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the conduct of their subordinate communities and their individual subjects . Most appropriately does Justice Field say , in a dissenting opinion in one of the cases in which our Supreme Court has upheld repudiating legislation : " If the Government will not keep its faith , little better can be expected from the citizen . If contracts are not observed , no property will , in the end , be respected ; and all history shows that rights of persons arc unsafe when property is insecure . Protection to one goes with protection to the other , and there can be neither prosperity nor progress where this foundation of all just government is unsettled . " The severest reproach to-day attaching to Americans as a people is their indifference to public obligations . Fifty years ago , such a thing as a city or a county or a township issuing and negotiating its bonds without faithfully providing for their payment , would not have been thought of ; but now , judging from the number of such communities that , on the slightest of pretexts , or no pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be // inferred that , outside of leading commercial centers where public credit is a necessity to business , very few of our bonded municipalities would pay a dollar of their debts if the interference of the courts could be escaped . Nothing is more notorious than that citizens who would scorn to be suspected of a disposition to shirk their private engagements , will publicly and unblushingly favor repudiation on the part of the State , or city , or county in which they live . In that regard , they seem to recognize no moral or honorary obligation as attaching to them personally . Indeed , that is a proposition publicly proclaimed and maintained . Not long ago there was a convention in the State of Missouri , made up of delegates from the different local communities seeking to defeat the collection of their bonds , that issued a printed address , in which we find the following curious bit of casuistry : " Many labored efforts have been made , to show that there are questions of good faith and moral obligation in reference to the payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legality . We maintain that arguments based on such considerations have no application to the payment of municipal obligations , and never had . . . . The only questions to be asked and answered in reference to a bond of that character are , Has it been issued *y proper authority of law ? Is the taxable property of the locality sufficient to meet the obligation , if its payment has to be enforced by law ? These are the true foundations of public credit as applied to municipal corporations , and they are matters of law purely . " According to the ethics of that address , a community has a perfect right to issue and market bonds , and then throw them off , if it can . And in so doing , its citizen incurs no responsibility . If he issues his own bond , he is morally bound for its payment ; but if he joins with a thousand others in issuing a bond , neither he nor any of the rest assumes any obligation . If a State , according to that morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiate its promise to pay , nobody in particular is responsible for the paper , either in law , conscience , or honor - not even the people by whom the affairs of the State are regulated , and who are directly chargeable with the nonpayment of the debt . Nor is there any reason , according to the same view of the subject , why the citizen of a dishonest city , county , or State should not carry his head as high and as bravely in the face of the world as a citizen of an honest city , county , or State . Such is the essential principle of repudiation , by whatever // name it may be k own . The effect of such teaching upon the moral tone of the community can not be doubted . Nor is its influence likely to be limited by the boundary-lines of repudiating States and municip lities , If part of the members of the body politic become diseased , it will be strange if others are not affected . To this demoralization can , undoubtedly , be attributed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iucreasinb number of crimes against property , especially in positions of public and corporate trust . It is a significant but by no means unaccountable fact , that nearly all the defaulting States have been heavy losers through the faithlessness of those to whom their public moneys have been intrusted ; among the recent sufferers being Tennessee , which has been the latest State to break faith with its creditors , and Arkansas , which has be n the last to put on record its formal resolution to repudiate its obligations . Fe r . The national security . Our Government owes its life to the credit of its bonds . Their marketability alone furnished the leans for suppressing the great rebellion . We feel a just pride in the confidence they command ; but we should not forget that , although it has been less than a quarter of a century since the first of them were issued , and a sense of what we owe to to em is fresh in the public recollection , we have already heard lo d talk about " bloated bondholders , ** and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the proposition *o pay them in cheap and irredeemable paper , which is nothing less than partial repudiation . Let the spirit that makes war on the obligations of States and their subordinate ommunities remain unchecked and unrebuked , and no man can tell how soon , and with what result , it may attack the bonde pled*es of the nation . They are no more sacred than those of the States . It is true that the Government may be so firmly established on the basis of a recon*tructed Union that its life woul not be endangered by the loss of its credit , and it would have no further occasion for the issue and sale of bonds ; but is it wise for it to tear away t e supports of he bridge that has so recently carried it safely over a fatal chasm * But are the holders of State bonds in a position to ask the intervention of any one in t eir behalf ? Did they not know of the difficulties in the *ay of the collection of the bonds when they pur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peril ? A New York journal , criticising the writer 's former article , thus sets forth the argument : " If there is any class of commodities to which the axiom caveat emptor was plainly applicable , it was that species of bonds whose payment is guar . anteed by a State as distinguished from the general Government . - . . A glance at our national Constitution , which is neither an inaccessible nor a mysterious document , would disclose to any lawyer the non-existence of any form of process or proceeding by which a State can be compelled to satisfy its creditors . " The fact is , however , that the true meaning of that accessible and non-mysterious document , on the point referred to - namely , the existence or non-existence of a legal means of compelling States to pay their debts - is something over which the lawyers have for many years been about equally divided . While it was admitted that , under the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution , the individual creditor could not sue the State , it was contended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only had the power , but it was its duty , to take assignments of its citizens ' claims against other States in default , and as a trustee collect them in its name . That proposition was supported with great plausi1*Ality by Benjamin R. Curtis , so long a distinguished Justice of the United States Supreme Court , in a paper to be found in his collected works , and first appearing *n the January number of the NORTH AMERICAN REvIEw for 1844 , long before most of the dishonored bonds were issued . The same view of the law was taken by Reverdy Johnson , and some years ago a very able paper in its advocacy , under the caption , " Can States be comrelied to pay their debts ? " from the pc*n of Gen. Bradley Johnson , appeared in the " American Law ReviewY So clear did the right appear to be , that the States of New York and New Hampshire , whose legislatures contained some gentlemen of very respectable legal acquirements , passed acts authorizing suits to be brought in their names against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them by their citizens . The recent adverse ruling of our Supreme Court was not made until long after all the bonds had been issued and marketed . It is , therefore , evident that when the purchasers took the securities , it was with no knowledge or warning that the courts of the country would be locked against them in case the debtor States made default ; although , of course , when they bought paper carrying the great seals and indorsements of American States , itwas with no expecta // tion that they would ever have to go to court , and proceed against its makers as they would against hair-brained speculators that had oversold their credit , or dishonest jobbers in the credulity of the investing public . They assumed - and did they not have a right to assume ? - undoubtedly , in most cases without consulting their lawyers , or engaging in the study of constitutional lore , that onr great and prosperous commonwealths could be trnsted to repay borrowed money without compulsion . But would it be right or proper to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustains its credit - pay , or help to pay , the debt of another State , particularly if the latter is perfectly able to pay its own debt ? Or , as one newspaper reviewer puts it , make the innocent pay for the guilty ? Hardly the correct thing , the writer admits ; but at the same time there may be cases in which it would be to the interest of the innocent to pay for the guilty , and wise to do so . However , in this instance , that is not what the writer has suggested or contends for . He does not propose to elaborate a scheme of settlement , which is something that any competent legislator could do ; but , to meet the appearance of inequality and inequity referred to , he wouldremark that it could be easily removed by an arrangement for the assumption by the general Government of the present bonded debts of all the States , whether in default or not , and for adequate compensation to those that owe nothing or but small amounts . So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue of the Government , which has become a troublesome element , it would work no disadvantage . In what way could the surplus be better disposed of than in redeeming the nation 's tarnished honor ? And while probably increasing the national bonded debt somewhat , though not oppressively , it would not necessarily on that account be objectionable . It is no secret that the rapid disappearance of the national securities threatens , by crippling the national banking *ystem , to become an embarrassment to business , and an increase of Government paper at this time would be a relief rather than a public detriment . Indeed , it would be a most excellent thing if we had fewer local securities , and more of those of the general Government . An arrangement by which the issue of all State and municipal bonds would stop , and their places , as far as necessary , be taken by obligations of the nation , would be most beneficent . And why not have such an arrangement , if there is no // legal impediment ? The abuse of the bond-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious and prodigious . The amount of paper put forth has often been excessive ; the execution so defective that our law books are filled with reports of bond eases ; the payment so uncertain as to create a crying public scandal . The result is , that nearly all such paper has come to be looked upon with suspicion , and , even if perfectly good , can only be negotiated at a sacrifice . So offensive has become the whole business that several of the States have , by constitutional prohibition , cut off altogether the authority to issue municipal obligations . And yet there are many communities , especially cities , that can not well get on and make needful improvements without the use of their credit , and the coupon bond is by far the most convenient form of its employment . If , instead of the community issuing its own paper , bearing a high rate of interest , and having to be disposed of at a heavy discount , with the possibility , if not probability , of litigation and discredit following , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interest , be supplied with an appropriate amount of United States Government paper , carrying a low rate of interest , and negotiable at par or a premium , with no trouble or scandal to follow , how much better it would be for all concerned . The money-saving to all parties would be immense . And such an arrangement would be less radical and revolutionary than the change from the old method of local banks supplying a paper currency to the national banking system , and in many respects a parallel proceeding . Certain it is that a State , as long as it can not be made by law to pay its debts , should have no privilege of issuing paper of any kind . Nor would such a limitation be an infringement upon the just powers of the so-called sovereign States , because in financial matters the States are not sovereign . They can not coin money ; they can not emit bills of credit ; they can not grant letters of marque and reprisal ; they can not do a general banking business ; all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing they can do that is an act of unmistakable sov* ereiguty , is to run head over ears in debt and contemptuously snap their fingers in the faces of their creditors when pay-day comes . But the question now is , *at is to be done with the repudiated paper that the States have already issued ? It certainly // does not look as if the States themselves , even if not hopelessly smitten with what some one has described as " the leprosy of repudiation , " would within any reasonable period take steps for its settlement , and the nominal prices it commands in the market show that its owners have no such expectation . Popular sentiment in the delinquent States does not appear to be running in the direction of good faith to creditors . Such of their better and more sagacious citizens as have been fighting the battle for public honor and honesty seem to be losing their courage or their influence , and the power is more and more drifting into the hands of that class of demagogues who find in repudiation an issue on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially the more ignorant and impecunious , to their support . Intelligent taxpayers are rarely repudiators . It was but a few years ago that Governor Holliday seemed to speak the public sentiment of Virginia in favor of maintaining the integrity and good name of that commonwealth , and now its legislature has before it a **27;391;TOOLONG all the adjustments and re-adjustments made with the creditors-to repudiate the State 's debt in toto . The immediate predecessors of Tenness*e 's present repudiation governor were " debt-payers . " Four years ago , Arkansas defeated at the polls a proposed amendment to the State Constitution to repudiate most of her debt ; but she has just ratified the same amendment by one hundred thousand majority . Until the populations of the defaulting States can be largely renovated by the introduction , through immigration ,  --  necessarily a slow process ,  --  of more sao'acious and public-spirited elements , it would seem as if no equitable or satisfactory agreement with their creditors can be hoped for . It remains , then , to inquire what the general Government , which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the debts , and largely responsible for the treatment that all of them are receiving , will do in the premises . Two courses of action are open to it . First , it can try to rescind the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution , and give the creditors of States the redress they originally had ; second , it can pay or compromise the debts . In executing the first-mentioned course , the repealing amendment would have to be submitted by a twothirds vote of both houses of Congress , and then it would need to be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States . // After its adoption , the creditors , who are scattered all over the civilized world , could bring their actions in the United States Supreme Court , the slowest tribunal on earth , and , having obtained judgments there , would then be ready to join issue with the debtor States in the struggle to enforce execution , the one side urging and the other resisting the mandatory forces of the law . By the time that business was settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors , who have already waited from twenty to forty years for their money , would be dead and buried . However , as more than one-fourth of the Statestwelve out of thirty-eight-are repudiators , there would be no likelihood of the amendment 's ratification . As to the other suggested course , it must be admitted that our people generally do not exhibit any great eagerness for its adoption . They seem to look upon repudiation as our national skeleton , which it is , and think that the better policy to pursue toward it is to lock it in the closet as securely as possible , and say nothing about it . The reticence of some of our public personages and bodies on the subject is remarkable . Once a year , for several seasons , the leading bankers of the country have been accustomed to meet in convention , to consider and discuss questions relating to the country 's finances . It might be supposed that the breach of public contracts amounting to over three hundred millions of dollars , which , by undermining the general credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first topics to command the attention of such an assemblage . But although there has been more than one endeavor to bring the subject to the bankers ' consideration , nothing concerning it has yet been heard from them . Our lawyers have a national association , and once a year the leading lights of the profession have met and concentrated their radiance upon such . subjects in their line as seemed to need illumination . It would be inferred that the matter of bond repudiation would peculiarly recommend itself to gentlemen whose business it is to mend broken contracts . But although they have talked at their meetings about nearly everything under the sun , that one subject has not yet come to their notice . Every four years our great political parties have had national conventions , made up of delegates from all parts of the country , and although these bodies have been accustomed to prepare long // platforms covering nearly everything supposed to concern the public , they have had nothing to say about State repudiation . Indeed , they do not appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest national convention of the party that has claimed to be par excellence the guardian of the public faith and the national honor , we are told by the Associated Press reporter that , when the most conspicuous repudiator in the land appeared upon the floor as a candidate for participation in its proceedings , he was " received with tremendous applause lasting for several minutes . " The writer can not just now recall the place and time where and when any one of the many regular synods of our religious denominations , convened of course to advance the cause of that morality which embraces the Eighth Commandment , has whispered , much less thundered , against the sin of organized violation of public contracts , of which our States and smaller communities have given so many glaring exhibitions . The callousness of the people of the repudiating States to the dishonor and turpitude of their communities , is a painful phenomenon , and ominous for their moral and political future ; but it is not more strange or discouraging than the indifference to that matter of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without receiving any of the supposed benefits . But perhaps when we see the President , and Cabinet ministers , and other high officials dealing out the patronage of the Government in aid of a movement the basis and avowed object of which is repudiation , in exchange for partisan favors , such things ought not to surprise us . The idea with most of our people seems to be that , if nothing is said about repudiation of public debts , it will get to be an old story , the public will lose sight of it , the bondholders will die , the bonds themselves will be destroyed or lost , and the whole matter will be forgotten . If there were no remedy for the evil , probably that would be the better course to adopt ; but when we have a government with all necessary power in the premises , with an embarrassing surplus of riches , with the opportunity presented to deal with the question under the most advantageous conditions , and undeniably under a high moral if not legal obligation to take it in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable if that would be the wiser policy . Letting the evil alone is only letting it grow . The defaulted State indebtedness // is now increasing , on interest account , at the rate of eighteen millions of dollars per annum ; and certainly the discredit attendant upon its non-payment is not diminishing . History will not forget it , though we.may try to do so . The financial wounds of our public creditors may be assuaged by the lapse of years , and all traces of them disappear , but time will not remove the scar from the nation 's honor . " The deep disgrace , the dark , abhorrent stain - O'er it oblivion 's flood will roll in vain . " Formidable as the obligation , at first glance , may appear , and important as it is to those immediately interested , it is really a very small affair for such a nation as ours . If paid in full and immediately , it would be a tax of less than six dollars per head of our population - a light matter to weigh against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , and the value of every debenture we have outstanding or may issue . It is idle to claim , as has been claimed , that the settlement of the States ' liabilities , as proposed , would compel the general Government to pay the Confederate debt and many other demands . For that conclusion there is no earthly reason . The case is one to be decided on its own circumstances and merits . When the Government has heretofore assumed debts of the States , as it has twice done , and distributed surplus revenue and lands among them ,  --  which is the same thing in principle ,  --  it has not found itself compelled to take care of everybody 's obligations . In doing what is now proposed , it would not be making precedent , it would be following precedent . Instead of going out of the way to hunt up objections , treating the business as if it were a pound-of-flesh affair , and urging reasons that are excuses rather than arguments for doing nothing , we ought to remember that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds ; that the general Government holds a paternal relation to the indebted States ; that the honor and character of the whole nation are concerned ; and that we as a community can much better afford to be liberal than unjust . That the general Government is blameless in the matter of State repudiation , will not be claimed by any one . The extent of its liability is the only question . That liability , involving a breach of faith with citizens of every civilized country , and thus carrying a world-wide reproach , is one that no // nation on earth can afford to ignore . That the Government will , sooner or later , make good the losses of the public creditors , can hardly be questioned ; but how much better to do so while those who furnished the money are alive and can enjoy the benefits . Non-action , at all events , will not answer . To do nothing while a great public injustice is conceded to exist , and we as a people have full power so to shape laws and constitutions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation of rascals . Rather than rest under a charge so serious , it would be preferable for us , in every conceivable sense , to pay the involved demands to the last penny , and thus acquit ourselves of every obligation , win the world 's esteem by a magnanimous deed , and give our troublesome national skeleton an honorable buriaL JonK F.
