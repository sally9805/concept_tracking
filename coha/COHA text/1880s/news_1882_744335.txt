txt President Arthur has had the sagacity and the courage to do exactly the right thing with the River and Harbor Appropriation bill . It ought not to require a great amount of sagacity or courage to do the right thing in such a case . So far as sound principle and the public demand were concerned his course was perfectly clear , but he was subject to so much pressure from those with whom he desired to be in accord and who are presumed to have great political influence that it doubtless required considerable resolution and firmness , as well as clearness of vision , to take the right stand . But the President has proved equal to the emergency , and has not only put his veto upon the great scheme of plunder , but has given reasons for his action that are unanswerable . It is many years since purely local jobs began to creep into this annual measure providing nominally for improvements upon rivers and harbors for the benefit of national commerce . Their nature has been perfectly well understood . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon these local schemes , and yet the self-interest of members of Congress has been stronger than their sense of public duty . With few exceptions they have been willing to have the public money devoted to unauthorized purposes so long as their own localities were benefited . But no one member could secure the benefit for his locality without conceding it to others , and hence arose the great log-rolling plan of admitting all these scandalous items of local jobbery , each member sustaining them in the aggregate for the sake of securing those in which he was interested . There have always been a few resolute members who have protested and remonstrated and fought against the great and growing " steal , " but a large majority , irrespective of party , have eagerly joined in it . It was the inevitable tendency of a job of this kind to increase in its proportions year by year . Once admitting the practice of diverting national funds for the promotion of local schemes of improvement , it was inevitable that the demand should grow , and there was no limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more for his district was , 4 constrained to allow more for other 7 districts , ? and thus we see the dimensions of the river and harbor appropriation advancing with steady but increasing strides from less than $4,000,000 in 1870 to nearly ' $20,000,000 this year . While the " steals " were small they attracted little attention . As they grew protests were made , but unheeded , and the thing was bound to become a scandal and a disgrace . This year the culmination was reached . The inevitable overdoing and the consequent revolt of public sentiment came . And now the President reminds Congress that these provisions for the benefit of particular localities are and always have been unconstitutional . The fact can not be disputed or doubted . They are no more unconstitutional now than last year or ten years ago , but it was necessary that the filching process should outstrip the dimensions of petty larceny before it would attract sufficient at , tention.to arouse public indignation . It re- minds us once more that public opinion rules in this country , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are checked and wrongs are corrected . The sovereign power has been moved to utter its mandate in regard to the great steal , " and the President has been constrained to give it voice . When the President declares that many of the objects provided for in this bill do not pertain to the common defense and general welfare or the promotion of commerce among the States , and that they do not come within the purview of the law-making power of the Government , ho utters a truth so obvious that there is no answer to be made , and it ought to make members of Congress who voted for them feel like detected thieves . independent of the constitutional question , the President rightly objects to the aggregate amount appropriated . It is too much to be devoted to this class of improvements , however legitimate , in a single year . It is more than can be economically and advantageously expended . The remark of the President regarding the general effect of public extravagance is of the nature of a truism , but it is one whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Executive as to the course now to be taken with the bill is , perhaps , the best that could be made under the circumstances . It is desirable that important public improvements should be provided for while the local jobs are extinguished . If an attempt were made to reconstruct the bill on sound principles , it might lead to endless disagreements and great difficulty in securing its passage in satisfactory shape . But if the aggregate is reduced one-half and its expenditure for the purposes named in the bill be left to Executive discretion , under the restrictions suggested by the President , there will be no difficulty in drawing the line . Needed improvements and public works will not suffer , and there will be no reason to apprehend that the local jobs will get any attention . It is well that Congress has been brought to a halt in its reckless course , and now is as good a time as any for it cheerfully to accept the lines of a new departure .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
