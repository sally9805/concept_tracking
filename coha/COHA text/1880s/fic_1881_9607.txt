Main text ACT FIRST " HAYIN ' TIME " VIEW of " Shore Acres Farm , " near Bar Harbor . SCENE : Frenchman 's Bay , with Mount Desert Island and its range of grandly picturesque hills in the distance . Away off to the right are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the stage , at the back , on a rocky bluff dotted with dwarf pines , and overlooking the bay , is Berry Light . It is separated from the farmhouse by a shady road , which runs across the stage from left to right . The farmhouse , on the right , is barely visible , being hidden in a profusion of shrubs and flowers . Trees overhang the roof ; a white-washed fence divides the door yard from the road . Several shining milk pails are hanging on the fence , and on one of the palings hangs a small weather-beaten mail bag ; near it hangs a battered tin horn . The door yard is filled with old-fashioned flowers . To the left of the stage is an old barn , its doors open , its littered yard enclosed by a rail fence . A dove cote is built into the peak of its gabled roof , and doves come and go leisurely . Outside the fence , at the upper end , is a pump , beneath which is a trough filled with water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trees overhang the roof of the barn , and join those overhanging the house from the other side . At right centre is a gnarled old tree , and beneath it is a bench . Down left , below the fence , is a wheelbarrow . At the rise of the curtain , and until the act is well in progress , the wind gently sways the foliage with a slight rustling sound . Birds sing , and flit to and fro . The sound of multitudinous insects is the one distinct note of the scene . The bay is calm , quiet , and in the distance a catboat is occasionally seen sailing lazily , appearing and disappearing among the islands . A tiny steam launch appears once , about the middle of the act , and is seen no more . A mowing machine is heard at work in the distance off left . It stops , turns , goes on again , while the voice of the driver is heard guiding his horses , with " Whoa ! Stiddy ! Get up ! Whoa Bill ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of the curtain , MILLIE , a little girl about four years old , is sitting down left near the plough , playing in the sand with clam shells and pieces of old crockery . She wears a quaint little calico dress , and has a small white flannel shawl around her shoulders , crossed in front and tied behind her back . Her shoes are very dusty , her little hands are dirty . On the road , off stage to the right , a horse and wagon can be heard driving up and stopping outside ; and presently the MAIL CARRIER appears , with a mail bag and a basket of groceries . He is a kindly-looking man of middle age , wearing a linen duster , driving gloves and a straw hat . He goes to the bag hanging on the fence , takes two letters from it , and puts in a newspaper wrapped for mailing . He drops the letters into his own bag , and places the basket of groceries beside the fence . MAIL CARRIER . Putting his hands to his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his call , MILLIE leaves her play and runs to him . They are evidently good friends . MILLIE . Hello ! MAIL CARRIER . Hello , Millie ! I swan I 'm afeared I 've fergot yeh this mornin ' . MILLIE . Oh ! Hev yeh ? MAIL CARRIER . Well , not quite . Feels in his coat pocket , gets out a piece of candy as if it were the usual thing , and gives it to her . MILLIE Pleased . Thank yeh . MAIL CARRIER . Hai n't yeh got a kiss fer me ? MILLIE . I guess so . Lifts up her face ; he kisses her . MAIL CARRIER . I 'll bring yeh a bigger piece to-morry . Goodbye . He goes off right , and is heard driving away . MILLIE nibbles the candy as she watches him out of sight , then she resumes her play . After the mail wagon drives away , HELEN enters , left , followed by UNCLE NAT . HELEN is a girl of seventeen , with a frank yet thoughtful manner , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown eyes ; she is picturesquely dressed , and wears a sunbonnet . She carries a small pail full of berries , and a tin cup hangs from a crooked finger . UNCLE NAT is a man of sixty , and his large sturdy frame shows signs of toil . His eyes , of a faded blue-grey , have the far-seeing look common to sailors . He wears his yellow-white hair rather long , and he is clean-shaven save for the tippet of straw-white beard that seems to grow up from his chest and to form a sort of frame for his benevolent , weather-beaten old face . UNCLE NAT is of the soil , yet there is an inherent poise and dignity about him that are typical of the men who have mastered their environment . He has great cheerfulness and much sly , quiet humor . He wears overalls of a faded blue , a blue checked jumper , beneath which one glimpses a red flannel shirt , and on his head is a farmer 's much-battered wide straw hat . His sleeves are rolled back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene progresses , one is impressed by the frank comradeship between the old man and the girl . On his part there is tenderness , and a deep interest in her problems ; there is admiration too for her fine spirit of independence . HELEN shows a suppressed feeling of bitterness as she talks . She is high-spirited and proud , yet simple and direct . They pause a little above centre as they talk . HELEN . Talking as she enters . Yes , I know , Uncle Nat , perhaps I ought n't . But Father makes me mad when he talks as he does about Sam . UNCLE NAT . Soothingly . Well , now , things 'll come out all right ef you 'll only hev patience . You 're young , so 's Sam . I told ' im so t' other day . Sez I , " Sam Warren , " sez I , " You hai n't got a mite o ' sense , " I sez . HELEN . In the same manner . Father says  --  if he catches me speaking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't let ' m ketch yeh ! Chuckles . Law sakes , ef I could n't spark a fellah athout my father ketchin ' me at it , I 'd bag my head . HELEN . With gentle reproach . I ca n't bear deceit  --  UNCLE NAT . Neither kin I , but what yeh goin ' to do about it  --  give Sam up ? HELEN . Determinedly . No ! She crosses to the right , and sits on the bench under the tree , and says with an undercurrent of defiance , I 'll never give him up  --  I 'll leave home first . UNCLE NAT . Teasingly . Oh , Nell ! You would n't hev spunk enough fer that . HELEN . Half smiling , then thoughtfully . Would n't I  --  UNCLE NAT . No sirree ! Crosses to the left and places the pitchfork against the fence . HELEN . You 'll see  --  it 'll be his own fault if I do . Rising and going towards him . Uncle Nat , if you were my father , would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice . Ef I was yer father , Nell ? Ef I was yer father , I 'm afeared I 'd let you do jes ' about 's you 'd a mind to . Allus did seem es ef you was my baby anyway , an ' I 'd give the two eyes out'n my head to see you an ' Sam happy . But I ai n't yer father , Nell  --  I ai n't yer father . The last with a regretful sigh . HELEN . softly . I sometimes wish you were . UNCLE NAT . Goes to her and places his hands affectionately on her shoulders . Now , hol ' on ! Thet ai n't right . No sirree ! Thet ai n't right , an ' you know it . HELEN . Father 's changed . Leaves him and goes slowly back to the bench . He never takes me on his knee any more . With a slight shade of resentment . UNCLE NAT . Smiling , and looking at her admiringly . You 're gittin ' too heavy I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's noticed it , and she feels pretty bad about it too , although she pretends not to see it . UNCLE NAT . Of course she dooze . She ai n't a-goin ' to see no changes in a man she 's been married to nigh on to twenty-five year , not ef she kin help it . HELEN rises , and as she does so she sees MR . BLAKE 'S buggy , which is supposedly standing off stage , right . Immediately her whole manner changes , and she says with an impatient tone in her voice , HELEN . There 's Mr. Blake 's buggy again ! Shrugging her shoulders . He 's here about all the time lately . UNCLE NAT . Rather seriously . He is here pooty consid'ble , ai n't he ? What he after I wonder ? HELEN . Resentfully . Principally  --  me . UNCLE NAT . Surprised , but rather amused . He ai n't ! HELEN . With finality . Yes he is . Father wants me to marry him . UNCLE NAT . Frightened . He do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does . Mr. Blake told me as much the other day . UNCLE NAT . My ! My ! Thet 's too bad . I swan thet 's too bad . I 'm afeared yer father do n't understand yeh , Helen . Has he said anythin ' to yeh about ' t himself ? HELEN . Still standing by the bench . No , not yet  --  but he will , and then  --  well  --  Half savagely . He 'll find out I 'm not Mother  --  UNCLE NAT . Tut  --  tut  --  tut  --  there yeh go  --  Thet 's yer father all over again  --  thet 's yer father all over again . JOEL GATES drifts into the farmyard from the road , left . Little MANDY drifts in after him . GATES is dressed in dark overalls , with suspenders , a soiled white shirt , no vest , and an old drab soft hat . He carries a scythe , the snath under his left arm , the blade to the ground with the point off to the left , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if life had battered him mercilessly . He is small and slight , his face weather-washed , kindly ; his keen little eyes seem to be as a child 's with a question in them , always asking " What is it all about anyhow !  --  I d'know ! " He is never seen without MANDY . Her whole little personality is part of his ; the nondescript , faded clothing , the rhythm of movement . The far-away look in the old face is repeated in the apple-blossom beauty of the child . He rarely addresses her or seems aware of her presence . GATES . In a drawl . Good day , Nathan'l . UNCLE NAT . Hello , Joel ! GATES . Talking as he walks across the stage towards the right . Why ai n't yeh in th ' hay field ? UNCLE NAT . Ben there good part th ' mornin ' . Who be you a-cuttin ' fer t'day , Joel ? GATES . Simm'ns . Jes ' got done . Goin ' t ' cut m ' own now . Ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good weather to lose , an ' no mistake . GATES is about to exit , with MANDY behind him , when he stops abruptly near the bench . MANDY pauses also . GATES . Oh , Nathan'l ! Will yeh lend me yer gun fer a day ' r two ? UNCLE NAT . Reluctantly . Yes  --  I guess'o . What fer ? Coming down centre . GATES . There 's a fox ' r suthin ' a-playin ' ol ' Nick with my chickings . UNCLE NAT . Thet so ? Helen , git me ol ' Uncle Sam'l , will yeh ? She 's a-standin ' in her corner in the kitchen . HELEN goes into the house . Hello , Mandy ! Chuckles . How d'yeh do ?  --  You ben in the hay field too ? The child nods . By George  --  you 're a great haymaker . I 'll tell you what  --  when you git a scythe inter yer hands th ' grasshoppers is got to jump over the fence an ' no mistake , ai n't they , Joel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child kindly . GATES . Go on  --  shake hands . MANDY shyly creeps behind her father . UNCLE NAT . Bashful , ai n't she ? GATES . Reaching around to where the child stands behind him , and pressing her closer to him . Yes  --  she 's a shy sort o ' critter . Do n't never seem t ' want t ' play with nobody nor nothin ' but me . UNCLE NAT . She 's a-growin ' ai n't she  --  growin ' jes ' like a weed . My  --  my ! How like her mother she dooze look , do n't she ? GATES . With a break in his voice and a catch in his breath , placing his hand on her head and looking at her . Yeh . Gits to look more an ' more like her every day in the week . UNCLE NAT . Hesitatingly , as if loth to arouse unhappy memories . I suppose  --  yeh hai n't never heerd nothin ' of her  --  sence  --  hev yeh , Joel ? GATES . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a great sigh . HELEN returns with the gun and crosses to UNCLE NAT . GATES also crosses to UNCLE NAT , leaving MANDY in front of the bench . After HELEN gives UNCLE NAT the gun , she goes over to MILLIE who has been playing in the sand , all unconscious of things that have been going on about her , and sits down beside her and plays with her . MANDY timidly sits on the edge of the bench ; she watches her father intently , with a look of trust and affectionate content which one sees in a dearly loved dog when near his master . The attitude of GATES and UNCLE NAT in the episode of the gun is that of two boys gloating over a treasure . UNCLE NAT . Well  --  here 's ol ' Uncle Sam'l . Take good keer of ' r . I set a good deal o ' store by Sam'l . He hands GATES the gun . GATES . Putting the stone in his pocket , laying down his scythe and taking the gun . Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I allus keep ' r ludded . GATES . Doos she  --  eh  --  kick ? UNCLE NAT . She never kicked me , d'know what she might do to a feller she did n't like . GATES . Handling the gun with pride , as though it were a great privilege , his eyes travelling the length of it admiringly , and then looking at UNCLE NAT with his face aglow . Fit all through the war with ' r , did n't yeh ? UNCLE NAT . Yeh . GATES . Sixth Maine ? UNCLE NAT . His hands clasped behind him , shoulders thrown back , his head high in the air , teeters to and fro on his heels and toes . Yeh  --  Sixth Maine , Company A. Her ' n me ' s tramped a good many miles together , one way ' nother . His voice is quiet and his face tense with memories . GATES . In an awed hushed voice . Did yeh ever  --  kill a rebel ' th her ? UNCLE NAT . In a matter of fact tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p'int ' er , shet both my eyes ' n let ' r do her own work . GATES . Reflectively . I guess thet 's ' bout as good a way as any fer me t'kill thet ' ere fox . He is fussing with the gun and unconsciously aims it at UNCLE NAT . UNCLE NAT . Taking hold of the gun and pushing it aside . Hol ' on , yeh danged ol ' fool  --  Did n't I jes ' tell yeh she was ludded ? GATES . What yer skeered of ? I wa' n't a-goin ' to pull the trigger  --  I was only jes ' aimin ' ' r . UNCLE NAT . Well , aim ' r at somebody else . GATES . There ai n't nobody else handy . UNCLE NAT . I swan thet 's too bad . GATES . Well , good day . Takes up the scythe , and puts the gun over his shoulder . I 'll bring ' r back safe an ' sound . GATES goes off right . MANDY quietly slips from the bench and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by playfully snapping his fingers at her , and she turns and shows quite a little interest in his kindly friendliness . She passes on , her eyes fixed wonderingly upon him . UNCLE NAT is amused and chuckles . After they go off , he seats himself on the bench under the tree . HELEN . Oh , Uncle Nat ! Have you and Sam done anything more about your back pension ? UNCLE NAT . Well , Sam got me t ' sign some papers over at the Squire 's t' other day  --  but  --  I d'want him to do nothin ' about my back pension . With mock indignation . What do you an ' him take me fur ? One o ' them ' ere pension grabbers ? HELEN . Going up left . Well , Sam says you 're entitled to it , and he 's going to try and get it for you too . UNCLE NAT . Sam says lots o ' things asides his prayers , do n't he Nell ? HELEN . Pausing and leaning over the fence . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UNCLE NAT . Where yeh goin ' ? HELEN . Oh , I do n't know . Just for a stroll . And much occupied with her problems , she disappears down the road to the left . UNCLE NAT rises from the bench a little stiffly , as if checked by a slight rheumatic twinge , goes down left and gets the wheelbarrow . He starts off as if he might be going to get fodder for the noon meal of the animals , when he notices MILLIE and says jovially , UNCLE NAT . Well , Millie , d'yeh want a ride ? MILLIE . Dropping her play and brushing off her frock , eagerly . Yes . UNCLE NAT . Well , climb into the kerridge an ' do n't keep the ol ' hoss waitin ' . Yeh know how to git into a kerridge ? MILLIE . Yes . She sits on the edge of the wheelbarrow . UNCLE NAT . Well , I do n't know whether yeh do or not . Take a back seat . He tips the wheelbarrow gently so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit startled for a moment . You see , I knew yeh did n't know how to git into a kerridge . The fust thing yeh know this ol hoss 'll kick up and knock the dashboard out , an ' spill yeh all over the place , an ' yeh wo n't like thet a bit . He wheels her off , right . BLAKE enters from the barn . He is a man of forty years ; he has black hair , and his side-whiskers are close cut . The rest of his face is cleanly shaven . He is dressed in a grey business suit , " store made ; " the coat is a single-breasted frock , very slightly cutaway , buttoned with one button at the breast . He wears a white laundered shirt , and a rather high standing collar with a black ready-made tie . His hat is a silk one , old , but not battered , brown at the edges of the crown and brim . His shoes have been home-polished , but are dusty . He has drab castor gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old white one . He has a black silk ribbon watch guard around his neck , and a gold watch . He is portly and well-to-do , but jovial . He is rather good-looking , and has the air of a contented , cheerful business man , shrewd , but not cunning or mean ; he is always smiling . He passes through the gate of the barnyard , and goes right centre . He is followed by MARTIN , a heavy robust man of fifty . He is slow and deliberate in manner and speech . His face and hands are weather-beaten , his hair is sandy-grey and cropped , and he has a short stubby beard . He wears pepper-and-salt trousers tucked into his boots , a black vest , and an open , white , home-made and home-laundered shirt with collar attached . His shirt sleeves are rolled up a trifle , showing red flannel beneath . He has a black silk sailor handkerchief , and a black soft hat , well worn . He carries a jackknife in his right hand , and is opening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " clicking " it . His left hand is behind his back , and his head is down , as if in deep thought . He stops inside the rail fence . At the same time enters from the house , PERLEY , the " hired girl , " a strong muscular girl of about twenty , in a calico dress , with her sleeves rolled up to her shoulders , showing her red powerful arms . She pays no attention to BLAKE or MARTIN , and goes to the mail bag , takes it down , takes out the paper , crosses over and gives it to MARTIN , who mechanically looks at the address as if he knew what it was , as it is a regularly " subscribed for " paper . She crosses back to the basket of provisions , puts the bag into the basket , stands with her back to the men , with her hands on her hips , and looks up and down the road for a moment . She then takes up the basket and goes into the house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action , from the moment they entered . BLAKE . No , sirree . I tell yeh , Martin , the day o ' sentiment 's gone . We 're livin ' in a practical age . Any man 's liable to go to bed poor ' n wake up a milli'naire . Ef I 'd hed a friend to give me such a boost and such advice 's I 've given you , I 'd hev owned half the State o ' Maine , I believe . MARTIN . At the lower end of the fence , and facing the audience ; putting the paper in the watch pocket of his vest . Why , yeh see 's I told yeh , Mother left the place to me ' n Nathan'l , an ' we sort o ' promised ' er we 'd never sell it an '  --  BLAKE . Sentiment ! All sentiment ! Any man thet 'll hang on to an old farm jes ' ' cause  --  Goes to the pump , takes the cup and pumps water into it he sort o ' promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no business to live in this bustlin ' , go-ahead , money-makin ' , **25;28;TOOLONG day of ours  --  Drinks thet 's all I 've got to say . Laughs . Pours the balance of the water into the trough , replaces the cup and wipes his mouth . MARTIN . Casually . P'r'aps you never sot much store b'your mother , Mr. Blake . BLAKE . I never hed no mother  --  thet is not to speak of . You know all about thet as well as I do . He returns to MARTIN . MARTIN . Thet mus ' be the reason yeh ca n't understand  --  BLAKE . Patronisingly . I kin understand this . Leaning with his back to the fence , both elbows on the top rail . " Shore Acres " is a good enough farm as Maine farms go  --  yeh manage by hard work to make a livin ' fer yerself an ' family  --  MARTIN . Defensively , nodding his head at BLAKE . A good  --  comfortable  --  livin ' ! He puts his foot upon the middle rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable livin ' ! Switching the whip up and down . MARTIN . With quiet dignity . An ' pay my debts . BLAKE . An ' pay  --  your debts . MARTIN . Complacently . Do n't owe no man nothin ' , an kin sleep nights . BLAKE . Patronisingly , agreeing with him . From sundown to cockcrow  --  I ai n't a-goin ' to dispute thet , thet 's a-l-l right . Well , now , you happen to hev a hundred an ' sixty rod , more or less , of about the sightliest shore front to be found on the coast . Yeh did n't know thet till I told yeh , did yeh ? MARTIN . No , I did n't . Climbs up , sits on the rail fence , facing the house , and sticks the knife into the rail between his legs . BLAKE . Well ! This shore front makes your land val'able . Turning and putting his foot on the bottom rail . Not to plant potatoes in  --  but to build summer cottages on . I tell yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure as you 're born . Carried away by his own enthusiasm . Bar Harbor 's got s ' high , yeh ca n't touch a foot of it  --  not by coverin ' it with gold dollars . This has got to be the next p'int . Goes to the bench , right , and sits down . MARTIN . He is impressed by BLAKE 'S enthusiasm , but there is caution in his immediate response . Seems so  --  the way you put matters . BLAKE . Seems so ? ' T is so . You pool your land in with mine  --  He talks with a confident , good-natured , yet shrewd business air . He lays out a plan on the grass with the end of his whip . We 'll lay out quarter-acre lots , cut avenoos , plant trees , build a driveway to the shore , hang on to all the shore front an ' corner lots  --  sell every one o ' the others , see ! ! ! They 'll build on ' em an ' that 'll double the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heft o ' the taxes ' cause they 've built ; we 'll be taxed light ' cause we did n't  --  see ? MARTIN . In the same manner . I d'know as I jes ' see . BLAKE . Confidentially . If we can get holt of half a dozen just the right sort o ' fellahs  --  city fellahs  --  yeh know  --  fellahs that hev got inflooance to bring folks down here  --  we can afford to give ' em each an inside lot , here an ' there , provided they 'll guarantee to build , lay out their grounds , an ' help to make the place attractive . That 'll give us a kind of starter  --  see ? Chuckles . MARTIN . Warming a bit at BLAKE 'S confident statements . Seems es ef thet would n't be a bad idee . BLAKE . Bad idee ? It 's the idee ! Rising and going to MARTIN , confidentially . Let me show you  --  He takes a notebook from his pocket , and begins to show MARTIN some calculations he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not notice GATES , who enters right , followed by MANDY . GATES . Smiling ingratiatingly . How d ' do ? If encouraged he would stop , but they merely nod . I hear you fellahs is a-goin ' to boom things here ' n the spring . He goes quite close to BLAKE and MARTIN who are deep in discussion . He tries to peer over their shoulders , and raises his voice as if they were deaf . Is thet so thet Jordan Ma'sh 's comin ' down here to go inter business ? He pauses , inviting a response ; again braces up a bit and makes another effort , now in a manner implying that he is doing them a great favor . I would n't mind sellin ' thet seven acre o ' mine  --  ef I thought I could git rich out ' n it . BLAKE looks over his shoulder as if a puff of wind or something had disturbed him , then pointedly resumes his talk with MARTIN . GATES is crestfallen , and turns away . GATES . Gosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they git a little mite rich  --  I never see  --  He shuffles off left , with mingled dignity and resentment , followed by MANDY . BLAKE . I tell yeh , Martin , I 've got the scheme ! You go in with me an ' in less than a year I 'll make you so rich you can live in Bangor . Move your mother 's remains up there , an ' have ' em buried in one o ' them fine cemet'ries , an ' put a handsome stun over her as you 'd ought to do . MARTIN . Nathan'l an ' me ' s ben savin ' up fer a stun . I guess we 've got most enough now to git one  --  money 's scurse with us  --  we do n't see much real cash . BLAKE . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll take a mortgage on the farm for the money to start you  --  an ' you kin sell the lots . MARTIN Hesitatingly . I 'll talk to Nathan'l an ' Ann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't let ' em talk you out of the scheme . There 's a good deal of sentiment in Nathan'l . MARTIN . It 'd make me pooty rich , would n't it ? BLAKE . Rich ? Well , I guess . Yeh would n't hev to be borrowin ' nobody else 's chaise to go to meetin ' in . MARTIN . Seems es though it hed ought to be done , do n't it ? Yet it seems a kind o ' pity to  --  BLAKE . To get rich , eh ? Laughs . Say , look a-here ! Honest now  --  would n't you like to live better ' n you do ? Now honest Injun , would n't yeh ? MARTIN . A bit warmed by BLAKE 'S suggestions . I suppose I would . BLAKE . Of course yeh would , an ' yeh 'd like to have your family live better . Helen 'd ought to hev a real good syminerry eddication  --  she 's worth it , she 's a bright han'some girl  --  she 'd ought to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' her t' other day ' bout your a-wantin ' her ' n me to git married , an '  --  MARTIN . Showing interest . What 'd she say ? BLAKE purses his lips and shakes his head dubiously . MARTIN . Did yeh offer her the piannah , as I told yeh to ? BLAKE . Y-e-s  --  MARTIN Nonplussed . I thought she 'd ' a'jumped at the piannah . She 's so fond o ' music . BLAKE . I offered her everything I could think of . I offered to build her a house , an ' let her paint an ' paper it any way she 'd a mind to . MARTIN . Pondering . I guess I 'd better talk to her myself . She giner'ly does what I tell her to . BLAKE . Yes , but you see girls are beginning to think they 've a right to marry who they please . MARTIN . With pride in HELEN , and pride in his own power to control her . Not my girl . BLAKE . Going right , with a shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to her so long ' s young Doc Warren 's around . MARTIN . Angrily . Doc Warren !  --  She do n't keep company along o ' him no more ? As if in doubt . BLAKE . Do n't she ? MARTIN . I guess not . I told her I did n't want she should  --  thet 's allus ben enough . BLAKE . Them free thinkers is hard to git shut of . They 're dangerous to young folks ' religion . MARTIN . Helen 's ben riz a stric ' Babtis '  --  I guess she 'll stay so ; she 's a pious girl . BLAKE . Them 's the wust when they do change . Sam Warren was raised respectable enough . His father and mother were Presbyterians . MARTIN . His memory carries him into the past , and a smile creeps into his face as he answers patronisingly , Ol ' man Warren was a good-natured honest ol ' soul an ' all that  --  but I never thought he had any too much sense . BLAKE . No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skeleton tryin ' to make a doctor out of his boy . Laughs . MARTIN . Nodding his head wisely . The mother had a good deal to do with thet , I guess . BLAKE . Six o ' one an ' half a dozen o ' the other . What she said was law with the ol ' man and what he said was gospel with her . They thought the sun jes rose an ' sot in their Sam , an ' now look at ' im . First he read Emanuel Swedenborg , an ' he was a red-hot Swedenborgian  --  then he got hold of Spencer an ' Darwin an ' a lot o ' them kind o ' lunatics an ' began to study frogs an ' bugs an ' things . He laughs . MARTIN laughs too , but not so heartily as BLAKE does . Why , sir ! One mornin ' , a spell ago , as I was goin ' to Ellsworth , I seed him a-settin ' on his hunkers in the middle of the rud , watchin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hole . Both roar with laughter at this . D'yeh remember thet free lecture he gave with the magic lantern in the school house , on evolution ' s he called it ? MARTIN . Yes , some of ' em wanted to tar an ' feather ' im thet time . BLAKE . Oh ! Pshaw ! That would n't ' a'done ! A slight pause . Now he 's come out as a home-a-pathic physician  --  Laughs . He ai n't a doctor  --  he 's a pheesycian  --  Goes around wantin ' to cure sick folks with sugar shot  --  by George ! Both laugh heartily . MARTIN . L'see  --  ai n't he a-tendin ' ol ' Mis ' Swazy now ? BLAKE . Carelessly . Yep ! Doc Leonard give her up , an ' they had to have him . Starts to go off right , then stops . Oh , I 'm goin ' to git rid o ' all my hawgs . I 'd like you to have them two shoats , they 're beauties ! MARTIN . Preoccupied . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , think over thet there land business . If you want to get rich , now 's your chance  --  if you do n't , I ca n't help it . Good day ! MARTIN nods . Good hay weather . Scans the sky . MARTIN . Fust-rate . BLAKE . As he goes off right . Most through ? MARTIN . Finish this week ef the weather holds . BLAKE . Outside . Good day ! MARTIN . Good day ! He looks after BLAKE , then slowly and thoughtfully enters the barn , head down , hands behind his back . HELEN 'S voice is heard off left . She talks as she enters ; she has an arm around YOUNG NAT , a handsome boy of fourteen . He is an errand boy in BLAKE 'S store . He wears knickerbockers , and a cap with no visor . He has the air of being spoiled and thoroughly selfish . HELEN 'S manner towards him is one of amused and affectionate tolerance . HELEN . Laughing indulgently . La , Nat ! What good would my marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' good . You could coax money out o ' him , an ' give it to me . HELEN . Shocked . Oh ! Nat Berry ! Shakes her finger at him . Would you take that kind of money ? YOUNG NAT . I 'd take any kind o ' money . ' Tai n't no worse than weighin ' yer hand with the sugar , is it ? HELEN . As if talking to a child , placing her hands to his face . Well , Natty dear  --  YOUNG NAT . Pushing her hands away . Do n't call me Natty . Gosh , do n't I hate thet ! Mother makes me so ' shamed every time she comes up to Blake 's . This is the last suit o ' knickerbockers she gits on me . Gosh , would n't I have lots o ' things ef you 'd marry ol ' Bllake ! Putting his arms around her , coaxingly . Say , Nell , will yeh ? Marry ol ' Blake  --  do . Jes ' this once an ' I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much fer you some day ! Will you ? HELEN . No , I wo n't ! I do n't want to marry Mr. Blake . YOUNG NAT . Reproachfully ; going right . Ai n't you selfish ! HELEN . Are n't you selfish ! YOUNG NAT . You 'd marry Doc Warren mighty quick ef Father 'd let you . HELEN . Smiling proudly . I guess I would . SAM WARREN enters by the road , right , at the back . He is tall , handsome and manly , with an open honest face , and a frank manner . He stands for a moment , leaning over the fence , listening to YOUNG NAT with an amused smile . YOUNG NAT Coming towards HELEN . Hands like a blacksmith , poor 's Job , proud as a peacock an '  --  With awe  --  do n't believe there 's any Hell . HELEN . Quietly smiling . Well , neither do I. YOUNG NAT . O-O-O-h !  --  Nell Berry ! I 'll tell yer father , an ' then you 'll find out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twists it playfully . YOUNG NAT howls . SAM . What do you think about it , Nat ? YOUNG NAT Crying . Ouch ! L ' go my ear ! HELEN . Going to YOUNG NAT and folding him in her arms . Ah ! YOUNG NAT . An ' you let go of me , too . Pushing her away and going up centre . HELEN . Sam ! You 've hurt him . You 're too rough . Do n't cry , Nat . SAM . I did n't mean to hurt him , Nell . He 's more mad than hurt I guess , are n't you , Nat ? YOUNG NAT . Crying . None of yer business ! I 'll get even with you fer this some day , you see if I do n't ! I wish I was big enough , I 'd show you whether there 's any Hell or not , you great big blacksmith , pickin ' on a little fellah like me ! He goes off left , crying . SAM laughs and crosses to right centre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't tease Nat so , Sam . You know he does n't like you . She sits beneath the tree on the bench , right . She is vibrating with content and happiness in the presence of the man she loves . SAM . Sits down on the plough lying against the barnyard fence . That seems to be a general complaint around these parts . A fellow that knows some things his great-great-grandfather did n't know is an object of suspicion here . As he talks , he picks up a handful of sand and lets it slip through his fingers . HELEN . Smiling . Well , what are you going to do about it ? SAM . Cheerily . Keep right on knowing . Just as long as they build printing offices , we 've got to know , that 's all there is about that . HELEN . I 'm afraid  --  Laughs softly  --  my reading is going to get me into trouble . SAM . How so ? HELEN . Still amused . Why , the other day I was trying to tell Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but he got mad and would n't listen . SAM . Laughing . Family pride ! You know , Nell , there are lots of people who would n't be happy in this world if they could n't look forward to a burning lake in the next . Takes a book out of his pocket and carelessly flips over the pages , looking at her as he talks . HELEN . Kind of sad , is n't it ? SAM . Oh ! I do n't know ! They take a heap of comfort preparing to keep out of it , I suppose . HELEN . Seeing the book in SAM 'S hand , rises and goes towards him . What book 's that ? Trying to read the title on the cover . SAM . Rising . " A Hazard of New Fortunes . " HELEN . Have you read it ? SAM . Yes . HELEN . Eagerly , reaching for it . May I read it ? SAM . Yes , I brought it for you . He gives her the book . HELEN delightedly takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes back to the bench under the tree , speaking as she goes . HELEN . I 've been longing for this book . I read a fine article about it in the Boston paper . Sits down and looks at SAM with a joyous smile . Thank you ever so much , Sam . SAM . Pointing to the book . That 's a book you wo n't have to hide . Your father 'll listen to that . If he was a speculating man , now , it would do him good . HELEN Turning the leaves of the book , and pausing here and there at a page as something interesting catches her eye . How 's poor old Mrs. Swazy getting along ? SAM . In a matter-of-fact way . First-rate . She 'll pull through this time . As the scene progresses , SAM moves about restlessly , as though preoccupied with something . He is never far away from HELEN and always has his eyes and attention focused upon her . HELEN . Looking up at him with awe and wonder . Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proudly but ingenuously . Well , they 'll have to acknowledge that you 're a great physician now . SAM . Laughs . Great fiddlesticks ! Why , the folks around here would n't let me doctor a sick kitten if they could help it . HELEN . Why , you 'll get the credit of this ! SAM . Yes ! Me and the Lord ! Laughs . I 'm satisfied so long as the old lady gets well . HELEN is still sitting on the bench , glancing over the book , a look of contentment and happiness upon her face . SAM , who has been leaning against the barnyard fence , goes to her thoughtfully , his whole manner changed . He stands slightly above her to the left , puts one foot on the bench , leans on his knee and bends over her , and says in a rather quiet tense voice SAM . Nell  --  I want to tell you something . HELEN . Without looking up , says gayly as SAM pauses . Something good , I hope . SAM . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? HELEN . With a teasing little laugh , looking up at him over her shoulder . Most  --  always , Sam ! SAM . Quietly , looking down into her eyes . I 'm going away . HELEN seems stunned . The joy passes out of her face ; her eyes are still upon him , but all the happiness is gone from them . The book drops from her hands and falls to the ground . She slowly slides along the bench away from him as though to study him better . She is pale and frightened , and in a dry voice with a low cry of pain , she says : HELEN . Oh !  --  Sam ! Then , feeling it can not be true , she leans towards him and adds in a very appealing voice , Honest ? SAM . Quietly . Honest . What 's the use of my staying here ? Sits down left of HELEN . Nobody 'll speak to me except Nathan'l  --  and your mother  --  and you . Putting his arm around her . HELEN . Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't , Sam  --  Please do n't . SAM . With a dry laugh . And you 're half afraid to . HELEN . Brokenly . No ! I 'm not afraid  --  only you know  --  Father says  --  SAM . In the same manner . I know  --  they all say it . Blake says I 've got dynamite in my boots . Just because I ca n't believe as they do  --  they wo n't any of ' em look at me if they can help it . So I 'm going out West , where a fellow can believe as he likes and talk as he likes  --  HELEN . With awe , her eyes upon him . To  --  Chicago ? SAM . Amused . Oh no  --  o ! A fellow may believe what he likes in Chicago , but he must n't say too much about it . I 'm going a-w-a-y out West . Montana  --  or somewhere out that way . HELEN . Innocently , in a pathetic voice . Oh my ! I 'll never get so far as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising and walking up centre . I want to get where I can sprout a new idea without being sat on . HELEN . In a crushed voice . Yes , of course  --  you 're right . SAM . Where I wo n't be hampered by dead men 's laws and dead men 's creeds . HELEN . Turning to him in a chiding manner . Why , you do n't blame Father for believing as his father believed , do you ? SAM . No . But I do blame him for sitting down on me just because I ca n't believe the same way . I tell you , Nell  --  He picks up a pebble.  --  one world at a time is good enough for me ; and I 've made up my mind that I 'm going to live while I 'm in this one  --  He throws the pebble as far as he can reach , watching its flight  --  and I 'm going to do something more than practice medicine in Berry . Sitting around , waiting for patients  --  Rather contemptuously  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pockets and turns down centre . HELEN . Getting up from the bench and going to him , centre . Yes . But  --  what 's going to become of me ? SAM goes to her with arms outstretched , and enfolds her lovingly . SAM . Tenderly . You ! You 're going to stay right here with your mother , till I get started . Then I 'm coming back to get you and take you out there and show those western fellows a real Yankee girl . Amused . You know , Nell , the newspapers used to print pictures of them with pants on and a stove pipe hat ! HELEN . Making a pitiful effort to be cheerful . Yes ! But they do n't do that now , Sam . SAM . No , they do not do that now . You girls have come to stay , there 's no getting around that fact , and we cranks are going to help you stay here . He notices the book lying on the ground . Let me show you something in that book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm remains about HELEN . She sits down , he picks up the book and sits at her left , and they both become deeply absorbed in reading . MARTIN enters from the barn , leading a horse by the halter to water him at the trough . Footnote : 1Kb His head is bent and he is in deep thought , pondering upon the idea of getting rich which BLAKE has suggested to him . He does not see HELEN and SAM until he turns to re-enter the barn . When his eyes rest upon them , so content and absorbed in each other , he pauses amazed , and his face flames with bitter resentment . He is unable to speak for a moment , then he blurts out harshly , MARTIN . Sam Warren , hai n't yeh got no more pride than to come where yeh ai n't wanted ? SAM and HELEN start in surprise . HELEN shyly draws away from SAM . SAM looks up with a very affable air and says pleasantly and respectfully , SAM . Hello , Mr. Berry ! Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , what yeh doin ' here , then ? SAM . Looking at HELEN slyly as if it were a good joke . I thought  --  I was wanted . MARTIN . Taking a menacing step towards him . Did n't I tell yeh yeh wa' n't ? SAM . Smiling , but rather reluctantly . Yes sir ,  --  you did ! SAM plays this scene very quietly , never losing his temper ; plays it as if something else of more immediate importance were on his mind . The scene throughout is pitched in a quick staccato , which reaches its height in HELEN 'S cry of terror as the two men clinch . Then there is a pause , and the rest of the scene , until MARTIN leaves the stage , is completed in tense low tones that are portentous of trouble . There is active hate on MARTIN 'S part . SAM 'S attitude is one of simple manly poise . MARTIN . Well , ai n't thet enough ? SAM . Pleasantly . Yes , I suppose it is  --  but I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goes towards him . MARTIN . Goaded by SAM 'S manner , fiercely . I do n't want to know nothin ' ! An ' I do n't want her to know nothin ' thet I do n't want her to know ! Indicating HELEN with a nod of his head . SAM . Making another effort to conciliate him . Why you see , Mr. Berry  --  you ca n't help  --  MARTIN . Breaking in and shouting at him . I 'm a-bringin ' up my family ! An ' I do n't want no interference from you  --  nor Darwin  --  nor any o ' the rest o ' the breed ! With a passionate sweep of his arm . He half turns as if to go . SAM . Smiling . Darwin 's dead , Mr. Berry  --  MARTIN . Turning and interrupting , resentfully . Them books ai n't dead . SAM . Very positive and very much satisfied with his statement . No ! " Them books " are going to be pretty hard to kill . MARTIN . Sharply , turning to HELEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thet yeh got there now ? Indicating the book with a wrathful toss of his arm . HELEN . Very gently . One of Sam 's books , Father . MARTIN . Glaring at SAM . Well , give it right straight back to Sam . I do n't want nothin ' to do with him nor his books . SAM . Kindly , correcting him . It is my book , Mr. Berry , but it was written by a man  --  MARTIN . His temper rising steadily , flashes at him . I wo n't hev yeh a-bringin ' them books here ! A-learnin ' my daughter a pack o ' lies , about me an ' my parents a-comin ' from monkeys  --  SAM . His eyes twinkling with suppressed amusement , answers soothingly . La bless you , Mr. Berry ! That was ages ago ! MARTIN . Is goaded to the extreme by SAM 'S manner . I do n't care how long ago it was , I wo n't hev it flung in my children 's faces . HELEN is much distressed by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm him , and approaches MARTIN who has been standing near the barnyard gate . She timidly holds out the book to him , and says pleadingly : HELEN . Father , I wish you 'd let me read you this little bit  --  MARTIN . With ugly stubbornness , checks her with a sweep of his arm , as though pushing away some harmful or noxious thing . I do n't want to hear it . I read The Bangor Whig , an ' The Agriculturist , an ' the Bible , an ' thet 's enough . There ai n't no lies in them . SAM . Ironically . No , especially in The Bangor Whig ! Here the staccato changes to a deep ominous murmur . MARTIN . Peering at SAM through half-closed lids , mutters , I 'm skeered of a man thet ai n't got no religion . SAM . With quiet assurance . But , Mr. Berry , I have got a religion . MARTIN . Doubtfully , in the same manner . What is it ? SAM . His manner becoming serious , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep of his arm . Do you hear those insects singing ? MARTIN . Rather puzzled , mumbles . Yes  --  I hear ' em ! SAM . Seriously and calmly . Well , that 's their religion , and I reckon mine 's just about the same thing . MARTIN . With supreme disgust and contempt in his voice and manner . Oh ! Good Lord ! He starts for the barn with the horse . HELEN . With tender appeal , swiftly following him . Father , why wo n't you ever let Sam tell you  --  MARTIN , goaded to the breaking point , turns upon HELEN , dropping the halter and allowing the horse to go into the barn . MARTIN . Hardly able to control his rage . Look a-here , Nell ! I 've had all the words I 'm goin ' to hev with you  --  Shaking his closed fist threateningly . But by the Eternal , I ai n't a-goin ' to hev thet fellah a-comin ' here preachin ' his infidelity to my family . Frantic with rage , he now says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want him , you take him , an ' clear out ! SAM approaches quickly , intensely moved by what MARTIN has said . SAM . Do you mean that , Mr. Berry ? HELEN . Her head high in the air , her whole attitude one of noble defiance . I will ! As though accepting the challenge . MARTIN . Looks at HELEN , quite broken , all the fire of his passion in ashes , and murmurs thickly , Yeh wo n't ? HELEN . Proudly , her eyes full of burning tears , her voice vibrating with emotion . Wo n't I ? You 'll see whether I will or not ! There is a challenge in her voice too . SAM . Moving towards MARTIN , intensely excited by his words . Mr. Berry  --  if you 'll say that again  --  MARTIN . Springs at SAM and clutches him by the throat . Damn you ! SAM . Swiftly seizes MARTIN 'S wrist with his left hand , drawing back his right hand to strike . Damn you ! HELEN . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calls out appealingly , Oh ! Sam  --  do n't ! The sound of HELEN 'S voice brings both men to their senses , and they relax their hold upon each other . They stand silent for a moment , both a little ashamed . Then MARTIN says in a heartbroken manner , MARTIN . D'yeh mean to steal my child from me ? SAM . Quietly , adjusting his collar . I 'm not going to steal her , Mr. Berry  --  I 'm going out West to earn her ! MARTIN . Speaking through his teeth , vehemently . Sam Warren , I hated you afore  --  but now you 've shamed me afore my own child . Git off'n my farm an ' do n't yeh never set foot o n't agin  --  Quite low and passionately . It 's dangerous fer both on us . MARTIN wearily drags himself into the barn . HELEN stands dazed and heartbroken . SAM leans against the fence , his hands in his pockets , his head bent , deep in thought . There is a moment 's pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is a woman of forty-five , handsome in a wholesome , motherly way . She is dressed in a freshly laundered , becoming calico dress , and her sleeves are rolled up beyond the elbows , showing a pair of shapely arms . She is quick and energetic in all her movements . To her , home is the most desirable place in the world , and she rules it with all the skill and love of a typical American housewife . Her manner is pleasant and happy . She is always smiling and always sees the best side of everything . Nothing disturbs her ; she meets all the problems of her daily life with a quiet and unobtrusive efficiency . ANN . Well Helen , I was jes ' a-wonderin ' what 'd become o ' you . Sam Warren ! I hup Martin hai n't seen yeh ; I say , hai n't seen yeh . SAM . Yes , he has  --  ANN . Did n't he hev a tantrum ; I say , a tantrum ? HELEN . Concealing her true feelings , listlessly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as much as  --  ANN . I want to know ! Well , there must ha ' ben sumpthin ' powerful on his mind ; I say , on his mind . SAM . I guess there is now , if there was n't before . Sadly . ANN . Well , Nell , blow the horn . Dinner 's all sot an ' I do n't want it to git cold . Sorry I ca n't ask yeh to stop , Sam ; I say , I 'm sorry I ca n't ask yeh to stop . She goes into the house . SAM . Thank you , I do n't think I 'd enjoy the meal . HELEN and he look at each other , her eyes fill with tears . HELEN goes up to the fence , picks up the horn hanging there and blows it twice . Then she turns back to SAM , letting the horn slip from her hand to the ground . SAM . Slowly . Well , Nell , I suppose you and I might just as well say good-bye now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of parting with him , holds out her hand , which he takes . Good-bye , Sam . Cries . SAM . Very tenderly . Good-bye , Nell . Draws her to him . Do n't cry ! I do n't know how soon I 'll get away , but just as soon as I can I will . I 'll try to see you before I go  --  if not  --  I 'll  --  HELEN . Pleadingly . You ca n't take me with you , can you , Sam ? SAM . Wistfully . No , Nell , I ca n't . I have n't got money enough . I ought to have a hundred dollars more than I 've got to get away myself . Meditatively . I wonder if Blake 'd lend me a hundred dollars . HELEN . Still struggling with her tears . I would n't ask him  --  he 'd only refuse you . She breaks down and clings to SAM like a child . It 's going to be awful lonesome  --  SAM . Deeply moved . I know  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now  --  Taking both her hands in his . I thought this was going to be one of those partings without tears  --  Trying to cheer her up  --  nor promises  --  nothing but just confidence . HELEN . Making an effort to overcome her grief . All right  --  Sam . Lifting her head and taking a deep breath to get hold of herself , bravely but still with a slight break in her voice . If I do n't see you before you go , good-bye . Goes to the house , as if to go inside , stops at the door and turns as though struck by a sudden thought . I do n't think you 'd better come here again , Sam . I do n't want to quarrel with Father if I can help it  --  With a note of fatality . I 'll have to some day I know  --  but I want to avoid it just as long as I can . She smiles and tries to brave it out , but it is plain that she is silently crying . SAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though loth to leave her . He can not control his own feelings . He turns away abruptly as he says Good-bye , Nell , keep up your courage , my girl . And remember , it is n't as though it was forever , you know . He goes off right above the house . HELEN . Her eyes follow him off . Good-bye , Sam . Waves her hand as if in response to him and calls after him . Take good care of yourself , wo n't yeh ? SAM . Speaking off stage , as though from a little distance . I 'll take care of myself , you take care of yourself . HELEN turns slowly away and drags herself broken and weary into the house . There is a brief pause , then MARY BERRY , a lively girl of about 10 , comes running from the road , left , into the yard . She has a little bunch of wild flowers in her hand . She is skipping gayly , and just as she is about to enter the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with rosy cheeks and dancing eyes , runs on excitedly from the left , with his schoolbooks tied in a strap , and says , BOB . Mary , Mary , take my books in the house , I 'm goin ' in swimmin ' . He throws the books into her hands and runs off right , above the house . MARY . Calling after him , Bob Berry , if you go in swimmin ' I 'll tell yer Ma . BOB . In the distance , off right . Tell if yeh want to  --  ol ' tattle tale . MARY . Running into the house . Ma , Ma , Bob 's goin ' in swimmin '  --  IKE RICHARDS , LEM CONANT , ABE HIGGINS and STEVE BAILEY , farmhands , enter from the left . With them is TIM HAYES , the hired man , a good-natured , red-headed Irishman . They are playing with an old football , laughing and scuffling in a friendly way . GATES , with MANDY in his wake , follows the men on , and watches them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIM . Good-naturedly . Let the ould man have a kick . The others jeer at this . ABE . He ca n't kick it , he 's too old . GATES . Enraged . Too old , am I ? You jes ' see . GATES seises the ball and gives it a tremendous kick which sends it flying down the road . The men cheer him derisively . GATES picks up a chip and puts it on his shoulder . GATES . To ABE , assuming a defiant attitude . If I 'm too old , you jes ' knock this chip off'n my shoulder . ABE hesitates , but the other men urge him on , at last forcing him into the fight . He and GATES have a brief , rough-and-tumble wrestling match , which ends when GATES ducks ABE in the water trough . The men greet ABE 'S defeat with shouts of laughter , and he hurries somewhat sheepishly into the house , followed by the others . GATES looks after them , wagging his head triumphantly . GATES . Calling after them . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they used to . An ' they do n't make boys like they used to , nuther ! With an air of high satisfaction he goes off , down the road , lower right , followed by MANDY . Enter UNCLE NAT along the road , upper right , wheeling MILLIE in the barrow . MILLIE has a line through the rod of the barrow , and is pretending to drive . UNCLE NAT . Talking as he enters . An ' after that they lived in peace and died in Greece , an ' was buried in a pot of honey . MILLIE . What 's the else of it , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . There ai n't no else to it . Besides , this hoss do n't do ' nother stroke of work till he gets his oats . He wheels the barrow down stage below the bench , right . MILLIE . Climbing out . Wait till I unhitch yeh  --  UNCLE NAT . This is a new fangled hoss . He can hitch himself up and unhitch himself , and currycomb himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the trough and starts to wash his hands . MILLIE . Following him up to the trough . Hossy want a drink ? UNCLE NAT . No  --  hossy do n't want a drink . Hossy wants to wash his hands so thet he can set down to the table like a clean respect'ble hoss . MILLY splashes water in his face . He staggers back , pretending to be drenched and shaking the wet off . Is thet what yen call givin ' hossy a drink ? MILLIE . Chuckling . Yep . UNCLE NAT . Well , the fust thing yeh know , this hoss 'll duck yeh in the hoss trough . MILLIE . No he wo n't . UNCLE NAT . Wo n't he ? You jes ' see if he wo n't . He talks to MILLIE in the manner of one child talking to another . You ca n't throw water in a hossy 's face without makin ' him mad no more than yeh can give a elephant a chaw o ' terbacker without makin ' him mad . Did yeh ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ! UNCLE NAT . Well , do n't yeh try it , cause I knowed a boy in a circus once that give a elephant a chaw o ' terbacker , an ' he did n't see thet boy agin fer more n ' a hundred years . But he jes ' remembered it an ' he blew water all over him . I tell yeh , elephants has got good memories  --  UNCLE NAT takes a clean bandanna handkerchief out of his pocket and wipes his hands . He is about to enter the house , when he is stopped by the voice of MARTIN , who comes from the barn and pauses outside the barnyard gate . MILLIE resumes her play in the sand . MARTIN . Casually . Nathan'l . UNCLE NAT . Kindly . Hello , Martin . MARTIN . Be yeh hungry ? UNCLE NAT . Still mechanically wiping his hands . Not powerful , but able to git away with my rayshuns ' thout no coaxin ' I guess . Why ? Taking a step towards MARTIN . MARTIN . Still casually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studying his face closely  --  an ' I d'know 's I 'll hev a better chance . UNCLE NAT . Cheerily ; putting his handkerchief back in his pocket . I d'know 's yeh will , Martin . He moves a few steps down right ; MARTIN is up left centre near the barnyard . MARTIN . Hesitates , picks up a stick , takes out a jackknife and whittles it , looking intently at the stick and walking down a few steps towards UNCLE NAT , He seems rather to dread saying what is on his mind . UNCLE NAT looks at him furtively ; this unusual request puzzles him ; he is apprehensive that it is of HELEN and BLAKE that his brother wishes to talk , and a look of disapproval sweeps into his eyes . His face grows a bit stern , but his manner is kindly and attentive . After a pause MARTIN blurts out abruptly , Mr. Blake 's been here . UNCLE NAT . Gazes at him curiously , looks off right as if he could still see BLAKE 'S buggy there , picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hez ' e ? Seats himself on the wheelbarrow . MARTIN . Seating himself on the stable bucket which he has turned bottom , upward . Yes . He argues that we 'd ought to cut the farm up into buildin ' lots . UNCLE NAT . Is dazed by this . It is so sudden and unexpected that he scarcely gets its full meaning , as he murmurs in a low tense voice , Dooze ' e ? MARTIN . Y-e-s . He says there 's a boom a-comin ' an ' the land 's too val'able to work . UNCLE NAT . Murmurs mechanically , Dooze  --  ' e  --  ? MARTIN . Yes . He wants I should pool in with him , an ' build cottages an ' sell ' em at a hundred per cent more'n they cost , an ' git 's rich 's Jay Gould . Slowly it comes to UNCLE NAT that his brother is saying  --  " Sell the farm . " He grows cold  --  there is a heavy painful lump where his heart was beating a moment ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine  --  no more music in the day . Sell the farm  --  the dear fields with all their slopes and undulations , the great old silver birches guarding the orchard from the pastures , the gnarled oaks along the rocky shore . He knows in a thousand aspects this old farm , summer and winter , always affable and friendly to him , and it is here he has learned to know God and love him . He answers casually enough in a tone of wonderment , UNCLE NAT . I want t ' know ' f he dooze . A moment 's pause . Where d 's he talk o ' beginnin ' ? MARTIN . Blurting out half defiantly , half shamefacedly . Out there at th ' north end o ' the shore front  --  an ' work back t ' his line . UNCLE NAT . The numbness passes and there is a tingling in his veins . Tense set lines come into his face and his voice grows vital . He talks with his usual clear cadence and gentle rhythm . Yeh do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right . MARTIN looks up and nods . Not up at the ol ' pastur ' ? MARTIN . Slowly Y  --  e  --  s  --  UNCLE NAT . In a tense voice . Dooze ' e calk'late to take in the knoll thet looks out t'Al'gator Reef ? MARTIN . As before . Y-e-s  --  I s'pose he  --  dooze . UNCLE NAT . Rising , speaking quietly , but with a quiver of smothered feeling in his voice . Did yeh tell him  --  ' bout  --  Mother 's bein ' buried there  --  ? MARTIN . Sulkily . He knows all ' bout thet jes ' as well as you do . UNCLE NAT . With significance , but very simply . Dooze . Well  --  what 's he calk'late to do with Mother ? MARTIN . He advises puttin ' on her in a cimitery up to Bangor . UNCLE NAT . A deprecating shadowy smile flits across his face ; he shakes his head slowly and replies , She 'd never sleep comfort'ble in no cimitery , Martin  --  Mother would n't . MARTIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull pa'sell . UNCLE NAT . Gently persuasive . Then who 's got so good a right to it as Mother has ? Yeh do n't begrutch it to her , do yeh , Martin ? MARTIN . I do n't begrutch nothin ' . Only , Blake says folks ai n't a-goin ' to pay fancy prices fer lots ' thout they hev their pick . UNCLE NAT . Gently reproachful . D'ye think any fancy price had ought to buy Mother 's grave , Martin ? MARTIN . Thet 's sent'mint ! UNCLE NAT . As though rebuked . Is it ? MARTIN . Yes , it is  --  Blake says  --  UNCLE NAT . Nodding his head , with a little sad , half-smile . Dooze  --  well  --  He sighs . P'r'aps ' t is  --  There is a pause ; then , as though a flood of memories had suddenly rushed over him . You do n't rec'llect much about Father  --  do yeh , Martin ? MARTIN . No . UNCLE NAT . You was so young  --  His eyes look far off down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clear cadence and soft rhythm are like the colours in a picture  --  a baby a'most , the evenin ' him an ' Si Leech was lost tryin ' to save the crew o ' thet ' ere brig  --  thet went to pieces on the reef yonder . Indicates over his shoulder with a nod of his head . MARTIN . Under the spell of UNCLE NAT 'S mood , is touched , and replies very gently , No . Mother'n you never seemed to care to talk much about thet . UNCLE NAT . Mother an ' me seen the hull thing from the p'int o ' thet ' ere knoll  --  With a slight indication of his head over his shoulder . After it was all over she sent me hum  --  told me to take care o ' you  --  said thet I need n't come back  --  thet she 'd stay there an ' wait fer him . ' Twa' n't no use t'argy with Mother , y'know , an ' so I went . I put you in yer cradle an ' sot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever passed jes ' sich a night  --  seemed s'kinder l-o-n-g . Pause . Jes ' as soon as it was light enough to see  --  I went back to find out what 'd come o ' her  --  I did n't know but what she might hev  --  but she had n't  --  she was there  --  jes ' where I left her  --  I do n't believe she 'd moved an inch the hull night . It had been a-rainin '  --  Pause . Her eyes was sot in her head and starin ' right out to sea  --  ef I 'd ' a ' met her any other place but there , I swear I would n't ' a ' know 'd ' r . I took her by the hand to sort o ' coax ' r away , " Nathan'l , " she says , " when I die  --  I want yeh should bury me right here on this spot  --  so 's ef Father ever dooze come back  --  he 'll find me waitin ' fer him . " I hed to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice sounded so kinder strange  --  seemed as ef it come from way off somewheres . Pause . She lived a good many years after thet  --  but I do n't believe she ever missed a day ' thout goin ' over t ' thet knoll . I allus sort o ' imagined she wa' n't never jes ' right in her head after thet night . UNCLE NAT is lost in memories for a moment . Then catching his breath and pulling himself together , he continues , Well , Martin , there she is . We buried her there at last  --  you an ' me did . I d'know , but seems to me  --  ef I was you  --  I 'd kinder hate to sell thet fer a buildin ' lot . Thet is , I 'd want to be pooty partic'lar who I sold it to . MARTIN . In the manner of a spoilt child , closing his knife with a sharp click . I 'm tired o ' lightkeepin ' . UNCLE NAT . Warmly , with quick understanding . I do n't blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh need n't do it no longer . Tim an ' me kin take keer o ' the light jes ' as well 's not . I only sort o ' hang onto it ' cause father had it put there , an ' the Gover'ment named it after him  --  he used to think so much o ' that . MARTIN . Defending himself . You give me your interest in the farm anyhow  --  made it all over to me the day I was married . UNCLE NAT . Warmly with a fine spirit of conciliation . I know it an ' I hai n't never regretted it . I ai n't a-regrettin ' of it now . MARTIN . Peevishly . You seem to kind o ' shameface me for wantin ' to sell it . UNCLE NAT . Did n't mean to , Martin  --  it 's only nat'ral thet I should feel kind o ' bad to see the ol ' place cut up  --  but law sakes ! Who 'm I thet I should set my face agin improvements I 'd like to know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' children , an ' a family , an ' all thet . Mr. Blake mus ' be right . So go ' head an ' build , an ' git rich , an ' move up to Boston ef yeh want to . Only , Martin  --  do n't sell thet . Indicating over his shoulder , right , with his head . Leave me thet , an ' I 'll build o n't an ' stay an ' take keer o ' th ' light , as long 's I kin  --  an ' after thet  --  why  --  well , after thet  --  yeh kin put both on us in a cimitery ef yeh hev a mind to . His voice trails off into silence . MARTIN stands downcast . UNCLE NAT remains immovable , self-hypnotised by the recital of his story  --  somehow all the sting of it has passed and he is at peace . He is still contemplating the remote days of his boyhood , and he stands there picking a bit of string into fine shreds too deeply absorbed to be aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . ANN enters briskly from the house . ANN . Sakes alive ! Martin Berry , ai n't you a-comin ' to yer dinner to-day ? I say to-day ? Goes up centre and looks off right . MARTIN . Slowly , starting towards house . Yes , I was jest a-comin ' . As he crosses to the house , he says very gently , Nathan'l , dinner 's waitin ' . He goes slowly and thoughtfully into the house . ANN . Looking up the road and calling , Bob  --  B-o-b ! Bob B-e-r-r-y  --  Come out o ' thet water  --  Come to yer dinner !  --  Yer back 'll be all blistered ! She sees MILLIE lying asleep and goes down to her . Bless thet child , she 's clean fagged out ! Come to Ma , precious . She takes MILLIE tenderly in her arms . Come Nathan'l , your dinner 'll be stun cold . I say stun cold . She goes into the house with the child . UNCLE NAT stands deep in meditation . THE CURTAIN DESCENDS SLOWLY ACT SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SCENE : A quaint old New England farmhouse kitchen of the better class , used partly as a living room . There is a large window centre , full of pots of growing flowers . Beneath the window is a table upon which HELEN places cups and saucers and from which she serves tea during the dinner . To the right of the window is a wooden sink with an old-fashioned hand pump , and there is a large stove to the left of the window , upon which a kettle is boiling and pots are stewing . Behind it is a woodbox . On the shelf back of the stove stands an old-fashioned cuckoo clock . A sturdy old open stairway is against the left wall , and at the back of it is a row of pegs , where hang UNCLE NAT 'S old army coat and cap , and HELEN 'S jacket and tam-o ' - shanter . There is a door leading to the woodhouse to the left of the stove . Standing parallel to the stairs is a long dining table , covered with a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy old-fashioned mahogany sideboard , from which HELEN later takes small articles , such as tumblers , and salt and pepper holders . At the foot of the stairs a door opens into the sitting room . There is a worktable , right , below the sink , covered with material for making bread , and on it are several loaves of bread fresh from the oven . Below the worktable is a door leading outside . To the right , between the door and the sink is an alcove where stands a large old-fashioned dresser , holding dishes , pans , and various kitchen furnishings , also several large pies . At the rise of the curtain , ANN , HELEN and PERLEY are in the midst of extensive preparations for dinner . MILLIE is down right , by a chair , making doll 's bread , very intent on her work . ANN is hot and flustered . She is dressed in an old-fashioned black silk dress , open at the neck , with a white lace collar . The skirt is pinned up , showing a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big white apron over all . PERLEY is cool and unconcerned . MARY and BOB , with aprons over their best clothes , are sitting on the stairs , polishing spoons and forks . HELEN is setting the table . She is dressed daintily in a simple muslin frock , and also wears a large apron to protect her dress . She is grave and thoughtful ; the memory of the encounter with her father is still sharp upon her . She moves about , doing her work with swift deft touches . ANN . At the stove , stirring the cranberry sauce . Sakes alive ! I hup another silver weddin ' wo n't come in this house in a hurry ; I say , in a hurry . She goes to the table , and starts sharpening a carving knife , preparatory to cutting a large loaf of bread which is on the table . HELEN . At the foot of the table , as she finishes placing the knives and forks . Ma , I 've arranged all the presents on the centre table . Smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . The sitting room looks like a jewelry store . She goes to the sideboard , left , and takes from it a glass jar holding teaspoons , and places it on the centre of the table . MARY . Oh , let 's go'n see ! Runs off into the sitting room . BOB . Yes , let 's do . Follows MARY . HELEN . Are n't you proud of them , Mother ? ANN . Seriously . Helen , you know what the Bible says about pride 's one day havin ' a fall . No , I ai n't proud . Turning and coming down slowly towards the centre of the stage , absentmindedly drawing the carving knife across the steel as she talks . Of course , it 's nice to be so remembered by everybody , an ' there 's a good many nice presents there  --  some I ben a-wishin ' fer . But I think I value yourn an ' the young uns an ' Nathan'l 's an ' Martin 's the best o ' the lot . Not thet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fills up , hastily brushes away a tear with the back of her hand , and turns to the stove to hide her emotion . Lifts the griddle and pokes the fire . How like the O'l Harry this fire dooze burn ! Seems es ef everythin ' went agin me to-day ; I say , to-day . Calls . Tim ! To PERLEY , sharply . Tell Tim I want him . Puts the griddle back on the stove , and closes the damper . PERLEY goes down to the door , right , opens it , and calls TIM , each time in a different and higher key . PERLEY . Ti-m  --  T-i-m  --  T-i-i-m-m  --  TIM Outside , in the distance . More power to ye , but it 's the foine loongs ye have in ye ! Fwat is it ? PERLEY . Mis ' Berry wants y-o-u . Goes back to her work . ANN . To PERLEY , handing her a saucepan of potatoes . Mash them ' taters ; I say , mash them ' taters . PERLEY gets the potato masher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peels and mashes them , adding butter , salt and a little milk . TIM appears at the door in his shirt sleeves . TIM . Fwat is it , ye Andhrewscoggin ' mermaid , ye ? He starts to come into the room . ANN . Stopping him , peremptorily . Scrape yer feet , Tim Hayes , an ' do n't track the hull cow shed over my clean floor ; I say , clean floor . She is standing near the window , centre . TIM . Wipes his feet on the door mat , and speaks ingratiatingly . Yis ma'am . I will ma'am . Fwat can I do for ye ? ANN . I want you should split me a handful of fine wood ; this ' ere fire 's actin ' like the very Ol ' Nick to-day ; I say , to-day . TIM goes into the woodhouse , and reappears almost immediately with a handful of small wood which he gives to ANN , who puts a few pieces on the fire . He returns to the woodhouse and during the next scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now finished mashing the potatoes ; speaking through TIM 'S business . What yeh want I should do ' th these ' ere ' taters ? ANN . Put ' em in a veg'table dish an ' set ' em in the ov'n to brown ; I say , to brown . PERLEY puts the potatoes into a vegetable dish , smooths them over , shakes two or three spots of pepper on them , and puts them in the oven . She takes plenty of time over this . ANN stirs the cranberries , tastes them , lifts up the kettle and sets it back , and puts the griddle on the hole . UNCLE NAT appears at the top of the stairs , dressed in a new " store " suit . He looks very important and proud , and glances down expecting all eyes to be upon him , but nobody notices him . He comes down a few steps . His new boots hurt him , and he pauses and bends his feet on the toes , as if to ease the boots , murmuring to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He straightens up , comes down a few more steps , and again eases his right boot and , making a wry face , he slips his foot partly out of the boot , and finishes the descent limping , but with a comfortable sense of relief . When he is well towards the left centre of the stage , he stands , anxious to be noticed . UNCLE NAT . In a jubilant tone . Well , Helen , I got ' em on ! HELEN . Coming down to his left , and speaking delightedly . Oh Uncle Nat ! Ma , look ! Is n't he sweet ? ANN . Stops in her work at the table in front of the window , and comes down right of him . Well Nathan'l , how nice you do look ; I say , look . PERLEY comes forward a few steps and gazes at him admiringly . UNCLE NAT . How do they fit me ? ANN . Jes ' es ef they was made  --  HELEN . More critically . Turn round , Uncle Nat . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy over the impression he is creating , for it is many a long day since he had a new suit of clothes . HELEN smooths the back of his coat down with her hand . The waist might be a trifle longer . Do n't you think so , Ma ? ANN . Inspecting him carefully with her arms on her hips . Oh ! Do you think so ? Seems to me 's ef ' t was meant to be jes ' thet way . Goes back to the stove . I say , jes ' thet way . HELEN . Well , maybe it was . A pause . She returns to her work at the table . UNCLE NAT . Fingering his vest . Helen , there 's a button come off this vest a'ready . I guess they 're jes ' stuck on . I wish you 'd sew ' em on with thread , by ' n ' by . HELEN . All right , Uncle Nat , good strong thread . UNCLE NAT . With a complete change of manner , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along  --  I hope yeh hai n't sp'ilt nothin ' sence I ben away . Helen , will you get me my apron . He takes off his coat and places it carefully over the back of a chair , and comes down centre . HELEN gets him a woman 's checked apron . I want you should tie it in a bowknot so that when the company comes , I can get it off handy . He stands with arms outstretched ; HELEN ties the apron around him just beneath his shoulders . He pushes it down . Not too high-waisted , not too high-waisted . He pushes his foot back into the boot and limps to the stove . How 's the ol ' cranberries gettin ' on ? Slight pause . Who sot these cranberries on the back of the stove ? Looks around at them all accusingly . Do n't yeh know nothin ' in this house , or do n't yeh ? Lifts up the saucepan and puts it on the front of the stove . Tastes the cranberries , and says reproachfully , Oh Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranberries , yeh got ' em too sweet . I had ' em jes ' right when I left ' em . Nobody answers . Ma , did you put any more sugar in them cranberries ? ANN . Busy at the table , right , speaking over her shoulder . I did n't put no more sugar in ' em . UNCLE NAT . Well somebody has . Helen , did you put any more sugar in them cranberries ? HELEN . No , Uncle Nat . UNCLE NAT . Well , somebody did . Turning to PERLEY in an accusing manner . Perley , did you put any more sugar in them cranberries ? PERLEY . A little resentfully , drawling . I hai n't teched ' em . UNCLE NAT . Testily , imitating her drawl . Well , somebody 's teched ' em . Cranberries could n't walk off the stove and get into the sugar bucket by themselves . PERLEY . They wuz a-scorchin ' , an ' I sot ' em back , thet 's all I done . UNCLE NAT . In disgust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ruther have I do n't know what around me than a lot of women when I 'm a-cookin ' of a dinner . Taking the saucepan off the stove , and setting it in the sink . Nell , dish out them cranberries and set ' em t ' cool some place ' r other , will yeh ? HELEN . Yes , in a minute . Gets a preserve dish from the alcove , dishes out the berries , and sets them on the table at the window . BOB runs on from the sitting room . BOB . Ma , can we play store with the presents ? ANN . Yes , play with ' em all you like , but do n't break any of ' em ; I say , do n't break any of ' em . BOB . Oh , we wo n't break ' em . Runs off . Mary ! Mary ! Ma says we can play with ' em . UNCLE NAT . With happy expectancy . Now , les ' see how the ol ' turkey 's a-gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damper is shut , and says indignantly , Now , in the name of common sense , who shut up thet damper ! Opens the damper with a jerk . ANN . Yeh must ' a ' done it yerself . UNCLE NAT . Upon my word , a man ca n't leave a stove out of his hands five minutes without somebody a-foolin ' with it . He opens the oven door and looks at the turkey , his face aglow with admiration . They all stand around him , very much interested . By George , ai n't he a beauty ? In a grieved tone . Who turned him on his back ? I had him on his side . HELEN . You want him to brown all over , do n't you ? UNCLE NAT . See here , who 's cookin ' this turkey , you or me ? Smacking his lips . Get the platter , he 's done . Ef he stays in there any longer , he 'll be burned to a crisp . HELEN gets a platter from the dresser . Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dishtowel . All is bustle and excitement as he lifts out the dripping pan , and sets it on top of the stove . UNCLE NAT is left and the women are right of the stove . TIM comes in from the woodhouse with an armful of wood , both large and small pieces , which he dumps into the woodbox , afterwards brushing the chips which cling to his sleeve into the box . He stands and looks admiringly at the turkey . UNCLE NAT . Glowing with pride . What do you think of thet for a turkey , eh Tim ? TIM . As they say in ould Ireland , that 's a burrd ! He goes over to PERLEY , who stands near the sink , right , throws his arm around her , and hugs her roughly and quickly . She hits him with a dishcloth , and he runs out down right , laughing , followed by PERLEY hitting the air with the dishcloth , trying to reach him . After he goes , she returns coolly to her work at the sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on the turkey . UNCLE NAT . To ANN and HELEN , chuckling ; speaking through TIM 'S business . I wonder what they call a turkey in Ireland , a critter ? Give me a large fork . HELEN gives him one . Now a big spoon . ANN gives him one . ANN . As UNCLE NAT starts to lift the turkey out with the fork and spoon . Be careful . Do n't stick the fork into the turkey ; ef you break the skin , the juice 'll all run out ; I say , run out . HELEN . Be careful , Uncle Nat , do n't drop him . UNCLE NAT . Puts the turkey back in the pan , turns from one woman to the other , and says with gentle exasperation , Say , if you can find anythin ' to do about the house , I wish you 'd go an ' do it an ' leave me alone . Yeh 've got me s'nervous , I do n't know whether I 'm standin ' on my head or my heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyously There he is ! Now put him in the oven to keep warm , while I make the gravy . Proceeds to stir the gravy in the dripping pan . Nell , pour a little water in there , careful now . She pours some into the pan from the tea kettle . Thet 's enough . Thet 'll do  --  Thet 'll do ! He pushes the kettle spout up . HELEN . Protesting . Why , Uncle Nat , you wo n't have half gravy enough ! Attempts to pour more in . Ma , I wish you 'd look at this . UNCLE NAT . Turning to ANN . Ma , you attend to your own business . While UNCLE NAT is talking to ANN , HELEN pours more water into the pan . UNCLE NAT turns and sees her doing it , and he pushes the spout up and burns his fingers . HELEN drops the kettle on the stove . UNCLE NAT . Now you 've done it , Nell ! You 've got enough gravy to sail a boat in . Blowing his scalded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with some flour , do n't you ? Here ! She takes the dredging box and sifts in the flour . UNCLE NAT . Making the best of it , stirs in the flour as she sifts . Thet 'll do  --  Thet 'll do  --  Thet 'll do ! Do you want to make a paste of it ? Oh , Nell , do n't put so much in , you 've got it all full o ' lumps now . Unconsciously blowing his scalded fingers , holding them up in the air , and then again blowing them . HELEN . All right , Uncle Nat . Make the gravy yourself . She returns to her work . UNCLE NAT . After a slight pause . He is now stirring the gravy . Now gim me the giblets , an ' I 'll stir ' em in an ' make the giblet sass . There is no answer . He speaks a little louder . I say , some one o ' yeh gim me the giblets , an ' I 'll make the giblet sass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , as if to say " What are we going to do now ? " Come , hurry up ! A pause , UNCLE NAT blows his fingers . Gim me the giblets I tell you ! Silence . HELEN crosses over to PERLEY . UNCLE NAT gets impatient . Will yeh gim me the giblets , Ma ? ANN . I do n't know where they be . UNCLE NAT . They 're in the choppin ' tray , wherever you stuck it . ANN . Holding up the empty chopping tray , and showing it to him . No they ai n't nuther ; I say , nuther . UNCLE NAT . As he continues to stir the gravy . Well , they was there . What yeh done with ' em ? ANN . I hai n't done nothin ' with ' em . UNCLE NAT . Getting testy again . Well , somebody 's done suthin ' with ' em . Turning to HELEN . Hev you seen ' em , Nell ? HELEN . No , Uncle Nat . UNCLE NAT . Well , somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perley , hev you been a-monkeyin ' with them giblets ? PERLEY . Who has been trying to escape observation by violently scouring a pan at the sink , blurts out . I fed ' em to the chickings . UNCLE NAT . Dropping the spoon with utter exasperation . Well , of all the durn gawks I ever see you beat all ! Thet ends the dinner ! No giblet sass . Me a-settin ' down fer half an hour a-choppin ' giblets fer you to feed to the chickings . Perley , yeh 're a nateral born gawk . ANN . Crossing to the table . Oh , Nathan'l , give me a hand with this table , will yeh ? UNCLE NAT . Going to the lower end of the table . What yeh want to do with it , Ma ? ANN . Oh , jes ' set it out a piece from the stair . UNCLE NAT . As they move the table slightly towards centre . Be keerful , Ma , it fell down last Washin'ton 's birthday . Crossing to the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope it wo n't keep any of the company away . ANN . Oh , I guess not . They ai n't nuther sugar nor salt ; I say , nuther sugar nor salt . MILLIE by this time has made all the dough into little loaves on a tin plate , and she now takes the plate to ANN . She has managed to get herself pretty well messed up with flour . MILLIE . Mama , please bake this for dolly'n me . ANN . Powers above ! Look at thet child ! What'n the name of all possessed hev yeh ben a-doin ' with yerself ? I say , a-doin ' with yerself ? MILLIE . Makin ' bwead for dolly ' n me . ANN . Smiling indulgently . Well , I should say you hed . Nathan'l , tend to thet baby ; I say , thet baby . She takes the plate of dough from MILLIE . During the following scene , ANN , HELEN and PERLEY busy themselves with the dinner things . UNCLE NAT . Yes , ef I did n't tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crosses to the sink , takes a clean towel and pumps water on one end of it . He then goes centre to MILLIE . Upon my word , Millie , this is too bad . Here 's company a-comin ' and you think we 've got nothin ' to do but run after you young uns every five minutes of the day . We put yeh all three this mornin '  --  why did n't yeh stay put ? Mussy , mussy , mussy , what a dirty child ! MILLIE . That ai n't dirt , it 's bwead . UNCLE NAT . Getting down on his knees , and beginning to clean her hands with the wet end of the towel . Well , it 's mighty dirty bread . Who 'd yeh ' spose 'd eat bread from such dirty hands as those ? Who you makin ' bread fer ? MILLIE . Dolly . UNCLE NAT . Drying her hands . Well , it 's a good thing that dolly 's only got one eye . She 'd never eat bread from such dirty hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . Washing her face . My sakes alive , why , you 'd scare all Mama 's visitors out o ' th ' house with such a dirty face . MILLIE . Talking through the towel . Bob 's got a false face . UNCLE NAT . What 's that ? MILLIE . Bob 's got a false face . UNCLE NAT . Drying her face . Hez he ? MILLIE . Yes . Talking through the towel . I wish you 'd buy me a false face , will yeh , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . You do n't want no false face , you want yer own sweet pooty little clean face . Kisses her . Now shake yer frock . She shakes it in his face . Do n't shake it in my face . Stand over there and shake it . MILLIE . Ai n't I a nice clean child now , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . You 're the nicest cleanest child in the hull State of Maine . As UNCLE NAT finishes making MILLIE tidy , the noise of approaching wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests except BLAKE arrive outside , amid great bustle and laughter , as if they had finished the journey in a race . Instantly all is excitement indoors . UNCLE NAT . Hello , Ann , here they be ! Crosses up left . Helen , take my apron off . She does so . UNCLE NAT puts on his coat quickly , and hurries off , right , leaving the door open . He is heard greeting the guests outside . ANN . Mussy on me , an ' I ai n't fit to be seen to a nigger clambake ; I say , clambake ! She takes her apron off . HELEN unpins her dress , and smooths it down . HELEN and PERLEY go to the window . BOB and MARY run in from the sitting room . MILLIE goes to the door , right . CAPTAIN BEN Outside . Hello , Nathan'l  --  Many happy returns o ' the day ! UNCLE NAT . Outside . Do n't git things mixed , Cap'n . This ai n't my fun'ral . All laugh . Step right in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosses . All the guests enter together , laughing and talking . CAPTAIN BEN HUTCHINS comes first . He is a jolly man of about fifty , half-farmer , half-skipper , with iron-grey hair and a full beard ; he wears a blue suit with brass buttons and a peaked cap . He is accompanied by LIDDY ANN NYE , a motherly widow in half-mourning . They are followed by SQUIRE ANDREWS , a very tall , wiry , distinguished-looking man about seventy-five . He is well-preserved , and has very grey hair and a pink face . He is very deaf , and carries a tin ear-trumpet which has seen much service . With him is MRS . ANDREWS , a tall woman with white hair ; she is dressed in good taste . The DOCTOR , MRS . LEONARD , and the TWINS enter last . The DOCTOR is a genial country physician . His wife is a trifle overdressed ; as her husband is a professional man , she feels a bit above the farmers ' wives . The twins are nicely dressed ; the boy is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trimmed with lace . The DOCTOR and the boy take off their hats as they enter . All the guests scrape their feet on the mat . They all speak at once . DOCTOR . Many happy returns of the day , Mrs. Berry ! MRS . LEONARD . Returns of the day , Mrs. Berry , I 'm sure . SQUIRE ANDREWS . Many happy returns of the day , Mis ' Berry ! MRS . ANDREWS . I wish you many happy returns of the day . CAPTAIN BEN . May ye live another twenty-five years , an ' invite us all agin . MRS . NYE . Well , Ann , I swan yeh look younger'n yeh did twenty-five years ago , an ' no wonder ! As they speak , they are all endeavouring to shake ANN by the hand . ANN .

She goes upstairs followed by PERLEY . BOB and MARY , one on each side of the TWINS , lead them by the hand in the direction of the sitting room . The DOCTOR , who is going out last , is stopped by MILLIE , who has a dilapidated doll , with no clothes , no hair , one eye , one arm and half a leg gone , in her arms . MILLIE . Tan ' oo ture my dolly , Doctor ? DOCTOR . Cure your dolly ? I guess so . What appears to be the matter with her ? Taking the doll , and entering into the mood of the child . MILLIE . She 's sick . DOCTOR . Sick ! Looking the doll over . I should say she was . What 's come of her other eye ? MILLIE . She swallowed it , an ' it 's down in her little tummick . DOCTOR . Is that so ? My , My ! She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's see what we can do for her . He goes out after the others , leading MILLIE . During this scene , HELEN has been busying herself with the table , putting on the bread , butter , cranberry sauce , etc . MARTIN and BLAKE enter through the door , right , BLAKE is in his best black suit , and MARTIN is dressed in his Sunday clothes . MARTIN . Speaking as he comes in . Where 's Ma , Helen ? Crosses over to the row of pegs at the back of the stairs and hangs up his hat . HELEN . Coldly . She 'll be here in a minute . Shows that she and her father have not been on the best of terms since the quarrel with SAM . She is not rude , however . As BLAKE notices HELEN 'S manner , he draws back and pretends to be wiping his feet on the doormat , so as not to hear what passes . He does not enter the room until MARTIN crosses the stage for his exit . MARTIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got over the sulks yet ? HELEN . I 'm not in any sulks , but I ca n't laugh when you stick pins in me . She crosses over to the stove , kneels down , opens the oven door and looks at the turkey . MARTIN . I do n't want to stick pins into yeh , Nell . You give up Sam Warren , an ' you an ' me 'll never have a word . HELEN . Speaking over her shoulder and temporarily stopping her work , trying to hide her feelings . He 'll not trouble any of us much longer , I guess . MARTIN . Pleased . Hev yeh forbid him a-seein ' of yeh ? HELEN . You have , have n't you ? MARTIN . Yes . HELEN . Well ? MARTIN . An ' ef he knows when he 's well off , he 'll do as I say . Company 's come , I see .

As MARTIN reaches the sitting room , he is heard saying genially , MARTIN . Be yeh all here ? THE GUESTS . Outside . Many happy returns of the day ! BLAKE . Whose eyes have been fixed on HELEN from the moment he entered . Well , Helen ! HELEN . Pleasantly , but distantly . How do you do , Mr. Blake . During this scene , HELEN goes to the sideboard , gets the tumblers and salt cellars , and begins arranging them on the table . She is at the left of the table ; BLAKE stands right centre . BLAKE . I suppose you 'll be hevin ' a silver weddin ' of your own one o ' these days , eh ? HELEN . Carelessly . I do n't know , I 'm sure . BLAKE . Did Sam tell yeh about wantin ' to borry a hundred dollars o ' me ? HELEN . Interested for the first time . No . When ? BLAKE . Yesterday afternoon . HELEN . Eagerly . Did you lend it to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give him a thousand if he 'd pick a fuss with you , clear out , an ' promise never to come back . HELEN . Smiling scornfully . What 'd he say ? BLAKE . Pauses deprecatingly . Said he 'd  --  see me in Hell fust . HELEN . H 'm ! As if to say " I knew he 'd say just that . " She turns and busies herself near the head of the table . CAPTAIN BEN . Outside . I said fifty fathom . THE GUESTS . Outside . Oh ! We did n't understand yeh , Cap'n Ben . BLAKE . Insinuatingly . Has yer father said anything to yeh about me lately ? HELEN . With a bitter little laugh . No , he does n't say much to me lately about anything , or anybody . BLAKE . Well ! I 've got the biggest scheme fer gettin ' him an ' me rich ! I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you . HELEN . Proudly . I do n't want you should do anything with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLAKE . Your father 's set his mind on you an ' me gettin ' married , y'know . HELEN . My father had better mind his own business . She picks up a pie and wipes the under part of the plate with a dishtowel . BLAKE . His own business ! Great Scott ! D'yeh mean to say it ai n't his business who his daughter marries ? HELEN . That 's just exactly what I mean to say . Crosses to the table , left , with the pie , and sets it on the table . BLAKE . Gives a long low whistle . Well , Sam Warren has filled your head with his new fangled ideas , an ' no mistake . HELEN . Filling up with tears . Never mind Sam Warren , Mr. Blake . I can talk for myself . BLAKE . That 's just why I think s'much of you . Helen , I 'm goin ' to be awful rich . I 'll give you half of every dollar I make for the next twenty years , if you 'll marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Mr. Blake , I ca n't marry you . She is left of the table ; BLAKE is right , close to the table . BLAKE . Wistfully . Too old , I suppose ? HELEN . Sighing heavily . No , it 's not that . That would n't make any difference to me . BLAKE . Too orthodox ? With large generosity . You need n't go to meetin ' if you do n't want to . You can read all the novels you 've a mind to . Beaming and enthusiastic , with a warm spirit of sacrifice . I 'll read them books with you . HELEN . With a hopeless little laugh . Oh , Mr. Blake , you do n't understand me . Crosses to the sink , taking off her apron . BLAKE . Intensely . No , nor you me . I never set my mind on a thing yet I did n't get . HELEN . Scornfully . I 'm afraid you 've done it this time , Mr. Blake . Gives her apron a vigorous and emphatic shake as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BLAKE . No , I have n't . I 'm goin ' to have you , Helen , or die a-tryin ' . She turns and looks at him ; he continues quickly , Nothin ' underhand though  --  nothin ' underhand . HELEN . With a scornful toss of her head . I should hope not . There is a note of defiance in her voice . UNCLE NAT enters through the door , right . UNCLE NAT . Helen  --  She runs to him and he says in a tense whisper . Sam 's out there by the wood pile . He 's got the money an '  --  HELEN . Joyously . Got the hundred dollars ? Where did he get it ? UNCLE NAT . Evading the question . He wants to see you  --  HELEN starts to go past him out the door . He stops her . Not thet way . Slip out through the woodhouse . HELEN runs out through the woodhouse door , left . BLAKE . Suspecting something , starts to go to the window as HELEN crosses outside . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between BLAKE and the window , picks up an apron and shakes it in his face . UNCLE NAT . Helen 's speckled pullet 's fell inter the rain barrel . BLAKE . Oh ! I hope she ai n't drowned . Trying to see through the window . UNCLE NAT . No , she ai n't drownded , but she 's awful wet . ANN comes down the stairs , all freshened up , followed by PERLEY . ANN Speaking as she comes down . Well , be we all ready , Perley ? PERLEY . Yes 'm . Puts the potatoes on the table . ANN . Well , let 's have ' em in , Nathan'l . UNCLE NAT . All right . You put the turkey on the table , an ' I 'll hev ' em in in three shakes of a lamb 's tail . UNCLE NAT goes into the sitting room . As he is supposed to open the sitting room door , a loud laugh is heard . ANN puts the turkey on the table . UNCLE NAT . Outside . Come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four chairs with you . ANN . For the first time seeing BLAKE , who has been standing at the window , his hands behind his back . Good afternoon , Mr. Blake . I was ' feared you could n't git here , yeh 're such a busy man . BLAKE . Coming down to the table . I 'd drop business any time to eat one o ' your dinners , Mrs. Berry . ANN . Well , I d'know whether the turkey sp'iled or not . Nathan'l 's so fussy ; I say , so fussy . All the guests enter , laughing and chatting . CAPTAIN BEN , the DOCTOR and MARTIN carrying chairs . UNCLE NAT is also carrying a chair , and is laughing heartily at some remark that has just been made . The guests stand around expectantly , waiting for ANN to seat them . MARTIN goes to the head of the table and begins to carve the turkey . The children come on leading the twins , in the same manner as they went off . CAPTAIN BEN . As he enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time o ' year . MARTIN . How long 'll you be gone this time ? CAPTAIN BEN . ' Bout six weeks to two months . UNCLE NAT . When d'ye sail , Cap'n Ben ? CAPTAIN BEN . T'night  --  fust o ' the tide . UNCLE NAT . I 've a durn good notion t ' go with yeh . D'yeh want any more hands ? CAPTAIN BEN . Yep , come on , Nathan'l . I 'll give you a berth , ten dollars an ' found . ANN . Oh , fer pity 's sake , do n't take him till I get these dishes washed . MARTIN . Where 'll yeh set us , Ma ? ANN . Who has been standing at the upper end of the table on MARTIN 'S right , recollecting herself . Oh ! Mr. Blake  --  He does not answer . She calls again . Mr. Blake ! BLAKE . Who has been at the window lost in thought , his arms folded behind him , his head bent . Eh ? Oh , I beg pardon . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bow preparatory to taking his or her seat . ANN . Indicating BLAKE 'S place at her right . Set there please . I suppose I 'd ought to make a speech  --  Mis ' Nye  --  Indicates her place at MARTIN 'S left , at the upper end of the table.  --  to thank yeh all  --  Doctor  --  Indicates his place left of MRS . NYE.  --  for yer pooty presents  --  Mis ' Leonard  --  Indicates her place left of the DOCTOR.  --  but I never made a speech except once  --  Cap'n Ben  --  Indicates his place left of MRS .

Oh Gosh ! I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wait ! Goes off left , leading SIS LEONARD by the hand , followed by MARY leading BOB LEONARD . UNCLE NAT half follows them off , motioning them to be quiet . ANN .  --  it 'll only be ' count of the presents . All laugh . Well , set by . All busy themselves at the table , and do not see HELEN , who enters , right , crying . She comes to UNCLE NAT , who draws her to the centre of the stage . HELEN . Softly . He is going to-night , Uncle Nat . UNCLE NAT . Tensely and quietly , soothing her . There , do n't let ' em see you cryin ' . It 'll all come right some day . You wait on the table . Turning to ANN and covering up his concern for HELEN with a cheery manner . Where be yeh a-goin ' to put me , Ma ? By this time everybody is seated . ANN . Pointing . Oh , you 're down at the foot o ' the class . All laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class  --  Laughs , and sits down . MILLIE enters through the door , right , with her apron full of clam shells . MILLIE . Dropping the shells on the floor . Where 's my place , Mama ? MRS . NYE . Bless the darlin ' ! CAPTAIN BEN . Gets up and offers his chair with mock ceremony . Set right down here , I 'll wait . MRS ANDREWS . Nudging the SQUIRE . Look at thet child . SQUIRE ANDREWS . Yes  --  I will  --  The above exclamations are simultaneous , and all are laughing . ANN . My blossom ! Come to Ma , precious . MILLIE goes to her ; ANN takes her on her lap , wipes her face and hands with a napkin , and puts her in her high chair which PERLEY has brought to the table . MARTIN has gone on carving . BLAKE has tucked his napkin in his neck , diamond wise , and spread the ends all over his chest . The DOCTOR and MRS . LEONARD have placed their napkins in their laps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . ANDREWS fastens the SQUIRE 'S napkin around his neck . UNCLE NAT sticks his in the breast of his vest like a handkerchief . All are laughing and chatting , then suddenly MARTIN taps on the table with the handle of his knife . They all pause instantly , and there is silence as they bow their heads in prayer . This must be done in a perfunctory manner , but in all seriousness . MARTIN . Quickly . Now sing out what kind uv a j'int yeh 'll hev . The SQUIRE remains with his head on the table , UNCLE NAT shakes him . UNCLE NAT . Squire , Squire ! The SQUIRE looks up and places his hand to his ear . Meetin 's out . MRS . ANDREWS . I 'll hev secon ' j'int , an ' the Squire ' ll hev a bit o ' the breast . MRS . ANDREWS has the SQUIRE 'S plate . SQUIRE ANDREWS . Puts his hand to his ear . Hey ?  --  What ? MRS . ANDREWS .

After all the others have spoken . Neither hev I. I 'll hev the part that went over the fence last , ef nob'dy else wants it . MARTIN helps rapidly . ANN serves the cranberry sauce . PERLEY and HELEN pass the vegetables , bread , and butter . They all eat heartily . CAPTAIN BEN . With his mouth full . Now thet 's what I call turkey . UNCLE NAT . Thet 's what we cooked her fer , Cap'n Ben . Ann , do n't be so stingy with yer ol ' cranberry sass . Passes his plate . ANN . As she helps UNCLE NAT to cranberry sauce . Well , yeh can pass up again . There 's plenty more in the sass dish . UNCLE NAT . I only said that to be polite . MARTIN . Now , folks , do n't be bashful . It costs jes ' the same whether yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SQUIRE , who is busy eating . JOEL GATES appears in the doorway , carrying UNCLE NAT 'S gun , with MANDY beside him . He stands there and cranes his neck to look over at the table , his eyes gloating over the food . No one notices him . They are all intent upon their food . UNCLE NAT . I do n't believe the Squire heard a word of it . Squire , did you hear what Martin said ? SQUIRE ANDREWS . With his hand back of his ear . Eh ? UNCLE NAT . He said it costs jes ' the same whether yeh eat or not . SQUIRE ANDREWS . Oh , we 'll eat a lot . UNCLE NAT . No , no  --  Not lot . GATES . Still standing at the doorway , ingratiatingly . How d ' do ? UNCLE NAT . Looking up and seeing him for the first time . Hello , Joel ! MARTIN . With hearty hospitality . Hello , Joel  --  jes ' in time . Set by an ' hev some dinner with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threshold , glowing at the invitation , followed by MANDY . I did n't know yeh hed comp'ny . ANN . Perley , set ' m a chair ; I say , a chair . PERLEY starts to get a chair for him . GATES . Protestingly , to PERLEY . No ! No ! Apologetically , to all the guests . I ai n't fit to set down with comp'ny , I ben workin ' round the barn . I jes ' fetched back yer gun , Nathan'l . HELEN . I 'll take her , Mr. Gates . GATES . As he hands her the gun . Be careful , Hel'n , she 's ludded . HELEN sets the gun in the corner by the sink . UNCLE NAT . Casually . Did yeh manage to kill thet there fox , Joel ? GATES . I found out ' t wa' n't a fox . Very much interested in the turkey and the guests ' enjoyment of it . UNCLE NAT . Thet so . What was it ? GATES . ' T was a skunk . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . MARTIN . Set down an ' hev some turkey . GATES . Deprecatingly , looking at the table longingly . No , I 'm too s'iled . Ef I 'd ' a ' knowed you was hevin ' turkey  --  I mean comp'ny , I 'd ' a ' cleaned myself up a bit . UNCLE NAT . While eating . Now thet yeh be here , let Ma fix some on a plate to take hum with yeh . ANN . Yes . Here , Martin , give him this , you can fix yerself some more . Holds MARTIN 'S plate ; MARTIN fills it . UNCLE NAT . To the child . Mandy , you come here an ' git a piece of Ma Berry 's pie . GATES . To the child , who hesitates and looks up at him inquiringly Go ' n git it , ef yeh want to . MANDY goes to UNCLE NAT , who gives her a huge piece of pie . She returns to her father , holding the pie with both hands , her face in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled high with food . Helen , pass this to Mr. Gates . GATES . As HELEN gives him the plate . Thank yeh , thank yeh . I 'll jes ' step inter the woodhouse an ' eat it , then I kin hand the plate back . MARTIN . No , set down there , ef yeh wo n't come to the table . Hel'n , give ' im a chair . HELEN places a chair , centre . Her manner is very gentle and kind . GATES . Thank yeh . HELEN gets MILLIE 'S small rocking-chair for MANDY . She sits down in it , and slowly rocks to and fro , and for the first time a look of childish joy appears on her face . GATES settles himself in the chair carefully , with his knees drawn together and his toes resting on a rung , so as to make a table of his lap . With his shoulders hunched , he attacks the overflowing plate and becomes absorbed in the food . He eats as if he had been saving himself for this meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime , the talk at the table continues . DOCTOR . Oh ! By the way , Mr. Blake , did you buy the Swazy place ? BLAKE . Yes . CAPTAIN BEN . L'see , how many acres is there in thet place ? BLAKE . Eighty odd . MARTIN . What 'd yeh hev to pay fer it , if it 's a fair question ? BLAKE . Paid enough fer it  --  they knew I had to hev it . UNCLE NAT . They ai n't givin ' land away nowadays , be they , Mr. Blake ? DOCTOR . To PERLEY . Will you give me another cup of tea , please ? She takes his cup and fills it from the teapot on the stove . I 'd like to sell you that ma'sh of mine , Mr. Blake . BLAKE . How much shore front hev yeh got there ? DOCTOR . Sixty-seven rod . BLAKE . What 'll yeh take fer it ? DOCTOR . Well , I 'm asking twenty-five hundred dollars for it . BLAKE . Good Heavens ! You hev sot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , half cash . DOCTOR . The Squire 's offered me more than that for it . BLAKE . Astonished . The Squire ! What 's he want with it ? SQUIRE ANDREWS . Hearing this . Thet 's my business . You do n't s'pose you 're goin ' to be the only one to git rich out'n the boom , do yeh ? BLAKE . I started it . SQUIRE ANDREWS . Columbus discovered Americky , but he do n't own it . All laugh . The SQUIRE looks round the table , well satisfied . UNCLE NAT . Laughing uproariously , to the SQUIRE on his left . Squire , thet 's the best thing yeh ever said in yer life  --  I say thet 's the best  --  Pauses , as he realises the SQUIRE is paying no attention , but is busily eating . Yeh did n't know yeh said it , did yeh ? The SQUIRE still pays no attention . UNCLE NAT turns to the rest of the company . He did n't hear himself say it . All laugh . CAPTAIN BEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? SQUIRE ANDREWS . Yes , an ' got it bad  --  see  --  Pulls out an oil paper map of his farm , laid off in lots , unfolds it and shows it to the company . BLAKE . By George , he 's got the start of all of us . GATES . Picking gingerly on a drumstick . Mr. Blake , I 'd like t ' sell yeh thet seven acre o ' mine . I got a great view there . Yeh kin see fer fifty mile round , ef yer eyesight 's good enough . BLAKE . What d'yeh want fer it ? GATES . Very importantly . Well , it 's sort o ' got round thet I sot a price . I told Gabe Kilpatrick , and he says I 'd ought to git ten ' r fifteen thousand dollars fer it . All laugh .

MARTIN . Speaking slowly and unwillingly . His name 's Beardsley . UNCLE NAT . Cheerfully and unsuspiciously . What is he , Martin ? MARTIN . Ponderously . Surveyor ! UNCLE NAT . Surveyor ? MARTIN . Surveyor for this ' ere new geruntee land an ' improv'ment company . CAPTAIN BEN . Martin , will yeh gim me jes ' a leetle taste more o ' thet stuffin ' ? Passes his plate , MARTIN helps him . ANN . For the first time a little uneasy . What 's he want here , Martin ? MARTIN . As if forced to a stand , defiantly . He 's goin ' to survey the farm . ANN . Gulping down her food . Survey it ! What fer ? I say , what fer ? MARTIN . In desperation . I 'm goin ' to cut it up into buildin ' lots , ef yeh must know . The guests stop eating . ANN is quite overcome at this news . She swiftly moves her chair out from the table , and stares at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . Hev another wing , Mis ' Nye . MRS . NYE . Soothingly . Hai n't et what I got on my plate yit , Martin . A damper now falls on the party . ANN . Passionately . Martin Berry , you ai n't a-goin ' to sell the farm , be yeh ? I say , be yeh ? MARTIN . Stubbornly . You heerd what I said , did n't yeh ? ANN . Yes  --  I heerd yeh , but I ca n't believe yeh . MARTIN . It 's mine , ai n't it ? ANN . Brokenly . Yes , I s'pose ' t is . MARTIN . Well , hai n't I got a right to do what I like with my own ? ANN . I d'know 's you got any right to turn me an ' the children out o ' house ' n hum . GATES gently rises and gives his empty plate to HELEN , a look of apprehension on his face . He tiptoes from the room through the door , right , followed by MANDY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , left , and crosses to right centre . MARTIN . Thet 's sentiment  --  I ai n't a-goin ' to turn yeh out o ' nothin ' . I 'm a-goin ' to move yeh all up to Bangor  --  I 'm a-goin ' to git rich . ANN . Rising and folding her arms , her head in the air , proudly and defiantly . You wo n't move me up to Bangor , not ef you git as rich as Methuselum . MARTIN . I 'll leave it to Mr. Blake ef I  --  BLAKE . I must say I think Martin 's scheme 's a  --  ANN . Still with spirit , but with a break in her voice . I do n't allow 's Mr. Blake 's got any right to jedge atween you an ' me in this : I say , in this . MARTIN . Rising , and striking his fist on the table , angrily . Look a-here ! I 'm goin ' to git rich in spite o ' yeh . Doctor , will yeh hev another piece o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browbeat . DOCTOR . No , thank you . MARTIN . In a great temper by this time .

MARTIN . I wo n't leave yeh nothin ' ! I 'm durned ef I do n't sell the hull thing , humstead , graveyard an ' every dum  --  YOUNG NAT enters through the door , right , out of breath and greatly agitated . YOUNG NAT . Mr. Blake  --  Mr. Blake  --  Mr. Blake  --  Breathes fast . You 're wanted up at the store . All are listening . There 's been a package o ' money took out o ' the safe . BLAKE . Swinging around in his chair so as to face YOUNG NAT , and resting his arms on the back as he talks . A package o ' money ! What sort of a package ? YOUNG NAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing a little above right centre , listens intently . BLAKE . Who 's been in the store today , thet yeh know of ? YOUNG NAT . Breathlessly . Well , there was Mis ' Peasley 's hired girl , but she did n't take it . Joe Bennett  --  Dan Nourse  --  Sam Warren  --  Draws out SAM WARREN 'S name significantly . BLAKE . Quickly . Sam Warren ! By George ! Hitting the back of his chair with his hand . He stole it . HELEN . With suppressed anger and shame . Oh , Mr. Blake ! BLAKE . To UNCLE NAT , with a significant look . Thet 's the speckled pullet thet fell into the rain barrel ! To the others . He hed to hev a hundred dollars to go out West with . All the guests except CAPTAIN BEN nod their heads as if to say " That 's so , that 's bad . " He tried to borry it o ' me . I would n't lend it to him , an ' so he stole it . The guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming down swiftly to right centre , quietly but determinedly . You lie ! MARTIN . Who is still at the head of the table . Helen ! A slight pause . How dast you call Mr. Blake a liar ? HELEN . Her voice quivering with indignation . How dare he call Dr. Warren a thief ? BLAKE . A little angrily . He is a  --  HELEN . Fiercely . You 're a  --  MARTIN . In a low tense tone , approaching her angrily with his hand clenched and partly lifted . Helen , if you say that agin , I swear I 'll  --  ANN turns around with her back to the table , and starts crying into her apron . UNCLE NAT . Who has been standing with his fingers to his lips , trembling , fearful of MARTIN 'S anger , goes between them and lays his hand on MARTIN 'S shoulder . Martin ! Do n't do nothin ' thet yeh 'll be sorry fer all the days o ' yer life . All the guests have risen , rather embarrassed , but fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table . MRS . ANDREWS explains to the SQUIRE through the ear trumpet . MARTIN . Shaking UNCLE NAT 'S hand off . Take yer hand off'n me . I tell yeh I wo n't be browbeat by you , an ' I wo n't hev her With an angry gesture towards HELEN insult my friends . HELEN . Her voice trembling with unshed tears of rage , her face flushed with angry excitement . He insulted me , and if Sam Warren does n't thrash him before night , it 'll be because I ca n't make him do it , that 's all . HELEN , during this scene , shows she is the modern girl , and has the temper inherited from her father . MRS . BERRY is the old-fashioned , submissive wife , awed and frightened at HELEN 'S daring to oppose her father . BLAKE . Losing his temper . He 'll be in the lockup before night , if I can put him there . Picks up his hat and cane from the table by the window . MARTIN . Turning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rushing over to BLAKE with it . That 's the thing to do . Git a warrant fer him an ' ef he raises his hand to yeh  --  you  --  shoot  --  him . UNCLE NAT has been standing at one side , his kind old face white and drawn with anguish . He now comes forward and interposes . UNCLE NAT . Hol ' on , Martin ! Uncle Sam'l ' s mine  --  an ' she wa' n't never made fer murderin ' folks . Quietly , but with authority , he takes the gun and puts it back in the corner by the sink . BLAKE . Shaking his cane , a very heavy one , threateningly . This 'll do me ! HELEN . Dominating the whole situation , in a low voice quivering with contempt , to BLAKE . Oh ! You coward ! Turning to her father . Father , Sam 's going away to-day . With tremendous authority . You 'd better let him go if you know when you 're well off . MARTIN . Taking her tone , tauntingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're well off . I s'pose you 'd like to go with him ? HELEN . Throwing her head proudly in the air . Yes  --  I would . MARTIN . Beside himself . By God ! If I lay my hands on him , I 'll kill him . HELEN . If you dare to lay a finger on him , I 'll  --  Springs towards MARTIN as she speaks , with hands clenched . UNCLE NAT catches her and puts his hand over her mouth . The tension is broken , and HELEN bursts into tears , her head resting on UNCLE NAT 'S breast . The guests now quietly leave the room , one by one , by the door left . MRS . NYE takes MILLIE 'S hand and follows the others . PERLEY , during all this , has gone on clearing away the table as if nothing had happened , only occasionally glancing in the direction of HELEN and MARTIN . She now goes into the woodhouse , taking the platter with the turkey on it , as if to have her dinner there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he speaks . You 'll find out that I 've got something to say about what you 'll do and what you wo n't do ! Who you 'll marry and who you wo n't marry ! He starts to go out . YOUNG NAT blocks his way , and he pushes him roughly outside . Come along , Mr. Blake ! BLAKE passes out ahead of MARTIN , who turns and gives a last fierce fling at HELEN . You 're not of age yet , my lady . I 'll show Sam Warren thet ef my grandfathers was monkeys , they wa' n't thieves . He goes out . As HELEN hears their receding footsteps , she runs to the window , and watches them out of sight . She is in a bitter , angry mood , and tears fill her eyes . UNCLE NAT sinks wearily and despondently into a chair , left centre . ANN is still standing with her back to the audience , crying into her apron . She is dazed and broken . UNCLE NAT . Well , Ann , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ontimely end , hai n't she ? HELEN leaves the window , takes a cup and saucer from the table , goes to the stove , pours out a cup of tea and comes down stage , slowly and listlessly , and seats herself left of the table . She mechanically reaches well across the table for the milk and sugar , stirs the tea , sips it , and nibbles a crust of bread . ANN . Turning , her voice tremulous with tears . Oh , Nathan'l , I 'm so ' shamed . I 'll never look a neighbor in the face agin . Twenty-five years married , an ' nothin ' like this ever happened afore . Begins to cry . To think o ' the dinner all sp'iled after me cookin ' myself hoarse over it . Starts towards the sitting room door . It 's enough to provoke a saint out of Heaven ; I say , a saint out of Heaven . She goes off into the sitting room . UNCLE NAT . In a quick decisive voice . Well , Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jes ' ' s quick ' s he kin . HELEN . Frightened , quickly , in an awed whisper . Do you think he took the money , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . Rising and going centre . ' Tai n't thet , but there 'll be trouble ef him an ' Martin comes together . He takes off his coat , doubles it up and throws it in a chair , and begins to clear the table , first gathering the napkins , then the knives and forks , as he talks . HELEN . He has got a hundred dollars , y'know . UNCLE NAT . Continuing with his work at the table . I know thet . Reluctantly . I let him hev the biggest part of it myself . HELEN . Amazed . You ? UNCLE NAT . It 's the money me ' n Martin 's ben a-savin ' up to buy a tombstun fer Mother . HELEN . Rising , and striking the table with her fist . Then he sha n't stir  --  one  --  single  --  step . Determined , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forks he has in his hand , and leaning over the table , appealingly . I beg of yeh , Nell  --  git him away from here . There 'll be murder ef yeh do n't ! Crosses to the right with two chairs . HELEN . I do n't care . They sha n't call him a thief . UNCLE NAT . Stops and turns . Now  --  now  --  Have n't they called ' im everything they could lay their tongues to a'ready ? Do n't yeh see thet I das n't tell Martin I let Sam hev thet money ? Puts the chairs down and goes back to the table . Do n't yeh see thet it wo n't do fer Martin an ' me to come together ? Taps the table with his forefinger . Things he s gone too fur now . HELEN . That 's so  --  he 's got to go . He 's got to pay that money back . UNCLE NAT . Under the stress of deep conflict and emotion , half turns away from the table with the napkins in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkins back on the table . Yes , but he 's jes ' as pig-headed as any of the rest of us , an ' if he knowed the money was Martin 's he would n't tech a cent of it , not with a forty-foot pole . He 'd want to stay right here an ' fight it out  --  I 'm ' feared . Picks up a chair and goes towards right centre with it . HELEN . With quick decision . He must n't do that . I 'd go with him if it were n't for Mother . UNCLE NAT . Putting down the chair and , turning around amazed and awed , whispers quickly Would yeh , Nell ? He comes back to the table . HELEN . Bitterly . This 'll never be a home to me any more . UNCLE NAT . Taking another chair and going to the window . It 'll never be a hum to anybody any more , Nell . It 's goin ' to be all cut up into buildin ' lots anyway . By this time HELEN has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She now goes to UNCLE NAT and says HELEN . If it were n't for Mother , I would n't stay here another minute . Appealingly . Would you blame me , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . Down left , goes to her and they meet centre . He says tenderly How could I blame yeh , Helen ? Things 'll never be the same here agin , an ' Sam 'd be all upsot out there athout you  --  an ' you 'd never be satisfied here athout him . With gentle insinuation . Now would yeh ? He might get goin ' to the dogs out there , an ' then yeh 'd worry  --  an ' blame yerself  --  an '  --  Persuasively . I d'know  --  seems to me  --  ' s ef  --  HELEN . Taking fire from his suggestion , is all eagerness and determination . How can we get away ? They 'd see us on the train . UNCLE NAT . Considering . Oh , you must n't go by no train . I 'll drive yeh over as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEN passes the window . UNCLE NAT glances up and sees him , over his shoulder . He is struck by a sudden idea , and goes towards the window and calls . UNCLE NAT . Oh , Cap'n Ben !  --  Cap'n Ben ! As UNCLE NAT calls , CAPTAIN BEN turns and stands leaning on the windowsill , looking into the room . When did yeh say yeh was a-goin ' t ' sail ? CAPTAIN BEN . ' Bout an hour'r so  --  ef it do n't come on to blow  --  looks kinder as ef we might git a sou'easter afore mornin ' . Turns and starts to go , scanning the sky . UNCLE NAT . Stopping him again in a voice of hushed anxiety . Cap'n Ben ! CAPTAIN BEN again pauses , and looks at UNCLE NAT . Helen an ' Sam ' s ben a-thinkin ' o ' takin ' a trip down the coast fer quite a spell  --  Looks and nods at him significantly . Would you mind droppin ' ' em at St. Andrews 's ' r somewheres along there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , comprehending the situation , answers with bluff heartiness . No , plenty o ' room an ' plenty o ' grub aboard . UNCLE NAT . Kin they go aboard now an ' be stowed away somewheres ? CAPTAIN BEN . Yes , I guess so . Nell , yeh kin come right along with me now in my buggy . He leaves the window and continues off , right . During this scene , HELEN has been standing tense as Page 79 she begins to realise the significance of UNCLE NAT 'S talk with CAPTAIN BEN . Now she turns and darts towards the pegs beside the woodhouse door , where hang her jacket , and tam-o ' - shanter . She pulls the cap quickly on her head , thrusts her arms into the sleeves of her jacket , and dashes swiftly to the door , right . UNCLE NAT checks her flight . UNCLE NAT . Helen !  --  Helen ! HELEN . Stopping . What is it , Uncle Nat ? There is a moment 's pause as they both stand looking at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking a plain little silver ring off his finger . Thet 's my mother 's weddin ' ring . You give it to Sam , an ' tell ' im to use it the fust chance he gits . He takes her hand , puts the ring into it , and folds her fingers around it . Now run along . Cap'n Ben 's a-waitin ' . He pushes her gently towards the door , and goes quickly to the table as though to hide his emotion . HELEN walks slowly to the door , looking at the ring . She stops , and a sudden sense of loss seizes her . She turns , and , with a cry , goes back to UNCLE NAT . HELEN . Oh , Uncle Nat , I do n't believe I can leave you and Mother  --  not even for him . Flings herself into his arms and bursts into tears . UNCLE NAT . Folding her in his arms , his voice shaking with tears . There now , do n't talk l'k thet  --  Do n't yeh start me a-cryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afeared I wo n't let yeh go . As he talks , he turns and moves with her very slowly towards the door . His tone is the soothing one he would use to a child . Now , see here . To-night 's my watch at the light , an ' when you an ' Sam an ' Cap'n Ben an ' all on yeh is a-sailin ' down the harbor , a-singin ' an ' a-laughin ' an ' enj'yin ' yerselves  --  jes ' as yeh git to the light , you look over there an ' sez you to Sam , sez you  --  There 's ol ' Uncle Nat 's eye , sez you  --  He 's a-winkin ' an ' a-blinkin ' an ' a-thinkin ' of us , sez you . HELEN . Good-bye , Uncle Nat . UNCLE NAT . No ! We ai n't a-goin ' t ' say good-bye ; we 're jes ' a-goin ' to say good afternoon , thet 's all ! Tries to laugh . P'r'aps I 'll come out there and see yeh one o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNCLE NAT 'S words , laughs at him almost joyously through her tears . Oh !  --  Will you , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . His face taking on a look of longing , with something of renunciation . I said  --  p'r'aps  --  A pause . In thet there palace o ' yourn yeh used to talk s'much about when yeh was little . Remember when yeh was little how yeh used to say thet when yeh growed up , yeh 'd marry a prince an ' live in a gol ' palace , an ' I was to come an ' see yeh , an ' yeh was to dress me all up in silks , an ' satins , an ' di'monds , an ' velvets  --  He half laughs , half cries , kisses her , almost pushes her out of the door , closes the door and bursts into tears , leaning his two arms on the door and burying his face in them . CURTAIN ACT THIRD SCENE I " HAVIN ' AN UNDERSTANDIN ' " INTERIOR of Berry Lighthouse . SCENE : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , and its chief feature is an iron stairway leading to the tower above . This stairway starts well down left , then makes a turn , and extends up and across the back wall . There are small windows at intervals along the stairway . Beneath the stairs , about centre , is a small , high , barred window , through which a terrific storm is seen raging . At intervals waves dash against the window . The entrance to the lighthouse is through a door on the right ; it is made of heavy planks , and has a large latch and a heavy , old-fashioned lock . ( NOTE : This door must be framed and set so as to slam with force . ) The whole room has an oily look and smell . On a shelf to the right of the window , about eighteen inches from the floor , is an oil barrel with a brass cock ; beside it are some oil-cans and a brass gallon measure for filling the lighthouse lamps . There is a brass pan on the floor beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wooden bucket . There is a shears for trimming the lamps on the floor at the foot of the stairway , and near it lies a coil of life-saving rope . A ship 's glass , a sou'wester , an oilskin coat and a pair of oilskin overalls hang on pegs on the wall , left . Leaning against the wall are oars and a boat hook . Several unlighted lanterns are standing about the floor . The light from above shines down on the room . At the rise of the curtain rain is heard falling in torrents outside . The wind howls , lightning flashes and thunder crashes at intervals . UNCLE NAT is discovered down left sweeping the floor . He has the dirt in a little heap and is getting it into a shovel with a broom . His actions are mechanical and his manner is preoccupied . He has on his working clothes and his trousers are tucked into high boots . MARTIN enters hurriedly from the right . He wears oilskins and carries a lighted lantern . He is pale and excited . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder can be heard outside . He slams the door behind him , puts the lantern on the floor , right , and stands a picture of excited anger . MARTIN . Standing down right . Helen 's gone ! UNCLE NAT . Who has looked up over his shoulder as MARTIN entered , and then immediately resumed his work , quietly says Y  --  e  --  s . MARTIN . Along with Sam Warren . UNCLE NAT looks up , concludes not to speak and continues his work . Did you know she was a-goin ' ? UNCLE NAT . Without looking up . Yeh . MARTIN . Why did n't yeh tell me ? UNCLE NAT . Has got all the dirt on the shovel by this time ; now he empties it into the bucket , right , sweeping off the shovel so that no dust will remain on it . He speaks as he does this . ' Cause yeh did n't desarve to be told ! MARTIN . Striking a clenched fist against his open palm . I 'm her father , ai n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . Yeh did n't act 's ef yeh was , today . MARTIN . Who is still standing down right . Then yeh blame me ? UNCLE NAT . Quietly . Well , I ai n't a-goin ' to lie about it , Martin . He hangs up the broom . MARTIN . An ' yeh uphold her ? UNCLE NAT . Yeh did n't know your own child , Martin , thet 's all . Ef yeh hed yeh 'd ' a ' knowed thet yeh might jest 's well ' a ' stuck thet there gaft  --  Points to the boat hook.  --  inter her heart as to hev said what yeh did ' bout Sam Warren . He knocks on the oil barrel to see how much it contains . MARTIN . With concentrated bitterness . He 's a thief . UNCLE NAT . Tut ! Tut ! Tut ! He ai n't . An ' you know it jes ' as well ' s I do . He takes up the pan from beneath the barrel , pours the drippings into an oil-can , wipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cock of the barrel . Yeh only said it ' cos yeh was crazy , crazier'n a loon . I knowed she would n't stay here long after thet . Yeh see , she ai n't me , Martin  --  she 's young , an '  --  Slight pause . MARTIN . Where 's Tim ? UNCLE NAT . Tim went to Ells'orth this evenin ' , hai n't got back yit . MARTIN . How 'd they go ? UNCLE NAT . ' Long o ' the mail . Crosses to the window , wipes the pane and peers out at the storm . MARTIN . I said how 'd they go ? UNCLE NAT . Oh ! Cap'n Ben took ' em in the " Liddy Ann . " MARTIN . Still standing right . What time 'd they start ? UNCLE NAT . Up centre near the window . Fust o ' the ebb . MARTIN . Slowly and with hate . I hope they sink afore ever they pass the light . UNCLE NAT . Quietly , turning and looking at MARTIN . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a brilliant flash of lightning followed by a loud crash of thunder . UNCLE NAT nods towards the window , indicating the storm , and adds You mought git yer wish . MARTIN . As before . I mean ev'ry word I say . She 's disgraced me . UNCLE NAT . Never losing his tone of patient gentleness . You 've disgraced yourself , Martin , I guess . He is wiping the things on the bench with the waste . MARTIN . Slowly , through his teeth . Be they married ? UNCLE NAT . No ! MARTIN . With a sneer . Humph ! UNCLE NAT . Not  --  yit . MARTIN . Bitterly . An ' never will be . UNCLE NAT . With quiet confidence ; he is down left . Oh yes , they will . Thunder and lightning . Ef they ever live to git to any place . Helen ai n't a-goin ' to forgit thet she 's got a mother an ' sisters  --  an '  --  MARTIN . Going to him left , and laughing derisively . You 're tryin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her go  --  d'ye think I 'm blind ? She went ' cause she hed to go to hide suthin ' wuss from her mother ' n me ; she went ' cause she could n't ' a ' held up ' r head much longer here  --  she 's  --  UNCLE NAT . Dropping his work and turning on him and for the first time showing deep feeling . Martin , do n't yeh dare say it ! Fer ef yeh do , I swear I 'll strangle yeh right where yeh stand . The light from the tower grows dim . Note : 1Kb MARTIN . Stubbornly standing his ground . It 's true an ' you know it . Thet 's why yeh hurried ' em away . UNCLE NAT . Making a movement as though to spring at MARTIN 'S throat , shrieks hoarsely Martin , you 've got to take thet back ! The light in the tower flickers and goes almost out . There is the distant sound of a ship 's gun . UNCLE NAT . With a sudden change of manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the light . Good land , what 's the matter with the light ? He crosses down right , and picks up the lighted lantern which MARTIN placed there on his entrance , speaking as he does so . Tim 's fergot to trim thet lamp , sure 's you 're born . Lantern in hand , he turns to go up the stairs . At the same moment MARTIN seizes the boat hook , and stands in front of the stairs , barring UNCLE NAT 'S way . MARTIN . Hoarsely , but determined . Yeh sha n't go up them stairs . UNCLE NAT . Paralyzed with horror . Martin ! The ship 's gun is heard again ; it is nearer this time . MARTIN . In cold and measured tones . I say yeh sha n't go up them stairs . Again the gun sounds outside . UNCLE NAT . Almost beside himself . Why , Martin !  --  Thet 's the " Liddy Ann " ! The gun is heard once more . Thet 's her gun ! MARTIN . Stolid , quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cry of protest and unbelief . She 'll go to pieces on the reef ! MARTIN . Grimly . Let her go . UNCLE NAT . Half crazed . Yes  --  but  --  Helen 'll go with ' er ! He starts for the stairs . MARTIN . Stopping him . Keep away , Nathan'l . I tell yeh thet light ai n't a-goin ' to be lit . UNCLE NAT . Frantically pleading , his voice broken with emotion . Martin , f'r God 's sake , list'n to me ! MARTIN . Doggedly . I wo n't listen to nothin ' . UNCLE NAT . Walking firmly over to him , speaking as he does so . You 've got to listen . MARTIN makes an angry movement . I say  --  you 've got to listen ! We 've got to hev an understandin ' right here and now . MARTIN submits sullenly , and UNCLE NAT continues to talk in hurried , nervous tones , pacing up and down the space between MARTIN and the door , like a caged lion , rolling and unrolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playin ' secon ' fiddle to you long enough , Martin Berry , ever sence yeh was born . When yeh was a baby I walked the floor with yeh , an ' sung yeh t ' sleep night after night . At school I fit yer battles fer yeh , an ' once I saved yer life . The gun is heard outside . MARTIN . Yeh need n't throw thet in my face . UNCLE NAT . I hai n't a-throwin ' it in yer face . I only want yeh not to forgit to remember it , thet 's all . He goes to the window and peers out . MARTIN . Doggedly . I know all about thet , I tell yeh . UNCLE NAT . Do yeh ? Well , then I 'll tell yeh somethin ' yeh did n't know . Walks over and deliberately faces him , and says emphatically Did yeh ever know thet I might ' a ' married your wife Ann ? MARTIN . Raising the boat hook , making a step towards him , white with rage , almost shrieks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hurried , tense and almost hysterical . Hol ' on  --  I ai n't through yit . I thought more o ' her than ever a miser did o ' money . But when I see thet you liked her too  --  I jes ' went off t ' the war  --  an ' I let yeh hev her ! Taps MARTIN 'S chest with his forefinger . An ' thet 's sumpthin ' yeh did n't know all about  --  wa' n't it , Martin Berry ? The gun is heard outside . But thet 's neither here nor there  --  her child is out there  --  my child by rights ! With sudden sublime conviction , almost heaven-inspired . Martin , thet light hez got to be lit ! With an angry snarl . I give yeh the mother , but I 'm damned ef I 'm a-goin ' to let yeh murder the child ! Come away from them stairs , Martin  --  come away from them stairs , I say ! UNCLE NAT seizes MARTIN , and the two men have a quick struggle . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the room . MARTIN is dazed ; he reels and staggers like a drunken man towards the door by which he entered , and blindly gropes his way out into the storm . UNCLE NAT seizes the lantern and starts to crawl up the stairs . It is hard work to climb them , the excitement has been too much for him . He gets up a few steps , then slips down again ; he crawls up again on hands and knees , and once more slips down . He makes still another effort , falters , staggers , and , with a heartbreaking cry , falls and rolls down the stairs . UNCLE NAT . God help me ! I hai n't got the strength ! The thunder crashes , the sea roars , the lightning flashes . The stage darkens as the light above goes completely out . END OF SCENE I SCENE II " THE ' LIDDY ANN ' IN A SOU'EASTER " EXTERIOR of Berry Lighthouse . Note : 1Kb SCENE : An expanse of wild , storm-tossed waves , with the lighthouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast on the left . The rain is pouring in torrents , the thunder roars , the lightning flashes . The boom of a ship 's gun is heard above the din of the storm , and in the darkness , the " Liddy Ann , " sloop-rigged and under reefed jib , makes her way slowly through the heavy seas , from right to left . She is off her course and perilously near the rocks . At intervals her gun booms and she sends up distress signals . The figures of CAPTAIN BEN , DAVE BURGESS , GABE KILPATRICK , and BILL HODGEKINS , as well as SAM and HELEN , can be dimly discerned on board . The shouts of CAPTAIN BEN giving orders , and the replies of the crew are drowned by the noise of the storm . For a few moments the " Liddy Ann " tosses helplessly in the darkness . Then a tiny light appears in the lowest window of the lighthouse . For a second it wavers , then slowly it rises from window to window , as UNCLE NAT climbs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tower blazes forth , showing the " Liddy Ann " her course . A shout of relief goes up from those on the boat , and as the " Liddy Ann " makes her way safely past the rocks THE CURTAIN DESCENDS ACT FOURTH " ME AN ' THE CHILDREN " THE scene is the same as in Act Second . It is fifteen months later . SCENE : Snow is falling heavily outside . The wind is howling ; a little drift of snow can be seen on the window sash . A fire burns briskly in the stove and everything has the appearance of the day 's work being over . The leaves of the table are folded , and a red checked cloth covers the table on which is a lighted lamp . The tea kettle is singing on the fire . UNCLE NAT 'S gun is in its place in the corner by the sink , and his old army coat and cap are hanging on the pegs under the stairs , as in Act Second . There is a large rocking-chair up right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the rise of the curtain , YOUNG NAT is seated reading a book at the upper end of the table ; he now wears long trousers instead of knickerbockers . From time to time he turns a page but instantly resumes his position to preserve the idea that he is very intent on the story before him . His elbows are resting on the table at either side of the book and his head is supported by both hands . MARTIN is seated on a chair , which is tilted back against the wall below the door , right . On his knees lies a blueprint map of his farm , which has been surveyed and laid off in lots . He is very dejected and in deep thought . Without realizing it he is grieving over the absence of his daughter , filled with bitter remorse for having driven her out of her home . ANN is sitting at the right of the table , mending stockings . She wears a warm-colored woolen dress , with a white embroidered collar , and a crisp white apron . UNCLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNCLE NAT is seated , centre , and PERLEY stands beside him . UNCLE NAT is just finishing buttoning up MILLIE 'S nightdress , while PERLEY is helping MARY . The children all have nightdresses and worsted slippers on , and their clothes are lying in little heaps , one in front of each child , as though they had just stepped out of them . MILLIE 'S hair is in curl papers . MARY 'S hair is braided and tied . The children 's nightdresses are made of Canton flannel , with legs and arms , covering them from the neck to the ankles , and they button at the back , MARY 'S and BOB 'S straight up and down , and MILLIE 'S with a little fall behind to let down . UNCLE NAT , PERLEY and the children are having a great deal of fun as the curtain goes up . YOUNG NAT . Looking up from his book , as though continuing a conversation . I tell yeh there ai n't no Santy Claus ! It 's y'r father and mother ! MILLIE . They is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat ? UNCLE NAT . Of course there is . See here , Nat , you jest read your book . When a boy gits too big to know there ai n't no Santy Claus , he ought to know enough to keep his thumb out'n the Christmas puddin' ' . YOUNG NAT laughs and resumes his reading . MILLIE . Did yeh ever see him , Uncle Nat ? UNCLE NAT . See 'm ? Yes , sir , I seen him  --  lots o ' times . BOB . Smiling . When was it , Uncle Nat ? The children surround UNCLE NAT scenting a story . UNCLE NAT . It was a g-r-e-a-t many years ago , when I was a little boy , not near so big 's as you be , Bob . MILLIE . Was you ever as big as Bob ? UNCLE NAT . Yes , sir , an ' bigger . I was as big as you be once , an ' once I was as little as Mis ' Pearce 's new baby . The CHILDREN all laugh . MILLIE . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? UNCLE NAT . Chuckling . I hai n't got much more now . The CHILDREN all laugh . ANN . Looking up from her mending . Now young uns , hang up yer stockin 's an ' go to bed , I say go to bed . The CHILDREN , all excitement , prepare to hang up their stockings . BOB . I 'm goin ' to hang up my pants . UNCLE NAT . You give me a piece of string an ' I 'll tie up one leg an ' you tie up t' other , an ' thet way we 'll get done quicker . BOB ties up one leg , UNCLE NAT the other . MILLIE . Watching enviously . I wish I wore pants . UNCLE NAT . Do yeh , Millie ? Well yeh may yit afore yeh die . Do n't you git discouraged . Things is comin ' your way mighty fast . I tell you what you do . You give me yer petticoat and I 'll tie up the skirt and make as good a bag as Bob 's pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all agree to this enthusiastically . ANN . While UNCLE NAT is busy tying MILLIE 'S petticoat . Mary , ai n't you goin ' to hang up yourn ? MARY . Yes , mother . With a smile . But I 'm afeared I wo n't get anything . The CHILDREN remove some towels which have been hanging on a line at the back of the stove , to make room for their stockings . UNCLE NAT . Now come on , git some pins . Bob , you get some clothespins . They rush to ANN , who gives them pins . We 'll hang Millie in the middle  --  jes ' like a fiddle . Gim me a couple o ' them pins , Mary . Bob , you go over there  --  Hanging BOB 'S knickerbockers on the line right . You got the clothespins , Bob ? BOB rushes into the woodhouse , and comes back with two clothespins . UNCLE NAT fastens his knickerbockers to the line with them . Mary , where 'll you go ?  --  oh , over here  --  He hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lighted a candle and stands waiting to show the children to bed . ANN watches UNCLE NAT and the children with amused interest . UNCLE NAT . Nat , ai n't you goin ' to hang up ? YOUNG NAT . Naw ! ' Cause I know there ai n't no Santy Claus . MILLIE . Crossing to him and almost crying . They is too , Nat Berry  --  you wo n't go to Heaven ef you say thet . UNCLE NAT . He wo n't go to Heaven at all ef he do n't say his prayers . Come now , gether up yer duds an ' be off to bed . The CHILDREN all pick up their clothes and shoes . MARY and BOB say " Good night " and kiss their UNCLE NAT , then their father , who is moody , and their mother last . She kisses them tenderly . They go upstairs . PERLEY stands at the foot of the stairs lighting them up . MILLIE . To UNCLE NAT who picks her up in his arms , clothes and all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . UNCLE NAT . Oh ! My suz ! I could n't git inter your bed  --  be yeh skeered ? MILLIE . Jes ' a ' ittle teeny might . Hides her head in his neck . UNCLE NAT . No , yeh ai n't nuther . Yeh jes ' want t ' git me to try to git my long legs inter thet trundle bed o ' yourn , Puts her down. and then kick me out on the floor like yeh did las ' Sunday mornin ' . But yeh ai n't a-goin ' to do it to-morry mornin ' . Spanks her playfully . Go ' long with yeh , yeh little hypocrite . MILLIE . Goes over and stands by her father demurely , with her clothes under her arm . Good night , Papa . MARTIN picks her up by her elbows , takes her in his arms , and kisses her , quite tenderly , and unconsciously lets the map fall to the floor , where it lies unobserved . Then he sets MILLIE down and becomes once more lost in his thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns and looks at him and says softly and shyly I wish you a Merry Kiss'mus . MARTIN makes no response , and MILLIE turns to UNCLE NAT lingeringly , as though loth to go to bed . I wish it was mornin ' so 's I could see what 's in my petticoat . UNCLE NAT . Dogmatically . Oh ! Yeh do  --  do yeh ? Tell yeh what yeh do , Millie . Yeh go to bed an ' sleep till mornin ' and then t'will be mornin ' in the mornin ' . MILLIE . Going over to her mother . Good night , Mama . Kisses her . ANN . Good night , I say good night . Bends over and kisses her tenderly . MILLIE . Full of Old Nick . Good night , Uncle Nat . Going to him . UNCLE NAT . Good night . MILLIE . Sleep tight . UNCLE NAT . Go t ' bed , yeh little baggage yeh ! Be yeh going to bed ' r not ? Shoos her away . MILLIE . Goes to the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? UNCLE NAT . What is it ? MILLIE . In a mysterious whisper . Look what 's behind yeh ! UNCLE NAT . Entering into her play . Oh , I 'm skeered to look  --  what is it ? MILLIE . In the same manner . Santy Claus ! UNCLE NAT . Pretending to be frightened , jumps . Where ? MILLIE laughs . Ai n't yeh ' shamed to skeer me like thet  --  I 've a good mind to  --  He runs after her , she runs and laughs . MILLIE . Yeh ca n't ketch me ! Laughs and runs around the table . BOB and MARY appear at the top of the stairs laughing and say " Run , Millie , quick , Millie ! " UNCLE NAT pretends he ca n't catch MILLIE . UNCLE NAT . At last catching MILLIE by the waist of her nightdress at the back , and carrying her as he would a carpet bag . She laughs very heartily all through the scene . Now , my young lady . I 've got yeh and I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her upstairs triumphantly , followed by PERLEY with the candle . He is heard talking all the way up the stairs ; MILLIE is laughing . I bet I 'll put yeh to bed  --  or I 'll know the reason why . UNCLE NAT , PERLEY and the children go off through the door at the top of the stairs , and their voices die away in the distance . ANN . Calling after them . I swan , Nathan'l , you 're wuss ' n the young uns  --  I say wuss ' n the young uns ! Gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the storm . Mussy on me , what a night ! I pity anybody thet 's got to be out on sech a night as this . She turns from the window , and notices MARTIN , who sits brooding . Martin , ai n't you well  --  I say ai n't you well ? MARTIN . Gloomily , not crossly . Oh yes . I s'pose I 'm well enough . ANN . Crosses to him and smooths his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mite o ' use to worry . I wish you 'd take some o ' thet pikrey  --  I know it 'd do you good  --  I say I know it 'd do you good . MARTIN . I d'want n-o  --  pik-rey . Pik-rey wo n't do me no good . ANN . Goes back to the table and resumes her work . Thet 's jes ' what Cap'n Ben Hutchins said last spring . But Liddy Ann managed to git some o n't inter his vittels right along athout his knowin ' of it an ' it cured him . He was mad 's a hornet when he found it out . I 've half a mind to try it  --  I say to try it . MARTIN . In the same manner . Do n't you put no pikrey inter my vittels if you know when you 're well off . ANN . Gently , with placid confidence and assurance . Well , Martin , jes ' as soon as you sell a few o ' them lots yeh got laid off ,  --  yeh said yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em in the spring , did n't yeh ? I say did n't yeh ? Absorbed in her mending . MARTIN . As if evading the question . I said I hoped I 'd sell some on ' em in the spring . ANN . Gently . Well I sh 'd hope so , now thet you 've cut the farm all up inter griddle cakes . Well soon 's yeh do  --  I 'm goin ' to hev yeh go up t ' Boston an ' see a reel doctor . Not but what Dr. Leonard 's good enough , but now thet we 're goin ' to git rich , we kin afford a little better one . You ai n't right an ' I know it  --  I say , an ' I know it . There is a tremendous burst of laughter from upstairs . Then UNCLE NAT comes flying down , followed by all the clothes , shoes etc. the children had carried up . He half falls , and lands sitting on the bottom step . The children all appear at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANN gives a scream and rises . Mussy on me  --  I tho't t'was an earthquake ! I say an earthquake ! What in time 's the matter with yeh ? UNCLE NAT . Looking up with an apologetic air . Me'n the children hevin ' a little fun , thet 's all . ANN . I should think yeh was . She crosses over to the stairs and calls up to the children . Ef I come up there ' th my slipper I 'll give you suthin ' to cut up about . Go to bed this minute , every man jack , o ' yeh , an ' do n't let me hear another word out o ' yeh this night . As ANN speaks there is a dead silence and the children all sneak away on tiptoe . Perley , come and git these duds . I say git these duds . PERLEY comes down and gathers up the clothes and goes off with them upstairs . ANN sits down to her darning again , and for the first time observes YOUNG NAT . Nat Berry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAT . Absorbed in his book ; without looking up . Jes 's soon 's I finish this chapter . The Black Ranger 's got the girl in his power an ' Walter Danforth 's on his trail . ANN . Le'see . She seizes the book and becomes absorbed in it . YOUNG NAT thrums on the table ; he is impatient , but polite ; finally he falls into a reverie over what he has been reading . During the talk between YOUNG NAT and his mother , UNCLE NAT slowly rises from the stairs . Now he goes up stage and peers out of the window , speaking as he does so . UNCLE NAT . By George  --  we 'll hev sleighin ' to-morry an ' no mistake , ef this keeps on ! He comes down stage and addresses the rest of the speech directly to MARTIN who pays no attention to him . UNCLE NAT takes a chair and sits a little to the right of centre . He lifts his left leg with his hands to cross it over his right , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and succeeds in crossing his legs ; his hands are clasped over his knee . His half-furtive glances at MARTIN , now and then , are full of affection and sympathy . The desire to engage his brother 's attention is the persistent note of his mood , and MARTIN 'S rebuffs only act as a stimulus to his efforts . Now he looks expectantly at MARTIN , who continues to ignore him . Then he becomes interested in his shoe as he detects a broken place in it . He examines it carefully , and runs his finger over it . There is a slight pause and again he resumes his efforts to break down his brother 's sullen resentment . There is an intimate tone in his voice as he remarks : I hai n't seen sech a storm  --  not sence I d'know when . Not sence thet big snowstorm we had ' way back in ' 59 . He looks at MARTIN 'S blank face as if for confirmation , but there is no response . Thet was a snowstorm ! Could n't see no fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along here fer more'n a week . He looks at MARTIN as before . The same forbidding mask meets his inviting smile . He shakes his foot meditatively as if to gain sympathy from it ; then he gives a long sigh . Ol ' Sam Hutchins was a-haulin ' wood , an ' got snowed in , an ' when they dug him out he was friz stiffer'n a poker , a-settin ' right on his lud . A pause . He steals a quick , inquiring glance at his brother 's immobile face , then with the manner of one who find himself in pleasant company , he remarks with fine unction : I kinder like to see snow on Christmas . It kinder  --  I d'know  --  seems kinder sorter more Christmassier  --  somehow . He gives another glance at the unresponsive MARTIN , then he rises . He leans heavily on his right foot , then he moves the foot up and down , his shoe creaking loudly as he does so . He goes up to the window and looks out once more at the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ol ' woman up in the sky 's pluckin ' her geese tonight fur all she 's worth an ' no mistake . He comes down , sees the map MARTIN has dropped , and picks it up . He handles it as though it were something precious . He looks at it a moment , and then bends his eyes upon his brother in a fine pride , as having in this map achieved a rare and wonderful thing . Then he seats himself in the same chair as before and looks over the map . Treemont Str  --  eet . Tracing the map with his forefinger . Corn  --  hill Str  --  eet . With a glance of pride at MARTIN . Wash  --  in '  --  ton Str  --  eet . There is a long pause , then UNCLE NAT glances about the room . ' Y George , Washin'ton Street 's a-goin ' to run right straight through the kitchen here , ai n't she ? He looks at MARTIN , who , for the first time meets UNCLE NAT 'S eye , and shifts uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oo . He traces the map with his forefinger . MARTIN casts impatient furtive glances at him from under his eyebrows ; then he gets up and goes towards UNCLE NAT . Hawthorne Avenoo begins at the Northeast end o ' the ol ' barn an ' runs due east to  --  MARTIN . Quietly taking the map from him , folding it up and putting it in the breast pocket of his coat . Ef you hai n't got nuthin ' better t ' do than to set there a-devilin ' me , I 'd advise you to go to bed . He returns to his chair and lapses into his former mood . UNCLE NAT and ANN exchange glances of wonderment and pleasure at the thought of MARTIN 'S having spoken to UNCLE NAT . It is a big moment for them . ANN catches her breath and a look of surprise and delight crosses her face . She starts to speak , but UNCLE NAT motions her to be quiet by putting his right hand over his lips and waving his left hand at her for additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards MARTIN . His face is illumined and quivers with joy , he speaks feelingly . UNCLE NAT . Martin  --  thet 's the fust word you 've spoke to me in over fifteen months . MARTIN remains stolid and silent . UNCLE NAT continues half sadly , half jokingly Do n't you think I 've wore black fer you long enough ? Wistfully Say , Martin , let 's you and me shake hands and wish each other Merry Christmas to-morry , jes like we used to  --  when we was boys together  --  will yeh ? MARTIN . I do n't care nuthin ' ' bout Christmas  --  one day 's good 's another t ' me . UNCLE NAT . Gently . ' Twa' n't allus so . MARTIN . Well it 's so now . Merry Christmas  --  Humph ! I 'd like t'know what I 've got to be merry about . UNCLE NAT . Yeh 've got me  --  ef yeh 'll hev me  --  MARTIN . Significantly . Humph ! UNCLE NAT . You 've got Ann . MARTIN looks up . UNCLE NAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got the children . MARTIN . Half-bitterly . Yes , till they git big enough to be some help , then they 'll clear out an ' leave me as their sister did . UNCLE NAT . Very gently . Now  --  now  --  now  --  Helen did n't clear out an ' leave you . She never 'd ' a ' gone ef you had n't ' a '  --  said what yeh said about  --  MARTIN . Murmurs almost inaudibly . There now . UNCLE NAT . Finishing the sentence under his breath.  --  Sam Warren . MARTIN . I do n't want to git inter no argument ' th you to-night ! I know what I done an ' I know what she done . UNCLE NAT . Yeh never will let me tell yeh nothin ' . MARTIN . I do n't want to know nothin '  --  UNCLE NAT . With a quizzical smile . Well  --  yeh come pooty nigh a-knowin ' of it . I never see a man s ' fond o ' huggin ' a sore thumb ' s you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeh help me to fill the children 's stockin 's ? MARTIN . Half-softening . I hai n't got nothin ' to put in ' em . UNCLE NAT . Well , I hai n't got much , but what I hev got ' s a-goin ' in . Come , Ma , let 's you and me play Santa Claus , then I 'll go to bed . ANN makes no reply . UNCLE NAT sees that she is absorbed in her book , chuckles , and decides to leave her alone . He passes YOUNG NAT , flicking him on the shoulder with his handkerchief as he does so and says , Nat , come out in the woodhouse and lend ' s a hand here , will yeh ? UNCLE NAT goes off into the woodhouse . YOUNG NAT gives his mother an impatient look , then shrugs his shoulders resignedly and follows UNCLE NAT off . They return almost immediately , carrying between them a large wood-basket containing a lot of bundles , which they place down centre . UNCLE NAT sits in the same chair as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to undo the presents . There are dolls , slates , picture books , big candy canes , a sleigh , a pair of skates , mittens , comforters , and any quantity of cheap toys , also a new dress pattern . As the things begin to reveal themselves , MARTIN is interested in spite of himself . YOUNG NAT . With a note of triumph in his voice I told yeh ' t was yer father an ' mother all the time . UNCLE NAT . Continuing with his work . Did yeh ? Well , yeh did n't know 's much as yeh thought yeh did , old smarty . It ai n't yer father an ' mother this time  --  it 's yer Uncle Nat , by George ! They both laugh . MARTIN . I hope yeh hai n't been a-runnin ' yerself in debt agin fer them children . UNCLE NAT . No , I hai n't run in debt this time . I paid spot cash this time . Thet 's how I got such good bargains . Shows a harlequin with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thet now fer five cents . Pulls the string and laughs . It 's wuth more'n thet to see Milly pull the string jes ' once . Chuckling . MARTIN . I did n't know yeh had any money by yeh . UNCLE NAT . I had n't . I got Blake t ' cash my pension warrant . He says this without making any boast of it . . MARTIN . An ' spent the hull o n't on the young uns as usual , I s'pose . UNCLE NAT . Still busy with the things ; in a matter-of-fact tone . Yep ! MARTIN . Eight dollars on sech foolishness  --  it 's wicked . UNCLE NAT . For the first time stopping his work and looking up . Say , what d'yeh s'pose I stood up to be shot at fer thirteen dollars a month fer , ef it wa' n't t ' hev a little fun on my income ? Think I 'm a-carryin ' around this bullet in my shoulder all these years f'r nuthin ' ? Not much , Johnny Roach ! Goes back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' bought yerself an overcut  --  UNCLE NAT . Overcut  --  such weather as this ? Holding up a candy cane . Not while candy canes is a-sellin ' b'low cost . What 's the matter with the one I 've got ? MARTIN . Thet ol ' army cut ? It 's patched from one end to t' other . UNCLE NAT . Thet makes it all the warmer . With humor . ' Sides , yeh must n't never despise a man jes ' ' cause he wears a ragged cut . ANN . Slamming the book shut with a sense of supreme satisfaction . There ! Ef ever a mean , contemptible houn ' got his jest deserts thet Black Ranger got his'n  --  I say thet Black Ranger got his'n . Walter Danforth jes '  --  YOUNG NAT . With loud protest . Oh , Mother , do n't tell ! I want to read it myself . Goes back to the table , sits down and resumes reading . ANN . I swan ef I did n't forgit it was Christmas Eve  --  an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ever bring another one o ' them books inside these doors when I 've got work to do . Jumps up and begins helping UNCLE NAT . Ai n't thet a pooty dolly  --  I say a pooty dolly ! They now proceed to fill the children 's clothes , and hang things on the outside of them . There must be enough stuff to pack them . At the same time footsteps are heard on the porch outside , there is a stamping of feet as if to knock off the snow , and BLAKE enters . The snow drifts in as he opens the door and the wind howls . He is covered with snow and well muffled up . MARTIN who has been half interested in the business of the Christmas presents , rises . ANN and UNCLE NAT stop in their work . YOUNG NAT looks up from his reading . UNCLE NAT takes the empty basket , and puts it back in the woodhouse . BLAKE . Too blizzardy to stop to knock . By George , what a night ! I hai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is about to shake the snow from his clothing when ANN stops him . ANN . Do n't shake it off on my clean floor , Mr. Blake . Nathan'l , git a broom . UNCLE NAT gets the broom , takes BLAKE up stage and sweeps the snow from his clothes , as the dialogue continues . PERLEY comes downstairs with the lighted candle , and puts it on the table . Then she crosses over to help with the presents . BLAKE . Did n't think I 'd ever git here  --  by George . The snow 's waist deep  --  To UNCLE NAT . Thank yeh , thet 'll do I guess . UNCLE NAT . Hanging up the broom . Set down by the fire an ' warm yerself . He places a chair for BLAKE . Ef yer feet are cold stick ' em in the oven an ' toast ' em a bit . BLAKE . I 'll thaw out my back first . Stands in front of the stove with his coat tails drawn apart and warms his back . UNCLE NAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLAKE observes them a moment in silence . Well , y 're at it I see . He watches them with a tinge of sadness in his face . UNCLE NAT . Yep ! Christmas only comes oncet a year , y'know , in this family . ANN . Displaying the dress pattern . Thet 's a-goin ' to make Millie an awful pooty dress . Nathan'l , what was thet a yard ? UNCLE NAT . I d'know  --  I never ask no prices . ANN . Contemplating the dress pattern . Wo n't Millie be proud o ' thet ! I 'll have it made up jes ' ' s stylish ' s kin be . Puts it in MILLIE 'S skirt , or beneath it . I say jes ' ' s stylish ' s kin be . UNCLE NAT . I heerd yeh  --  I heerd yeh  --  BLAKE . By George , Martin , I 'd give all I 'm wuth in the world to hev jes ' one stockin ' a-hangin ' in my chimney corner to-night . ANN . You 'd ought t ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw but one girl wuth hevin ' and she would n't hev me . Sighing . I 'll never git married now . ANN . It must be kinder lunsome athout no children nor nothin ' , specially at Christmas . I say at Christmas . BLAKE . I never noticed how lunsome it was till I see you a-fillin ' them stockin 's . I 've ben s ' busy all my life makin ' money I hai n't hed time to git lunsome . Now I 'm gittin ' old , I begin to see thet p'r'aps I might  --  He shakes off his retrospective mood . Oh , Martin ! He sets a chair down stage in front of MARTIN , sits astride it , and leans his hands on the back . They talk in low tones while ANN , PERLEY and UNCLE NAT continue their work . BLAKE 'S tone now is tense and low . Did you hear about the Land Company 's bustin ' ? MARTIN . Alarmed . Bustin ' ? What ? When ? How ? He starts to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . BLAKE . As if discharging a disagreeable duty . Sh ! Yes sir , busted cleaner'n a whistle . Opposition fellers done it . They 've bought up Lemoine , an ' thrown it on the Boston market way down . Got a lot of Boston big bugs goin ' to build there soon 's the weather breaks . MARTIN . Then your boom 's over ? BLAKE . Yes , for five years anyway . Apologetically . Folks ai n't a-goin ' to come here when they can go to Lemoine for the same money'r less . MARTIN . With finality . An ' I 'm ruined . BLAKE . Really sorry . Looks thet way  --  now  --  I 'm sorry to say . MARTIN . Slowly . With my farm mortgaged to you for fifteen hundred dollars , an ' the money spent in cuttin ' it up inter buildin ' lots . BLAKE drums on the back of the chair with his fingers . MARTIN rises as if to spring at him and says between his teeth but in a low tone . Damn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way as before . Hol ' on . Points to ANN and UNCLE NAT . Yeh do n't want them t ' know , do yeh ? MARTIN . Sinking back in his chair and covering his face with his hands . No , not to-night , do n't tell ' em to-night . HELEN and SAM appear at the window . HELEN has a baby in her arms . UNCLE NAT looks up , sees them , gives a start . UNCLE NAT . Oh ! My ! They cross the window and disappear . ANN . What in time is the matter with you ? BLAKE looks up , MARTIN does not stir . UNCLE NAT . A tech of rheumatiz I guess . Rubs his shoulder . ANN . La ! You sot my heart right in my mouth . BLAKE resumes his former attitude . UNCLE NAT whispers in ANN 'S ear . She starts to scream , and he claps his hand over her mouth then he motions her towards the woodhouse door . ANN runs out . PERLEY comes over to UNCLE NAT to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , she gives a little scream and he claps his hand over her mouth and cautions her to be quiet . UNCLE NAT goes out through the woodhouse door , followed by PERLEY . All this is unobserved by BLAKE and MARTIN . BLAKE . In an undertone to MARTIN ; this can just be heard by the audience . Do n't worry , Martin , mebbe things 'll come out all right . MARTIN shakes his head without looking up . BLAKE . All yeh 've got to do is to keep up the interest  --  y'know . MARTIN . Without looking up . Interest  --  how 'm I goin ' t ' pay interest an ' the farm all cut up ? BLAKE . I know , it 's goin ' to be a tough job . You 'll hev to begin all over agin  --  seed down the avenoos  --  cut down the shade trees  --  an ' plow up the hotel site . Enter UNCLE NAT from the woodhouse , carrying a baby , and followed by ANN . MARTIN and BLAKE are so absorbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish you 'd ben struck dumb afore ever you come here to set us all by the ears with y'r blame land scheme  --  I hai n't had a minute 's peace sence you fust put it inter my head . BLAKE . Good-naturedly . Thet 's right , blame me . Blame me . MARTIN . Flaming up in bitterness . Who else should I blame ? Ef it had n't ' a ' ben fer you , I 'd ' a ' ben satisfied as I was . UNCLE NAT comes to centre and ANN takes the baby , takes the shawl from around it and hands it back to UNCLE NAT , who comes slowly down centre . Helen 'd never left hum ef it had n't ' a ' ben fer you  --  Raising his head aloft . I wish I was dead . I 'm ashamed to look my wife an ' children in the face . Just at this moment he sees UNCLE NAT who has been drawing near , the baby in his arms . MARTIN rises , and pauses , startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice almost choking with joy . Kinder sorter looks like a baby  --  do n't it  --  ? MARTIN . Puzzled . Whose is it ? UNCLE NAT . Looking down at the baby and rocking it back and forth in his arms . I d'know 's I jes ' know ! MARTIN . Looks all round the room . Where 'd it come from ? UNCLE NAT . I got it  --  out on the doorstep jes ' now . MARTIN . Well , put it right straight back on the doorstep  --  I ai n't the poor-master . UNCLE NAT . This baby ai n't lookin ' fer no poorhouse  --  this baby 's goin ' to stay right here . MARTIN . There 's too many babies here now . UNCLE NAT . No there ai n't nuther . Yeh ca n't hev too many babies in a home . He crosses and sits in chair centre , and rocks the baby in his arms . BLAKE . Hungrily , coming forward . Give it to me . By George , I 'll take it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her voice full of tears . Martin , wo n't yeh guess whose baby this is ? MARTIN . I ai n't a-guessin ' babies . ANN . Twining her arms around his neck . Guess this one , jes ' fer me , Martin . Jes ' as a sort of a Christmas present . MARTIN . Looks at her earnestly , then says softly . Tai n't  --  Nell 's  --  ? ANN . Drops her eyes to the floor , afraid of how he will take her answer . Yes  --  It 's poor Nell 's . MARTIN . In a fierce loud whisper . Poor Nell 's ? Yeh do n't mean to say thet he did n't marry her ? UNCLE NAT draws the baby close to his breast as if to shield it from even that thought . ANN . Oh yes , Martin , he married her . MARTIN . Misinterpreting her words and her action , aghast , slowly , in a loud whisper . You do n't mean to say she 's dead ? ANN . No , Martin , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is she ? ANN . Points to the woodhouse . Out there . MARTIN looks from ANN to UNCLE NAT , and back to ANN . Then he walks slowly up stage towards the woodhouse . At the door he pauses , hesitates , and finally says , MARTIN . Nathan'l  --  be keerful  --  do n't drop that baby . He goes slowly out through the woodhouse door . UNCLE NAT , still seated , continues to rock the baby back and forth . ANN looks down into the baby 's face . BLAKE goes to the stove and stands with his back to it , and his coat tails parted behind him , absorbed in thought . UNCLE NAT . As MARTIN goes out , with quiet , sly humor . I 've held you many a time an ' I never dropped you . Pause . Well , Ma , I s'pose you 're awful proud ' cause yeh 're a gran'mother . Reflectively . Seems only the day ' fore yist'day sence Nell was a baby herself . The woodhouse door opens and MARTIN enters slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very happy to be back in her home . They are followed by SAM , now a bearded handsome man who appears to be perfectly happy and gratified that HELEN 'S wish to bring her baby home has been fulfilled . SAM has returned from the West a prosperous , successful man ; they are both well dressed and have an air of achievement . PERLEY follows SAM into the room , her face beaming with joy . There is a long pause ; everybody 's eyes are on MARTIN and HELEN . He leads her proudly and slowly down the stage before he speaks . MARTIN . Nell  --  my girl  --  I 'm glad to see yeh back , thet 's all I got to say . It is with difficulty that MARTIN can get these words out . Tears are in his eyes and voice . He kisses her . BLAKE has been standing spellbound , and now he blows his nose to hide his emotion . HELEN creeps into her father 's embrace , puts her arms around his neck and looks pleadingly first at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , have n't you got a word for Sam ? " MARTIN 'S gaze follows hers and he sees SAM . HELEN draws away a little and MARTIN moves towards SAM . ANN goes to HELEN and puts her arms about her ; both women are tense , expectantly waiting to see what MARTIN will do . MARTIN . Making a big effort to conquer his pride . Sam , I do n't b'lieve I acted jes 's a father ought to hev acted towards Nell , an ' I did n't treat you quite right I know  --  I  --  Hesitantly stretches out his hand which SAM takes in a hearty grasp , and the two men shake hands . ANN and HELEN , in great relief , embrace each other joyously . SAM . In a big warmhearted manner . Oh ! That 's all right , Mr. Berry ! You did n't quite understand me , that 's all . MARTIN . Introspectively . Thet must ' a ' ben it , I did n't understand yeh , Then with a complete change of manner MARTIN turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair nursing the baby , and in an almost boyish manner , says to him with an air of ownership Give me thet baby ! During this scene , HELEN and SAM go up left centre to YOUNG NAT and greet him affectionately . He proudly displays his long trousers . Then they turn to PERLEY who stands above the table and greet her warmly . She helps HELEN off with her things , also takes SAM 'S hat and coat , and hangs them up on the pegs beside the woodhouse door . UNCLE NAT . Imperturbably . No sir , this baby goes right straight back on the door step where it come from  --  MARTIN . Give me thet baby I tell yeh  --  UNCLE NAT . Rocking the baby in his arms . No sir ! there 's too many babies here now . This ai n't no poorhouse . MARTIN . You give me thet baby . UNCLE NAT . Getting up and handing him the baby . All right  --  take y'r ol ' baby  --  I 'm durned ef I do n't hev a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yeh see ef I do n't  --  an ' then I 'm durned ef I 'll lend her to any of yeh  --  He goes up stage . During the next scene , ANN goes up stage , pokes the fire , and puts the kettle which is on the back of the stove , in one of the front holes , where it at once begins to sing ; she bustles about , gets the teapot and makes some tea . MARTIN is standing centre , holding the baby in his arms , with SAM on one side and HELEN on the other . MARTIN . Looking down at the baby . How old is it ? HELEN . Three months last Sunday . MARTIN . Thet so ? Looking down at it and smiling proudly . It 's a pooty baby . A pause . What is it ? SAM . Proudly . Boy ! MARTIN . Thet so ? Glancing up . H-h-hev  --  yeh  --  named him yit ? HELEN . Sam calls him Martin . MARTIN . Thet so ! Calls to UNCLE NAT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' his name 's Martin . UNCLE NAT . Oh ! Good Lord ! I knowed all ' bout thet long ago . Sits in the rocking-chair . MARTIN . Thet so  --  I thought I was tellin ' yeh news . UNCLE NAT . Yeh wa' n't tellin ' me no news , was he , Nell ? HELEN . No , indeed . MARTIN . Gim me that rockin ' - chair . UNCLE NAT . Getting up from the rocking-chair and placing it in the middle of the stage . Give him the rockin ' - chair  --  he 's a grandfather . He owns the house now  --  MARTIN seats himself in the rocking-chair with the baby on his knee . UNCLE NAT sits in the chair down right formerly occupied by MARTIN . ANN . Bringing the pot of tea and cups and saucers over to the table . Here , Hel'n , you an ' Sam drink this cup o ' tea . HELEN and SAM sit down at the table , SAM at the upper end and HELEN on his right . YOUNG NAT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding scene , BLAKE has been hovering on the outskirts of the group , forgotten for the moment by all , profoundly moved at what is taking place . He now musters up his courage to speak to SAM . BLAKE . Dr. Warren ! Oh , Dr. Warren ! SAM . Rises and goes to him . Hello , Mr. Blake . Helen , here 's Mr. Blake . HELEN . Bows pleasantly . Why , how do you do , Mr. Blake ? BLAKE . Oh , I 'm feeling pretty good for an old man . Turning to SAM . Dr. Warren , I 'm awfully ashamed of the part I had in drivin ' you away . It was small potatoes an ' few in a hill . SAM . With the same hearty manner in which he spoke to MARTIN . Oh , that 's all right , Mr. Blake . You folks around here did n't understand fellows like me , that 's all . BLAKE . Well , I 'm ashamed of it all the same . He crosses to HELEN . Helen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? HELEN . Why certainly , Mr. Blake . They shake hands . Oh , by the way , Mr. Blake , did you ever find out who stole your hundred dollars that time ? All listen . BLAKE . Ashamed . Well to tell the truth it never was stole . ALL . What ! HELEN . Amazed . Never was stolen ? BLAKE . No ! We found it stuck away in the back part o ' the safe  --  among a lot of papers . YOUNG NAT . Rising and standing left below the table , half grinning and half ashamed , with a sort of bravado . That was some o ' my work . I hid it there . HELEN . You  --  ? ANN . You  --  what fer  --  I say what fer ? YOUNG NAT . Half crying . I wanted to git even with Sam Warren fer pullin ' my ear  --  I heerd him ask Mr. Blake fer a hundred dollars an ' I hid the package . I was sorry the minute I done it and I 'd ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lickin ' . ANN . Well , I swan to goodness ef you ai n't wuss'n the Black Ranger  --  I say wuss'n the Black Ranger !

MANDY 'S eyes instantly fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene she continues to stare wistfully at them . GATES . Speaking as he enters . How d'do ?

Awaiting your further pleasure , we are , Very truly yours , Higgins and Wells , Attorneys at law . " Oh ! Uncle Nat ! There is a general murmur of amazement . UNCLE NAT . Who is standing beside HELEN . Well , I wo n't tech it . I d'want no back pension , an ' I do n't want nothin ' to do with no durn lawyers . A pension grabber 's next thing to a bounty jumper , an ' I 'll be jiggered ef I tech it . ANN . Still sitting down left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? UNCLE NAT . ' Cause I never fit fer no back pension . I fit  --  ' Cause  --  He catches ANN 'S eye and stops . ANN looks at him significantly , and then at MARTIN , who sits , the picture of dejection . UNCLE NAT glances around at the others , and reads the same implication in all their eyes . He wavers and finishes lamely . ' Cause I fit . ANN . Yeh airned it  --  did n't yeh ?

Broken and greatly touched by UNCLE NAT 'S generosity . I 'd know as I 've got a right to say either yes or no . I 'll do whatever you and Mother wants I should . I hai n't got a word to say . UNCLE NAT . Going to MARTIN and clapping him on the back . Yeh do n't need to say another word , Martin , not another blessed word . Turning to HELEN . Helen , git me ol ' Uncle Sam'l . Say , Martin , Uncle Sam'l 's the gal thet won the pension , an ' she 's the feller thet ought to hev it . HELEN brings the gun down to UNCLE NAT , who is standing centre . He takes it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . Well , ol ' gal , yeh 've got yer deserts at last . Yeh not only saved the Union , but , by Gosh , yeh 've saved this hull family ! Still holding the gun , UNCLE NAT starts to go through the Manual of Arms , while GATES watches him and imitates him . Attention ! He comes stiffly to attention . GATES does the same . Shoulder-r-r Arms ! He brings the gun to his shoulder . GATES pretends to do the same thing . Carr-r-r-y Arms ! Pre-e-sent Arms ! As UNCLE NAT starts to present arms , the gun goes off suddenly . It must be loaded so as to make a great smoke and not too much noise . There is a movement of general excitement and panic . HELEN 'S first thought is for her baby , and she rushes over to ANN and takes it in her arms . GATES picks up MANDY , heels in the air , and head down , and rushes to the door , right , as if to save her anyway . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latch and escape with MANDY out of harm 's way , giving frightened little gasps as he does so . As the smoke clears away , the others all gather around UNCLE NAT who explains that the explosion was an accident . They are all excitedly talking and laughing , and completely oblivious of GATES , who , as the panic dies down , comes to his senses , and turns his attention to MANDY . She is completely enveloped in her wraps and he has some difficulty in getting her right side up . When he finally discovers her feet , he sets her on the ground , frees her head from its wrappings , smooths her hair , feels her body to assure himself that no bones are broken , kisses her and croons over her . UNCLE NAT , still holding the gun , comes down to him , and starts to explain , but , at his approach GATES has another attack of fright , and seizing MANDY , he starts to back towards the door , waving UNCLE NAT away . UNCLE NAT . Laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GATES . Putting his fingers in his ears . Gosh , that deefened me ! Then , as if to test his hearing , he cries , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Everyone laughs . They have all recovered their spirits as readily as they became depressed . BLAKE . Who has got to the door by this time . Well , good night . He goes out . GATES . Who is still nervous . I go your way a piece , Mr. Blake . He hurries after BLAKE , dragging MANDY with him . UNCLE NAT shows them out , closes the door and locks it after them . ALL . Calling after them . Good night , good night . ANN . Come now , it 's bedtime , I say bedtime . There is a general movement . UNCLE NAT puts the gun away , then he turns and begins the task of locking up for the night , plodding slowly and methodically about the room . PERLEY lights a candle , and goes upstairs and off . ANN lights a candle which she leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp . She and HELEN move towards the door down left . HELEN . Yes  --  I 'm pretty tired . Shall we sleep in my old room ? ANN .

Chicago must be a great city . SAM . A wonderful city . Why do n't you come out for the World 's Fair ? He goes off through the door lower left .

Coming down a few steps towards him ; in a deep whisper . I never told her nothin ' . MARTIN . After a pause . She 'd ought to ' a ' had you . ' Twa n't jes ' right somehow  --  He goes slowly off , lower left , closing the door . UNCLE NAT stands looking after MARTIN , his face lighted up by an inner glow of peace and happiness . His thoughts are reflected in his face , but not a word is spoken . The scene is played in absolute silence . He sinks into the rocking-chair close by with a sigh of content and satisfaction . He settles himself comfortably , with his chin resting in his right hand as he thinks . UNCLE NAT . He thinks this . Well , everythin 's all right again . He nods his head approvingly .

Then suddenly he scans the door , wondering if he locked it . He rises slowly , easing himself on the arms of the chair , and plods to the door ; he tries the lock , then tucks the doormat snugly against the sill to keep the snow from drifting in . Then he goes to the window , rubs the pane to clear the frost from it and peers out . Gracious ! What a night ! He stoops down , and looks up to find the lighthouse beacon . He nods his head .

Coming down to the table he picks up the candle which ANN left there for him and starts to go up the stairs . At the foot he pauses , then he moves down to , the door , softly pushes it open and stands there for a moment looking off . He smiles to himself as he thinks , I wonder what the young uns 'll say in the mornin ' ? For a moment he is lost in thought ; his right arm slowly relaxes . Then he turns and starts to climb slowly up the stairs , his heavy footfalls echoing through the empty room . The wind howls outside ; the sharp snow tinkles rhythmically upon the window-pane . The stage darkens slightly . He reaches the top of the stairs and goes off , closing the door after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firelight flickering through the chinks of the stove .
