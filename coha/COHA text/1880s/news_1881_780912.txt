txt " To-morrow and toMorrow and to-morrow . " This was the story yesterday and is the reply to-day to all inquiries as to when there is to be an election to fill Roscoe Conkling 's place . All the Stalwarts who have not voted for either of the caucus candidates say that a week of to-morrows will pass and yet there . will be no e lee ton . The Stalwarts who have voted for Miller , and who have promised half a dozen times that they will vote for Lapham , would probably make good their promises if they were free to act independently of instructions . At night they are " almost persuaded . " Superintendent Dutcher finds them later , after they have made up their alleged minds , and says in his most persuasive way : " Do n't go yet , boys . What we want to do is to keep together ; no going over one at a time . Time enough , and when it comes to the time to go we will all go at once . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The morning conferences in the Attorney-General 's office bring new propositions daily , and the Stalwarts who go there come into the joint assembly Bound by some new order from Conkling , issued through Payn or Dutcher and communicated through the new leaders . Since Speaker Sharpe swung into the Administration line , disgusted with obstructing the election by mere factious pretexts , he has been succeeded by two aspirants to leadership . One is Senator Strahan , whose Legislative record is one of accumulated political blunders ; the other is Senator Halbert , who celebrated himself and Roscoe Conkling a few days ago in an explosive speech , remarkable rather for vehemence than thought . Mr. Halbert 's desire to be of service to Conkling is undoubted . His skill as a politician is scarcely believed to be equal to disposing of 29 , ; more or less , doubtful men so as to overcome the votes of 70 or more Republicans . Everybody has heard that he went to Conkling to get orders , but as Conkling 's orders were disregarded when issued in person at Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective when transmitted through even the most subservient lieutenant . It is reported about the hotels and streets to-night that the direction of Mr. Conkling is that Halbert and Strahan shall hold the Stalwarts together at all hazards until Thursday . In the meantime assurances are given that something will " turn up " that will elect Mr. Conkling or force an adjournment . The story has gone about , but can not be traced to any good source , that efforts are being made by Conk ling to induce the Democrats to consent to vote with the Republicans to elect him , and that in consideration of his election to the Senate he agrees to allow the Democrats to have a " walk-over " in the election next Fall . It is said that this bargain also includes Conkling 's consent to the election of a Democratic President pro tern . of the United States Senate . These stories do not at all alarm the majority Republicans . They say that Conkling can not do more than agree to attempt to do any of these things . Should he attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lose seven or eight votes , and that would be a large enough number to elect Lapham . If the alliance of Democrats and Republicans could by any possibility be large enough to elect him , the feeling among Republicans in the State would be so aroused that the Republican vote would be enormous , and he would be disappointed in attempting to deliver the goods he had promised . As for attempting to secure an adjournment , not even the presence of the ' Lieutenant-Governor , who is expected to-morrow , can make that possible , and any undue interference on his part may aggravate unpleasant matters now before the Senate and yet to be considered . This noon , after the joint assembly , Senator Robertson was confident that there would be an election to-morrow . During the afternoon , after John F. Smyth had returned and consulted with Mr. Payn , the Stalwarts who had teen wavering gradually regained their 11Dright position and decided they would have to " stand " for a while . Four or five Conkling men have repeatedly declared , within a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be had . It is evident that they are under the shadow of some great fear and so feebleminded that nothing but the regulating and controlling influence of men more positive and powerful than themselves is preventing them from exercising a plain and honorable independence . The spectacle of men of ordinary common sense , men who were elected because they were considered competent to judge for themselves , being led and directed by such shallow politicians as Strahan and Halbert is an appropriate illustration of the extremity to which the Conkling cause is rtaduced . Late to-night the hotels are remarkably dull , Ind members who noted a singularly dull state of things are led to hope that the stagnation may be followed to-morrow by an election . The attendance will be large . The Administration men have refused absolutely to make any pairs for to-morrow , although several Democrats who want to go to the Saratoga races besought them to pair with them with tears in their eyes . Mr. Crapser has come all the way . from Potsdam to have another vote . Senator Porster has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will vote or Lapham . Mr. Boardman , of Tompkins , w ho has been voting for Stewart L. Woodford , : cannot bring himself to vote for Lanham . About 25 years ago  --  Mr. Boardman is an old man  --  he encountered Mr. Lapham is a politi:al contest and was beaten , and having what the boys call " a low forehead , " he thinks it more becoming to dodge and get away than to forgive and forget . It is said that he has paired with Dr. S. R. Wells , Democrat , and that both are agreed to go away for the remainder of the session . Several other Democrats would go away without pairing , but so completely has Conkling tied up the Democrats and extended his control that Spinola is able to keep in line Democrats who have legitimate and important business at home . Mr. Spinola 's speech in the Assembly to-day has not raised him in the estimation of the more respectable Democrats , who question the decency and propriety of his attack upon a member of the opposition , inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ashamed Of such a speech from a Republican .
