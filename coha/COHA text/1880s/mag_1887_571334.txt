ARTICLE 11. - CHARITY ORGANIZATION . THE methods of dealing with the dependent classes of a generation ago have served their purpose and are passing away with the state of society to which they were adapted . When ninety per cent . of our people lived in communities whose inhabitants were well known to each other , relief could be freely given with comparatively little danger and usually with beneficial results . But now that our population is flowing with an ever-increasing stream into large cities , and nearly one-half of the people in the Atlantic States between New Hampshire and Virginia live in places of more than 10,000 inhabitants , the old systems of relief have not only broken down , but have become most prolific sources of evil . It is a well known fact that pauperism is increasing in nearly all our cities-indeed it would be hard to find a single exception  --  and this in the midst of as prosperous a society as ever existed , and among a people only too ready to give bountiful relief to all in need . The growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in vice , crime , and insanity . These facts require and are receiving the attention of all who are interested in the welfare of society . For whether we regard the poor as our neighbors to whom we are under obligation by reason of our greater opportunities , or whether we think only of the growing burdens and dangers which increasing pauperism brings , we must in either event face the problems which their condition presents . The first thing to be done is to ascertain and , in so far as possible , remove the causes of this increase of pauperism , and it seems to be generally conceded that the leading cause is indiscriminate almsgiving by individuals , private societies , and the public . Everyone understands that the really deserving poor , including the sick , the young , the aged , the defective in mind or body , and sometimes the unemployed , do not change very greatly in their ratio to the rest of society . But the class of professional paupers live like parasites upon // the social organism and obtain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor should receive , grow and multiply in our cities , because much of our so-called charity is a direct encouragement to them to lay aside their independence and resort to the wretched artifices by which they impose upon all who are willing to give without knowledge o the applicant 's actual needs . Our people relieve want and destitution by providing aid , under certain conditions , from the public treasury , by giving individual assistance , and by supporting a multitude of charitable societies of every kind and description , most of which aim at little more than the temporary relief of the person in need . These various agencies have usually worked independently of each other so that none of them has had much knowledge of what its neighbors were doing . Under these circumstances they have often duplicated each others ' work , and important duties have frequently been neglected because they did not seem to fall within the particular province of any single agency . There has been no effective codperation , and the pauper class has been quick to understand and take advantage of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserving woman is a member of a dozen different churches in a single city and is drawing relief from them all ; and the other relief agencies have been treated in the same manner as the churches . The only means of meeting such difficulties is by organization , by bringing all charities under a single harmonions system which will leave each free to do its own work while it receives the aid of the others . The best plan thus far devised for accomplishing this object is that of the Charity Organization Societies . The Charity Organization movement began in London where the enormous population made the evils of the old methods of relief-common alike to England and the United States-especially apparent . It succeeded from the outset and has since been introduced into some fifty cities in England and as many more in our own country . The first step in establishing a Charity Organization Society is to secure an office in the central portion of the city and one or more agents who can give their whole time to the work . This office serves as a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in need of help is entitled to its service or advice . It frequently happens that persons overtaken by want for the first time do not know where to look for relief . People going from town to town in search of employment often find their money and strength giving out where they do not know anyone to whom they can turn . If referred to the central office , their cases can be investigated and their exact needs ascertained , and they can then be sent to the society or institution which can best supply their particular wants . The services of the society to relief-giving agencies are equally valuable . Such agencies , of course , desire to accomplish the greatest possible good with the means at their disposal , and to administer relief only to such persons as really deserve it , and the Charity Organization Society offers to ascertain and report the exact facts about every case which they may bring to it for investigation . The examinations are made by agents trained by experience to distinguish actual need from voluntary pauperism . And the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agent and a branch office of its own . The agent reports to his own branch office , whence the facts are transmitted to the central office and to the person or society making the inquiry . The information about each case is arranged , filed , and indexed , either in books or on cards , so that it can be quickly referred to , and all knowledge of the case subsequently received is treated in the same manner . Thus the history of each applicant , with a statement of what has been or is being done for him , can always be furnished to those who have a right to know about him . In addition to the register indexed by names , some societies also keep a register indexed by streets which locates and defines the quarters in which pauperism is most prevalent With such an investigating force and such registers at the service of all who will use them , there is no excuse for any person who gives unwise alms . Charity Organization Societies are not relief agencies . Some of them give absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it their business , and which usually are abundantly able to provide for all deserving cases . When the investigating agents find cases of actual destitution , they can // always arrange for immediate relief . It is such cases , however , that people , who are not fully acquainted with the actual condition of the poor , think can not wait for the examination which Charity Organization requires . They fear that the delay necessary for ascertaining the facts may cause hardship . It must be remembered , however , that the cases in which there is danger of starvation or suffering from extreme need of any kind , are much rarer in American cities than is usually supposed . Poor people have neighbors with the feelings common to humanity , and they will almost invariably give assistance when necessity demands ; so that the instances in which the few hours needed for investigation would make any serious difference very seldom occur . All applicants for relief may be placed in one of the four following classes : in the class worthy of continuous relief , worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in the class entirely unworthy of assistance . In 1881 the Associated Charities of Boston classified 3,200 cases which they had investigated , and in 1885 a similar analysis of 5,169 cases was made by the Charity Organization Society of New York . The results , which correspond very closely , are shown in the following table : In Boston In 1881 . In New York In 1884-5 . Worthy of continuous relief 11 per cent . 6.4 per cent . Worthy of temporary relief 20 " 24.4 Needing work rather than relief . 52 " 52.2 Unworthy of relief 17 " 17 . Those who require continuous relief are chiefly children and persons whose powers of body or mind are permanently impaired . Charity Organization Societies generally see that they are provided for in orphan asylums , private homes , hospitals , almshouses , or such other institutions , public or private , as are best able to meet their needs . People requiring temporary relief on account of sickness or other good cause , can , as has been said , be provided for by the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the great class of unemployed , those who are able , and many of them willing , to work , if opportunity can be found , are the ones for whom charity organization can and does do most . It procures for them em voL. x. 15 // employment , loans , food , clothing , fuel , or whatever they may require , but always insists that the person who receives aid shall render an equivalent in labor if work is offered . It not only makes employment the basis of relief , but makes assistance conditional upon progress and good behavior . If , for example , a man is intemperate , he must stop drinking if the society is to help him . If he is given such employment and wages as will enable him to save money , he must save it . In short , it endeavors to develop and strengthen a spirit of selfhelp which is the greatest of all the needs of those on the verge of panperisrn . The fourth class , who are unworthy of any aid , are the professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes them a living , and who are quite willing to be supported by the industrious portion of the community . These are the persons in whose behalf sensational appeals for relief appear in the newspapers , who carefully prepare their stories and cultivate their deformities to work upon the feelings of those who give without investigation . These people sometimes make a good living from the alms which the deserving poor are too modest or too proud to obtain by similar means . Charity organization constantly strives to exterminate this class by thorough investigation , complete exposure , and by enforcing the full penalty of the law . Another of its principles is never to lose sight of a case which it has once investigated until the person is either permanently provided for , or beyond the need of further aid . This purpose is carried out chiefly through the efforts of its friendly visitors . They are a body of volunteers , divided among the several districts , to whom are referred all cases which need attention , with a statement of the facts which the preliminary investigation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he becomes personally responsible . He goes to their homes as a friend , to become acquainted with them , to learn their exact needs , and to help them in every possible way except by direct gifts . If the poor have immediate needs , the visitor must first see that these are supplied by the regular relief societies . But his chief duty is to help by his advice and sympathy , when the poor are striving to help themselves . This work brings different classes of society together // to their mutual advantage . It enables the prosperous to understand the actual condition of the unthrifty , and the poor to learn the ways and means by which the successful have gained and preserved the comforts of life . Charity organization societies are untiring in their efforts to prevent children from growing up to be paupers . One of the saddest and most discouraging features of pauperism is its hereditary character . It is now being handed down from generation to generation in every large city in the land . Children grow up without knowing what independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgrace and misery of their condition , and this , not from any necessity , but because they are never taken in hand by the charitable people who give them alms , and furnished the opportunity to become indepen. dent and self-respecting . When our charity once puts an end to hereditary pauperism , the problem of dealing with the poor will be comparatively simple . The friendly visitors make it a special feature of their work to care for and protect the children . If their home surroundings are of such a character as to make it impossible to improve their condition there , if it is clear that the parent will deliberately lead the child in ways of vice and ruin , the visitor invokes the aid of the law and takes the child from a home of continual temptation and places it where its surroundings will tend to strengthen and encourage whatever good tendencies it may possess , and give it a chance to live a life of industry , virtue , and independence . Such features of the work as have been already described make it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all considerations of race , creed , or condition must be entirely disregarded . Wherever a human being is in need of such aid as charity can give , there the society has a duty . Its work is purely secular-not that it fails to recognize the need of religious work among the poor  --  but because this can be better done by other agencies , and becanse any religious teaching by its own visitors might lead to proselyting , which would make the harmonious action of different denominations impossible . Its visitors , nevertheless , always try to persuade any person with whom they deal to renew or strengthen the connection he may have had with any church . Co6peration between different // societies is encouraged in every way and experience shows that one can supplement the work of another in a remarkable degree . This is not only true of the charities of a single city , but societies in different communities can do much to help each other . A large number of poor persons migrate from town to town , and they can be much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other places is known . The Charity Organization Societies in different cities take special pains to furnish each other such information , and to help each other in every possible way . It may appear to some that Charity Organization seeks to occupy a field already taken , inasmuch as our local governments , through their departments of Charity and Correction , Overseers of the Poor , etc. , provide relief from the public treasury for all persons having a settlement in each community . Such , however , is not the case . In a great many places the relations of the public and private charities are far from friendly , and in some cities one actually hinders the work of the other . Charity Organization has already done much to bring these conflicting agencies into harmonious cooperation . It has furnished them a common ground for meeting where each has learned to understand the work of the other , and with better understanding usually comes better feeling . But a more fundamental reason for Charity Organization is that its work is charity in the strictest and best sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . The needy demand relief as a right under the law , while the officials dispense funds raised by the compulsory process of taxation , not because they wish to relieve distress , but because they are charged with a public duty which they must discharge according to binding instructions . Such duties are of course faithfully performed only where governments are good and officials conscientious . In too many places the officers in charge of the poor are controlled by political rings and are often interested in schemes of public plunder . A single example will show what may occur under such circumstances . The following is quoted from page 40 of the report of the Philadelphia Committee of One Hundred , dated Nov. 13th , 1884 , and refers to events which took place some time before the report was made . " His the superintendent 's flight to Canada was // followed by revelations of the most sickening character , which may as well be passed with the remark that the organized and systematic yearly attacks by certain politicians and public thieves , with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund , resulted in a shocking loss of life , and in untold suffering to those who were conipelled to seek shelter under the almshonse roof and survived its terrors . " The President of the Philadelphia Charity Organization Society is the chairman of the committee which exposed and reformed these abuses . One clear and well recognized duty of these societies is to keep themselves informed in regard to the methods by which public relief is administered , and to take an active part in reforming and improving those methods whenever there is need . It is a well known fact that in many communities , both in England and the United States , public relief is given in such a way as to increase and aggravate pauperism . And both here and there Charity Organization has materially changed and modified these methods with the most beneficial results . Let us take one illustration of what has been accomplished in the saving of money alone by such a reform . In the report of the Charity Organization Society of Philadelphia for 1885 , the Secretary makes the following statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the seven years ending with 1878 , when the society began its work , the appropriations for the support of the poor were $3,579,214.58 . For the succeeding seven years $2,790,996.24 . It thus appeal 's that the municipal expenditures for the latter period were $788,218.34 less than for the former and this notwithstanding the steady increase of the city 's population . We do not claim that all this reduction was due to the operations of the society . We believe that improved methods of municipal administration had a share in producing this result ; but we think it can not be questioned that a main factor in this enormous saving was the abolition of outdoor relief rendered possible only by the existence of the Society for Organizing Charity . " IDuring the time when this saving was being made , the poor of that city , outside of the almshouse , were much better cared for than they had been before . Great as is the direct benefit // to the public treasury by the methods of this society , a greater and far more important saving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the New York Society for 1885 , the Secretary says : " The society depends for the proof of its usefulness , not upon the largest possible list of beneficiaries relieved at the slightest possible cost of time and means , but upon the number redeemed from dependence , and transferred to the ranks of- the independent . As already stated , the District Committee reported during the past nine months 974 such cases which , at the lowest estimate by our best political economists of the difference between the value to the community of a contributing and of a dependent family , shows a clear gain of $487,000 , or a saving of $70 for every dollar of expense which the society incurred in maintaining these committees . This estimate takes no account of the more tender and loving work done for the temporarily distressed , the sick , the helpless , and the defective , a work not computable in the currency of trade . Again , on the same plane of money value , estimate the saving to the community of the 900 frauds and beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one dollar a day ( and their gains in many cases are known to be much greater ) their suppression saved to the benevolent $328,500 a year . . . . The question is often asked , what is the use of all this machinery of district committees , agents , and officers ? We desire no better answer than the facts above given . It pays-pays on the spot-pays 100 per cent . compound interest yearly in the future . " As the writer says , the attempt to put a money value on this work counts for little . It is the saving in men , women , and children that attests its worth . It holds them back from pauperism and the wretchedness and crime which follow . It strengthens character , inspires hope , and gives opportunity-curing the disease instead of soothing the patient with remedies which help but for the moment . There is no wise reform , no effort to improve the condition of the dependent , that can not count upon the support of Charity Organization . All well considered legislation to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its indorsement . Every reasonable attempt to add to their happiness or comfort receives its approval in advance . This // system is rapidly extending itself over the English-speaking world and has already accomplished greater results than are generally known . Whether it is destined to survive in its present form , or whether it is to be replaced by other and better plans for work among the poor , does not now concern ns . This fact , however , does deserve the recognition of every person interested in the welfare of the nnfortunate , that this is the best system thus far devised , that greater good has been and can be done under it than in any other way at present known . And whatever may follow , we may safely predict that so long as the present order of society continues , no charitable work can be thoroughly successful which is not based upon the fundamental principles of this system , viz : codperation , carefnl investigation , and the encouragement of self-help among the poor . Charity Organization calls on the strong and warm-hearted in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It asks not so much for their money , as for their time , their labor , and their thought . It calls on them to lend their aid in the solution of the problem of life for those who have thus far found it too hard for them , and whose future is beset by difficulties to which if left alone they would probably give way . But with the advice and sympathy of those who have the power and the will to help them in their need , they are inspired to the stronger and more persistent effort which usually succeeds . HENRY C.
