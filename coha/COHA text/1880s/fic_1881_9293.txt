Between the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The New York production was not very successful and the play was soon withdrawn . The cast was as follows : Jagon Henry Lee Blanchard Walden Ramsay Claude Charles Wheatleigh Robert O.H . Barr Captain Guerin Louis R. Grisel Lorenzo Fred Huebner Bontout Charles Burke Lonstalot Oliver Wren Papin James Wallis Xavier George H. Sheppard First Lieutenant James Sumner Second Lieutenant Dan Lacy Monsieur Vitel George Nichols Cabasa Harry Horn Pierre John H. Bunny Gregoin S. C. Halpin Jagnot L. F. Gorman Mathilde Agnes Booth Sophie Ellen Cummens Zoe Mrs. Selden Irwin Governor of Prison Lacy Victor Captain of the Ship Harry Jeffreys Jeanne Guerin Elen Ottolengui La Grande Florine Emily Denin In revising the play for production in New York , Belasco cut the number of speaking characters from thirty to twenty-four . It will be noticed , also , that in the pirated version included in this volume the number of speaking parts has been further reduced to twenty . As illustrations of what may happen to proper names when plays are subjected to the hazards of the theater , including piracy , we may point to Jacquot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ends as Laccassel ; and to La Grand Florine , which is metamorphosed into La Grande Florentine . Although the play was not particularly successful , it was revived several times for short engagements in New York : at the Grand Opera House , June 2-7 , 1884 ; at the Peoples Theatre , June 9-15 , 1884 , and again May 11-17 , 1885 . Belasco based the play on a French work by Adolphe Belot . Both Belasco and his biographer , William Winter , refer to the adaptation as having been made from a " story , " and it is true that a novel , Les Etrangleurs de Paris , by Adolphe Belot was published in 1879 and appeared in an English translation in 1880 . It is worth noting , however , that Belot dramatized his own novel , and that the play he made from it was produced at the Theatre Porte Saint-Martin , Paris , in the spring of 1880 . It would not be unreasonable , therefore , to assume that although Belasco based his play on the novel , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French dramatization . In reviewing the first performance in New York the Tribune of that city referred to it as " a sensation piece , embellished with showy scenery . " In his biography of Belasco , William Winter says , " This play is , in fact , an extravagant and , in some respects , a repulsive sensation melodrama ... The play is immensely inferior to the story upon parts of which it is based , but it serves its purpose as a ' shocker ' . " Belasco himself , in later years , referred to the play as " buncombe .

His fortune would then have come to me his natural heir . Well , two years ago when the old gentleman died , a will was found in which he left everything to a certain Matilda de Villeneuve . Soph . Sophie And who is this Matilda de Villeneuve ? Jean . Jeanne Guerin No one knows . Father contested the will but the courts decided against him ; he was advised to try his case before another tribunal but father was so discouraged at his failure that he gave it up and renounced all claim , and I am not sorry , for the first trial was a constant worry and excitement to us all . Besides , so very expensive , so much so that we are obliged even now to economize to make up for the costs . Bell rings Soph . Sophie There is master now . Jean .

There R.1.E. is the girl 's chamber and there Points to stairs is the old captain 's room . Everything just as he said . He came to deposit the money and I held him in conversation until after banking hours , then he returned here with the 53,000 francs , the money of which he has robbed my child . Little did he think when he sat there in the office chattering idly that Jagon the notary 's clerk was the father of Matilda de Villeneuve .

Zaviet Fifty-three thousand francs . Claude . Monsieur Claude At what hour did Monsieur Guerin leave your office yesterday ? Zav . Zaviet At a quarter of 4 o'clock . Claude . Monsieur Claude Is n't it rather unusual to pay out so large a sum of money at such an hour ? Zav . Zaviet He came after the time of our appointment . Claude .

Lor . Lorenz But me  --  your accomplice . Jagon . Jagon Would never be condemned , but silence , and listen to me . Sit down , keep your eyes straight before you . The time has now come when I must take you into my entire confidence . Twenty-three years ago I had a young and beautiful wife who died in giving birth to Matilda . I loved my wife  --  oh  --  oh , how I loved her  --  and the love of her made me forget I was a man . I became indifferent to my interests , neglected my business , lost all ambition , and sank so low that I became an outcast . But finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for  --  I endeavored to regain my position among my associates but it was too late . They turned their backs upon me , not one offered me a helping hand ; it was then I first hated mankind and resolved to be revenged upon the whole human race , and the more I hated mankind the more I loved my child . I resolved that nothing should remain undone which would gain for her wealth and position . I left Matilda with relatives in Paris . At my request Matilda assumed the name of De Villeneuve . I then went to Africa to endeavor to make a fortune ; it was there I first learned to strangle . I dealt in human flesh and developed the internal powers within me as I exercised my strength upon the black wretches who dared to rebel against me . I acquired a fortune and returned to Paris . I found that Matilda 's relatives had died in my absence and I found Matilda earning a bare livelihood . I concealed the fact that I was her father , I quelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I straightened the crooked back which nature gave me to hide the humps upon my shoulders . I established Matilda in a costly mansion and surrounded her with every luxury . At this time a wealthy gentleman , one Claude Guerin , struck by her beauty asked her to become his wife . I made a tool of Matilda . She obeyed me without questioning and promised to marry him . It was then you came with your accursed handsome face and ruined all my plans . But I determined the old gentleman 's wealth should not escape me , as this added to my own would be ample to satisfy all my ambitions . She got him to draw up a will in her favor . He did so , that was all I wanted of him , and he died . Lor . Lorenz Then ' t was you who  --  ? Jagon . Jagon Hush  --  Ask me no questions ; the doctors said it was apoplexy . The same will be said here . I have here 53,000 francs . Lor . Lorenz Here ? Jagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your rooms tonight together with the family papers and all , of the Marquis de Ribas . Use them to the best advantage . There is no one living to contest the ownership of them . Assume the title and rank , and now listen to my last words to you forever . When you see my child tonight , take her in your arms and hold her to your heart and bid her good-bye for me  --  forever . Lor . Lorenz Forever  --  ? Jagon . Jagon Yes , forever  --  for hard , cruel as I am , I have not the courage and even if I had , I dare not . Say what you please , tell her I have gone back to Africa to make another fortune . Tell her anything to satisfy her , and tell her that we shall never meet Sobs again ; I may be arrested , convicted , and executed , under the name of Jagon , but my child must never know it was her wretched father .

Enter Soldiers , gate Take it quietly ; how long have you been absent from Orleans without permission ? Jos . Joseph Three or four times at most . I came when I heard of the murder of Captain Guerin . Claude . Monsieur Claude What had the murder to do with your coming here ? Jos . Joseph My wife wrote me that she was ill and worried . Claude . Monsieur Claude What was she worried about ? Jos . Joseph There was a key  --  Claude . Monsieur Claude Exactly . Well  --  Jos . Joseph She took it away with her and when she returned it was not in her pocket . Claude . Monsieur Claude How does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it . Claude . Monsieur Claude Yet she opened the gate as usual that morning . Jos . Joseph She found the key in the lock . Claude . Monsieur Claude And yet when I questioned her she never mentioned so important an item ; nor has the fact of some person having the key in the lock before the arrival of your wife the next morning induced you to make this tardy confession with the hope of forestalling discovery . Jos . Joseph With what object ? Claude . Monsieur Claude To avert suspicion . Jos . Joseph Suspicion of what ? Claude . Monsieur Claude Of your wife having given you the key , although it is very ingenious for a cut and dry defense . It was simple for you to leave it in the lock where your wife would find it in the morning and return at once to Orleans to establish an alibi . Jos . Joseph An alibi  --  then I am accused ?

At present everything points to your being in Paris at eleven o'clock that night ; eleven o'clock , mind you , you were seen walking with your wife under the railway bridge at the end of the Rue Mercadet . Jos . Joseph I was seen , I was recognized , I Blanchard ? Claude . Monsieur Claude Yes , you ; your name was not known , but your description is exact ; now what have you to say ? Jos .

Sophie Yes  --  I worked a year for him . Claude . Monsieur Claude Well , Monsieur Vital asserts that on the night in question he saw you walking under the railway bridge in company with a man . Soph . Sophie Ah  --  I remember he followed me through the arch and tried to engage me in conversation but I walked very fast and he suddenly turned and left me . Claude . Monsieur Claude Could he have taken the key from the pocket of your apron as he walked by your side ? Soph . Sophie Yes  --  yes  --  I see it all . He attempted to take me by the wrist but I pushed him away . It was then he stole the key and returned . He was to rob and murder my poor master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I had forgotten it . Claude . Monsieur Claude The man who followed you was no other than your husband . Soph . Sophie My husband ! It is false ! Claude . Monsieur Claude Joseph Blanchard , proof points conclusively to you as one of the murderers of Captain Guerin  --  can you deny it ? Jos . Joseph What would be the use of denying it ? You would still believe me guilty . My God , penal servitude ! Transportation for life , the gallows , escape is impossible ! Soph . Sophie He can not defend himself  --  I will speak for him . Ten years of imprisonment have broken his spirit . You sent him to prison for a crime he never committed ; he was innocent of that as he is of this . You tore him away and left me , his wife , to starve . Our little child died of hunger in my arms . She has not stolen  --  what had she done that she should die ?

Robert Then you can establish the innocence of Blanchard ? Matilda . Mathilde I can . Rob . Robert And you know the accomplice ? Matilda . Mathilde Both the murderer and the accomplice . I can not , will not lie to you . Ask me no more , I can not answer . Rob . Robert But  --  Matilda .

Robert You must have some great motive for this mysterious concealment of what you know . Matilda . Mathilde I have  --  but believe me , I can not , dare  --  I dare not tell you what it is . There , let us talk of your affairs , of yourself . Not half an hour ago I overheard a plot to separate you from Jeanne ! Rob . Robert To separate me from Jeanne ! It is impossible ! Matilda . Mathilde Nothing is impossible . You are not aware with whom you are dealing . You must go to her at once , or it will be too late . Rob . Robert Ah , Matilda , you think only of my happiness . Takes her hand What a noble woman you are . Matilda . Mathil de A woman you have made noble by your counsel , your reasoning , and your kindness . You spoke , she listened , her heart was touched by your goodness , tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand across her eyes Rob . Robert But if you think of my welfare , I also have a right to think of yours . What is to become of you ? You are ill  --  weary ? Matilda . Mathilde Yes  --  weary  --  weary of life . Ah , if you only knew . But go  --  go  --  you must not delay . Rob . Robert Goes to door I shall see you again ? Matilda . Mathilde Yes , when you are happy with your bride . Exit Robert , door , L.U.E. See him again , never ! Never ! I can not meet him again . Oh , my God , what agony , what torture , I have endured this night .

Mathilde You shall not leave this room . Lor . Lorenz I shall . Matilda . Mathilde You shall not . Lor . Lorenz Throws her aside and unlocks the door As there is a Heaven above us , I 'll find Robert de Meillant and kill him . Matilda . Mathilde Then as there is a Heaven above us , I will denounce you not only as the murderer of Robert de Meillant , but also of Captain Guerin . Lor . Lorenz Recoils It is false . Matilda . Mathilde It is true and if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would aid him in proving the innocence of Joseph Blanchard and punish the guilty party , but I never dreamed of the horrible discovery that was revealed to me , when on being shown the portrait of Jagon and Joseph Blanchard  --  oh , great heaven , the portrait of Jagon was my father , do you hear ? My father ; the other one , oh  --  my eyes were at once opened to the whole truth . I remember having seen you on the night of the murder disguised in the exact imitation of Blanchard , of his every feature , his every article of dress . It was you who followed Sophie Blanchard under the bridge at the head of the Rue Mercadet . Everything was at once apparent . I found myself the wife of one villain , and the daughter of the other . Sinks on sofa Lor . Lorenz If Jagon , as you believe , is your father , is he not entitled to some compassion from you ? Was it to enrich himself he became a criminal ? That he risked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for you . It is your duty to protect him . You dare not denounce me . You understand ? It is not for you to bring your father to the scaffold . Matilda . Mathilde Aye  --  I understand . It was for love of me that he robbed , that he murdered , and I should thank and bless him for it . Yes , that is the creed of both of you . Both you and he have taught me that all means are good that aid in the acquirement of wealth , luxury , and position , and that nothing else is necessary . But , no , a thousand times , no ! There is something more . There is a self-respect , there is affection , there is a clear conscience . I have neither . My God , and this is the work of my father . Lor . Lorenz Matilda , I  --  Matilda . Mathilde You are a coward . An innocent man suffers in your place and you never raised a hand to save him . This is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hatred and loathing . If I could forget your crime , I could n't forget your infamy . Lor . Lorenz You reproach me for failing to denounce myself when an innocent man is accused in my stead . But if I had delivered myself up to justice , I should have been torn from you . I could n't renounce you . Matilda . Mathilde Joseph Blanchard had a wife whom he loved ; they tore him from her . Why inflict on him the tortures you could not support ? My  --  and why condemn him to a punishment you had n't the courage to face ? Lor . Lorenz What is he to you , this Blanchard , the convict ? You pity him , not through any goodness of heart , but because he is a protg of your lover . Matilda . Mathilde It is for that very reason , and for that reason I intend to bring him back from exile and send you in his place . Joseph Blanchard has suffered enough . You shall pay for your audacity . When Robert de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lorenz Take care . Matilda . Mathilde Yes , I swear it . He shall know all ! Lor . Lorenz Seizes her You will tell him ? Matilda . Mathil de I 'll tell him all  --  Lor . Lorenz Then curse you  --  die ! She screams , struggles up and down stage . He strangles her , tries to escape , down L.U.E. Enter Jagon , Bontout , Papen , Sophie , Jeanne , Robert , Claude , Zaviet . Zaviet and Claude seize Jagon ; he bursts away , dashes across to Lorenz , Guards stand in front of Lorenz Lor .

Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us here ? What induced you to escape from penal servitude only to deliver yourself into the hands of the law again ? Jagon . Jagon I have come to own my crime and to tell you that that wretch is my accomplice , the murderer of Captain Guerin ! Claude . Monsieur Claude How came a gentleman like the Marquis de Ribas to be your accomplice ? Jagon . Jagon He is not the Marquis de Ribas . The Marquis de Ribas is dead ; I strangled him . And this man who wears his name is no other than Lorenz the Blackmailer . Claude . Monsieur Claude Then Joseph Blanchard is innocent ? Soph . Sophie Speak man , speak . Papen . Papen Yes , he is innocent , and the crime for which he suffered years ago I committed and was not brave enough to free him . But now I will try to atone for the crime . Claude . Monsieur Claude He must be brought back from exile . Rob . Robert He has been brought back  --  he is here . Shoves Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert He is here and free of every crime . Soph . Sophie Do you hear , Joseph  --  at last  --  at last ! Jean . Jeanne Guerin My father is avenged . Jagon . Jagon Now Joseph Blanchard is cleared , restored to his wife . But my work is not done till I have killed this wretch . Darts at Lorenz who runs off , L.U.E. , guarded . Jagon rushes after him Claude . Monsieur Claude Do n't let him escape . Fire upon him ! Guards fire , Jagon fails in C. door , drags himself to Matilda 's side , as he speaks He has been brought to justice . Jagon . Jagon I had no wish to live but for my child . Now that she is gone , I am ready to die . Gasping I am done with justice , done with prisons , done with crime , done with life . Dies Back matter CURTAIN
