txt There are scores of regular physicians in this city , and nearly every man of them is excited over the subject of public vaccination . Some time ago the Board of Education got frightened at the possibility of a smallpox epidemic and worked up a petition for a town meeting to make an appropriation for free vaccination . The meeting was hold and only one man voted against the appriation , which was not to exceed $3,000 . Then the Selectmen took the matter in hand . They did n't believe in any sentimental squeamishness . If the town had a lot of vaeinating to do , the business should be done just as economically as possible . They would act just as if they had a sewer to build or a road to repair . They would not pay doctors $5 an hour just for making little holes in people 's arms . They would let the vacinating out by contract . Times were dull for the doctors , anyway , and the cheapest bidder could have the contract . The Board of Health favored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cost $15 a thousand less . When the New-Haven physicians heard of all this they lost their tempers . Last night the city Medical Association held a meeting , at which the members declared themselves as utterly opposed to putting in bids , and intimated that any man who would bid was no doctor at all . They were no two-dollar a day men , and they felt so badly about the slur the Selectmen had east upon their ancient and honorable profession that they adopted a set of resolutions , which closed with the statement " that it is the sense of this association that no member should put in a bid to do the vaccinating under the proposed plan to obtain the service at the lowest cost . " This afternoon the Selectmen held a meeting and voted to carry out their original plan to let out the contract . So the physicians are disgusted , the Selectmen are triumphant , and New-Haven waits to be vaccinated.
