txt Having crowded its most important business : into the last week of the session , tho House to-day got rid of the Sundry , Civil and River and Harbor bills in just the slovenly fashion that might have been expected . A good deal of objection has been made , even by Democrats , to Mr. Randall 's programme of holding back the Sundry Civil and Deficiency bills , to be forced through under suspension of the rules , without a careful examination of the items . Mr. Potter , of New-York , was indignant in his speeches of yesterday and to-day at the proposition to rush through with only four hours ' consideration a bill carrying $22,000,000 . The Appropriations Committee appeared to be impressed with the force of the criticisms made upon it . One after the other of its members rose to justify the action of the committee , but could give no better reason for the slovenly course adopted than that a lack of time compelled affirmative action . The River and Harbor COM% ittee , which had given up all hope days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , beat a retreat to-day and came out of the long fight with a compromise bill appropriating 85,000,000 , to be expended by the Secretary of War , upon the basis of the appropriations made in the last River and Harbor bill . Mr. Hiscock , who has been gratified because the consideration of the bill has given opportunity to discuss the - Mississippi River improvement , very positively declared that it would be better to pass no bill at ail than to take the imperfect compromise measure offered . The House , however , is tired out ; it has become impressed with its own inability to transact business in a.businesslike way , and it did not long hesitate to get rid of a matter that had troubled it . The bill was passed under a suspension of the rules by a vote of 100 to 8S , or four votes more than two-thirds . The Post Office Appropriation bill , which did not go to a conference committee , has been taken up in the House as in Committee of the Whole , and the amendments of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , and the House was voting on the Senate amendment in regard to the rate on newspaper postage , when the recess at 5 o'clock stopped proceedings . The bill will be taken up again to-morrow , and a vote will be reached on the ocean postage clause , when the House will again declare itself upon the Pacific Mail proposition to take the mails at 50 cents a mile . There are some fears expressed that the Pacific Mail people have secured votes enough to obtain the subsidy . If the House adheres to its last vote it will nonconcur in the Frye amendment and instruct its conferrees. to reject the amendment . Mr. John Roach is in the city talking with members of Congress . Members of the lobby who have been actively looking after the interests of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company express great confidence in the ability of the friends of the subsidy to carry it through the conference committee . It is asserted to-night that the members of that committee on the part of the House have been already selected , and that they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also asserted that the advocates of the subsidy confidently count upon Mr. Towushend , who voted against the subsidy clause in the House , to see that the conference committee reports in favor of leaving the proposition in the bill .
