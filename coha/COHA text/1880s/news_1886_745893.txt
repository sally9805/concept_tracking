txt The effort made in Boston to enforce the Sunday laws of Massachusetts may perhaps have the good result of drawing public attention to the fact that those laws are obsolete . Gen. GRANT once said that the best way to secure the repeal of a bad law was to enforce it , and there is no doubt that a literal execution of the Sunday laws in any city of New-England or of the Middle States would result at least in a vigorous agitation for their amendment . Liquor dealers , disgusted with . the restraints put upon their calling by the law , have at various times and in divers communities resented these restraints by endeavoring to secure the enforcement of the whole body of Sunday laws . It is not too much to say that the rigid enforcement of these laws would produce very great public . inconvenience in any city . From Saturday to Monday people would be deprived of the news of the day , and all communication as well as all traffic would be suspended . This need only be fairly tried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general inconvenience but , in a great many cases , positive distress . In this State the law permits the sale of perishable commodities early in the morning and the sale of drugs throughout the day . In Massachusetts the laws omit at least the latter of these exceptions , so that even a physician 's prescription can not lawfully be filled on Sunday . It does not need to be pointed out that such a state of the law is not only obsolete , but monstrous and inhuman . It does not follow , however , that all Sunday laws are either inhuman or obsolete . That is the conclusion the liquor dealers apparently wish the public to draw when they retort upon pile fitful attempts to suppress their traffic on Sunday with the attempt to suppress all traffic on that day . " Works of necessity and charity " are excepted in this State from the prohibition of " servile labor " on the first day of the week . The sale of liquor can not be brought under either of these heads , as most of the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . The question how far these exceptions should extend is one that will be variously answered . Even among those who hold that the observance of one day in the week as a day of rest is not merely a wise institution , but a religious duty , the line will be drawn very differently . The more complex and artificial character of life in cities makes the dwellers in them reckon as necessities things of which the inhabitants of rural regions have never felt and can not be expected to recognize the need . It is not fanciful to say that for people who spend six days of the week in monotonous toil , the provision of some diversion and recreation on the seventh is a necessity . It is this fact which justifies the opening of museums and libraries on Sunday and the employment of such persons as are necessary for this purpose . Those who uphold the letter of the Sunday laws would have a better warrant for their course if they could show that the visiting of these places would diminish the attendance upon the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither can anybody believe that Sunday can be kept as a day of wholesome and refreshing rest by families cooped up in the tenement houses of a great city . All this does not help the liquor sellers at all . It is certainly not a commendable way of spending Sunday , either from a religious or from a secular point of view , to spend it guzzling in a dram shop . Nor do the keepers of dram shops reduce the excise laws to an absurdity when they succeed in putting the law in motion against all manner of traffic . One need not take the Puritanical view of Sunday in order to believe that the observance of one day in seven as a day of rest is of great physical and moral benefit to the community . Such a person will be in favor of permitting only such labor to be done on that day , apart from work of evident necessity , as will best enable the community to profit by its day of rest . This will not include the opening of all the groggeries on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to permit wholesome and instructive recreation , there can be no reason for relaxing them in favor of an indulgence which never either wholesome or instructive , and is in a great majority of cases positively vicious .
