UNFORTUNATELY for Harvard the excesses of certain students have fastened upon the University a reputation which , to say the least , is undesirable . Perhaps the thought that Harvard can be unfortunate in any way may not readily occur to many , but the fact that parents are known to hesitate before entering their sons at Cambridge , and in some cases decline to do so , because there is said to be so much fast life there , must of itself prejudice the future of the Varsity in some measure . Even prosperous Harvard can not escape unharmed from an assault of public opinion . From time to time statements and counter-statements have appeared , on the one hand affirming the existence of a distinctly fast set at Cambridge and rebuking its wild and midnight revels ; and on the other hand denying the existence of such a coterie , or , at any rate , attempting to gloss over the conduct of the accused . The college authorities themselves may be reasonably suspected of efforts in the latter direction , for it is unlikely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire community . If they have not regarded the subject lightly , it is certain that they have adopted no heroic measures for the remedy of abuses that must ere long wffect Harvard seriously . Is there , or is there not a fast set at Harvard ? If the answer is " yes , " will it not apply to other American colleges aswell ? Or does Harvard present unusual opportunities or attractions for fast men ? Questions of this sort have been asked so many times without bringing a satisfactory reply that it may be well to give to the public a fair presentation of the facts as they are , facts hitherto withheld ( for excellent reasons of their own , no doubt ) by the Faculty . Lest the very title of this paper should move scores of worthy persons to indignant remonstrance , it may be remarked at the outset that Harvard life , while not of itself fast , presents // many attractions for the gay men who form a small though conspicuous part of the membership of the various classes , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . A clear exception having thus been made , many worthy souls may cry with the first breath of morning : " Let the gall 'd jade wince , our withers are unwrung ! " The Harvard Faculty , with the aid of elaborate statistics backing an exhaustive report which was founded upon a special investigation , proved , last summer , not only that an athletic student is not of necessity a poor scholar , but that numbers of the best men in college are devoted athletes . Having thus silenced the popular cry against college sports it is possible that the authorities may regard the popular conception of Harvard fast life as being considerably exaggerated , and as having no better foundation of fact than the other prejudice against college athletics . Without doubting for a moment that the Harvard Faculty during last May and June accomplished the almost miraculous task of conducting an investigation that investigated , it is well to bear in mind the fact that the evidence necessary to demonstrate a close connection between high scholastic percentages and " nines , ** and " elevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to be obtained with comparative ease and accuracy . After all , it could have been no very great feat to vindicate Harvard from the charge of sacrificing brain to brawn ; but the Faculty would be met with a task of altogether different dimensions were they to undertake to show that the fast men of the college and the high marks of the class are on intimate terms with one another ; and their task would be still more difficult were they to undertake to prove by statistics , however elaborate , and reports , however exhaustive or exhausting , that Harvard does not offer unsurpassed opportunities for young men who are bent upon a career of unhindered rapidity . In the first place , it would be essential for the Faculty to agree upon a definition . A given number of persons may have as many notions of what constitutes a fast life as they have of the merits of the various denominational roads to heaven . One thing is certain ; it would be wholly useless to accept the Boston definition . In Boston a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acts of a tragedy , if he keeps a shell on the river , or has a tandem on the Brighton road ; and , although he may not be // wholly lost to grace if his hours are prolonged at the Somerset Club , he is quite as meet for repentance as was that famous clergyman of the Hub whose parishioners lost all faith in his orthodoxy because he preferred a*swift horse to a slow one . There is but one way to approach the subject of fast life at Harvard , and that is from the standpoint of the fast Harvard man . Harvard 's definition of fast life will go further than the definition afforded by any other authority in the country , unless it be that of New York , and it is possible that the fast young man may fare the worse on that account . To be fast in the Harvard sense is to run the scale of " manly pleasures , " and then jump the border and plunge into the babbling stream of dissipation . It will be understood , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sort that modern refinement exalts as " gentlemanly . " A fast Harvard man when in his cups is proudly conscious of the fact that he is still a gentleman , and , though he may cause his neighbors and the police some annoyance , his exuberance of spirit never descends to the common level of an inebriated costermonger 's joy-at least in his opinion . A member of the fast set is not a sot ; he is not a hopeless case by any means ; but there is not a pleasure , legitimate or forbidden , that he leaves untasted during his college life . No one will resent more quickly than he any imputation of grossness or license in his conduct ; in his wildest excess he is always " the gentleman ; " which , being interpreted , means in the plainest phrase that he dresses his vices and his extravagances better , and that he pays more for them than other men . Harvard is about three miles from Boston . To the Gothamite , or the Chicagoan mind this may not seem an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the very teeth of metropolitan prejudice it can be urged that even provincial Bostonis fully equipped with every aid to the gay life . Harvard men know this , and in their search for convivial , financial , pugilistic , or amorous adventure they shape their course due East from the Delta . They return when they choose , sometimes the same night , sometimes the next day , sometimes a week hence , and occasions have not been lacking when an absence of three weeks followed the starting forth . There are upwards of two thousand students at Harvard . Naturally , a multitude of characters is found in this goodly // number . Perhaps a majority are quiet fellows whose utmost gaiety will scarcely bring the traditional blush to the cheek of modesty . Of the remainder , most drink a little , play a little , get into all sorts of foolish and reprehensible scrapes very often , and rather desire a reputation for rapidity than actually get up the high speed ; while the " fast set " will comprise , say , one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gleaners , to be sure . In many other colleges the social life centres in the rooms of the students . At Harvard the social life is most manifest in the clubs and societies . Of these societies the D. K. E. , having , perhaps , two hundred members , is the most conspicuous , and , as many think , the least desirable . All the members of the D. K. E. may not be fast , but the society itself does not conceal a desire to be thought as boisterous and as jovial as the law permits . To such a point have the nocturnal celebrations of this body been carried , that the D. K. E. long since became a reproach to Harvard student life . Its members have often been brought up , not only by the Faculty , but by the police magistrates , on charges that mozt young men , not collegians , would be ashamed to meet . Ther has of late been a certain pretence of reforming the ID . K. E. , but reforms in college life , like reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch woodcocks withal , " - glittering promises to quiet the exacting multitude . The ID . K. E. is called a fast society , but , while members of the fast set belong to it , the society is not the fast set itself , although it is perhaps its dearest wish in life to be considered so . The society is held in evidence by its high spirits . These spirits are kept in individual lockers during the day and let loose at night , to the utter dismay of the neighbors and the local advocates of prohibition . The members greet a police raid on their premises not with sorrow or with anger , but with delight , as if the presence of the officers of the law afforded proof of the soundness of the society 's pretensions to dissipation . The members of the D. K. E. , like their superiors in the gay ranks , have a profound consciousness that they are gentlemen ; and so it is to be presumed that when they broke the tableware at the conclusion of a recent feast , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises with all the arts that distinguish the gentleman from the cad . VOL. cxLYII. - No. 384. // But the distinctively fast set at Harvard is a thing by itself , and it dwells apart from ordinary life . It is a close clique , within which are cliques still closer , it has no specific organization , no by-laws , and no unquestioned leader to whose decrees it must bow . It is composed of rich men and their satellites , and it numbers , all told , say one hundred men , with pocket incomes ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 a year , and more if occasion warrants and their parents permit . Their expenditures are as liberal as the judgment of their fathers is limited . Their dress , their rooms , their table , their habits and their notes of hand  --  the shadow of extravagance is over them all ! If they learn nothing else at college , they easily acquire the education of the spendthrift ; and they talk with nonchalance of an outgo of thousands a year before they have mastered the rudiments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride is in their reputation as fast men ; for this reputation they work as hard as other men work at Greek and conic sections , and in this reputation they glory . They are not high in their classes ; they are , indeed , very poor scholars as a general thing , giving as little attention to study as will suffice to keep their names on the college books , burning midnight oil every night in the year , and yet only for study when examinations are at hand , at which trying periods they place themselves under the diligent and expensive care of tutors . It may be said that the fast men buy their way through college . They have plenty of money , and when they need brains they can very easily purchase the necessary assortment from their tutors . They are " good fellows " by universal consent , and their social eminence is attested by the fact that they take their pleasures , as they say , " as becomes gentlemen , and not in the manner of chumps . " From this it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard : " the gentlemen " and the " chumps . " Mr. Eugene Field , the savant of Chicago , has lately thrown a strong light on the origin of this term of opprobrium , and , according to his researches , it appears that " the word chumps was new born about 1883 , and was originally used to designate the heavy , English sort of swell who bought wine for chorus girls . The essential conditions of true chumpery are : " ( 1 ) The man must be large in person and solemn in manner . ( 2 ) He must open wine . " ' No traveler or hen vivani in America will need an introduction // to the Parker House in Boston . Nor will any of these worthies need to be told that the youths who haunt that hostlery , in overcoats ridiculously small , and trousers " a world too wide for their shrunk shanks , " with walking sticks carried wrong end up , and with voices that apparently embrace all mankind in their confidences ,  --  no patron of Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Harvard men . Parker 's is the Boston annex of Harvard College . Collegians fast and furious , and those who are feebly imitative and lack fat purses , betake themselves to the famous caravansary on School street , the first to do the " smart thing , " and the others to pretend to the extremes they can not hope to grasp . To be carried home in a cab , through absolute incapacity to get home in any othcr way , is to reach a distinction not attainable by less fortunate mortals who , though they may reach a high state of intoxication , have , like the poor in the familiar rhyme , " to walk be jabez . " But if Harvard men who have dallied too long over the wine cup would always go home in a cab , outer barbarians would have much less cause to heap anathemas upon them .

When he , with a dozen comrades in a similar state of spirituous ecstasy , takes possession of the last car to Cambridge , bullies the conductor , frightens belated women and children , and ogles attractive maids , it must be confessed that he and his free companions merit the broken heads which they occasionally put to bed in college halls . The demeanor of a large class of Harvard men is , as the world knows well , one of ever conscious superiority ; and this is rarely diluted with even the smallest suspicion of condescension . Add to this a bountiful supply of fire-water , and the Chesterfieldian claims of the Harvard man have , of necessity , to be taken on trust . Even a lordly sense of superiority to all mankind is but a questionable warrant for publicly kissing a young woman whose acquaintance one has enjoyed , first and last , for full sixty // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW seconds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning Faculty , the strongest plea that can be urged in his favor is : " He is a gentleman , and has always borne himself as becomes a gentleman . * The Faculty may frown , but they will rarely do more than frown or admonish . It might be well if the college authorities pronounced sentence of suspension more frequently . As for expulsion , that is an affair so rare that when it occurs the collegiate world is horrified . The sin at Harvard seems to be the discovery rather than the act of error itself . It is , or at any rate it has been , the policy of the college authorities to shield the evil-doer when he has not publicly disgraced himself ; but let him appear in the police courts , or let the public hear of his escapades , and " the reputation of the college must be sustained . " It is not Harvard 's place to teach manners ; the student should be fairly grounded in this branch of learning before leaving the kindergarten . The fast set is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell one of the elect that his set is snobbish , he will reply : " Not so . harvard is democratic , and men are judged here purely on their merits . " In this case one can conclude only that Harvard 's idea of democratic spirit is like the way of the Mongolian in the poem-vain and peculiar . A man who does not belong to the fashionable set may be a very worthy fellow , but at best he is unfortunate , and he is treated with an air of patronage that is not always gracious . Harvard men who deny this can do so only after forgetting the condescending paragraphs printed in Boston 's leading society paper by college correspondents whose lament was that certain men who won distinction in the class of 88 were not members of the best set in college . Heaven forbid ! Had they belonged to the best set in college they might never have won distinction in their studies . When asked how much a fast man has to spend at college to do justice to his position , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . It is difficult , if not impossible , to say how much another man spends ; only he , or his father or guardian , will be likely to know . One or two men are credited with spending *10,000 a year , but few of us , I dare say , spend more than *5,000 , while the average in the set would be a little below that . Of course this is my own estimate ; if you want to know the facts ask the other fellows  --  and they wo n't tell . " // 549 All Harvard men , like a few of their less favored fellow creatures outside college walls , have an eye , if indeed they are not all eyes , for a pretty face under a love of a bonnet .

Managers of this highly intellectual species of entertainment have been known to make their dates for cultured Boston in order to meet term-time at Harvard . The old habit of " supiug " at the play has of late years fallen into " innocuous desnetude , " or if it finds favor at all , it is only among a few callow freshmen . Suping was not fast enough for the fast men , who now take their drama in front and ogle the stars or the chorus girls , according to the depth of assurance or pocket in individual cases . Floral tributes to the passing fair who disport themselves in tights , carriages at the stage door and suppers after the play , with vivacious coryphees , soubrettes or prima donnas to lend a sauce to appetite , testify to the collegian 's love of the dramatic art in these days . Nor does his appreciation *anse here .

What should Boston have known about " The Parsonage , " where the morals of Harvard youth were depleted along with Harvard purses ; where wine ran freely from dusk till daybreak , and where hundreds of dollars were dissipated over the wildest orgies that ever went unmolested by the police ? What should Boston have known of it , even though an Alderman had owned this palace of joy , whose sirens lured on their victims , while prayer and praise were ascending in the church not more distant than the thickness of a brick wall ? Gambling has been very nearly crushed out at Harvard , if the college authorities are to be believed . But it may be urged , with all deference to the dignitaries , that circumstances occasionally justify a respectful doubt of the best intentioned representations . College authorities are not always informed of what is taking place // under their noses , and the Harvard authorities sometimes slumber in blissful ignorance of the revels of their merry young men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instructor recently , and the experience and observation of a college man who sometimes puts his ideas into print warranted the following plain statement last term , and it may be said , parenthetically , that when the present term is a little older , a similar if not a worse condition will undoubtedly prevail , for they say that 89 is the wildest class that has been at Harvard for years . " One of the most surprising things , " says the authority just mentioned , " is the universality of poker ; like the measles , it attacks rich and poor ; some rooms are regular dives where games are always going on . I dropped into such a room the other evening where seven men were playing , and four or five more were lying around reading novels and waiting for a chance to play . In college the dual life may be followed with greater success than in after years .

" Here is a pen picture of a Harvard card den drawn by a college correspondent : 1'The poker room with its heated atmosphere impregnated with the sickening smell of stale cigarette smoke , its curses both loud and deeps at ill luck , the wild , feverish talk , the hysterical laugh , and the ghastly faces on which are written greed and avarice and despair , is a bad school for any one , and it makes short work of these freshmen , on whose lips the milk is scarcely dry . ' About one-half of the constant poker players practice disreputable tricks . One is driven to the conclusion that it is chiefly rascals who take to poker , or that poker makes rascals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , said to me the other day that he would have to play in a gambling-hell in Boston hereafter , where he would run less risk of being cheated . " It requires but a few moments to lose a hundred dollars at a game , as many fast men and would-be fast men know . One of the set dropped a cool thousand at poker last year . He may have been the hero of his clique after that ; his foolishness entitled // him to the honor . From poker to betting , or from betting to poker-either way is but a step and a step easily taken . " Bet and be a man , " is a motto that very many Harvard boys have appropriated . The fruitful result of all this financial insanity is the sea of paper that inundates Cambridge every now and then . The I. 0 . U. 's of college men are as plentiful as blackberries ; and certain local tradesmen of kindly heart lend money at as reasonable a rate as five per cent . a week . A college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fast in the complete sense of the term ; nor can he spend $5,000 a year without being fast . Indeed , when his expenditure exceeds $1,500 or $2,000 the legitimate inference is that he is a wild youth , always providing that he does not keep horses or a yacht-either of which are expensive luxuries , even when taken in the mildest form . " Harvard is a world of itself , " says the student of to-day . And , like the great world outside , it has changed amazingly during the last four or five decades . Less than half a century ago sixty men were considered a large class ; now the average is two hundred and fifty . Then the character and mode of life of every man were known to every other man ; a condition now impossible where every man 's acquaintance is limited to his " Society , " and his intimacy restricted to his clique . Then quick and constant communication with Boston was unknown , and , as the fare ( by omnibus ) was twenty-five cents , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then an atmosphere of simple village life pervaded Cambridge ; now the place is a " prohibition " city where thirsty students may find favor at the druggists ' without " winking . " Then the college men from the country lived on $300 a year , including tuition , and the great body of students did not exceed $500 a year in their individual expenditures ; now the man who spends less than $1,000 in a twelvemouth is considered poor indeed , and a five-thousand-dollar man is not regarded as a spendthrift . Then , although most , if not all , of the students drank , they did not drink to excess . They were very moderate in their use of wine . One man , who had a keg of beer in his room , was thought a monstrously dissipated fellow to go to such an extent . Intoxication was rare then ; now it is all too common . Then a man in his cups was regarded with pity , or scorn , or contempt by the great body // of his fellow-students ; now he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not as straight a path as most men wish to tread . Then about one man in ten was a total abstainer , and looked upon as a " milksop " ; now , although there is more drunkenness , there is more charity for the fellows who " lack manly spirit . " Then the Don Juans were very , very few , and there would have been a public scandal had a medical examiner rejected eight out of nine candidates for positions in athletic games on the score of unmentionable disease . Then such men would have been socially ostracised ; now their sufferings are purely physical . Harvard 's proximity to a large city , and the fact that the homes of most of the students are far away , may account for much of the " wildness " in the college life . In this case famous conditions are somewhat changed , and while the mice are away they play as only college mice can play . At Harvard a man is very much his own master , and very poor mastery some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eliot , the Faculty and the Overseers together can alter things . They can not make foolish men wise , and they can not make saints of giddy and licentious worldlings . If it were practicable , as it is not , it would b* unwise to establish a system of espionage , for while the Faculty might exercise a degree of repressive authority in Cambridge , such a course would end only in making bad matters worse by driving the students to Boston for their flighty " larks . " Now they go to town voluntarily ; it would be rash to force them there . Nor would it be a simple matter for the Faculty to prevent the gay Lotharios bringing the fair and frail companions of their dissipations into the yard on Class Day . The expressed contempt of fellow students might affect a reform here . Had such contempt been taken from its shell of indifference last June , it is possible that some men would have slunk into dark corners for very shame . It is bad enough to be conspicuous outside the college territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as respect for the venerable varsity might induce men to exclude the priestesses of pleasure from precincts for which some other men at least show reverence . If it is impossible for the Faculty to subdue the misdirected energies of the fast men at Harvard , an aroused college sentiment may be capable of affecting a reform . This , and some trifles of common sense on the part of indulgent fathers , might heighten the moral tone , // perforce . When paler cuts down the allowance , refuses to take up the notes and to honor the debts of excess , Jilius will , of necessity , be nearer chaste , if it is impossible for him to be pure .
