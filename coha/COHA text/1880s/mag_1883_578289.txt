MR . EMERSON IN THE LECTURE ROOM . THE following reminiscences of a course of lectures by Emerson , delivered before the post-graduate class of Harvard University during April and May , 1870 , were written in letters to an absent friend . They can not be considered in any sense as reports of the lectures , but rather as memory-pictures of our New England master and teacher . To those persons who can recall the tones of Emerson 's voice and his manner in speaking , such fragments possess an interest apart from the thoughts they contain . Personal memories tinge the sentiments they convey , but they present , at least , a picture painted with reverence and affection . BosToN , April 28 , 1870 . DEAR - : I have the happiness of being one of thirty persons who attend a course of lectures by Mr. Emerson , intended for the graduates of Harvard . His general topic is Notes on the History of the Intellect , and he began his first lecture with a witty disclaimer against being considered a metaphysician himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Reid , Hamilton , Berkeley , Kant , give us less , with all their systems , than Montaigne , Montesquien , Diderot , or even Rabelais , with his breadth of humor . " The trouble is , " he continued , " men ordinarily take no note of their thoughts . They say one thing to-day and another thing to-mor* row , and forget them all . Our thoughts are our companions and our guides ; but sometimes we find ourselves less familiar with these interior friends than with exterior ones . It is the development of mind which makes the science of mind . " The miracle is the tally of thoughts to things . A new thought is retrospective . It is like fire applied to a train of gunpowder . It lights all that has gone before . " We are impatient of too much introspection . What the eye sees , and not the eye , is what we chiefly regard . We are broken into sparkles of thought , like the stars in the system of Copernicus . To Be is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle with Truth . Our thoughts are like facets cut on the jewel of Truth . Intelhi*t is not a gift , but the presence of God : You will see from these morsels that I attempt nothing like a report in your behalf . Few things disturb Mr. Emerson so much as to see a note-book ; so we only have a right to carry away what we can put into the pocket of our memories . He seldom speaks an hour ; once he gave us but twenty minutes ; indeed , I think half an hour is about the measure of his discourse . He said one day , " The mind is what has and sees and is seen . There is perfect unison between mind and matter ; hence the value // of a new word , which is a gift to the world . Plato gave us one of the most valuable words and definitions when lie used analogy , ' and defined it as identity of ratios . ' No definition of genius , however , can equal the word , and Mr. Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle mind by the presence of the hero . " The best study of metaphysics is physics . The subtle relations between things , the discovery that every system is but a part of the one great system , - this is the wonderful lesson the universe teaches us . " There is no stop ; all is pulsation , undulation . The world is framed of atoms , and in every atom we may discern Man . " Growth and birth and the sexes , - all these words belong also to the mind ; for there is assuredly sex in the mind , though not the same . A masculine mind is sometimes found in the woman , and a feminine in the man . " The mind is a deep , unfathomable cavern . Man is forever a stranger to himself , and what a blessing is he who can help us to a better acquaintance ! What a torch is that which can throw one gleam down into the spirit 's cavernous depths ! We are to each other as our perception is . Perception is power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science results . " Thoughts are rare ; whoever has one to give , that person is needed . Young people often feel as if they were bursting with them ; but when they try to ( leliver themselves , it is discovered to be all a false alarm . The heavens appear to be sown with countless stars ; but when we try to number those we really see , they only amount to a few hundreds . So it is with our thoughts . Herschel computed there were only about one hundred hours in the year when his great forty-foot telescope was of any avail for observations . Our hours of thought are as rare . It is not every undisturbed day which is fruitful in them . They belong to happy periods . " Perception is swiftness ; they who see first what to do can do it first , except some few inspired idiots , who are full and see much , but can not be tapped anywhere . Words and definitions are often the result of this swift apprehension . Perception helps expression , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free our thought , we should be liberated into the universe . " Talent is ever in demand . A man who can do anything well is needed . We utilize talent too much in this age . It goes for nothing if it be not lucrative . A useful talent is wanted twelve hours in the day . " Bohemianism is the surrender of talent to money . Isocrates said of Protagoras , and that class of philosophers , that they would sell anything but their hope in the immortality of their own souls for four mina* . Talent is everywhere in great repute with us . To say clever things , to be sharp and brilliant , is to be well regarded . " Mr. Emerson seldom announces any subject or subdivision of his general topic , but one afternoon he began by saying , " My subject is Memory . Every machine must be perfect to be in running order . Wheels cogs , teeth , must all match and hold well together . It is the healthy mind whose memory works perfectly . Memory should shut tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is cement , bitumen , matrix , to the mind , the cohesion which creates knowledge . It is retroactive , working backward as well as forward in an ever-lengthening chain . Akin to the power of creation is the joy of calling back into existence , by the compelling force of will , something which had disappeared from life . Tenacity , accessibility or choice , and swiftness are qualities of memory . No memory holds a variety of subjects . We remember according to our affec // tions . Napoleon could remember the army roll , but said his memory was so poor that an Alexandrine verse was impossible to him . If the army roll were put on one side , and all the great poems of the world on the other , he should choose the army roll . He wrote down everything else which it was important to record ; that he remembered without an effort . " Quintilian has said , Memory is the measure of mind . ' Frederick the Great knew every man in his army and every bottle in his wine-cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many pages in length , the latter , on Boilean 's ceasing to read , immediately repeated the whole after him , saying he had heard it before . Boilean was at first distressed , but soon discovered it to be simply a feat of memory . Dr. Johnson could repeat whole hooks which he had read but once . This power failed somewhat after he was forty years old . *The faculty of memory does not appear to grow ; there is some wildness in it . Horses possess in their wild state a swiftness which is never attained after they are broken ; so the sleep of savages and children , which people of culture and care never know again . Such is the undisturbed power of memory in childhood . We hever forget what is absorbed in those few first years of existence . The power of vivid remembrance seems to make time very long to children . We hear one who can scarcely speak say to his companion , Ca n't you berember how we used to make mud pies and play in puddles ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , though seeming years to them . This wild memory belongs both to children and to the childhood of the world . There is an Eastern poem in existence , said to be longer than the iliad and Odyssey , which exists only in the memories of its people . " Memory is not only subject to will , but it has a will of its own . It is like a looking-glass , because it reflects what passes before it ; yet , unlike a lookingglass , it retains , and at will reproduces , any figure that is wanted in the very centre of the plate . What the power is by which a subject is often unconsciously retained , through years , uncalled for , and is suddenly produced when needed , no one has ever been able to turn himself inside out quick enough to discover . " There is a bit of journal , written by an English gentleman after a pleasant visit to a country-house , in which he says , I left Lady s house several days ago . I heard many good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have not yet found time . I take a look at them now and then , in my memory , to he sure they are quite safe . ' " Who of us has not known kindred experiences ! Memory accelerates life , and lengthens it . How a short period may be made a long one by a diversity of subjects being presented to us which are worth remembering , we all know . So a person of quick perception to behold and memory to secure will be possessed of something of which a slower man , having the same experience , may be altogether unconscious of . What a convenience and resource is memory ! To have what is needed always on demand ! It was said of a German professor that he was a third university ; he carried a whole library in his head . " This memory is after all so rare that let a man read what everybody else has read , just one year later and hewill appear to other people to be a sphinx . The swiftness of memory distinguishes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the point . It is no marvel to see anybody perform the feats of Safford with pen and paper . Everybody can do that ! But at the age of ten , with a multiplicand of fifteen figures and a multiplier of fifteen figures , to give the result at once , was indeed a marvel , and this ten years before he // came to our university . Nevertheless , memory appears to be no test of the original power of the mind . With a certain ideal class it seems rather to interfere . Wordsworth and Goethe , for instance , could never bring the memory to explain the meaning and connection of certain passages written in their youth . Whatever coherence there was in their own minds with what went before or came after was not easily perceived by others , nor to be explained by themselves . Not unfrequently , however , the connection between thoughts , lost by the author , may be discovered by other imaginative minds brought to bear upon the subject . There is something ideal in memory . What is addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost . When we discover that a man remembers many things we have not ; when we perceive that he does not do this by a knot in his handkerchief , or a bit of worsted , or by any trick , but by some hidden and fine relation between subject and subject , which we can not discern , then we feel the greatness of the power , and we seem to talk with Jove . " The memory of beautiful things retards time ; music conceals it . Thus the allegory of Siva , when he comes to ask the god to give him one of three princes in marriage for his daughter . As he approaches the oracle he hears sounds of music , which appear to him so beautiful that he delays a while to listen ; and while he delays the first strain ceases , and another begins , which he also waits to hear . When at last there is silence he asks the god for one of the three princes . lie is assured that it is impossible ; for not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third generation , have already married while he was listening to the music . " Memory , with most people , consists of a record of what notes are given and when the payment is , due ; with others , it is formative and a token of love . We naturally hate all docked or shallowthoughted men . Simonides is called the Father of Memory . It is recorded on the tomb of Abelard that he knew all that was knowable . The best office of memory is to forget all that is painful , and remember only our joys . Fate is an artist , and lets us forget what we should forget . Most of us remember only what we have remembered before ; but deep thought holds in solution all facts . The best art of memory is to understand things thoroughly . New knowledge always calls upon old knowledge . Memory should enshrine principles instead of traditions . " rrhe serious significance of this lecture was lightened for the public mind by a number of humorous illustrations . Mr. Emerson said that there were various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember reading , " he continued , " in an old book called Fullom 's Casket of Memory , that it is good to make a gargle , to be taken warm in the morning , to be composed of a concoction of flowers , Pew milk , and pennyroyal ! Dr. Johnson said he could remember the man he had kicked last . " Speaking , one day , of imagination , Mr. Emerson quoted Sir rrhomas Browne , who said , " The severe schools shall never laugh me out of the philosophy of Hermes , that this visible world is but a picture of the invisible , wherein as in a portrait , things are not , truly , but in equivocal shapes , and as they counterfeit some more real substance in that invisible fabric . " " No one , perhaps , has given us a better exposition of this doctrine than Emmanuel Swedenborg . The substance of his teaching is how , out of the shows of things , to obtain reality . Imagination predicts Nature , and leads our thought upward from point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its office . The imagination following the steps of a new thought hears it echoed // from pole to pole . The symbol plays a large part in our speech . We could not do without it . Few can either give or receive unrelieved thought in conversation . A symbol or trope lightens it . We remember a happy comparison all our lives . Machiavelli said the papacy was a great stone in the wound of Italy to keep it from healing . Genius shows itself in sprightly suggestion . A good analogy to my thought is far more to me than to find that Plato or Swedenborg agree with it . To find that the elm-tree nods assent to it and that runfling waters conform to it , - this alone is confirmation . " Dante 's poetry has hands and feet . I went into a painter 's studio once , where I found he had modeled the figures of Dante 's characters in clay before beginning to paint his picture ; and I was half persuaded the poet did the same himself . " All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The lectures themselves are poetry and music . Speaking of dreams , he continued , " More than what Plato or any philosopher can or ever shall give u sis sometimes unveiled in these unaccountable experiences . No drama in five acts ever written can compare with the drama in fifty acts unfolded to the dirtiest sluggard upon the floor of the watchhouse . " The words Fancy and Imagination are frequently used without discrimination . It is a mistake . Fancy is full of accidental surprises , and amuses the vacant or idle mind . Imagination silences Fancy , which becomes speechless in its presence . Imagination deals with the identity of things . It is real , central , tragic . Sometimes we think it makes all we call Nature . " My friend Thoreau was full of fanciful suggestions from natural objects : such as the tanager setting the woods on fire as he flies through them ; ' the golden-rod waving its yellow banners , and marching eastward to the Crusade ; ' the dewy cobwebs , handkerchiefs dropped by fairies . ' And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the back of that great whale just under our bows ! They have stuck a harpoon in him , and he is plowing his way off across the continent . ' I can never see it without that thought coming again to my mind . Imagina tion gives us the like romantic elements for our life , and feeds us with commanding thoughts . " Every one would be a poet if his intellectual digestion were perfect . " The transition from the subject of Imagination to that of Inspiration is easy . No fable of metamorphosis , but a truth , is this which inspiration works in us . Plato has said no man who always understands himself can ever be a poet . There is an essence which passes from an intelligence higher than ourselves , and sways us . We can not compel it by our will . We throw up our work for it ( wishing it may come ) , to no purpose . When we least hope for it in lyric glances , it shines upon us . Unstable in its course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared little for those poets who understood what they did , like Byron and Scott . He much preferred William Blake . We never know the depth of the notes we accidentally sound . Heat is necessary . We must have heat . Enthusiasm daring ruin for its object . " Pit-coal , - where to find it ! We may have engines which work as perfectly as watches , but they are all nothing if we can not strike the mine . " There is contagion in inspiration . It was said of Mirabean that to-morrow was no impostor to him ; ' all who came near him learned how much the hours meant to him . We love to be magnetized. **rrhe story of the Pleiades , - by what poet has it not been sung ! Every nun in retirement makes the lost Pleiad the // 1883 . Alir . Emerson in the Lecture Room . subject of her song . I think there must he a universal chord struck in the idea , which is that of a lost thought . How to obtain thoughts is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul , - these are some of the means by which thoughts visit us . But there is no continuance , no permanency , in their presence . They are subject to continual ebb and flow ; beside , we lose much by the breaking up of hours and by sleep . We are sometimes like the cat 's back , breaking out all over in sparkles of thought . Are these moods within control ? Where is the Franklin for this fluid ? Poetry is full of apostrophe to inspiration , much of it commonplace enough ; but Herrick 's little poem is worth reading ; also the preface written by William Blake to his poems . A certain recognition of this power beyond themselves is often manifested by great men , as when Kepler said he could afford to wait one hundred years for a reader , since God had waited five thousand years for such an astronomer as himself . " How many sources of inspiration can we count ? As many as are our aflinities . First , I would say health ; second , sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were . We lie down spent ; we rise with powers new born . As a third source of inspiration I would choose solitary converse with nature . What student does not know this ? The mornings , the deep woods , the yellow autumn-time . There is much in that French motto , Ii n'y a que le matin . ' Thought is clear then ; life is new and strong . But to save the hours , to prevent the frightening away of thought ! It is a difficult problem . At home I shut myself up , frequently with great detriment to my affairs ( being small farmer as well as householder ) , and must not he interrupted . But the only safe refuge is a country inn or a city hotel . There no one can call you , and the hours flow on in astronomic leisure . Years ago , I remember , Mr. Carlyle projected a study at the top of his house , subject to no housemaid . Late in life this plan of his was accomplished , and Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Sand says , somewhere , she never had an idea that the slightest chill could not drive away from her . To some , a fine view , the face of external nature , is a hindrance . William Blake said nature was a disturbance to his work . Sir Joshua Reynolds disliked Richmond , and said his landscape was the human face divine . " We remember the plainness of Goethe 's study . New poetry , too , is inspiration . I mean for the most part old poetry read for the first time ; so also with new words . Almost we say , not even friends ! a word is best . " Next , I would put conversation . Good conversation is a wonderful promoter of intellectual activity . We become emulous . If one says better things than we could , or different , we are stimulated in turn . Conversation is the right metaphysical professor . Sincere and happy conversation always doubles our power. * , On another day , in approaching the subject of Genius , Mr. Emerson said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been described as Attention ; but I hold that Genius is Veracity , and with it always the year is one and the emperor present . With Genius there is always youth , and never the obituary eloquence of memory . Who taught Raphael and Correggio to paint ? They were taught of God in a dream . " Shakespeare , Voltaire , Byron , Daniel Webster , and Father Taylor were equally interesting to all classes ; for there are two brains in every man of genius . Talent is vice-president and presiding officer , never the king . Truth is sensibility to the laws of the world , and genius is always governed by truth . Genius deals with the elemental , the // June , roots of things , and takes nothing second hand . " Once , in speaking of common sense , Mr. Emerson said , " It is a power all esteem . It reaps , plows , *ows , threshes , sweats . No one would be without it . Bonar said , Common sense and genius make the world , ' not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect sticking to facts . Goethe was full of this . Like Pericles , he needed a helmet to conceal the dreaded infirmity of his head . He had a large air-chamber ; but if any of his neighbors caught him creeping into the chamber of the Muses , he would deny it point blank , saying , No , no ; I was going to the county jail . ' Some nations appear more distinguished for this quality than others . I think the English excel ; although with them it is apt to degenerate into brutality . The French people perhaps manage it more courteously ; yet a republic is a bette.r field for its development . With a monarchy and the small circle of aristocracy come idealism and exemption . In a republic all find use for hands and feet . Napoleon conversing with an officer on a matter of business , the functionary said , I can hardly talk with you as I should like about this , for I am not a witty man . ' Napoleon answered , I do not want your wit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes , to whom Mr. Osborne , of England , was sent as minister , being interested in ghostly am pearances , assured Mr. Osborne , if he would accompany him at twelve o'clock midnight to the neighboring churchyard , he would show him a ghost . If I may take six grenadiers with me , who shall shoot at the apparition when it comes , I will accompany your majesty gladly , ' was the reply . The rendezvous did not take place . The Duke of Wellington having a bullet-proof shirt brought him by the inventor , Bullet-proof , you say ? ' asked the duke . Yes , ' was the reply . Will you put it on yourself , and allow me to order in six soldiers to shoot at it ? ' The man did not press his suit - nor wear it . Lord Palmerston , being asked to serve on the cholera committee in Edinburgh , declined , saying , They would do better to obey the laws of health . ' Sir Fowell Buxton 's book is full of common sense regarding Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules he lays down would he good for more Parliaments than that of England . " Common sense was a great characteristic of Dr. Johnson , and his conversation can never be overrated . It will live when much of the Rambler will be forgotten . " The primal facts of Intellect lie close under the surface of Nature . Sometimes we feel Nature to be a chamber lined with mirrors , wherein we see reflected the disguised man . The analogy between processes of thought and those of the physical world is perfect , thorough . Good work does itself ; there is growth in the night . " The fame of the Mans pear came from the saliency of the trees as well as the excellence of the fruit . The shoots were continually cut off and new graftings made . Saliency of the mind may he encouraged by use . We need saliency . Nothing is more simple than the fact discovered yesterday , nothing more wonderful than the fact to be discovered to-morrow . In the old schools of Italy they would dry up a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity of republics will save us . " We are inspired by every kind of true vigor . We do not need to meet vigor of our own kind , but misalliance , misassociation , must be shunned . It is of no avail . Genius ill-companioned is no genius ; without identity of base , chaos must be forever . We are surprised by occult sympathies . In each form of nature we seem to see ourselves in some distorting glass . Nature is saturated with Deity . The solar architec // ture , upon which we gaze in wonder , is not so marvelous as the same system in the revolving mind . " Thoughts run parallel with the creative law ; to unveil them , to understand their action from the laws of the world , - this is imagination , this is the poetic gift . Among the laws of the mind are powers and analogies which should be considered . First among them stands Identity ; then follow Metamorphosis , Flux " ... Here Mr. Emerson paused , his sentence still unfinished , while he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments , finding nothing to advance the subject satisfactorily , he rose , and so ended the lecture of the day . On another occasion Mr. Emerson renewed this subject . " The detachment and flux of our natures , " he said , " are the metres of their strength . Nothing remains ; everything is becoming other than it is ; this doctrine is the secret of things . Wisdom consists in keeping the soul fluent , resisting petrifaction . We see this in all things ; we are asked why there is a hole in the bottom of the flower-pot ! The moment there is fixation , petrifaction and death ensue . The very word Nature makes us to know this : natura ; ' becoming about to be born . We are immortal by the force of transits . The law of the world is transition , and our power lies in that . No wonder children delight in masks and plays , - in being other than they are ; so do older children ; it is the instinct of the universe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The swift mind is capable of spiritual sculpture , and can build a statue in the air with every word . The artist values himself on his speed . Saadi says , With the budding out of the leaf this work began , and was ended with the falling of the same . ' Shakespeare seems to have lived faster than any other man ; he appears to have been a thousand years old when he wrote his first line , and his judgment is as wonderful to us as his pace . Quick wit is always a miracle , but for l'esprit de l'escaller we have no respect ; everybody has that . Good fortune is only another name for quick perceptions . Improvisation is simply acceleration . We have nothing of value in literature done that way ; what is gained in one direction is lost in another . It is thought our pace is injured by civilization ; untutored peoples are said to do what they do more rapidly than we . When results are shown to us without the processes by which they were produced , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaumont made Wilkie 's sudden reputation in London . He went about saying , Here s a young man who has just come to London , who went at once to see a picture by Teniers , and then mu home and painted The Village Politicians . ' " Each power , when largely developed , exhausts some other . The Delphian prophetess at her altar is herself a victim . But the pace of Nature is strong ! We never hear that she has sprained her foot . We become spent , and fail ; she thanks God that she breathes very well . ' " We find grown people , with quick perceptiouus , whose judgment is two years old , - Hercules with a withered arm I This element of Time is a wonderful magician . I once went to a beautiful f&amp;e , where was a little old man in a gray coat . Presently some one asked him for one of Dolland 's great telescopes ; and he produced it immediately , no larger at first than a microscope , from his waistcoat pocket . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Turkey carpet laid on the lawn , if he had one about him ; and the little gray man took that out , too , and presently a marquee was added to the rest . Time , the little gray man , has made , and is making , changes as wonderful upon every one of us . No Turkey carpets nor marquee tents can // be so extraordinary as the processes in chemistry , miraculous to our uninstructed eyes . " Bias is yet another quality or power of the mind to be considered , - power to resist shocks of contending temperainents . Faraday discovered that certain minerals would obey the two poles of the magnet , north and south , while others would only seek those diametrically opposed . Polarity is a universal law ; every mind is a magnet , with a new north . " We soon discern whether a man speaks from himself , or is giving us something at second hand . We see through all his paint ; he may as well wash it off at once . He who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not employ a town-crier . So shall each soul speak for itself as God made it . Opinions are organic . They should be fostered by our studies into a healthy natural growth . We say of a man , Where is his home ? ' There where he is incessantly called . " Do not fear to push these individualizations to their farthest divergence . Excellence is an inflamed personality . Power fraternizes with power , and wishes you to be not like himself . We acquiesce in what we are . We do not wish conformity or fair words ; yea and nay will suffice . God makes but one man of each kind . My son will not be like me , and can never fill my place , ' said Napoleon , but he will fulfill his own destiny . ' A human soul is a momentary fixation of power . The tenacity of retention must be in proportion to the idea it represents . " Everybody can do his best work easiest . While the master works in his own way , and draws on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resents the rule which cripples him . We must do our best in our own way . We do not wish praise ; we never forgive overappreciation . Reserve , pique , - both these can help to stimulate us . Do not fear to be a monotone ! We wish every man to truly please himself ; then he will please us . " Mr. Emerson read in connection with this subject a passage from Varuhagen von Ense upon Vicarious Sacrifice . He said it was so fine that it would not be out of place anywhere , and belonged to the philosophy of history . One day he remarked that be bad always considered a course of lectures at Harvard University would be incomplete if a series upon Plato and the Platonists were omitted . " Thought has subsisted for the most part on one root ; the Norse mythology , the Vedas , Shakespeare , have served for ages . The history of our venerable Bible , - what heights , what lights , what strength , does this contain ! We see how Nature loves to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this in the history of the Aryans , of the Pelasgi as invaded by the Jonians , of the East by Alexander , and so op continually . There must be both power and provocation to develop the highest in man . " The systems of philosophy are few , and repeat each other ; there is little that is new . One philosopher unfolds the doctrine of materialism ; the next will unfold the same doctrine , but after the fashion of his own mind ; another will dispute sense and talk non-sense ; the fourth will take a middle ground , until we have Materialism , Idealism , Dogmatism , Skepticism , and few new thoughts . " When Orientalism in Alexandria found the Platonists , a new school was produced . The sternness of the Greek school , feeling its way forward from argument to argument , met and combined with the beauty of Orientalism . Plotinus , Proclus , Porphyry , and Jamblicus were the apostles of the new philosophy . " Some truths were then , perhaps , first unveiled : such as , pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind is the source of things , the truth of absolute units ; Being , or First Cause , creates to the end of imparting happiness . This philosophy was the consolation of the human race . The principles of Plato were distilled in various schools , and at last went down with the greatness of Rome . Then came , not until the third century of our era , Plotinus . He was the founder of the new Platonism . The wisdom of its method is great and worthy of profound study . Music , Love , Philosophy , were the three powers of which he has left us a beautiful analysis . " Mr. Emerson read carefully selected passages from Plotinus , and afterward gave the history of his life so far as it is known ; then , taking up an octavo volume translated by Thomas Taylor , of Norwich , which contained the essay of Synesius on Providence , he spoke of its untold value to the world . His audience could understand at least how precious the hook was to him . Douhtless many a reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystic pages ; hut the readers must he few who have seen the mysterious light shining in them which the poet found . Of Proclus Mr. Emerson said , " I am always astonished at his strength . He has purple deeps which I can never fully sound . What literature should he , he is . Proclus first called attention to Chaldaic oracles . There are hardly men athletic enough to read him . How insignificant and far behind Proclus is what we call Scotch philosophy . It is like comparing Phidias and Uncle Toby . " For a period of the world 's history Plato and the Platonists were almost lost , as it appeared . But the disciples always reappear ; thus , curiously , in our age have these doctrines revived . As surely as Wilkinson is the pupil of Swedenborg , and as surely as everything must come round , so here in our time arrives a scholar who sets the Platonists on their legs again , and calls everybody to hear these sages who wrote fifteen hundred years ago . Thomas Taylor was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshing stroke of wit , or even of good sense , haughtily believing in his work , he accepted poverty proudly to the end of its accomplishment . He can not suppress his high contempt for those who are ignorant of Greek philosophy , lie equals Gibbon in his pride , and Johnson in his gloom . There is little recorded of his life , hut I draw much of my information from Porson . Thomas Taylor says , No living author heside myself has devoted himself to Plato . ' Elsewhere he speaks of his solitary road ; ' and indeed it was a road no man had traversed for centuries . Niehuhr has a touching reference to him ; the name is not given , but it can he no one else . Sydenham also , whom I should hardly quote here hut for his strange fate and the interest his early death excites in us . " Taylor tilts against many notable windmills . Like Coleridge , he thanked God that he knew no French . He calls Christianity a gigantic impiety . Like Winckelmann , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no faith in the education of the masses ; his whole idea of government was founded on Plato 's republic ; he eagerly dissuaded the uneducated from reading his hooks . He received scorn for scorn . Even learned England knew nothing of him , gave him no attention . Hallam had never heard of him , nor Milman , nor , I think , had Macanlay . I met a gentleman who thought he could find out something for me , hut the whole result of the inquiry was that Taylor 's eldest son was named Proclus . There are very few facts beside . His wife married him suddenly , when she was about to be compelled to marry a rich man in his stead , and for a year or more they subsisted on seven shillings a week , which he made by copying . His labors were immense . Aristotle , Plato , Plotinus , Proclus , Syne // sius , all exist from his hand , and many other works . He was turned out of a good boarding-place because he wished to sacrifice a bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Synesius will live with Comus , Laodamia , and a few other things of that nature . " The next afternoon Mr. Emerson said his subject was The Conduct of the Intellect . " I have arranged , " he continued , " with some amplitude the study of the working agents of the mind , that we may become conscious as far as possible bow system and power may be reached by persons desirous of true culture . First , we will consider Attention , which is the natural prayer we make to Truth that she will discover herself to us . Attention is perpetual application of the will . Sir Isaac Newton said that what he had accomplished was done by always intending his mind . Goethe said that he believed every child should learn drawing ; for it unfolds attention , the highest of our skills and virtues . This power can not always be called into its fullest force , and it is differently excited in different persons , or in the same persons at different times . When you can not flog your mind into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , where it becomes refreshed . Some men have found the public their school and study . They go to their audience as others go to their closet , and learn there what they should say . " This brings me again to Bias , that indispensable condition of all true influence . Each makes and should make one reserve in the canon of nature , namely , himself ! Not the fact , but what he makes of it , is its value , after all . Be yourself ! Do n't walk one way and look another . Straining , tour de force , will accomplish for the time , but the result is always weariness and waste . You can not disguise your opinions . This faculty is your lot in life ; therefore make the most of it , instead of wishing it something else . Abandon yourself to your real love and hate ! That which burns you can alone set other minds in flame . Labor , drudge , and wrestle for it ; profound sincerity is the only basis of character . Beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise man in the centre of a town , and he will create a new consciousness of wealth . He will show the rich their mistakes and poverty , and to the poor he will discover their own resources . He will establish an immovable equality . " Most books of travel tell us nothing ; but take the men born to travel and to see , and we recognize at once that they are inspired for discoverers . The poet sees also , and if he sees only in fragmeats he paints those with what energy he has . " The primary quality of Genius is Veracity . What he would write , he was before he writ , ' said Lord Brooke . Youth and truth should be inseparable . No proselytizing adviser is then needed . I want nothing less Truth . I will wear her garment , rather than array myself in a red rag of any borrowed garniture . I see how grand it is . " The condition of sanity is to keep down talent and to preserve instinct . Otherwise we find talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organic order in every mind , therefore there is natural order in our thought ; but bad artists do not foresee the end from the beginning . " Mr. Emerson here spoke of the Classic and Romantic schools of art , and of the essential quality of Affirmation . " The affirmative position of the mind , " he continued ; " knowing what we like best , and acknowledging it ; discovering the grand basis where lies the joy of the great masters that they are all alike ; not dealing with petty differences ; not seeing less than the immortal , - this is the duty of every healthy soul . It is the causal fact in every forward nature that he shall look // affirmatively upon subjects . An affirmative talker is always safe . I think it is the main guard not to accept degrading views . Do n't try to make the universe a blind alley . We must march under the banner of the advancing cause . There is no limit to the strength of affirmation ; we can go on , sky over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that truth has steeps unapproachable to the profane foot . No negative evidence can be worth one affirm ative . It is the mind , never the body , which will conquer , and will bnrst up to carry all away as with a sea-stroke . The true poet , if such could he embodied , would electrify us with truth , once heard . What is now the capital would be so no longer : grass would grow in its streets ; it would soon be superseded . Good order , analogy , health , benefit , - to each and all of these the assenting soul sings paean ! Said a good saint once to me , The Lord gives , but he never takes away . ' We must cleave to God against the name of God . " I think Keats 's best lines are those in Hyperion : - So Saturn , as he walked into the midst , Felt faint , and would have sunk among the rest But that he met Enceladus 's eve , Whose mightiness and awe of him at once Came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition is very great , and the gift or acquirement of this generosity is one of the consolations of life . Therefore use the faculty ; labor , drudge , for it . Put to it the spirit of Napoleon when he was asked to repeat an order , and replied , Pensez , fr*pon ! I never repeat ; it is for you to remember . ' Go , and be like Napoleon ! Let Isis endeavor be your constant type and exemplar . He was always on the offensive , and , as he said himself , never on the defensive , except in the night , when he could not see his enemy . Use your powers , and put them to a better use than Napoleon put his . Use them all ; otherwise we shall be like the Indians , with thick legs and thin arms . We need all our resources to live in the world which is to he used and decorated by us . Socrates understood this well . His humility was sincere , hut he used it also with exquisite tact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision of other men . " We must lie in wait for thoughts , for times when the intellect is facile ; think with the flower of the soul . Be confident that a man can not exhaust the abilities of his nature , and the best is never attained but at the price of continual labor . Success depends on previous preparation . If principles and high conduct he sustained by continual practice , their virtue will be inexhaustible . The question always is how to keep up to the top of my condition ! " A good day 's work is too valuable to be broken in upon lightly . Continence must be attained . A certain continence is always to be remembered . Seven silences for one word . Let the thinker keep his secret ; we hate a leaky mind . Continuity , - we must strive also for that , although true thoughts arrange themselves . But let us be no ck*ffoniers ; have a piece of twine , and it will lead to royal truths . Have control ; it is indispensable ! Primal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always melting into each other ; but he who gains control shall use a ladder of lightning , and efface his steps as he mounts . " Following upon our labor for thought come sometimes periods of fullness , when the whole being is fused , yet we can not express a word . We are lifted above expression , and filled with a sublime life . This joy compensates . The question must always be whether the mind possesses control of its thoughts , or they of it . We sometimes go to sects to ask of some member the secret of his peace or progression , but we find he can not formulate . He impresses those who know him by the honesty and truth of his worship , but lie can not convey // the ground of his satisfaction to us . George Fox was filled with groanings that could not be uttered ; and so it has ever been . Wordsworth called his brother a voiceless poet , ' and the world is filled with these dumb souls . The primary rule is to have control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the prophets . " But you must formulate your thought , or you have all stars and no sky I It is a want of self-possession not to learn this control . Has a metaphysician no art for his bad memory or attention ? Has lie no balloon to send up into the empyrean , to bring down its wonderful hues ? Father Taylor 's grand seahorses have always drawn him up and down only on condition that he shall not guide them . The faculties are continual assertors of immortality for what never could be said . Locomotive destiny must be hitched on to the cars in which we all are . " There is a sense of power attendant always upon the period when thought comes . We stand like Atlas , on our legs , and feel as if we could move the world . We have such debility of nature that a new thought is as a god to us . We can no more manage it than a thunderbolt . But after a time its affinities begin to appear ; we become accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow familiar with it ; then we can compare it with others , and begin to distribute them . " The endless procession of thoughts is the miracle of every day . What shall we say of these potentates ? To the healthy man there is alway&amp; one waiting at the door when he awakes . Wonderful they are in their relation to each other . What is written in the mind in indelible ink is brought out by the fire of thought . *Certain medicinal value is in all intellectual action . Sit down to work with weak eyes , and when your imagina tion begins to work your eyes become strong . Dumont , in his life of Mirabeau , says , when the husband of Madame ClaviZ*re was about to be elected to the ministry she became ill of nervous fever ; but when he was elected , her physician declared that in four days she would be able to appear in public ; which proved true , for at the end of that time she appeared in perfect health as the mistress of her own salon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despair shows we have been living on a low plane , in the sense or understanding . It is a sign of the decay of thought . The brave uplift us . Jamblicus tells us some have been burned , and not apprehended it . After the last great defeat of the Athenjans there was evident loss of power for wide thought . " We must all recognize the influence of two distinct classes of persons . One class of men and women appear to bring their power from a moral source , and the other from intellectual forces . Thus Dr. Channing , the oracle of morals and religion forty years ago , drew his power clearly from a moral force instinct within him ; and this as contrasted with what we call intellectual power , exemplified in such men as Michael Angelo , Shakespeare , and others . In the first class we find men of strength , whose names are unheard of by the world , often in humble company and perhaps without a talent by which to express themselves ; nevertheless , their power is indisputable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , pause upon their thought ; it is something higher than that which sways us . The power of man is twofold : one part man and one woman , the masculine and feminine elements , the moral and intellectual ; the soul in which one predominates is ever watchful and jealous ; where intellect leads it grows skeptical , narrow , worldly , and runs down into talent . On the other hand , clear-thoughted minds complain of the opposing class as of // lJuIir . Emerson in the Lecture Room . wandering spirits , who can not formulate their faith or make their light evident . Aristotle said the origin of reason is not in itself , but in something better ; and one of the ancients says , The two elements are united at their summit in being God . ' " As a student of the laws of the mind , learning to believe more deeply in proportion to research into its divine potentiality , I do not believe in any objector who would make that responsible for vices and failure . Dumesnil calls Michael Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probity of the intellect which demands more than any Bible has enjoined . All feel the mystery of this twofold genius at the he d of creation . Looking back upon the philosophy of the ancients with this idea in my mind , I find this conception of the Highest present everywhere : in Plato , Plotinus* and in the Hindoo hooks . There is always a light which is recognized as of older birth than the intellect . One says , Intellect has twofold energies : some of these powers act as Intellect , others as Being inebriated with nectar . ' We say the soul grows by moral obedience . This is the only true foundation , and we find it treason in the philosopher to do wrong . The mind knows nature by sharing it , hut religion , that home of genius , will strengthen the mind as it does the character . The obedience to a man 's genius is the particular of faith ; the obedience to his religion , the general of faith . This sentiment is the affirmative of affirmatives ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life opens upon us , if we possess this truth . " A devout sentiment has the effect of genius uttered in society . How often we lament the development of talent when we see the heart of man disappear , and we say , Happy are those who have no talent . Plato , Dante , Shakespeare , we could not do without ; hut the central guard of all is the quiet influ ences of society , - the men who have no talent , hut who see the right and do it . Such moral forces are perhaps the highest in the scale . " Here Mr. Emerson quoted a passage from the novel " Counterparts . " He often spoke of this book as one possessing singular power and significance . " It would be easy , " he continued , " to show the irreligion of people , not from their writings , Uut from their table-talk and the asides of life . For wisdom , for sanity , you must have some entrance into the heart of humanity . He who is exclusive excludes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a flower which will not bear handling , but must lie gently in the mind and bear fruit there . Piety gives an elegance of manners which the court can not teach ; we never obtain sincerity in any speech unless we feel a degree of tenderness . Christianity taught this ; the beauty and the strength of this truth was only brou* , ht to perfection in the life and teaching of Jesus Christ . Wisdom has its root in goodness , not goodness in wisdom . I ever hear in the voice of genius invariably the moral tone : the finer the sense of genius , the finer is the influence . " The one avenue to truth and wisdom is love . Here , then , is the foundation , - that all growth comes from moral obedience . " What we call poetical ju*tice , that is real justice . We call the characters who rest on these foundations real men , ' as distinguished from men of the world who act from other motives . Piety is the essential condition of science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Brown of Ossawatomie , I remember what a world of old poetry fitted him exactly , - Shakespeare , Wordsworth , Herbert ; indeed , there was no end to it ! " It is common to find the contrary to much that I have said . Napoleon is an example of genius without morality , but 1883. // Wellington spoke once to the effect that it was a moral failure which first ma ( le it possil ) le for him to see how to defeat Napoleon . The exceptions still show the truth . How coarse and rude was the masculinity of the French Revolution , - how different from New England in its harshest days of creed ! Intellect is purged hy humility ; no great intellect but is bankrupted by moral defects . Algernon Sidney , Marcus Antoninus , are noble examples of moral power . Some of the greatest statements of the truths of Christianity which are found outside of it are in the I-Iiudoo literature . " Here Mr. Emerson quoted from the Purana , from Fox , Bebmen , Swedenborg , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscience has stood in lieu of mental development . " Again , he continued , " The persons gener lly most praised and esteemed are not those we most value . We praise talent and cheaper things ; we can make an inventory of affairs of the world , but we can not do that with the hero . We can have only one hero , here and there , to preserve the line in the world ; quiet and obscure they are , often , but keen and sure almost as Socrates when the time comes for them to observe . These are not men who are spoken of ; they are left alone , for the most part , as gods are ; they nre elemental , and not made for ball-rooms , - not heroes of communities ; nothing could be more private , but always able to come in exigency and ready for our sorriest plight . Such are strong in the drudgeries of endeavor ; they excel in extricating us from bad society . To such a hero as I have described , men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such I call not so much men as influences ! I knew one : he was at this university ; of all unknown and unseen . I will read you something he has left , to show you how he looked upon the world . " Here Mr. Emerson read Thoreau 's poem called The Stranger , and afterward , to illustrate his remarks upon eternity and patience to this end , he read also fragments from Sappho and Michael Angelo . Mr. Emerson then continued : " The fondness of the mind for stability is a very remarkable fact . Whatever is ancient and long in time has attractious for us . The man of thought is willing to live , or living to die ; he probably sees the cord reaching both up and down . You shall not say Oh , my bishop , Oh , my pastor , is there any resurrection ? ' or Did Channing believe ? ' Go read Milton , Eschylus , Plato , St. Augustine , and ask no such school-dame questions as these ! True lives , those of prophets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted , suggest vast leisure . In reading some of their sentences you feel the certainty of immortality . Belief in the future of the mind is only such to those who use it . " A.F.
