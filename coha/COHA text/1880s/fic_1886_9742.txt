Virginia has thrown herself on divan L. , and is sobbing . Stuyvesant stands up C. , his back partly to the audience , his hand on the casement ; he is looking out . A moment of silence after the rise of curtain . Stuyvesant glances over his shoulder at Virginia , then looks out again . He picks a rose from the vine at casement , then turns and walks slowly down stage , stands a moment looking down at Virginia . STUYVESANT . This is our first lovers ' quarrel , Virginia . VIRGINIA . We can never be happy together . ( Arouses herself , brushing her eyes hastily . ) We should never understand each other , Stuyvesant ; you are from the East , I am a California girl . You belong to what they call , in New York , " one of the old families . " You had a great-great-grandfather , who signed the Declaration of Independence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Knickerbocker families . People like yours , in New York and Boston and Philadelphia , have more " family pride " than the oldest European nobility . STUYVESANT . Have I ever referred to either our " family " or our " pride ? " VIRGINIA . We women understand men better by what they do n't say than by what they do . STUYVESANT . When I am silent I am only thinking of you . VIRGINIA . Stuyvesant ! ( Tenderly ; looking up at him , over her shoulder . He leans toward her responsively , but she draws back , turning away . ) I am purified and glorified in your eyes  --  STUYVESANT ( tenderly ) . Yes ! VIRGINIA . By the fact that a member of an old New York family has asked me to be his wife . STUYVESANT . ( Starts . ) Something has happened that I do n't know about yet . When I met you , half an hour ago , there was a chill in your manner , that  --  that  --  almost made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ! STUYVESANT . Nothing but the good breeding of an " old New York family " prevented me from keeping my hat on in the house . Unless you get a little less frigid toward me I shall need a warm bath and a dose of quinine . ( Virginia laughs merrily , and he leans over her , giving her the flower . ) Accept a peace offering , Virginia  --  you do love me ? VIRGINIA . Of course ! Have n't I just been quarrrelling with you ? I hope you do n't think I should condescend to quarrel with a man I did n't love ; I have too much respect for my sex to do that . STUYVESANT . It is a token of a girl 's affection , then . Keep on quarrelling , please . VIRGINIA . I shall . I have n't nearly finished yet ; and the way you behave yourself in a quarrel makes it a great temptation to a girl . You seem to be swearing , to yourself , most of the time . STUYVESANT . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  swearing to myself , and at myself , but never at you . VIRGINIA . ( Stroking his hand tenderly . ) Do n't forget , dear , we are still quarrelling . STUYVESANT . Of course ; go on , my darling ! VIRGINIA . My love ! ( Looking up at him ; then straightens up . ) Your father arrived in Menlo Park to-day . STUYVESANT . Yes , with my sister ; they are at the same house where I am visiting . Tenny asked me to tell you that she would run over to see you this afternoon . VIRGINIA . When you left New York two months ago you were engaged to be married . STUYVESANT . ( After drawing up ; looks at her ; shuts his teeth tightly ; gives a tug at his neckband . ) What do you know about that ? VIRGINIA . My father has received a note from your father . You were engaged to Miss Eleanor Van Kleeck , of Stuyvesant Square . ( He turns on his heel , walks R. , stops before table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a resounding blow ; then turns up to the casement , C. , with his back to the audience , looking out . Virginia continues aside . ) Now he is swearing to himself ; I am too . It 's a duet . ( Aloud . ) You are angry with me . STUYVESANT . No , not with you . I was only imagining that table was one of Miss Eleanor Van Kleeck 's brothers  --  or her cousin , or somebody I could hit : and I dare say she would like to scratch out the eyes of some of my relations . What with my father 's family pride  --  and her father 's  --  and the feminine talent , on both sides , for conducting other people 's love affairs , Eleanor Van Kleeck and I were engaged to be married . We mistook the fact that we could tolerate each other 's society for eternal devotion ; people often do . We have broken off our engagement every time either of us has left New York for the last five years . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the mail . ( Virginia bursts into a laugh . ) After that I met you . VIRGINIA . Your father is determined that your engagement to Miss Van Kleeck shall not be broken off . That is what he has come to California for . STUYVESANT . In other words ( with rising anger as he proceeds ) , he proposes to interfere in a matter which is sacred to me . I worship you , Virginia ; you are my religion ! I am open to neither his bribery nor his threats . My father is not a European nobleman , with a helpless younger son dependent on him for his next meal and the clothes he wears . His letter to your father is an insult to me . We are both men ; and he will interfere at his own peril . I will marry whom I like  --  when I like  --  where I like  --  and as far beneath me as I choose . ( Virginia starts to her feet . Stuyvesant checks himself with a short gasp . ) VIRGINIA . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , I shall marry as far above me as such a gentle creature must be above a hotheaded , quick-tempered brute like me . That 's all I am  --  they may talk as they like about breeding and good blood . VIRGINIA . You only spoke your real thoughts honestly , Stuyvesant ; you need not apologize for them . ( Touching her eyes . ) How truly I spoke when I told you we could never be happy together . STUYVESANT . I wish that I did bitten off my tongue in my anger ; then I could not have spoken those last words . VIRGINIA . It is better to speak them now , by accident , than to think that you have married " beneath " you after it is too late . STUYVESANT . Virginia ! ( Starting toward her . She sees Martin enter up R. C. , and she arrests Stuyvesant with a slight motion of her hand ; then walks up , meeting Martin , R. C. Stuyvesant turns up L. C. to window , looking out . Virginia takes a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading card ) " Miss Catherine Ten Broeck Laurence "  --  your sister has called . Show Miss Laurence in here , Martin . You may then come to my own room for a message . MARTIN . Yes , miss . ( Exit R. C. to hall . ) ( Virginia moves L. ) VIRGINIA . Good bye , Stuyvesant . I ca n't meet Tenny or any one else just now . STUYVESANT . I will go to the lawn . Wo n't you walk out there when she goes ? I will wait for you all day . VIRGINIA . You need not ; I will write to you . STUYVESANT . I wo n't go ! VIRGINIA . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! ( Laughing and brushing tears from her eyes at the same time . Extends her hand . ) Good bye . STUYVESANT . ( Taking her hand eagerly . ) I 'll stay there until you come to me , if it 's all night . VIRGINIA . You 'll catch your death o ' cold , or die of hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wish I did n't love him . ( Exit L. 1 E. Enter Catherine Ten Broeck Laurence . R. C. from hall . She is quietly demure in manner ; elegantly dressed . ) TENNY . Stuyvesant ! STUYVESANT . Tenny ! Do you know what father came to California for ? TENNY . Of course ; mamma sent him  --  to break off the match between you and Virginia Stockton . She could n't come herself . STUYVESANT . Why did n't you tell me of this when we met this morning ? TENNY . You were telling me what an absolutely perfect creature Virginia is ; we were only two hours together and you were n't half through . I could n't get a word in edgewise , Papa will call here , presently , and begin . STUYVESANT . I 'm going to have a soliloquy in the garden ; make a short call , please , Tenny . ( Exit through French window , L. C. and out up L. ) TENNY . A soliloquy . ( Looking out after him . ) There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I smell sulphur . If my dear mamma had known how I felt about his marrying Virginia Stockton she would n't have sent me to California with papa . Virginia was the sweetest girl in our school , and I could n't have a nicer sister-in-law . I hope Stuyvesant 's profanity will be more successful than mamma 's prayers . ( Enter MARTIN L. 1 E. with folded note . ) MARTIN . Miss Stockton wished me to hand you this note and await your instructions . TENNY . ( After taking note , glances at its contents , reads ) " Forgive me for not seeing you at once , dear , but I will be down just as soon as I can be . " They 've been quarrelling ; and she 's having a good cry . How nice ! ( Reads again ) " The card of the Marquis  --  of Normandale !  --  has just been brought to me . " ( Turns head L. ) Oh ! The Marquis of Normandale  --  he is in San Francisco ; how very odd ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except once  --  for a minute or two  --  in a crowded room , so I hardly know him better than you do . " Not so well . I met him for five minutes ; and the next day he wrote to my father asking my hand in marriage . ( Reads ) " If you will kindly entertain the Marquis a few moments "  --  Certainly . ( Then to Martin ) . Show the gentleman who just called into this room . ( Exit Martin R. C. ) ( 2 steps L. ) It will be a trifle embarrasing for both of us meeting again here so unexpectedly . He will be taken by surprise . ( Laughing . ) I wonder how he 'll act ? ( Walking L. Enter the MARQUIS of NORMANDALE R. C. , shown in by Martin , who retires . The Marquis stops up R. C. , looking at Tenny through his single glass . She turns , bowing . ) Marquis ! MARQUIS . Miss Stockton ! TENNY . Eh ? ( Aside ) He does n't know me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago that man asked me to be his wife . He thinks I 'm Virginia . MARQUIS . You were about to go out , Miss Stockton ? TENNY . Oh , no  --  I 've just come in . ( Aside . ) I feel as if I had been stepped on . ( Aloud ) Be seated , Marquis . MARQUIS . Thank you . TENNY . ( Sitting ; aside ) When Virginia comes in , he can unravel us for himself . I wo n't help him . ( Aloud ) You English noblemen meet so many American girls , Marquis . MARQUIS . Y-e-s . ( Sitting , C. ) TENNY . I really wonder that you can tell one of us from another . MARQUIS . It is confusing ; very . I have been placed by your father in a peculiar position , Miss Stockton ; and I have called this afternoon to  --  TENNY . Have you ever been to New York , Marquis ? MARQUIS . Last winter . TENNY . I dare say you met some of my friends there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . MARQUIS . I really do n't remember . TENNY . ( Aside ) And he proposed to me ! ( Aloud ) I think you did meet her . MARQUIS . Very likely . I wrote your father , Miss Stockton , asking the honor of your hand in marriage . TENNY . ( Springing to her feet . ) I 've let him propose to the wrong girl this time . MARQUIS . I will read your father 's answer . You will then understand the position I am in . TENNY.  --  The position we 're both in . How shall I explain to the man now ? ( Turning up stage . The Marquis opens a large letter-sheet , with display business heading . As he begins reading Tenny , slightly at his back , up stage , turns away and claps her hands to her ears . ) MARQUIS . ( Reads . ) " Transcontinental Railway Company . President 's Office , " San Francisco , Nov. 4 , 1892 . " In answering this communication , ' refer to No. 958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , your favor of 22d ultimo before me . By a mistake of my private secretary it was referred to the Superintendent of the Construction Department , and did not come to my notice until it was read to the Board of Directors at our regular meeting this morning . Hence my delay in answering you . In conclusion , I beg to say that the matter you refer to does not interest me in any way until you have communicated with my daughter herself . " Your obedient servant , " JEFFERSON STOCKTON . " ( Folds letter deliberately . ) TENNY . ( Looking around at him furtively ; then taking down her hands . ) He 's finished . MARQUIS . Your American customs in matters of this kind , Miss Stockton , are entirely different from our own in Europe . ( Enter Virginia L. 1 E. ; a garden hat in her hand . She stops L. , bowing . ) VIRGINIA . Marquis ! ( The Marquis rises and bows . ) Tenny , darling ! ( Running to Tenny and embracing her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I suppose this is another of the American girls I have met . ( Virginia walks down across to him , extending her hand . ) VIRGINIA . I am very glad to meet you again , Marquis . MARQUIS . Thank you ; delighted , I assure you . Pardon me . ( Crosses to Tenny ; speaks apart to her . ) We have been interrupted . Have I your permission to speak to Mr. Stockton again ? TENNY . ( After a moment 's hesitation ) I have n't any right to refuse an offer for another girl . ( Aloud ) Yes . MARQUIS . On another occasion I will tell you how deeply I love you . ( Bowing She bows deeply in return . He turns R. The Marquis is crossing up R. ; hesitates a second and makes a slight bow to Virginia ; then goes out up R. C. Virginia , astonished , moves up and looks after him . Tenny drops upon sofa down L. choking with suppressed laughter . ) VIRGINIA . That was a remarkably short call . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tenny ? TENNY . Oh , Ginnie ! He got us all mixed up . We American girls are like so many ponies , or a flock of sheep , to an English nobleman ; he ca n't tell us apart . He  --  he  --  ( gradually suppressing her laughter ) he proposed to me . VIRGINIA . So soon ! TENNY . He  --  he  --  thought I was you . VIRGINIA . Oh ! I see ! ( Both girls laugh merrily . ) Well ! It 's all one to him . I dare say he stopped even a train in Chicago on the way here to offer his hand to an illeg . . I 'm very much obliged to you , my dear , for saving me the trouble of refusing him . TENNY . ( Drawing up suddenly ; aside ) Refusing him ! I 'm afraid to tell her she has accepted him . ( Aloud ) Let 's talk about something else , Ginnie ! It 's three long years since we parted from each other at school . VIRGINIA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , dear . ( Sitting at her side , and taking her hand . ) TENNY . When did you hear from your brother Sheridan last ? VIRGINIA . About six weeks ago . He is at Oxford University , in England . TENNY . My last letter from him was two weeks ago . VIRGINIA . You and Sheridan have been corresponding ? TENNY . After he went to England I kept it up in the hope of improving myself ; by a serious correspondence with a young gentleman who was pursuing the classical studies of an ancient university in Europe . I 've been at a finishing school , you know , near Philadelphia . The girls in my class have learned a great deal from Sheridan and his companions at Oxford . We know more about boxing matches and bulldogs than the same number of girls anywhere else in the country . I 'm going to England . VIRGINIA . You are ?  --  to England ? TENNY . M  --  m . Dear mamma and the Dowager Countess of Caryston-Leigh have been putting their heads together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , for a nobleman ; but he has a title . Papa is rich ; he has n't a title . I am to visit the Dowager . See ? VIRGINIA . Yes ; I see . TENNY . For my own part , the arrangement has my entire approval . The Earl of Caryston-Leigh is one of Sheridan Stockton 's boon companions at Oxford . See ? VIRGINIA . Tenny ! TENNY . Kiss me ! ( They embrace and kiss . Enter DIANA STOCKTON up C. from out L. on veranda . ) DIANA . Virginia ! ( The two girls rise . ) This is your old schoolmate ? VIRGINIA . Yes . Tenny , dear , this is my new sister . TENNY . Your sister ? VIRGINIA . ( With arm about Diana . ) Papa 's young wife . TENNY . Oh ! DIANA . Virginia has talked so much of you ; I am very glad to meet you . I have just left your brother Stuyvesant on the lawn . TENNY . Oh ! I forgot . He asked me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tenny . TENNY . I 'll drop in again this evening . Mrs. Stockton ! ( Bowing and moving R. , accompanied by Virginia . ) Good bye . VIRGINIA . Good bye , for the present . ( Stopping R. C. Exit Tenny R. C. ) DIANA . Virginia , dear  --  ( Virginia looks around at her ; a slight pause . ) VIRGINIA . What is it , Diana ? ( Tenny runs back from hall . ) TENNY . Oh  --  Ginnie ! ( Apart , R. C. ) I really think you ought to know about it . You have accepted the Marquis . ( She hurries out again . ) VIRGINIA . Tenny ! ( Looking after , bewildered , and moving to door . ) DIANA . Virginia ! Stuyvesant Laurence is a dangerous animal to be loose on the lawn . I wish you 'd go and muzzle him , or chain him up . VIRGINIA . I have told him we can never be happy with each other . DIANA . Yes ; so he said . I promised to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your garden hat . ( Taking it from illeg . L. C. ) VIRGINIA . ( Looking down . ) I  --  I thought I  --  I might , perhaps , need it . DIANA . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! ( Laughing and walking up to window L. C. ; looks out up L. ) See ! There he is , pacing up and down like a young tiger . ( Virginia runs up and looks out over her shoulder . Diana looks back at her . ) There are tears in your eyes . He can wipe them away better than I can . ( Virginia kisses her quickly , snatches her hat and runs out C. on veranda up L. Diana looks after her , laughing quietly . ) It 's a race between them . She 's running as fast as she can ; but Stuyvesant will meet her more than half way ; he 's a better runner . They are together ! I have kept my promise . ( Turning down . ) It 's time that Jefferson returned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R. C. ; takes a portfolio from the top and turns with it to table down R. C. ) I have looked over these drawings fifty times already , but I never got tired . ( Opens portfolio on table . ) Our magnificent new house in the city of New York . Dear Jefferson ! It seems as if I only had to think of what I want . He is building this palace for me . ( Sitting ; looks at plates . ) Front elevation  --  facing Central Park . Hall and main staircase . The grand salon . That is where we shall hold our court in New York . Our court ! Heigh-ho ! Who will be in that magnificent drawing room when we hold our grand receptions ? We shall be " new people " from the West . I am almost sorry , now , that I told Jefferson I should like to live in New York . ( Enter JEFFERSON STOCKTON from hall , R. C. He is a man of about forty-four or five , slightly iron gray , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Diana ! DIANA . Jefferson , dear ! ( Looking up . He leans down and kisses her . ) You have returned early . STOCKTON . Yes . You were looking at those drawings when I left you this morning . I 'm glad I 've found a plaything that amuses you so much . DIANA . You have always gratified every wish before I could express it . STOCKTON . I could hardly fail to know the dearest wish of your heart . I love you too much for that . Your ambition shall be gratified , my pet . ( Diana draws a long breath ; looking down at the drawings . ) You are sighing . Is n't the house grand enough ? DIANA . It will be a palace . But my ambition  --  to be a leader among the women of society  --  received a sad check this morning . I had a long talk with an Eastern lady . She told me frankly about the efforts of Western millionnaires to gain a footing by their wealth in the old society of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an occasional " old family " will take " pity " on them , perhaps , as if they were interesting paupers , and patronize them . STOCKTON . Exactly . There is a regular gradation of millionnaires in New York  --  brand new millionnaires , like me ; twenty year millionnaires ; forty year millionnaires ; millionnaires with one grandfather , with two grandfathers . After two grandfathers they are promoted from the millionnaire class into good society , and cease to be graded by six ciphers . The newly rich man who goes to New York city to impress it by his wealth is a fool . New York will never patronize us , my dear . DIANA . Are you sure of that ? STOCKTON . Quite . I shall patronize New York . DIANA . What do you mean ? STOCKTON . You desire a social position there ; you shall have it . DIANA . What will you do ? STOCKTON . Exactly what I always do when you want anything ; I shall buy it for you , and I shall buy it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a newly rich American to enter society in New York is to take a house in London . DIANA . We are going to London ? STOCKTON . We shall spend just enough time in New York to take our passage for Liverpool ; and we shall return to New York , in eighteen months , as members of its best society . DIANA . I do n't understand you . STOCKTON . The simplest business transaction in the world . I shall purchase spendthrift noblemen at current rates . There is as regular a market for that kind of property in London as there is for other merchandise , or for stocks . An English Duke and two or three Marquises ; as many Earls as you like ; a French Duc or two , and a few Continental Princes . They will throw in their noble friends for nothing . With a card basket like that , what " old family " in New York will close its doors to you , when you return ? The poor millionnaires who are still struggling there may flatten their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knickerbockers . We 'll fill the card basket , my dear . DIANA . Are we really going into the aristocratic society of Europe ? STOCKTON . Why not ? I am rich enough ; that is all they care for , in an American . I shall simply use them for my purpose , as I do other men . I have been in London ; but heretofore I have used noblemen only for commercial purposes , on Boards of Directors . The last time I was there , I ordered ten thousand tons of railway iron ; this time , I shall order about five tons of good society . Business is business , my love ; you are the wife of a financier ! DIANA . The aristocracy of Europe ! ( Enter Martin from hall , R. C. , with card ; crosses to Stockton . ) STOCKTON . Show Mr. Laurence in . DIANA . Stuyvesant 's father ! I do hope you and he can arrange matters pleasantly . I know that Virginia loves Stuyvesant ; and he 's a dear , good fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I must take the plans of our new house with me . ( Hurries L. with portfolio . Turns at door . ) Virginia and I will be presented to the Queen ? STOCKTON . Introduced by a Duchess . DIANA . You darling ! ( Runs back to him . ) STOCKTON . My pretty girl !  --  with her new toy . ( Kissing her . She runs out L. He looks at card in his hand . ) Mr. Laurence is one of our American aristocracy . It will be much more difficult to deal with him than with a mere English Duke , or an Austrian Prince . Members of the European aristocracy have become so accustomed to having ancestors ; they can think of something else now and then . ( Enter Mr. Hamilton Stuart Laurence , from hall , R. C. , shown in by Martin , who retires . Laurence is a man of about fifty or sixty ; elegantly , though quietly dressed ; gray hair parted in the middle , gray mustache and neatly trimmed side-pieces ; manner extremely courteous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own superiority . ) Mr. Laurence ! LAURENCE . This is Mr. Stockton , I presume . STOCKTON . I am pleased to meet you . Be seated . I feel that we are acquainted ; though we have never met before . I need hardly say that I know you by reputation , Mr. Laurence . ( Sitting L. C. Laurence also seated . ) And also , of course , the distinguished family , in New York , to which you belong . You are yourself , I believe , the senior member of that family . LAURENCE . I am Mr. Laurence . The agent of our property , in New York , has mentioned your own name to me , Mr. Stockton . STOCKTON . Ah ! I trust you are enjoying your Western trip . LAURENCE . I did not come West for pleasure . In fact , I had hoped to take a steamer for England , at this time . We usually reside abroad ; and we think seriously of taking up our permanent residence in Europe . America is becoming more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your American property with you ? LAURENCE . It is in New York City real-estate ; exactly as it was left to us by the uncle of my great grandfather . STOCKTON . Perhaps you would like to sell it . LAURENCE . We never sell . STOCKTON . I thought I might buy it , for my wife ; she has a birthday next week . But it was n't business that called us together to-day , Mr. Laurence . You dropped me a line , saying that you wished to talk with me about the proposed marriage of our two children . You say , in your note , that you have no objection to my daughter personally . LAURENCE . I have heard nothing but praise of the young woman . STOCKTON . Your son , also , is a fine young fellow , and I have learned that his habits are good . What have you and I to do with the matter ? LAURENCE . Sir ? STOCKTON . Where do we come in ? LAURENCE . We are their fathers , sir . STOCKTON . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon my emphasis but I must use the word  --  it 's none of our damned business . LAURENCE . I have n't the slightest objection to the word you have used . As the head of one of the oldest families in America , I consider the comparative neglect of that word , at the present day , a piece of modern vulgarity . My forefathers used it freely ; and I revere them too much to drop it myself . My son , the next heir , shows them equal respect . But I can not agree with the view which you take of our duty as two fathers . In the first place , as I said in my note to you , my son had contracted a previous matrimonial engagement . STOCKTON . If both the ladies are satisfied , that is his affair , and theirs ; not ours . LAURENCE . Miss Van Kleeck belongs , on her father 's side , to one of the oldest Dutch families in the State of New York . And on the maternal side , a cousin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the year sixteen hundred and seventy-four , from King Charles the Second . He was a personal friend of that monarch . STOCKTON . What has Charles the Second to do with the marriage of our children ? LAURENCE . You compel me to speak frankly . Mrs. Laurence and I do not consider the union of your family with our own desirable . STOCKTON . Why not ? LAURENCE . Since you insist ; members of my own immediate family circle have already made social alliances with the aristocracy abroad , and we do not care to complicate them with  --  shall I say ?  --  with inappropriate  --  I need not to use a stronger word  --  associations in this country . Our eldest daughter is Lady Broughton-Killingly , wife of the Baron Broughton-Killingly , of Trentley-on-Sea , in Norfolk , England . And her younger sister , Catharine , who has accompanied me to California , has attracted the attention of the Dowager Countess of Caryston-Leigh . That lady is now in correspondence with Mrs. Laurence . The two mothers , indeed , are about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Caryston-Leigh . I mention these sacred details of our family life , merely to convince you that an alliance with a  --  shall I say ?  --  a  --  Western  --  family  --  I need not use a stronger term  --  an alliance on our part , with a Western family , must result in social ramifications entirely uncongenial to both sides . STOCKTON . You certainly can not object to my family  --  I have none . A stage-coach was robbed , and the passengers murdered . I was found in it  --  an infant . That is my pedigree . It was near Stockton , California , and the man who found me was a Jeffersonian Democrat . That is my name . Virginia 's mother was discovered in a miner 's cabin , a little three year old girl , crying , by the fire . A man was lying dead in the woods near by . There is absolutely no record of our family on either side ; and nothing to object to . You have a family history , and I may object ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAURENCE . Damn it , Sir ! Whatever you might find in my family history to object to , it is not a blank page . I will say this , once for all ; it is a custom in our family to leave the bulk of the estate to the eldest male heir . But if my son persists in his disobedience to me , I shall leave him nothing . ( Rising and walking R. ) Nothing , whatever , sir ! STOCKTON . ( Rising . ) I will make that up to him as a part of the wedding present . ( Turning up L. C. ) LAURENCE . You will separate father and son . STOCKTON . ( Turning sharply and looking at him a moment before speaking . ) No , Laurence ! ( Crosses down to him . ) I will not separate you . If your son is n't willing to paddle his own canoe , with a young wife in it  --  as I did , before I was twenty years old  --  you may keep him in the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up R. C. ) Here they come , together . We shall see what view they take of it . ( Virginia and Stuyvesant walk in on veranda , L. , and enter through window , L. C. As Virginia sees Laurence she stops and turns to Stockton , C. Stuyvesant sees his father as he steps in and stops a second , looking at him . ) STUYVESANT . Father ! ( Moving down L. ) STOCKTON . ( To Virginia . ) Mr. Laurence , my pet . ( She bows to him with downcast eyes . Laurence bows with marked politeness . ) STUYVESANT . ( Quietly . ) This is my future wife , father . LAURENCE . ( To Virginia . ) I am very sorry to have come upon such an errand as I have , my dear Miss Stockton ; and I trust you will not think that what I am compelled to say has any personal reference to yourself . My son ! I have decided that you shall not form a matrimonial alliance with this young lady . STOCKTON . Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will give nothing to either of you . LAURENCE . It is your turn to speak . STUYVESANT . I will speak . If you were not my father and if you were not Virginia 's father  --  I should say that you may both be  --  LAURENCE . Sir ! STOCKTON . True to his ancestors , Laurence ; and I imagine they were men of that kind . My pet ! Do you also say we may both be  --  VIRGINIA . Well  --  not exactly that , father ; but I  --  really  --  I  --  I have nothing to say  --  to either of you !  --  only to him ! ( Running down to Stuyvesant . ) STOCKTON . As I asked you before , Laurence , where do we come in ? LAURENCE . I beg to bid you all  --  good afternoon . ( Going R. Stockton strikes bell on small table , up L. C. Virginia hurries across R. , detaining Laurence . ) VIRGINIA . Oh , sir ! Do not go away angry with us . We have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STUYVESANT . She refuses to make it in three days . VIRGINIA . Not less than three months ; and I hope that we may reconcile you and Stuyvesant 's mother before we are married . And  --  ( As if with a sudden thought . ) I 'll tell you , Mr. Laurence ; we need not  --  in the meantime  --  we need not be " engaged " at all . STUYVESANT . What ! VIRGINIA . I can trust you , Stuyvesant . STUYVESANT . Yes ,  --  but  --  VIRGINIA . And you can trust me . STUYVESANT . My love !  --  Certainly . But  --  VIRGINIA . What difference does it make ? And it will please him . I insist ! STUYVESANT . Father ! If I consent to dispense with the mere form of an engagement it is only because she asks me to do so ; not because I recognize the slightest possibility of giving up my happiness , or your right to ask me to do so . ( Martin appears R. C. ) LAURENCE . We shall see . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , Miss Stockton ; good afternoon ! VIRGINIA . Good afternoon , sir ! LAURENCE . Mr. Stockton ! STOCKTON . Good day , Mr. Laurence . A truce under arms . ( Exit Laurence with quiet dignity , shown out by Martin R. ) VIRGINIA . Stuyvesant , dear ! ( He crosses to her , R. C. ) You may come to see me very often ! I can not give that up , even for him . But go with your father  --  now ; and let him know you intend to be a kind , good son to him . STUYVESANT . ( After a moment 's hesitation , as if struggling with himself . ) For your sake , I will ! Good bye . ( Offering to kiss her . She raises her finger playfully ; passing to L. of him . ) I forgot . VIRGINIA . We are not engaged now . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! STUYVESANT . ( In door , looking back at her . ) Do n't keep me in purgatory too long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often . My visits to heaven will be frequent . ( Exit R. C. Virginia glances R. , then crosses L. thoughtfully ; Stockton watching her . ) STOCKTON . My girl ! ( She stops L. , half turning . He goes to her . She raises her face . He kisses her . She brushes her eyes ; then laughs , and runs out L. 1 E. He stands looking after her . Enter Martin with card ; crosses to Stockton , who turns and reads card . ) Ask him in here . ( Exit Martin . Stockton looks down at card . Reads . ) " The Marquis of Normandale . Normandale House , London . " I 've seen that name before . ( Enter the Marquis R. , shown in by Martin , who retires . ) MARQUIS . I called about half an hour ago upon your daughter , Mr. Stockton . As I was leaving , your servant informed me that you would probably return by the next train from town ; so I took a short drive , and have ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Be seated . By the bye  --  Normandale ! ( With a sudden thought . ) Have n't we had a slight correspondence recently , Marquis ? MARQUIS . " Nine hundred and fifty-eight , B. " STOCKTON . It was connected with one of my railways . MARQUIS . Incidentally . STOCKTON . I remember , now . Pardon me , Marquis . It was a proposition of marriage for my daughter . MARQUIS . She has accepted my hand . STOCKTON . She !  --  ( Stopping with a slight start ; stares at the Marquis , putting down the chair ; then turns his head , looking at door L. ; then at Marquis again . He drops his chin into his hand , turns up stage in thought . After a second 's pause he turns and looks at the Marquis . ) You must have called at the wrong house , Marquis . ( The Marquis half turns and looks at him . ) There 's another millionnaire about half a mile up the road ; the next place to this ; and he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . MARQUIS . You are Mr. Jefferson Stockton . STOCKTON . Yes , But there 's a mistake somewhere , Marquis . However , I  --  I 'm willing to talk business with you . ( Walking down . ) MARQUIS . Business ? STOCKTON . ( Sitting at table . ) I see by your card that you have a residence in London : " Normandale House . " And you have various ancestral estates in the country , of course . They are all heavily mortgaged . MARQUIS . Sir ! STOCKTON . The remainder of your property is equally encumbered , and you are deeply in debt to the money leaders on your personal notes . MARQUIS . Really , sir  --  your apparent familiarity with my private affairs  --  may I ask have you been employing a detective ? STOCKTON . You are not the first European nobleman who has proposed to marry my daughter ; and all the rest had squandered their fortunes . Your predecessors have been the only detectives I have used . You would hardly know my daughter if you met her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , you are simply talking business . I am also talking business . We are two business men , talking business . Listen ! I will assume your mortgages on long time , at low interest . I will relieve you of immediate pressure from your floating debts , and see that you have enough ready money to run on with comfortably . MARQUIS . You interest me . Proceed . STOCKTON . ( Using notebook and pencil . ) How much do the mortgages amount to ? MARQUIS . My agent informs me that the total amount is now about eighty-five thousand pounds . STOCKTON . ( Making note . ) And foreclosure threatened . That will be merely a safe investment for me . The other indebtedness ? MARQUIS . About eighteen thousand . STOCKTON . ( Making note . ) They refuse to wait longer unless they receive something substantial on account . MARQUIS . I never read one of my agent 's letters as carefully as you seem to have done . STOCKTON . If you give the money lenders five thousand on account they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance that amount on your personal security ; and also another five thousand for cash in hand . MARQUIS . Am I to understand that this is apart from any settlement you intend to make upon your daughter ? STOCKTON . My daughter does not go with the transaction . MARQUIS . Sir ! ( Starting to his feet . ) You have been trifling with me . STOCKTON . I have a direct and definite business proposition to make to you . If a civilized man will bargain for a wife , as a South Sea Islander does , he need not hesitate to bargain for anything else . You came here to sell your title for a young girl 's heart , and her life ; you need n't shrink from what I am about to propose . I wish to take your house in London , at a fair rental ; with the servants , furniture and yourself , for six months , with the privilege of one year . MARQUIS . I think I understand you . You wish to be introduced by me to the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest . MARQUIS . You probably intend to float some American commercial company . STOCKTON . I have a purpose of my own ; but that is my affair . I have made you my offer  --  to assume your mortgages at easy terms ; to rent your residence  --  and you ; and to advance you , on your personal notes , ten thousand pounds in cash . MARQUIS . You seem to forget that you are addressing a man who belongs to an old and highly distinguished family . The history of our house extends back twelve centuries or more . STOCKTON . Twelve centuries ! We 'll call it fifteen thousand pounds . MARQUIS . Permit me to remind you that I belong to the most dignified body that has ever existed in the history of the world . I am a peer of England ; a member of the British House of Lords . STOCKTON . Twenty thousand . MARQUIS . You speak of taking my residence in London . From the walls of that house my ancestors look down upon me as the present representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full height ; speaking with deep earnestness and great dignity . ) You can not honor them more than I do , sir . From my very childhood , in this distant West , during the intervals of hard work , I have read the history of great Englishmen . I know what the ancestors of your noble families once did . They were leaders of men ; and I can understand them . They brought England through the terrors of dark ages ; and laid the foundations of her empire . I can understand those men . Men like them have brought this Western country to what it is to-day ; we have been leaders  --  to subdue mountains and the deserts for the people . We understand your forefathers . No man can be before myself in his respect for your great ancestors . I 'll make it thirty thousand pounds . ( The Marquis sinks back into his chair ; Stockton 's eyes fixed on him ; then , aside . ) Seventy times a millionnaire ! The world is at my feet ! A cigar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARQUIS . Thank you . ( Taking cigar ; returns case ; lights cigar . Stockton also lights one , and the Marquis is smoking thoughtfully as curtain descends . ) CURTAIN . ACT II . SCENE .  --  Normandale House , London . The ancestral town residence of the Marquis of Normandale . Interior . An apartment in panelled wood ; old ivory white and gold , in the general style of the Holland House , London . The room extends back about twelve feet from curtain , with a very wide and high opening to family hall at back . The hall in old oak . A very handsome old screen nearly fills the large opening ; standing back from it about three feet . Doors R. and L. , near upper wall in the front room , Mantelpiece and fire down R. The front room is lighted by small candelabra on mantel , and , in the shape of brackets , on walls . The family hall , at back , is dimly lighted . Large family portraits , in age-tarnished gilt frames , hang on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century , are set in panels on the side walls of the front room . These portraits agree with the dialogue of the act , as follows :  --  In the back room , C. , a full-length Norman Knight in armor , 1066 ; on L. , a nobleman of 1154-89 ; on R. , courtier of 1550 ; in the front , half-lengths and busts ; a nobleman of 1600 , 1660 and 1700 ; a Bishop ; a Judge of about 1750 . There are also two full length portraits , one on each side of the central opening , on the wall of the front room , facing audience . These represent , respectively , a sweet and dignified young matron in court costume of about 1550 ( L. ) , and a very beautiful and dashing young woman in modern costume ( R. ) The furniture of the front apartment is of the early eighteenth century .

Exit GRIMTHORPE un R. ) DUC . Stanhope , mon ami ! MARQUIS . My dear Octave ! DUC . I found your note awaiting me . MARQUIS . I was afraid you had an engagement . DUC . No  --  I was delighted . MARQUIS . Mrs. Stockton and Miss Virginia Stockton were presented to the Queen this afternoon . DUC . Mais oui . I know . MARQUIS . We have asked a number of friends to drop in after dinner to see the ladies in their presentation frocks . The usual thing , you know . They will spread their illeg. like peacock tails , for admiration and criticism . I thought you might like to join us at dinner , en famille before the others come . DUC . Of all places in London , I would wish to be here to-night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUC . What a charming little romance it was , this afternoon ! MARQUIS . Romance ? DUC . The Prince 's marriage . Of course the young lady 's father was easily appeased . Were you present at the scene when they first met him ? MARQUIS . I have n't the remotest idea what you are talking about , Duc . DUC . They have not returned yet ? MARQUIS . My mother and Mrs. Stockton drove home from Buckingham Palace about an hour ago . Miss Stockton has not returned yet , however . DUC . Oh ! Then I am the first to bring you the news . Delightful ! Congratulate me , Marquis ! I am in heaven ! The woman of all the world that I adore  --  the woman I have worshipped , as a sinful man on earth might worship Saint Cecile in Paradise she is married ! MARQUIS . To you ? DUC . No , no . I said I was in heaven . She has married my dearest friend . We shall all be very happy together , Emil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Virginie Stockton was married to Prince Emil Von Haldenwald , at the Austrian Embassy , this afternoon . MARQUIS . The deuce she was ! I was quite aware that a previous engagement of the young lady in America was broken off ; but I have never heard of any prospective alliance here . This is very sudden . Tell me about it . ( Sits R. ) DUC . ( Duke sits R. in chair . ) Sudden ! That is the romance , my dear Marquis . Two months ago the Prince obtained the lady 's consent , and he wrote to Mr. Stockton , making formal offer for her hand . Her father declined . Last evening she accepted him for herself , and to-day they married . Again I say , congratulate me , Marquis ! ( Starting to his feet . ) The Prince Von Haldenwald is my dearest friend ; it would be my duty as a French gentleman to love his wife under any circumstances , but I love her already . Voila ! I can be true to them both  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! She never looked so charming to me as she did to-day ; and to think that I am at last so near to her . We are bound together now by a sacred tie . Dear Emil ! I can never be grateful enough to him ; it is very seldom that a man marries a woman his dearest friend really loves . Emil , Virginie and I will settle down quietly and peacefully . We two men will give up the wild life we have passed together and practice the domestic virtues ; with an angel between us ! Is it not charming ? This secret marriage will be the sensation of the London season . Paris , too , and Vienna will be electrified . The most extravagant and reckless of all the young Austrian princes , and the daughter of a Californian Croesus . Oh ! La , la ! We all drove directly from Buckingham Palace to the Embassy . The young bride elect escaped from her party , and the Ambassador himself took her in his own carriage . A dainty sensation !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novelty for the Prince . It 's the only sensation he has ever been in where there was not some wickedness  --  and I know , for I 've been in most of the others with him . Ah , Marquis !  --  if you could have seen her at the ceremony ! She was breathing rapidly her hand trembled a flush on her face her eyes cast down she dared not look up . When she was pronounced the wife of the Prince you would have envied me . At that moment she gave a little gasping scream and fell backwards . I caught her in my arms . She lay there , pale and motionless ; I never loved her so much before . If the Prince himself had not supported me I should have fainted too . And when I finally left her she was looking about her with the wild , quick glance of a frightened gazelle . I could hardly tear myself away ; but I was obliged at last to trust her to her husband . MARQUIS . Y-e-s . ( Rising . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. thoughtfully . ) It will be some time before dinner , Duc ; will you come into the smoking room ? DUC . Thank you . ( Walking up stage R. ; stops suddenly . ) It has just occurred to me  --  they have not returned yet , Marquis . It is possible  --  of course !  --  she may have swooned again  --  and it is more serious . ( Touches his eyes . ) Pardon me ; but I am a newly married friend . I am anxious . ( Exit R. ) MARQUIS . I have received an advance lesson in French . ( Going R. , is interrupted by Sheridan Stockton , who enters L. The latter is the very extreme of a young English fop in his tone , looks and manners ; evening dress ; a single eyeglass . ) SHERIDAN . Marquis ! MARQUIS . Sheridan ! I did n't know you had come from Oxford to-day . Were they expecting you ? SHERIDAN . No . I slipped away from Oxford surreptitiously . I 'm trying to get ahead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , apparently , whenever I take the train . Tenny Laurence is visiting her , you know . MARQUIS . Yes . SHERIDAN . The Dowager gets her out of town whenever I come to London . I got twelve hours ' start of her the last time ; but when I met Miss Laurence that evening at Lady Hamperdown 's the old shehawk interrupted us every three minutes . I shall circumvent the Dowager Countess this time , if I have to glue to her seat , while I talk with Tenny in the next room . What receptions and five o'clock teas are on in our set , now ? MARQUIS . I 'll give you a list of our engagements . SHERIDAN . Thank you . MARQUIS . ( Going . Aside ) I have been trying to circumvent the Dowager myself . ( Exit R. Sheridan suddenly stretches his arm : then the other arm . ) SHERIDAN . By thunder ! I ca n't stand this English manner more than five minutes at a time when I first get up to London . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My bones creak . ( Throws up his legs and his arms , dancing . Grimthorpe enters R. ; very stiff in manner ; looks at Sheridan as he crosses and passes out L. , with accentuated dignity . Sheridan , having danced up stage , suddenly pulls himself up , places his glass in his eye , and walks out R. with his former English manner . Enter Stockton , C. from further room , R. He is looking from side to side at the pictures . STOCKTON . The Marquis has informed me that his ancestors , on these walls , look down upon him . They do . ( Turns , up C. , his back to the audience , looking at pictures on further wall of the back room . Turns ; looking at pictures R. and L. in front room . ) Lord Chamberlains , Constables of Windsor Castle , Hereditary Grand Almoners , Bishops and Chief Justices  --  and I hold a chattel mortgage on the lot . Ladies and gentlemen , we are alone together again . I enjoy these quiet little reunions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be a great satisfaction to you to have some one in this house that respects you . ( Enter Virginia , L. in full presentation costume . She stops L. C. ; her eyes dropped . ) VIRGINIA . Father ! STOCKTON.  --  Virginia , dear , you have returned . Diana and Lady Normandale told me they lost sight of you , after the presentation to the Queen to-day . I suppose you were separated from them in the crush . ( Goes L. ) VIRGINIA . How shall I tell him ? ( Aside . ) I have been mad to-day  --  mad . How can I tell him ? ( Aloud . ) Father ! ( Running to him ; throwing one arm over his shoulder the other hand on his breast ; looks up into his face . ) I  --  I have something to  --  to tell you . STOCKTON . My dear girl ! What has excited you like this ? VIRGINIA . I have been in a fever all day , father . I hardly know what I have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think badly of me , dear . Whatever I have done , you must still love me . You must , dear ! Put your arm closer about me , father  --  closer . STOCKTON . Did you love Stuyvesant Laurence so much , my poor girl ? VIRGINIA . Why do you ask me that question now ? STOCKTON . Because you have never been yourself since your engagement to him was finally broken off ; and on the morning I read the announcement of his approaching marriage to another woman , I looked up at you . You were as pale as death . Stuyvesant Laurence 's marriage was set for to-day . I looked at you tenderly and anxiously when we first met , this morning . You have kept the day in mind , I see . Did you love him so much ? ( Raising her head and looks in her eyes . ) VIRGINIA . Stuyvesant is nothing to me , now , father . All that is past . ( Enter PRINCE EMIL VON HALDENWALD , L. ) PRINCE . Mr. Stockton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STOCKTON . Prince Von Haldenwald . PRINCE . ( Moving down to VIRGINIA . ) You have told him of our marriage ? VIRGINIA . Not yet . I could not . PRINCE . Ah ! ( Lightly . ) I will relieve you of that duty . It is not such a terrible thing for a man to discover that his daughter is a Princess . Mr. Stockton ! about two months ago I asked your permission to make your daughter the Princess Von Haldenwald . STOCKTON . And I declined the honor . Am I to understand that you are now renewing that request ? We need not waste words . I decline again . ( The PRINCE shrugs his shoulders slightly , and crosses R. Leans against the mantel with a quiet smile . ) PRINCE . We do not quite understand each other , I fear . STOCKTON . You have seen fit to recur to this subject in my daughter 's presence ; and you compel me to speak more plainly to you than I should wish . I , of course , am a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that you have no particular interest in my daughter . It is a custom in your country , and in your class , to marry for wealth . I do not charge you with what we consider almost a crime , for you were born to it . But I do not like the custom , and we will drop the subject . PRINCE . I do n't quite see that we can drop the subject . STOCKTON . You are persistent , and force me to speak still more frankly . I am familiar with your history , sir ; you are one of the most profligate young noblemen in Europe . VIRGINIA . Father ! ( Starting up . ) Do not say another word . The Prince is  --  he is  --  STOCKTON . Well ? PRINCE . A pretty scene ! ( Aside with a smile . ) It amuses me . VIRGINIA . How shall I tell him ? STOCKTON . Come , my girl . ( He drops one arm around her waist and leads her up C. a little . ) Leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have I done ? ( Exit C. to R. ) STOCKTON . ( To PRINCE . ) Your mistresses , sir , have assisted you to seatter your ancestral estates . I do not propose to furnish you another fortune to squander , nor a wife to neglect . Do you wish to continue the subject ? PRINCE . Not at present . ( Exit STOCKTON , C. , after VIRGINIA . ) He will not furnish me another fortune ! To be the husband of an American money king 's daughter is a fortune in itself . That alone renews my credit ; and I was desperate . But , above all !  --  I shall be near Diana Stockton now , in spite of herself . She can not again tell me never to come into her presence , as she did at our last meeting  --  and how magnificently she did it ! Stockton objects to the various ladies who have kindly assisted me in the disposal of my fortune . I would give them all for one glance of his young wife 's eyes when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation costume . She stops as she sees the PRINCE . He bows politely . ) DIANA . Prince Von Haldenwald ! ( Walks to him , with a stately manner , looking straight into his face . ) You are in this house once more , Prince , notwithstanding my request that you should never enter its doors again while I reside here . PRINCE . When we last met , you entirely misunderstood the language I used . DIANA . I sincerely hope I did ; but I do not ask you for an explanation . ( Crosses , L. , front . ) PRINCE . Believe me , whatever my language may have been , there was nothing in my intentions that requires an explanation . For my unfortunate words , however unconscious I was of anything wrong in them , I offer you an apology . I wish sincerely to be your friend , and to feel that you are my friend . I have never wished this so much as I do at the present moment . DIANA . I would not charge any one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of if you do not mean what you are saying now . PRINCE . Trust me , I do mean it . DIANA . You compel me to accept your apology ; and I ask you to pardon me for misunderstanding you . We will forget the matter . ( Enter GRIMTHORPE , L. ) GRIMTHORPE . Miss Laurence . ( The PRINCE moves , R. Enter TENNY , L. ; in full presentation robe , with train caught up over her arm . She runs in quickly , speaking as she does so . ) TENNY . Virginia ! Oh ! Diana ! Prince ! ( Stopping suddenly up , C. She swings her train back at full length over GRIMTHORPE , just behind her . He squirms out of it and spreads it over the stage . TENNY sinks into a deep courtesy to DIANA , and then to the PRINCE . ) TENNY . I thought I 'd got done making courtesies for the day . We 've been to the Duchess of Wolventon 's reception , to show off our trains . How do you like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . Are my feathers all right ? Where is Virginia ? DIANA . She returned a few moments ago , but  --  PRINCE . She is in the next room . DIANA . I will send her to you . TENNY . Thank you , dear . I must see her at once . ( DIANA moves up and exits , C. to R. ) I 've just escaped from the Dowager Countess of Caryston-Leigh . She 'll think I 've eloped . I ran away with her own carriage . The Countess will have to go home from the Duchess 's in a hansom cab . ( Enter VIRGINIA , C. from R. ) VIRGINIA . Tenny ! TENNY . Virginia ! I have something very important to say to you . I am sure the Prince will excuse us for a few moments . PRINCE . Certainly . ( Moves up and exit , C. to R. ) TENNY . Ginnie , dear ! my life depended on seeing you this afternoon . What I know and you do n't is so much dynamite inside of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIRGINIA . A despatch from Stuyvesant ! TENNY . I 'll read it to you . ( Takes out desp . ) VIRGINIA . No , Tenny  --  no ! TENNY . What ? VIRGINIA . Do I not know what it contains ? His marriage to-day was duly announced in advance . TENNY . Yes , I know  --  of course  --  ( Turns down , L. ) and that 's exactly what it 's about . VIRGINIA . I will not hear it . TENNY . But  --  VIRGINIA . You were once my dearest friend , and my pride even now is not strong enough to let me hide my feelings from you . You are cruel , Tenny  --  cruel ! ( Turning away , back to audience , up C. ) TENNY . I come to bring you good news . VIRGINIA . ( Turns suddenly and looks at her . ) Good news ? TENNY . Stuyvesant was not married to-day , ( VIRGINIA wavers as if struck ) . And he still loves you dearly , Virginia ! ( Runs up and supports her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He still loves me ! ( Moves down , L. , half supported by Tenny ; drops into chair , with her face in her arms . ) Good news ! TENNY . Virginia , darling , I  --  I am obliged to tell you something that I would n't tell you  --  or anybody  --  for the world , if I did n't have to do it . I have found out all about it . It was somebody else that caused the trouble between you and Stuyvesant before you left America ; it was somebody else that separated you . VIRGINIA . Good news ! TENNY . I  --  I do n't like to tell you ; but I must . It was  --  my own mother . ( Virginia raises head ; Tenny continues quickly . ) Mamma is a very good woman , but  --  as  --  but  --  well ! She is a woman . ( Virginia 's head falls into her arms . ) That is n't what I was going to tell you . I 'm coming to that . But it does make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have done it ; and I should never have forgiven him if he had . Mama is such a very good woman , Ginnie ! And good women always think that Providence has put them in special charge of the way young people get married . Women that are n't quite so good do n't think the Lord has so much confidence in them . Mama  --  she  --  she had your letters intercepted . VIRGINIA . Tenny ! ( Raising head and turning front . ) TENNY . I got a letter from an old nurse of mine that 's still in the family . She 's a good woman , too ; she helped mama , and she could n't keep it to herself . And Stuyvesant 's valet  --  he often posts his letters  --  he helped too . They intercepted your correspondence until the letters on both sides became very cold and formal ; then mother let ' em go on . They took care of themselves after that . VIRGINIA . Yes ! After the long silence our short , cold letters put us further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We helped her to carry it out . TENNY . But it 's all passed now , my darling . VIRGINIA . All passed ! Yes . TENNY . This intended marriage of Stuyvesant was only a family affair , without love on either side , and he did n't care what became of him after he lost you . As soon as I heard from my old nurse I wrote to Stuyvesant , enclosing her letter , and I told him how I was sure you still loved him ; because I knew it , dear . You could n't conceal it from me . That was about ten days ago . VIRGINIA . Oh ! Tenny , Tenny ! ( Rise and passes toward C. ) If you had only told me then . TENNY . I have been so impatient to tell you , but I wanted to get it all fixed and give you a happy surprise . VIRGINIA . You  --  you have surprised me , dear . TENNY . But there is something else for you to know . Read Stuyvesant 's despatch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will surprise you , too . ( Virginia takes despatch hesitatingly  --  turns , moving R. Reading . ) VIRGINIA . " God bless you for your letter . The marriage will not take place . " TENNY . ( Eagerly ) Go on ! VIRGINIA . " Tell Virginia " ( Hesitates and looks away . ) TENNY . Yes  --  wo n't it be jolly for us all ? Go on ! VIRGINIA . ( Returning to despatch ) " Tell Virginia  --  I shall soon be with her . I  --  sail  --  for  --  England  --  this  --  morning . " Ah ! TENNY . Why !  --  it does n't make you happy at all . It did me . I was laughing over it all the way here . VIRGINIA . On the ocean , now ! and he will find me  --  Oh ! Tenny ! TENNY . Virginia ! What is it ? VIRGINIA . Good news ! Listen , Tenny ! Stuyvesant , you know , yielded to my wishes , and we agreed that there should be no formal engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from your mother , she seemed very kind , but wished us to put off our marriage definitely for  --  for six months . Stuyvesant demurred , as he always had ; but I was persuaded . I did so want his father and mother to love us both . Afterward , when Stuyvesant returned to the East  --  our  --  our correspondence was  --  interrupted . TENNY . Mother ! ( Dropping into chair , L. ) VIRGINIA . You know how things went then . When I passed through New York on the way to England , Stuyvesant and I did not even meet . We each thought the other was taking advantage of the freedom offered us . I tried to forget that we had ever met . Then I learned that he was to marry another woman . The thought of ever returning to America became terrible to me . I reconciled myself to a life abroad , which would take me as far away as possible from all the past . But when the news reached me that Stuyvesant was to be married to-day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London world ! Day after day , as the time approached , I had gone on in the whirl with the rest . But the strain became too great for me . It seemed as if my mind was going . The Prince Von Haldenwald had urged me again and again to become his wife ; and at last , in despair , even against my father 's wish , I was married to him  --  to-day ! TENNY . Married ! Oh ! Virginia ! ( Turns and drops her head into her arms on back of the chair . ) VIRGINIA . They tell me I have been presented to the Queen to-day . I did not see her . When I left the palace I could have thrown myself into the river  --  this long train would have looked so beautiful floating upon the water ! ( Sweeping up stage . ) But I have done worse than that . I have done worse ! Death would be peace for me ! I must live ! TENNY . Virginia ! ( Rising and going to her  --  Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , dear , with all my heart for what you have tried to do for me . But I 'm not quite well ; I will go to my room . TENNY . Let me go with you . VIRGINIA . No . I wish to be alone . ( Kissing her . ) There are times in life and this is such a time for me when one needs to be alone to weep , to pray , to resolve ! When a woman must make herself strong  --  so strong that in the worst that may come to her she will not even think what is wrong . ( Exit L. ) TENNY . Married already ! And only to-day . Ah , if I had only spoken in time ! ( Moves down to table R. C. ; strikes bell , stands back of table crying . Enter Grimthorpe , L. , also Marquis , R. The Marquis motions to Grimthorpe to retire .

American women , as a rule , do not consider a title of nobility a misfortune . I would like to speak one word to you , Miss Laurence , before you go ; here where we can not be interrupted by the Dowager Countess of Caryston Leigh . TENNY ( wiping eyes ) . My guardian angel ! MARQUIS . She interrupted us at Lady Eaton-Fanning 's reception last Monday afternoon . TENNY ( touching eyes ) . We were in the bay window and the Countess was eating cold chicken . Thank heaven , my guardian angel has an appetite . You were remarking that you hoped to convince me of your deep regard . Just then the angel caught sight of us .

These are your ancestors , Marquis .

You may be a member of it . TENNY . One of these portraits  --  that one  --  ( Pointing to the full length figure on left of central opening. )  --  has a deep and strong attraction for me . MARQUIS . The first Marchioness of Normandale . TENNY . A noble woman ! She did all the good it was possible for her to do , in her own day . She sustained the dignity of her sex as well as of her title . I confess to you honestly , Marquis , that I thrill with pride at the thought of being that woman 's successor . MARQUIS . You shall be her successor . ( Eagerly ; going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the other picture , Marquis !

The last time I met my friend , Stuyvesant , it was in London , about eight months ago . He had just arrived from New York . It seemed to me as if some great calamity had fallen upon him .

I have repented of my past life . It is the work of an angel ! PRINCE . Why will you not carry my message to Suzanne ? DUC . You are the husband of Virginia . I will not take a message from you to another woman . Listen to me , Emil . On that day in London , when you were married to the loveliest woman the world has ever known  --  the loveliest , Emil !  --  the best  --  I said to myself  --  " Emil is my bosom friend .

I have come to worship her  --  and to despise you . ( The Prince rises ; also the Duc . ) PRINCE . Despise me ! DUC . Yes , Prince Von Haldenwald . The word slipped from my tongue before I was aware of it , but I will not withdraw it . If I should say I do not despise you , I should lie .

I will follow you as soon as I possibly can . DUC . Send me your card when you arrive in Paris . I now feel at liberty to express still more fully what has long been on my mind . Since I came with you to New York , I have been , much of the time , an inmate of this house ; and I have not been blind . You are trying , slowly but surely , to ruin the happiness and the character of Mr. Stockton 's young wife . You are making yourself a scoundrel . PRINCE . You claim the privilege of heaping insult on insult ? DUC . We have already arranged for a meeting ; it may cover this , also . But Emil  --  beyond the duel which we may have , there is hope ; a few strokes of the sword  --  a wound  --  and your honor is satisfied . There need not be death in it ; and our life long friendship may be renewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nobleman can not go ; beyond which no friendship is possible . The young wife of Virginie 's father stands on the other side of that line . I beg of you , Emil , to leave it possible for me to be your friend again . PRINCE . You now speak of an absorbing passion in my life , for which I am accountable to no human law . DUC . Other men , also , refuse to be accountable to human law . Mr. Jefferson Stockton is an American . I have a right to warn you , Emil ; you have an appointment with me in Paris ; if you persist in crossing the path of Diane 's husband  --  you will not keep it . Adieu ! ( Moves up quickly and exit at door R. ) PRINCE . Adieu ! ( Looking down thoughtfully . The Servant closes the door and retires L. ) I know the kind of man I am dealing with ; but if my passion for Diana were not too strong for me to regard that , I should despise myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must not forget ; I have promised to see my sweet little wife before she goes to sleep . ( Exit L. 1 E. Martin passes in hall from L. , with a valise and travelling rug ; followed by Stockton and Diana . Stockton is now in travelling suit . Martin opens door and holds it back . ) STOCKTON . Good bye , my love ; I hope to be back to-morrow night . DIANA . Must you go ? STOCKTON . My darling ! I have answered that question a dozen times , in as many minutes . DIANA . ( Walking down . ) Do n't go just yet , Jefferson . Martin , close the door go to the carriage . Mr. Stockton will be there in a few moments if he goes . ( Martin goes out . ) STOCKTON . If I go ? There was a hurried meeting of our Board of Directors to-night , and message have been coming to me since nine o'clock . I must be in Harrisburg before noon . DIANA . I wish you would not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars are at stake . DIANA . I  --  I wish you would not go . STOCKTON . Diana ! You have been singularly nervous and unsettled of late . Do you know what happened last night ? DIANA . Last night ? I only remember that I had a horrible dream . STOCKTON . Dream ! It was a nightmare , my dear . I intended to speak to you about it this morning . You gave a sudden striek , that brought me to the side of your bed in a second . Your breathing was quick and hard . I took you in my arms . In another moment , you were sleeping quietly and peacefully upon my breast . DIANA . I did not know why that horrible dream passed away , darling , but I began to feel peaceful and happy , as if the arm of a strong man were protecting me from evil . I want that same strong arm to be near me to-night . STOCKTON . ( Laughing lightly . ) You are afraid the bad dream will return . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steps to C. ) When we left London and came back to America we brought a serpent with us . STOCKTON . In our luggage ? DIANA . I am telling you my dream . STOCKTON . Oh ! of course . DIANA . The serpent quietly coiled itself up ; it was as harmless as a cat ; but it was always here  --  in our home . It made no sign : and its eyes followed me  --  day after day . It began to fascinate me  --  in one way ; not as if I were a terrified dove . It was the fascination which a snake-charmer must feel . I touched the serpent ; it was still harmless . I felt my power ! It became my slave . I played with it . Suddenly I felt its coils compress , and I was helpless . STOCKTON . It was then that you gave that shriek , and I jumped into the middle of the room . In a moment after , as I have said , you were sleeping quietly in your husband 's arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Placing his arms about her . ) Long after you were slumbering peacefully I hold you in my arms . DIANA . Do not leave me to-night . STOCKTON . I can hardly telegraph to the other Directors , in Harrisburg , that my wife is afraid of a nightmare . Have one of the maids sleep in the next room to-night ( takes hat ) , my love . Good bye ! ( Kisses her and goes up quickly . ) DIANA . ( Turning L. ) Good-bye . ( Sits in armchair ; looking into fire . ) STOCKTON . I will return to-morrow . ( Exit at door R. ) DIANA . Millions of dollars at stake ! Millions of sensitive nerves ! Millions of little fancies in a woman 's brain , that have no right there ! Do I fear the Prince von Haldenwald ? The only thing I am certain of is that I hate him . ( The Prince steps in C. ; stops and looks at her . Diana is still looking into the fire , without looking up . ) Emil ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hear you . PRINCE . A mystery ! Second sight . DIANA . I bade you good-night a few moments ago . PRINCE . And I said " Au revoir . " ( Moving down R. C. ) Poor little Virginia has been crying herself to sleep . Something has been troubling her innocent soul , and she had a confession to make . ( Sitting at table L. C. ) So far as I could understand what it was all about , she loved another man before her marriage . But what woman has not ? She lay holding my hand in her own , and crying as if her little heart would break . I was thinking of something else just then , and I suddenly discovered that she was asleep . DIANA . She was reaching out to her husband for strength to help her weakness . PRINCE . I dare say . ( Taking up a bronze handled paper knife and trifling with it as he speaks . ) Her face looked very pretty as it lay upon the pillow , with tears running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No heart , no conscience , no feeling . ( She rises and moves down R. , near Prince , and looks down at him . ) Emil ! PRINCE . ( Looking up at her with a smile ; over his shoulder ) Diana ! DIANA . You are the most interesting man I ever knew . PRINCE . Thank you . DIANA . I have known you nearly a year . If , in all that time , I had ever discovered a single impulse that belonged to earth , and not to those beneath the earth ; a single ray of feeling , to weaken the utter badness of your character , I could despise you . PRINCE . And for what I am ? DIANA . I respect you , Prince . You are a perfect creature of its kind . If I ever had any doubts of that perfection , you have removed them to-night . A sweet young wife , struggling to be true to you in every thought , appealing to you for sympathy and support , has sobbed herself to sleep with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks have aroused your admiration . You are utterly and hopelessly perfect . Some women would fear you . PRINCE . I trust that you do not . DIANA . No ; you simply interest me . ( Crosses L. , front . The Prince rises and watches her across ; then moves to her . ) PRINCE . If there is one ray of light in my nature , it is what you have thrown into it . DIANA . ( After turning her head and looking at him quietly , then looking away . ) Go on , Emil ! PRINCE . It is the fierce light of a passion which some better men , perhaps , are not capable of feeling . And I know you better than you think ; you only among the women that I have met are capable of returning such a passion as mine . Good or bad , it is the only feeling I have  --  the only deep feeling I have ever had . It is all I live for , it is all I am . Diana !  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws up watching her . ) DIANA . Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha . ( Turning and looking at him frankly , with her hands at her back on the chair . ) My dear Prince !  --  if an ordinary man had said that to me , I should be virtuously indignant . I should consider myself insulted . But I am not troubled , now , about the conventionalities of society . A woman feels so entirely at her ease  --  alone with the devil . ( Looking straight into his eyes . ) She can be as frank with him as she can with her physician . So you love me , Prince ? PRINCE . ( Quietly , having kept his eyes fixed upon her . ) It was a charming reception this evening , was it not ? DIANA . Eh ? The reception ! You have changed the subject . PRINCE . I confess the remark is commonplace . DIANA . Brilliantly so . PRINCE . I have seen many social gatherings in the courts of Europe ; but never one where more beautiful women  --  DIANA . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly say " impressed ; "  --  yes , I was impressed , but not with the guests  --  with the hostess . DIANA . Indeed !  --  ha-ha-ha-ha . ( Laughing quietly and passing him to R. ) PRINCE . Do not you think that I am merely flattering you ? I could hardly be guilty of that vulgarity . I say it in all sincerity . I can remember my own mother . DIANA . Your  --  mother ! PRINCE . Still in the full beauty of her youth ; I will be frank with you  --  a youth more beautiful than yours  --  but not more fascinating . I have seen her receiving Princes and royal guests ; but not with more simple ease , nor with more queenly grace , than I saw in you to-night . DIANA . Have you no other memories of your mother , Emil ? Memories of her that might guide a man to better things at a time like this ? PRINCE . I remember her as she leaned over me , in boyhood , with all a mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With a step toward him . ) PRINCE . With eyes as beautiful as yours . ( She starts ; drawing up as if receiving a blow . ) I remember her voice , in prayer , at my bedside ; it sounded as sweet to me then  --  DIANA . Your mother 's voice in prayer ! PRINCE .  --  As sweet as yours sounds to me now . DIANA . Emil ! Prince ! Is there nothing human in you ? PRINCE . Yes !  --  for I love you . DIANA . ( Turning away . ) I am looking further into the devil 's heart than I dare  --  but I can not close my eyes . PRINCE . ( Looking at the bronze dirk in his hand . ) Have you ever noticed this old bronze-handled dirk , Diana ? It hung at the belt of one of my family , in the thirteenth century , and I gave it to my wife  --  here in a country unknown then  --  to cut the leaves of a modern novel . It 's a pretty toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) My ancestor who carried it was a Robber Baron , on the Danube . The ruins of his castle , on a high peak above the river , are now looked at with interest by passing travellers . He once had a prisoner there , a beautiful young woman . Her picture now hangs in the grand hall of our family residence , near Vienna . She was entirely in his power ; and he loved her with that intense passion which I have inherited from him . One day , when he stood at her side , she seized this little weapon from his hand . DIANA . I can finish the story . They are all alike . Did she plunge it into his breast , or her own . Ha-ha-ha-ha . ( Laughing . ) These are modern , commonplace days , Emil  --  in a commonplace country . Here and now , she would simply hand back the toy  --  ( Offering it quietly. )  --  and bid the wicked Prince good night . ( In taking it , he grasps her hand firmly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm still outstretched . He draws her slowly towards him with his left hand ; then , with a sharp , firm , swift movement brings her to his breast ; his right arm about her waist , turning her face to face with him , and pressing her to him ; she throws back her head and shoulders , looking into his face . PRINCE ( softly ) . Good night ! DIANA . ( With quick , heavy breath . ) I hate you ! PRINCE . I would rather have your hatred , to-night , with that look in your eyes , than all the insipid love that other women have given me . DIANA . Hate begins to seem like love to me . Your breath , on my cheek , is the hot fire of hell ! It is your wickedness that fascinates me  --  not you  --  not you ! All that I love and respect in the world is growing dim to me . I hate you ! ( Her face drops upon his breast ; he takes her right hand , gently lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; looking down at her with a quiet smile . A moment 's silence . The clear , sharp ring of the electric door bell is heard . They start , looking up ; she still in his arms ; a moment 's silence ; then a second bell . She draws back from him and crosses L. ; turns and looks up at centre door . The Prince stands quietly R. C. Diana suddenly moves up C. , and throws back one of the portieres , standing with her hand upon it at left of doorway , looking up into hall R. Grimthorpe walks by , in hall , from L. , opens door . Enter MARTIN . He is passing L. ) Martin ! What is it ? Why have you returned ? MARTIN . ( Stopping C. ) I was very careless , madam ; I forgot the box containing Mr. Stockton 's papers . We have driven back for it . DIANA . Mr. Stockton is with you ? MARTIN . Yes , madam ; in the carriage at the door . DIANA . Ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great haste . DIANA . Tell him I must see him ! ( Exit Martin R. ) DIANA . ( To Prince ) My husband shall remain with me . ( Moves down to him ) I once gave you a warning , in London , that I had a natural protector ; I turn to him now . Heaven knows I have been weak enough , I need a protector ; and he has come back to me . Go ! Leave this room . I have been as much at fault as you ; and I must make such poor excuses to my husband to detain him as I can . But you must not be here  --  Go ! PRINCE . It is too late . I shall not crawl away from your husband , like a coward , trembling at my own footsteps on the stairs . He will hardly object to an interview between you and me , in one of the drawing rooms after the reception . You may use my name in any way you like . It is quite indifferent to me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) STOCKTON . My love ! DIANA . Jefferson ! ( Crossing R. The Prince turns front , tossing the bronze knife upon table . ) STOCKTON . ( Moving down ) Martin says you wish to see me again  --  Emil !  --  you are still up . PRINCE . Perhaps we can have a cigar together . STOCKTON . I can remain only a moment . PRINCE . I shall be in the smoking room . ( Exit up C. , in hall , to L. ) STOCKTON . What is it , darling ? ( Approaching her , L. C. ) You are excited , and your hand is hot  --  and trembling ! ( Drawing her around to him ; she drops her head upon his breast ) DIANA . My husband ! Oh !  --  I am so happy  --  so happy here . Do not leave me . STOCKTON . Why !  --  your heart is beating as if you had been frightened . Are you still troubled about that silly dream ? You have been awake , and you have not been alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clinging to him more closely . He straightens up , looking about as if a new thought had come to him , and continues aside ) She has not been alone ; and yet I find her trembling , excited and frightened ; clinging to me as she did last night in her sleep , when I stood at her bedside . ( Aloud ) Diana ! Look me in the face . ( She raises herself from his breast , trying to look at him . ) Straight into my eyes , girl , as you have always done . ( She compels herself , with an effort , to look squarely at him . ) I begin to understand what your dream meant . ( She drops her head . ) You need my protection to-night . ( She covers her face with her hands . He makes sudden exclamation and steps back with his arms raised as if shrinking from her . ) Ah !  --  you could not protect yourself . DIANA . My husband ! STOCKTON . Another has been between you and me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward him . He has had a single thought that should have been mine . I will not say that his lips  --  ( A deprecatory gesture from her ) No  --  I believe you  --  nor his arms  --  ( Her head drops lower . ) Ah ! I did not return in time to save us both from that degradation . You shall have my protection to-night . ( Turning to table R. C. ; strikes bell . ) DIANA . ( Turning suddenly ) What will you do ? STOCKTON . You need not fear ; I shall control myself . ( Enter Grimthorpe in hall from L. ) Say to the Prince that I would like to see him in this room . Afterward , you may tell Martin to drive to the station and say I shall not take the special train . I shall have no further use for the carriage or for his services . You may then retire for the night yourself . GRIMTHORPE . ( Yawning ; with his hand to his mouth ) Yes , sir  --  thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so . ) DIANA . You and the Prince must not meet to-night . STOCKTON . As I told you before , I shall control myself , and I shall do nothing rash . You may go to your room now . You may sleep peacefully , and dreams need disturb you no longer . Go ! DIANA . But  --  STOCKTON . ( With sudden energy ) If your face is before me when I meet that man I shall kill him ! Go ! ( She shrinks from him toward door , L. 1 E. He points her away ; she moves backwards watching him intently , as if fearing to stay . Disappears , L. 1 E. He looks after her a moment . Then turns up to the mantel ; takes a cigar from his pocket , lights it and gives a few puffs in silence , looking into the fire . ) I shall deal with the serpent , now . ( The Prince enters , C. , through portieres . He glances at Stockton . ) PRINCE . Your servant tells me you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince . ( The Prince walks down R. C. He stops at table and picks up the bronze-handled dirk again ; taps his hand lightly with it as he speaks aside . Stockton is leaning quietly against the mantel , watching him and smoking . ) PRINCE . ( Aside ) I wonder if our California friend is in a far Western mood to-night ! This is hardly a fair match for a revolver ; however , if worse comes to worst , I must do the best I can with it . ( Glances at Stockton , still trifling with the dirk , then moves further R. and sits at right of the table . Aloud ) I am quite at your service . ( Stockton lays his cigar upon the mantel and takes a large revolver from his hip pocket . ) STOCKTON . One of my old Pacific coast habits ; when I travel I usually put this in my pocket . ( Crosses to table . The Prince keeps his eyes on him , quietly smoking his cigarette and holding the dirk firmly . ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . ( Lays the revolver upon the table , near the Prince , and returns to the mantel ; takes up his cigar . The Prince replaces the dirk on the table . ) STOCKTON . Prince von Haldenwald ! You are a member of what is called one of the great noble families of Europe . You are the final result of long inheritance ; of power and wealth and privileges , enjoyed by your ancestors for many generations . There are many leaders of society , in Europe , like yourself ; of equally high nobility and equally low character . PRINCE . ( Drawing up slightly and looking at him ) I follow you . STOCKTON . You are a fair example of the class of men to which you belong . I am merely a product of the present age , and of a new country . We are both representative men . You are undoubtedly under the impression that you despise me . ( A deprecatory gesture from the Prince . ) But you are mistaken . You do not know what the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolent scorn which all your ancestors have felt for those they thought beneath them ; it will seem weak and colorless compared with the utter and hopeless contempt which I now feel for you . PRINCE . ( After biting his lips ; then quietly ) Pardon me if I am too frank ; but you are becoming tedious to me . STOCKTON . My remarks will grow more interesting to you as we proceed . You forced yourself , without my own consent , into the very heart of my family . I cast aside my prejudices and accepted you with a man 's good faith . What have you given me in return for that good faith ? When I placed my daughter 's hand in yours , you gave me the pledge of your family honor for her happiness . The promise was a lie  --  ( The Prince rises )  --  as the promises of your class have always been . They are a by word in history . PRINCE . It is sufficient ; we need proceed no further . I have waited until there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I trust you will not take advantage of the customs of your own country , and after insulting me refuse to meet me . STOCKTON . I shall " meet " you at no time , and at no place , except the present . But I have still in reserve some plain and rather blunt words , which you may consider insults . I shall proceed to use them . There is a weapon ; all the chambers are loaded ; you 'd better hold it in your hands . PRINCE . Bah ! STOCKTON . You decline my suggestion . I will do you justice ; you are too brave a man to adopt it . I decline yours . But there is a third course for two men in an emergency . You have the weapons that nature gave you ; so have I. If you object to what I have yet to say you may use them . PRINCE . We will close this interview . ( Turning and moving up . ) STOCKTON . We will not close it , sir  --  ( Stepping C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you , when this interview is ended . It will not be closed until you know how I have seen my daughter 's very life fading away in the blight which you have brought upon her ; until you know what we think of men who marry women for their wealth , and afterward crush their hearts by all the mean cruelties of neglect and coldness ; who cease to act out their lying promises at the altar as soon as the money is in their hands . We think that such a man is a meaner thing than the sneak thief that infests our streets ; and a title of nobility is quite as appropriate for one as for the other . It was to tell you that my home is no longer your home that I wished to speak with you to-night . PRINCE . What you and your people may think does not interest me . The opinions of American are indifferent to me ; and as to your American women  --  STOCKTON . Be on your guard , sir . PRINCE .  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have honored one of them by making her the Princess von Haldenwald . As to her , you may leave my wife and my relations to her out of this question . That is not what has brought us together to-night . STOCKTON . If you so much as whisper a thought of any other cause  --  PRINCE . I need not whisper it ; we both know it . STOCKTON . We  --  both  --  know  --  nothing , sir . ( Clasping his hands behind him , as if controlling his rising anger with difficulty . ) PRINCE . You gave up your trip to Harrisburg to-night , and you afterward sent for me . It was not my wife that asked you to remain ; and you will please not mention her again . I will not tolerate it . It is not my wife that needs your protection . STOCKTON . Damn you ! ( Springing at his throat . The Prince meets the shock firmly ; but the savage impulse of Stockton bears him down , over table , on which he is pressed back ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one strong effort ; swings his arm around and strikes the dirk into Stockton 's side . Stockton , with a sharp cry , and as if nerved to greater effort by the blow , makes a quick movement and brings the Prince down before him , turning to L. C. as he does so ; grasps the Prince 's throat tightly in his clenched fingers ; staring into his face , and speaking through his teeth . ) Serpent ! You will never utter another hiss . ( He stands glaring down into his face . The Prince 's arms drop listlessly . He is slowly choking . A half-suppressed scream , as if from a woman trying to catch her voice . Stockton looks up . Diana steps in , L. 1 E. , weak and staggering , her arms raised to check him . Stockton looks fixedly at her a moment ; then down at the Prince 's face ; raises it , toward his own , still pressing his throat and staring with tightly pressed lips at the closing eyes . Then , with a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves up to mantel L. C. , where he stands looking down into the fire , with his hands clasped behind his head and his back to audience . The Prince almose lifeless , wavers a moment on his feet and drops into chair R. C. , front . Diana stands L. , with her eyes fixed on him . After a moment , the Prince begins to show signs of returning life . Diana then glances at Stockton and drops into chair L. , her face falling upon the back of the chair , into her arms . The Prince slowly regains full consciousness ; gradually gaining control of himself ; then starts to his feet with a look of dogged determination in his face . ) PRINCE . You will not fight me , like a gentleman ? STOCKTON . I have not killed you ; that is my answer . PRINCE . These Americans are barbarians . STOCKTON . Yes ! ( Moving down to near Diana ; glances down at her , then looks at the Prince . ) We are barbarians ; and we have preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom you and we alike descended . Like them , we still protect , by physical force  --  direct , simple and deadly  --  the honor of our women . We want neither you nor your influence here . I have already told you that my house is no longer your home . Go ! PRINCE . You will pardon me for intruding upon your time at present for one moment longer . But I owe you an apology . I should not have taken a weapon in my hand , when you were unarmed . ( Diana raises her head suddenly , with an anxious look . ) I can only say that the emergency of the moment made me forget myself . It was quite inexcusable , however ; and I sincerely trust you are not dangerously wounded . DIANA . Wounded ! STOCKTON . I have not felt it . PRINCE . I hope it will not be serious . ( Walks up C. ) Good night . STOCKTON . Good night . ( Exit in hall to L. Stockton walks across and drops into chair at table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Rising . ) Is he wounded ?  --  and I hardly dare speak to him . Husband ! ( Starting a step toward Stockton , her arm raised ; stops suddenly watching his action . He opens his waistcoat and places his hand to his side , withdraws it , glances at the inside of his hand , takes out his handkerchief and places it under the waistcoat at his side . ) You are wounded ! STOCKTON . Yes ; wounded . ( Raising his hand and holding her away from him . ) But it is not the wound he gave me that pains . ( She sinks to the floor , and drags herself to him , laying her head upon his foot , and clinging to him . He looks down at her a moment ; then lifts her head to his knee , and is stroking her head tenderly , as the curtain descends . ) ( CURTAIN . ) ACT IV . SCENE .  --  Same as that of Act III . It is now daylight ; afternoon . The portieres all drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine through the glass . The sun also pours through the window in hall at back . Street scene , in spring , beyond . The corridor out L. as bright as possible , with stand of flowers or bric-a-brac . No fire . Armchair L. C. , near lower end of fender . Armchair down R. C. The small table with bell up stage , R. C. , in angle between central door and conservatory . DISCOVERED  --  SHERIDAN STOCKTON . He is seated R. C. , astride of a chair , his elbows on the back of it , and his face on his hand ; looking straight ahead , in a brown study , afternoon calling dress . Enter GRIMTHORPE C. , from hall R. he comes down . GRIMTHORPE . Mr. Sheridan ! The coachman h'asks pardon and ' e wishes to know as w'ether it was three or ' arf-past three as you vished the carriage h'at the door . ( Waits a second ; looks down inquiringly . Sheridan looks steadily before him . ) Mr. Sheridan ! If you please , Mr. Sheridan ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come h'at three and vait h'until Mr. Sheridan recovers . ( Turning up C. Enter the Marquis , L. 1 E. ) MARQUIS . Ah ! Grimthorpe ! ( Grimthorpe stops in hall . ) Has Mr. Stockton returned yet ? GRIMTHORPE . No , sir . MARQUIS . As soon as he does so kindly let me know , and say to him that I should like to see him a moment . GRIMTHORPE . Yes , sir . ( Exit in hall to L. ) MARQUIS . Good afternoon , Sheridan . I dare say you are settled by this time , after your voyage . ( Sees that Sheridan does not hear him ; then moves to mantel ; takes a society paper ; opens paper ; looks over it at Sheridan ; turns up stage as if going . ) SHERIDAN . Damn ! MARQUIS . ( Stopping R. C. ) Quite so ; a condensed version of Hamlet 's soliloquy . SHERIDAN . ( Looking around . ) If Hamlet had been in my place he would n't have hesitated long enough about suicide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; facing the Marquis . ) I 'm in a box . MARQUIS . Box ? SHERIDAN . And the lid is shut down tight . I landed in New York last evening , and of course I must call upon Miss Tenny Laurence this afternoon ; I 've ordered the carriage for that purpose . MARQUIS . I suspected there would be trouble on this side of the ocean when I last saw you in London . SHERIDAN . I remember ; at the Flower Show . Was n't that a pretty little English girl I was with ? She 's lovely , Marquis . I 'm engaged to her . MARQUIS . In England ; but in America  --  SHERIDAN . I 'm engaged to Miss Tenny Laurence . That 's the box I 'm in . MARQUIS . Three is an awkward number in a private box . You returned to New York by way of Paris ? SHERIDAN . Yes ; and sailed from Havre . MARQUIS . The Duc de Vigny-Volante returned on the same steamer with you last evening , you told me . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York ? SHERIDAN . The Imperial . MARQUIS . Thank you . I will call on him this afternoon . SHERIDAN . He 'll probably drop in here . MARQUIS . I dare say . Did you meet your sister 's husband , the Prince von Haldenwald , in Paris ? SHERIDAN . Oh , yes  --  the next day after his duel with the Duc de Vigny-Volante . They were together . MARQUIS . No harm came to either from their duel , I understood . SHERIDAN . They both looked better for it . MARQUIS . And better friends than ever , I dare say . SHERIDAN . Apparently . ( Rising ; takes chair up R. C. ) MARQUIS . That 's one good thing about the duelling system in France ; it does cement the bonds of friendship . SHERIDAN . ( Turning abruptly ) It was n't my fault , Marquis  --  falling in love with another girl when I was engaged to Tenny . She was three thousand miles away ; and I saw Fanny  --  MARQUIS . Her name is Fanny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What makes this matter worse for me now is this : Since that time my letters to Tenny have been more warmly and deeply affectionate than they ever were before . MARQUIS . Of course ; necessarily . A clear conscience is never so ardent as a troubled one . SHERIDAN . It was n't that . But I could n't write my own love letters to Tenny after I fell in love with the other girl . Somehow my pen would n't work . MARQUIS . Your conscience gave you more trouble than I thought . It was impertinent . SHERIDAN . Yet I could n't stop the letters altogether suddenly , so I engaged a private secretary  --  one of the poor students at Oxford . He wrote them on a typewriter , and I copied them . Unfortunately for me , he is ambitious to be the Poet Laureate of England some day , and it was too good a chance for him to lose . My letters to Tenny have been perfect love poems since I 've been engaged to another girl . When I meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean breast of it or I must talk up to those letters . Now , I ca n't talk poetry ; never could . I must take my chances on telling the truth , and it troubles me . MARQUIS . That would trouble any man . You are worse off than I am . SHERIDAN . Than you ? MARQUIS . I became engaged yesterday afternoon to an elderly New York widow . She is quite equal to two young girls  --  SHERIDAN . In weight and years ? MARQUIS . Yes ; but not so inconvenient . My second Marchioness  --  SHERIDAN . I remember the portrait of the first Marchioness , in Normandale House . MARQUIS . Yes ? ( Aside . ) Poor , dear Flossie ! ( Aloud . ) The second Marchioness will be different . SHERIDAN . I congratulate you . MARQUIS . Thank you . ( Moving down R. , aside . ) She will never be able to kick so high as poor , dear Flossie could . ( Exit L. 1 E. ) SHERIDAN . Poor Tenny ! How I pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a light glove . ) But I 'm doing the best I can for the dear girl . I 've put on my last London suit . I could n't do less than that for Tenny . Poor girl ! it 'll be bad enough for her , anyway . I 'm doing the best I can for her . ( Taking up a glossy silk hat . The front door bell . Sheridan is walking up . Grimthorpe passes in hall toward door , which he opens . A footman hands him cards ; he nods and footman retires . ) Is my carriage at the door , yet , Grimthorpe ? GRIMTHORPE . Yes , sir ; just drew up . SHERIDAN . Whose cards are those ? ( Indifferently buttoning his glove . ) GRIMTHORPE . ( Reading card . ) " Mrs. Laurence " ( Sheridan looks up suddenly , listening . ) " Miss Laurence , " and  --  ( Sheridan turns and starts down for the door L. 1 E. , with long strides . Exit . Grimthorpe looks after him as he disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenny and the Earl ; they come down . Mrs. Laurence , C. , Tenny and Earl R. C. Grimthorpe closes door and steps in . ) Mrs. Stockton was h'expecting you , Mrs. Laurence . MRS . LAURENCE . Yes ; I sent her a note this morning . GRIMTHORPE . She wished me to show you to the library at once , if you called . MRS . LAURENCE . Ah ! ( Then to Tenny and Earl . ) She did n't know that you would be with me , children . It is about matters of charity , in which we are both interested . Amuse yourselves . I will return in a few moments , children . ( She goes up and out , in hall to L. ) TENNY . Grimthorpe ! ( He stops as he is about to follow Mrs. Laurence . ) Mr. Sheridan Stockton arrived from Europe last evening , I believe ; is he at home ? GRIMTHORPE . My h'impression h'is , ' e is not at ' ome . TENNY . Did you receive that impression recently ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earl of Caryston-Leigh and Miss Laurence desire to see him . GRIMTHORPE . Yes , miss . ( Exit . ) TENNY . If mamma had heard of Sheridan 's arrival she would n't have let us come in with her . EARL . Do n't you think I 'd better go out and sit in the carriage while you meet Sheridan ? TENNY . No , Regy . I am especially anxious that you should be present at our first meeting . Reginald ! We are approaching a crisis in our lives . My mamma sent me to London , Regy , to be with your mamma and you . After my return , your mamma sent you to New York , to be with my mamma and me . I have found you extremely useful to me , Regy . A tall , handsome young English Earl is a great convenience to a girl . I have decided to keep you in the family . EARL . Y-e-s ? TENNY . Regy , dear , the other day you saved my life , when the horses ran away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never referred to the incident since  --  but I told you , I  --  I loved you . ( Resting her hand on his , and looking up into his face . ) EARL . I said something , too . ( Putting his arm about her . ) TENNY . The confession was mutual ; we love each other , Regy . EARL . It 's awfully unfair to Sheridan ; and he and I were such good friends . It 's rough on a man for another fellow to save the life of the girl he 's engaged to . I 'm sorry I did it . TENNY . Reginald ! EARL . I mean  --  but , of course , if I had n't saved your life  --  that would be rough on him , too . How are you going to explain it to him , Tenny ? TENNY . You dear , silly boy ! A girl never " explains " to a young man ; she always makes him explain to her . That 's the reason I wish you to be present when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should hear the apology he will offer to me for my breaking off our engagement . ( Enter SHERIDAN L. 1 E. He stops L. ) Sheridan ! ( He starts suddenly across , front , to her . She draws up slightly , extending her hand . He stops , looking at her ; takes her , hand quietly ; drops it . A second 's awkward pause . He glances at Earl ; puts up his glass and walks to him with his English manner . ) SHERIDAN . Regy !  --  glad to see you  --  quite so , I 'm sure . EARL . Thank you ; very glad . I think I 'll go and  --  ( Turning up . ) TENNY . No ! ( He turns back and walks to mantel , up L. C. ) I wish to speak with you , Sheridan . ( Sitting R. ) SHERIDAN . Certainly . ( Moves down and sits L. C. Aside ) The box is getting uncomfortable . TENNY . When I left England , Sheridan , we were engaged to be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot box . TENNY . Your letters to me  --  EARL . I think I 'd better  --  ( Starts again . ) TENNY . Oh , no , I will be brief . ( The Earl returns to mantel . ) You wrote to me about boxing matches  --  and football  --  and rowing ; more especially about a large bulldog , named Tiger Lily , that was always with you . SHERIDAN . ( Eagerly ) He is a splendid dog ! You ought to see him , Tenny . You shall . I brought him over with me . He could whip any dog within thirty miles of Oxford , and once I matched him against the Bowlegged Terror in London . TENNY . ( Euthusiastically ) That sounds like one of your old love letters , Sheridan . But about four months ago there was a sudden change . SHERIDAN . ( Aside ) That infernal poet . TENNY . I have missed the bulldog . Your last letter to me was a poem in prose . Thinking I might see you to-day I brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I also brought the one which immediately preceded it . ( Rises , crosses and gives him letters . ) They are identically the same ; word for word . SHERIDAN . By Jove ! ( Starting to his feet ; looking at the two letters . ) I copied the same one twice . TENNY . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! SHERIDAN . Tenny ! TENNY . Sheridan ! SHERIDAN . I fell in love with some one else . TENNY . Did you think I did n't know it as soon as the letters came without any bulldog in ' em ? So did I , Sheridan ! SHERIDAN . You ! Glory ! TENNY . That is what I fell in love with . ( Pointing to the Earl . ) SHERIDAN . Regy , old boy ! ( Taking his hands cordially . ) TENNY . Come , Regy !  --  we 'll wait for mamma in the carriage . Come and see us , Sheridan ; and bring the bulldog . ( Exit through hall door , R. ) SHERIDAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , Regy ; we 'll paint the Western Hemisphere red . EARL . Y-e-s . ( Going ) I 'd like to see America when it 's that color . ( Exit after Tenny . ) SHERIDAN . You shall see it ; we paint the whole planet red . ( Speaking after him ; closes the door and turns down stage . The Marquis appears in hall from L. ; light overcoat , hat , gloves , &c.); Bless the dear old Dowager Countess , his mother !  --  that sent him to New York . She 's got there . MARQUIS . You are out of that box , apparently . SHERIDAN . Yes ! I 'll send a cable to Fanny . We 'll be married as soon as I can get back to England . ( Exit L. 1 E. ) MARQUIS . He 's going to get into another box . So am I. I must call on the elderly widow . Of course I must see her at least once a day  --  until we are married . ( Moves to front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering . The Marquis steps back . ) Mr. Stockton ! Pardon me . STOCKTON . And me , Marquis . ( The Marquis walks partly down L. C. ) You have saved me the trouble of finding the keyhole . ( Taking off his overcoat . Grimthorpe steps in from L. , helping him . ) Although that , I am pleased to say , never bothers me very much . ( Handing his hat to Grimthorpe and moving down R. C. Exit Grimthorpe , L. ) MARQUIS . I am glad to see you a moment , Mr. Stockton ; tried to do so this morning , but you had left the house . STOCKTON . Can I be of service to you ? MARQUIS . Not in the usual way . I have been enjoying your hospitality in New York  --  very much , indeed  --  for several weeks , Mr. Stockton , and  --  STOCKTON . Delighted , I 'm sure . I shall never forget your own hospitality to me , in London . ( Bowing . ) MARQUIS . ( Also bowing . ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to you . Mr. Stockton , for certain kindnesses , in a financial way , which you have extended to me ; and to say that I have written , this morning , to my agent all the necessary legal arrangements to satisfy the mortgages which you hold , upon my various estates in England and to pay in full the bills of credit in your hands . I shall enclose to him the necessary drafts upon my banker in a very short time . STOCKTON . Is the name of the lady a secret ? MARQUIS . Not at all . Mrs. Montgomery Parkins . STOCKTON . Jonathan M. Parkins &; Co . I remember her late husband . He made a large fortune in  --  MARQUIS . Lard . I shall honor his memory by marrying his widow . But the old girl  --  ( Checks himself . ) Mrs. Parkins  --  Eliza  --  is now expecting me . ( Walks up ; turns . ) If you should desire a more extended acquaintance in the aristocratic society of Europe , Mr. Stockton  --  STOCKTON . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be delighted to see you , at the home of my  --  of our  --  ancestors . ( Then half aside as he continues up stage . ) Eliza has taken us all , alive and dead . ( Exit by front door in hall , to R. ) STOCKTON . Those old family portraits in Normandale House will stare at Widow Parkins . They thought I was bad enough . ( Walking L. Enter Diana from up L. , in hall . Walks down R. C. ) DIANA . Jefferson ! STOCKTON . Ah  --  Diana DIANA . I saw you returning , from the window of the library . STOCKTON . Were you watching for me ? DIANA . I  --  I was looking out , while Mrs. Laurence was talking to me . She has called about a charity she is very deeply interested in . STOCKTON . Are you interested in it ? DIANA . Yes ; very much . STOCKTON . Subscribe any amount you wish . DIANA . Your purse is always open to me . But , this time , the amount is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like ; I 'll make you a check at once . DIANA . Thank you . STOCKTON . Is that all , Diana ? Merely " thank you . " You have never once spoken a warmer word than that , nor offered me one caress  --  since  --  since  --  DIANA . Since  --  that night . STOCKTON . Five weeks ago . Since that night ! You then returned to your own apartment , almost in silence . I heard nothing but a half suppressed sob , as you left me . DIANA . You have not been to my apartment since then . STOCKTON . I have waited to be asked into it again . DIANA . I knew that , Jefferson . You were waiting . STOCKTON . It has been sacred ground to me . DIANA . Waiting for me to call you . STOCKTON . I have waited in vain . Have I been less tender to you than before ?  --  less gentle  --  or less willing to return your affection ? DIANA . No . But I , too , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask ; for something more than the manly tenderness of a forgiving husband . I was received back to my duty as a wife , gently and lovingly ; generously . I should have accepted the situation  --  gratefully . But we women are not logical creatures , you know . My own conscience has made me feel that there was still a lurking suspicion of me in your heart , Jefferson . I have waited for the sign that it was dead . I have waited for the old passionate cry of the lover that I never missed before . A woman never mistakes any other sound for that ; and she knows the look that goes with it , in the eyes of the man she loves . Oh ! How quickly I will spring into your arms !  --  if I ever hear that cry from your heart again . STOCKTON . You do not understand me , Diana , when you think there is still suspicion in my heart . Have you forgotten what I am ?  --  a natural animal  --  tamed  --  civilized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kill my enemy that night ? My fingers were on his throat , and his last breath had come . I was killing him . Why did I not ? When I looked up and saw you , the convivction came  --  swift as a stroke of lightning  --  to my mind  --  absolute and final  --  that you were pure ; that you were true to me . The reason for killing him was gone ; and I flung him aside . Suspicion ! No ! There is no middle ground . Absolute faith , now !  --  it is all I know . Diana ! ( Eagerly and impulsively , with a step toward her , extending his arms . ) DIANA . Ah ! I have heard it again ! It is the cry of the lion to its mate . ( Springing into his arms ; drops her head on his shoulder , her arms about his neck ; and he enfolds her in a strong embrace . ) STOCKTON . My  --  wife ! ( She throws back her head ; looking him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself and moves down L. ; stops and looks back . ) STOCKTON . I am still waiting . DIANA . Come ! ( Exit L. 1 E. He follows her out . The electric doorbell is heard . Grimthorpe passes in hall from L. ; opens door . Enter Stuyvesant Laurence  --  he turns quietly and hands card to Grimthorpe . ) STUYVESANT . Mrs. Stockton and the Princess von Haldenwald ; are they both at home ? GRIMTHORPE . Yes , sir . ( Stuyvesant moves down . Grimthorpe goes out L. , in hall . ) STUYVESANT . I really hope the ladies wo n't keep me long . ( Looks at his watch . ) I 've barely time for my appointment at the club with Fred Merryfield . Stockton has a beautiful place , here , not unlike the Count Ladislas Mendorff 's house in Vienna . ( Looking about as he speaks , turns up stage ; glances into conservatory and hall up C. Moves to mantel up L. C. ) I wonder how long Fred will wait for me . I ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall hardly get out to the Country Club in time for dinner . ( Sees a photograph on mantel . ) The Princess Virginia von Haldenwald . Not quite the same as when I last saw her ; but a very good likeness . ( Lightly turns away , looking casually about , at ceiling , &c.; He stops suddenly R. C. looking down , then looks up across at the mantel ; recrosses and stands looking at the picture . He takes it in his hand ; looks down at it a moment , then , with deep earnestness , ) Am I so indifferent as I thought I was ? ( He is still looking at the picture as Mrs. Laurence enters L. 1 E. She is passing up ; stops C. ) MRS . LAURENCE . Stuyvevsant ! You here ? STUYVESANT . Mother ! I have called to see Mrs. Stockton and the Princess von Haldenwald . ( Returns the photograph and moves down L. C. ) MRS . LAURENCE . ( Aside . ) He was looking at Virginia 's picture . ( Enter GRIMTHORPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Er ' ighness , the Princess von Haldenwald , will see you at once , sir . Mrs. Stockton sends her compliments and wishes to be excused . MRS . LAURENCE . ( To Grimthorpe ) Where is my daughter , Grimthorpe , and the Earl of Caryston-Leigh ? I left them here . GRIMTHORPE . They are in the carriage at the door , ma'am , waiting for you . MRS . LAURENCE . Oh ! ( Exit Grimthorpe L. , in hall . ) Stuyvesant ! I thought you were to drive out to Westchester this afternoon with a coaching party . STUYVESANT . Yes . I dropped in here for a few moments on my way . I have not paid my respects to Mrs. Stockton and the Princess since my return from Europe , two weeks ago . MRS . LAURENCE . My son ! ( Moving to him . ) Make this call as short as you possibly can . STUYVESANT . Why , mother ? MRS . LAURENCE . I need not answer that ; you know why I ask it . Since your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt  --  that  --  you were not  --  the same . STUYVESANT . Did you expect to find me the same ? You  --  mother ? ( Looking at her , she drops her head . ) But we need not remind each other of the past . MRS . LAURENCE . Your life abroad has changed you . STUYVESANT . Yes ; for the worse . You have heard a hard , metallic ring in my character . It is n't a pleasant sound , even to a man himself . But why should you be troubled ? Virginia Stockton is now a married woman ; and I  --  MRS . LAURENCE . Yes , Stuyvesant ! ( Placing her hand on his arm . ) She is a married woman . STUYVESANT . I understand you . You think that my life abroad has changed me . What did you expect , mother ? You wished me to go into the very highest society there . I have done so . You were pleased  --  were you not ?  --  when you heard of your son in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish ; and I have left nothing undone to make myself one of them ; and yet you remind me now that the marriage of a woman is a thing for men to respect . I did so once , but I have been polished abroad . Are n't you proud of me ? ( She looks down a moment ; touches her eyes . ) MRS . LAURENCE . Do n't talk to me like that , Stuyvesant . STUYVESANT . Mother ! ( He kisses her ; she turns up stage and goes out silently in hall , and through the front door R. Stuyvesant walks R. in thought . ) Should I come to this house at all ? Can I trust myself ? ( Enter VIRGINIA , L. 1 E. She crosses directly to him from door , extending her hand simply and frankly . ) VIRGINIA . I am sincerely glad to see you again , Stuyvesant . STUYVESANT . Thank you . VIRGINIA . You returned to New York about two weeks ago . ( Dropping into seat R. and indicating the seat L. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourgogne  --  from France . ( Sitting L. C. ) VIRGINIA . Your mother told us that you bore the journey well . We all felt anxious for you after your long illness at the Chateau of the Duc de Vigny-Volante . STUYVESANT . Octave and his sister Adele cared for me as if I were a member of the family . If he had been my own brother he could not have done more for me ; and as to Adele herself , she might have been a professional nurse for her skill ; with all the delicacy and gentleness of her high rank . VIRGINIA . The Duc sent me a picture of his sister . ( Rising and moving to table up R. C. ) Here it is . ( She moves down with a small album to near Stuyvesant . He has risen ; she hands him the album . ) Be seated . ( He resumes his seat . ) Is it a good one ? STUYVESANT . Fairly . The wealth of golden hair is merely indicated , of course ; and it lacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have known her tenderness and care . There was a light in her eyes , too , which can have no reflection except in my own heart . VIRGINIA . In your own heart . We have all thought that your heart would become interested there . We  --  we have  --  hoped so . STUYVESANT . You have  --  hoped for it ? VIRGINIA . Yes ; sincerely and truly . Stuyvesant !  --  you will let me call you that  --  still  --  wo n't you ? STUYVESANT . Anything else would sound strangely to me on your lips . VIRGINIA . Adele 's brother told me how beautiful and gentle she was . He told me , also , that it would not be unpleasing to him if  --  if the accident which had brought you together so closely should bring you to  --  to love each other . STUYVESANT . ( Looking at her picture . ) I do love her . VIRGINIA . The tone in which you spoke of her as you looked down at that picture had already told me that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you now . Our separation , Stuyvesant , was brought about by others : but , all the same , I did you a great wrong . I know what a shock you received when you arrived in England last year , and how wretched you were for a time . The knowledge of that has borne heavily upon my conscience , and since my own marriage I have never known perfect peace until this moment . With all sincerity , Stuyvesant  --  with the true interest in your welfare that a sister might feel  --  I wish you lifelong happiness  --  with  --  her . STUYVESANT . I  --  I thank you , Virginia . ( Looking down at the picture ; then closes the album and returns it to her . ) I selected a wedding present for Adele yesterday at Tiffany 's . VIRGINIA . You must show it to me . STUYVESANT . I will . She is to be married to a young French nobleman . ( Virginia starts slightly , looks down at him a moment , then walks across to table up R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was sharply that of a good woman , whose own love already belonged to another . ( Virginia glances around at him and moves down R. C. ) VIRGINIA . Pardon me , I misunderstood you . STUYVESANT . She helped to bring back to life a man whose life was worthless to himself . However much I appreciate her kindness  --  and I do love her for that  --  I can hardly thank her for it  --  she was not so kind to me as she thought . ( Rising . ) I told you that her picture lacked many things which I could see in her face . There is another picture of a woman  --  here . There is more in her face , also , than the sun could put there ; more , for me , than the greatest artist that ever lived could have expressed . Her face was before me when I left New York and when I arrived in England . VIRGINIA . Do not speak of that , now , Stuyvesant . ( Sinking into chair R. C. ) STUYVESANT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . ) That would be ungenerous and unfair . You have just told me that the knowledge of what I suffered has borne upon your conscience ; it should not . Others were guilty ; not you  --  nor I. ( Then , with sudden energy ) But when I landed in England and was told  --  VIRGINIA . Stuyvesant ! I beg of you again ; do not speak of that . STUYVESANT . You have brought the memory of what I suffered back to me ; I can not be silent . I had one great consolation from the first  --  I knew that you were wretched , too . You have sympathized with me ; you have tried to hope that I would forgot . You have tried to rest contented in the thought that I had found happiness in another love . I have been selfish ! I am selfish now ! The one thing that has made life worth living , for me , has been the knowledge  --  for I do know it  --  that you have suffered too . I am still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am speaking the honest truth . I love you now as I did then , and I thank God !  --  I know that you love me . VIRGINIA . ( She starts firmly to her feet , rising to her full dignity and looking him in the face ; then gently and with sadness ) You speak those words to me , Stuyvesant , knowing they dishonor me and yourself , for I am bound to another . Perhaps you have a right to do it . I did you a great wrong . But it grieves me to hear you . This is the man I  --  once  --  loved . No !  --  it is not ! My memory of him is sacred , and I can think of what he was , as a woman may think  --  without sin  --  of her dead lover . ( Stuyvesant sinks into the chair L. C. ) This is another man ; a man who has learned , in other countries , to despise my sex . I am a Princess in a great European family ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher title . ( Moves to him . ) Oh  --  Stuyvesant !  --  let me be a queen again , for you , at least . Take back those words . Deny that you ever spoke them . Do not leave it impossible for us to be friends again ; the best of friends ! STUYVESANT . Forgive me , Virginia . ( His head bowed . ) Forgive me ! ( Enter STOCKTON up C. in hall , from L. He hesitates slightly as he sees Stuyvesant . ) STOCKTON . Stuyvesant ! ( Advances to meet him , down R. ) STUYVESANT . Mr. Stockton ! STOCKTON . ( To Stuyvesant ) I have just received news  --  that may interest you , as well as me . VIRGINIA . News , father ? STOCKTON . Yes . But pardon us a moment , Virginia . ( Apart to Stuyvesant . ) A cable despatch from Paris . ( Handing him a despatch . As he does so the bell is heard . Stuyvesant looks at despatch ; starts ; looking first at Stockton , then at Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duc de Vigny-Volante . ) DUC . ( In hall ; giving cards to Grimthorpe . ) Mr. and Mrs. Stockton , and the Princess von Haldenwald . ( Turns down . ) Ah  --  Mr. Stockton !  --  you are here . ( Grimthorpe disappears L. ) And Stuyvesant ! Mon ami ! I did not find you at your house this morning . STUYVESANT . Duc ! my dear friend ! DUC . And  --  pardon ! Madame la Princesse ! ( Bowing deeply ; Virginia the same . ) VIRGINIA . I am very glad to see you , Duc . STOCKTON . So am I , Duc ; we all are . But  --  but  --  DUC . But  --  you hesitate . There is something  --  STOCKTON . Pardon me . ( Passes him , toward Virginia . The Duc looks after him , inquiringly ; then at Stuyvesant , who stands R. C. , with despatch in his hand . ) DUC . What is it , mon ami ? STUYVESANT . You have arrived here at a peculiar crisis . DUC . Crisis ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist and taking her hand in his . Tenderly . ) The news I have received is from Paris . Your husband , the Prince von Haldenwald  --  VIRGINIA . Well ? ( He rests his hand upon her head as she looks up into his face ; then turns her gently to chair , L. C. , letting her sink into it . ) Father ! STOCKTON . Duc ! You met the Prince in a duel a few days before you returned from Paris . DUC . ( Lightly . ) Oui , ami ; certainement . VIRGINIA . Their duel ? I see ! ( Drops her face into her hands . Stockton glances down at her , and passes across R. ) DUC . But surely  --  a trifle like that  --  Oh ! Monsieur ! Princesse ! You do not think the worse of me for that ? The Prince and I are better friends than ever . The little affair was necessary to the continuance of our friendship . A word dropped from my lips  --  by accident ; but I could not explain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too sincerely not to fight under the circumstances . But we dined together on the same evening . The point of my weapon reached him ! ( Touching his breast . ) I also received a scratch . ( Touching his wrist . ) But it was nothing . The night before I sailed Emil took supper with me at my home , in Paris . The Prince sent his kindest wishes to you all and a message to the Princess . I am the bearer . STOCKTON . The Prince 's wound has proved more serious than you thought , Duc . DUC . His wound ? It was not quite healed when we parted ; nor mine  --  but  --  you have heard from him ? ( Looking from Stockton to Stuyvesant . The latter hands him the open despatch and moves across up L. C. The Duc looks at despatch , drops it . Enter DIANA , L. 1 E. , now in a tea gown . ) DIANA . Oh ! Duc ! I am glad . DUC . Madame !  --  I  --  I greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same moment . DIANA . You  --  DUC . I can not say more . ( Diana looks at Stockton inquiringly , joining him , R. ) Madame la Princesse ! I brought a message to you ; but I need not deliver it now . Adieu ! ( Turns up stage C. to doorway , just beyond the threshold . ) Emil !  --  in heaven ! My friend ! I am separated from your wife , forever . ( Exit through door R. Stuyvesant stands near Virginia , looking down at her . ) STOCKTON . Diana ! The shadow of European aristocracy has passed away from our home ! Back matter ( CURTAIN. )
