DIRECTLY after the nomination of General Garfield for the Presidency , it was arranged between him and me that I should write a life of him , to be published by the Messrs . Harper &amp; Brothers . I had then been on intimate terms with the General for all of seventeen years , during nearly the whole of which time I had been gathering material for a biography of him , to be written at some subsequent period ; but when I set about the actual writing of the book , I found that my work would be greatly facilitated if it had his active help and supervision . Accordingly , I went to his home at Mentor , Ohio , submitted to him the proofs of what I had already written , and secured from him such additional facts as seemed to be necessary . These facts he communicated to me orally , in the presence of a stenographer , who took down his every word as it was uttered . The substance o* a part of what he then dictated  --  but not the whole-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thought that an exact report of all that he said may be of interest to the public . It is consequently here given , in his own language , and without any alteration from the colloquial style in which it was delivered . The only change I have felt at liberty to make in the stenographic report , has been the striking out of some of the questions by which I led him upon different branches of his subject . EDMUND KIRKE . I. COIiGRESSIONAL CAREER . When I went into Congress the war was still raging . I wanted to go back into the army . After Rosecrans 's removal , Thomas , who was a very dear friend of mine , was exceedingly anxious to have me come back , and tendered me in a private letter the command of an army corps if I would go . He had become the head of the whole army , you know . I very much wanted to go back , but Mr. Lincoln made a personal point of my taking my seat in the House of Representatives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress was very small , and there was great doubt whether we could certainly carry the necessary measures ; and in the next place , he was greatly lacking in men of military experience in the House , to regulate the legisla // tion about the army . So I went in , and was immediately put upon the Military Committee . In time of peace Ways and Means and Appropriations are the most important of the committees , and the Military is rather a Aecoration than an influential committee . But in the war the Military Cizmmittee was way up above any others in importance , and my position on it , as practically acquainted with the wants of the army , called me into immediate requisition , giving me a prominence in the House in the beginning that I could not possibly have had in any other way . The first speech I made was on the 26th of January , 1864 , . on a bill for the confiscation of rebel property . There are portions of that which you will probably think it best to print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mind , and the character of my speaking . I was the youngest member in either branch of Congress at that time , as I had been the youngest member of the Ohio Legislature , and the youngest Brigadier General in the army . That speech is probably an exhibition of what I was when I got there , and it shows my growth at that time . Then immediately followed the great war legislation  --  the question was whether we should continue the work of offering large bounties , and getting bounty-jumpers and poor fellows . When they were passing a bill to offer more bounties , I voted alone on the ayes and noes against it , to the amazement of everybody who wanted to be friendly with the soldiers . The reason I assigned was that the policy was ruinous , would not get us more men , and would simply cost us money . In a crisis like that , I said , the nation had a right to the service of its children ; and it had a right , therefore , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the draft , to put just as many citizens into the field as ' it needed . A few months afterwards , when the bounty system actually broke down , the whole Congress came to my view . In the course of that Congress I made a speech in favor of a draft law . We were in a desperate strait . It was a very solemn moment . Mr. Lincoln came to the Committee , and told us , what we did not dare to tell the House , that in so many months , not far ahead , the term of 380,000 men would expire . The army was about three-quarters of a million , and the term of enlistment of ' nearly one-half-say , forty per cent. - would expire in about a hundred days . " Now , " he said , " unless I can replace those men , we not only can not push this Rebellion , but we can not even stand // where we are ; Sherman will have to come back from Atlanta , and McClellan retire from the Peninsula ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks . " His Republican friends expostulated with him ; said that it was right on the eve of his re-election , and that the country would not stand it ; that men who had already paid large sums in bounties , to get men to serve in their stead , * .  --  and to raise the quotas of different places ,  --  would not now submit to be drafted ; that it would raise a storm and tempest , and the Democracy would carry the country . Mr. Lincoln raised himself up to his full height , as he answered : " It is not necessary for me to be re-elected ; but it is necessary that I should put down this Rebellion . Give me that law , and I will put it down before my successor takes his seat . " Thereupon we took a bill for a draft into the House , and it was defeated two to one-all the Democrats and enough of our people to make a two-thirds opposition voted it down . I moved to reconsider the vote , and made a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can be found in the Congres8ional Globe , sometime in the Thirty-eighth Congress-I think in the month of July , 1864 . In it I said to the House that , in my judgment , they had voted to abandon the contest and give up the Union ; and I went on to show them how they were doing it . Question. - " Did you carry the draft law on this reconsideration ? " Answer. - We carried the draft law on that reconsideration ; and Lincoln drafted for 500,000 men . Question. - " Then it was in consequence of your motion that the law was carried ? " Answer. -I ca n't take the entire credit of it , because General Schenck was the Chairman of the Committee ; but I stood in the breach , and made a large number whose re-election was then pending furious . They feared that if they voted for it they might have to face an angry constituency . I made myself then somewhat unpopular by a rather reckless defiance of opinion in the House , so determined was I to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men could value their political lives a moment in such a crisis . After a debate of several weeks the draft was carried ; and the former law , which permitted commutation in money instead of service under the draft , was repealed by a vote of one hundred to fifty . // After my vote and speech against the bounty law , I received a petition , signed by a number of prominent persons in my district , demanding my resignation , and withdrawing their confidence from me because I had gone against the soldiers and the bounty . I replied to them that I had acted according to my best judgment of the needs of the country , was sorry that it did not agree with theirs , but as between their opinion and my own , I was compelled to follow my own , and I expected to live till they confessed to me that I was right and they were wrong . Before many years I had letters from every signer of that petition expressing regret that he had signed it , and saying he then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Thirty-eighth Congress expired , on the 4th of March , 1865 . When the Thirty-ninth Congress assembled in December , 1865 , the Speaker of the House Colfax came to me , and asked if I had any request to make about the make-up of the committees ; and I surprised him by saying that I had one , and that was that I might be left off the Military Committee . The war was over , but it was still an immense committee , because the war had to be settled , the army reorganized , rank adjusted , and all that sort of thing . It was considered as by all odds the post affording the most brilliant opportunity . Well , " he said , " that is the most remarkable request I ever heard ; but if you do n't want the post , there are dozens back from the war who do ? What do you want ? " I said , " I would like to go on a committee where I can study finance . That is soon to be the great question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Means just when we were beginning to handle those great dry questions of detail about tariff , taxation , currency , and the public debt , and I then laid myself out to study very thoroughly the history of English finance during the Napoleonic wars . I went over the speeches and the writers of that time , and then traced the subject through our own Revolutionary time , Hamilton 's time , and Jackson 's time until I had made a very thorough study of it , taking copious notes of what I read as I went along . I kept very quiet for a time while studying these subjects , but , at last , in 1866 , I broke ground with a speech in favor of returning to specie payments . About that time the Committee of Ways and Means was divided into three committees-Ways and Means proper , Appropriations , // and Banking and Currency , and I was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency . The great currency struggle-the beginning of Greenbackism , or rather of inflation-came then . It was while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday " occurred  --  the great gold panic . The House directed my Committee to investigate it , and I went to New York to see if I could set forces to work to grapple with those gold gamblers , and get hold of the conspiracy . When I thought I had masVered the elements , I returned to Washington , and summoned man by man the witnesses I wanted , took their testimony , and wrote the report myself . In the next Congress , . I was made Chairman of the Committee of Appropriations , and I held that for four years . All the expenditures of the Government are passed upon by that Committee . On the subject of appropriations I made a speech , in 1872 , entitled " Revenues and Expenditures , " which , whatever I may say about it myself , others said was the first interesting speech that was ever made on that subject . That is , I made what they call in Parliament a " budget speech , " in which I gave the philosophy of expenditures and appropriations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history we could reach a peace level of expen4itures-at what time we could get down so low that we could not get any lower , and the natural growth of the country would require a rise again ; and in forecasting the time I took an immense risk in saying that " at a certain period , so far ahead , it will be found that we shall touch bottom on the scale of reduction , and at that time we shall probably get our interest down to such a figure , and , thereupon and thereafter , the growth of the country will make the peace-increase , starting up again , necessary . " The period I fixed was about the end of 1876 . I wrote an article in the NORTH AMERICA* REVIEW about a year ago on appropriations No. 271 , June , 1879 . In that I quote a passage from this speech , and compare it with the facts to show how near I came to being correct . It was so accurate as to be almost startling . The only difference was it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the figures were almost identical . I made this discovery as the result of an immense induction of reading , that the expenditures of a war could not be reduced so as to strike a peace level until a period after the war twice the length of the war itself . I showed that it was so in England 's wars , and that // it was so in all our wars from the beginning ; that the expenditures rose to their height , of course , at the close of the war . Then they began to drop , drop , drop , and to slope down in an inclined plane , until they struck the new level of peace , where the rise began again , gradually , and that they struck it at a period twice as long after the war as the length of the war itself . Our war was substantially five years long , ending , financially , in 1866 . Add ten years , and you get to 1876 , and I said , " We shall reach our peace level then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the expenses resulting from the war , and the expenses of peace , showing that the peace expenses would increase all the time , growing with the growth of the country , and the war expenses decrease . There were two processes ; but the war was so big that its decrease would be more rapid than the peace increase ; and by and by those two lines would meet , and the sloping incline of peace would come . I got a theory upon it , and ventured to present it , and time showed my theory to be correct . I had served four years on the Committee on Appropriations when the Democrats came into power in the House . I was put , of course , into the minority , and almost immediately there arose the Jeff . Davis amnesty debate-whether Jeff . Davis should be amnestied with the rest . Blame made a speech against it , and Ben Hill made a terrific onslaught upon Blame . I followed , and replied to Hill . That reply made a good deal of impression on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those speeches circulated in the campaign that fall . Near the close of that session of Congress , Lamar , who is a very brilliant man , made a carefully prepared speech , showing why the Democratic party ought to be put in power at the next election , and arraigning the Republican party . That speech was delayed until within two or three days of the adjournment of Congress . The word was passed around , and it was understood among them that Lamar was going to make a speech which would be a great campaign speech , and was to deliver it so late that it could not be replied to . The moment he sat down I rose , and got the floor . It was late in the afternoon , and the House adjourned , but I had the right to the floor the next morning . His speech was withheld , and did not appear in the Record , so that I could not see the full speech . I heard it , and had taken notes , and there was a brief summary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of // August 4th , 1876 , under the caption , " Can the Democratic party be safely intrusted with the administration of the Government ? " I suppose on some accounts that is one of the best speeches I ever made . I think it had more effect , perhaps , on the country . It was made without much preparation . Of course , I worked pretty much all night in preparing the points . But that speech shows my feeling toward the South . I think one of generosity , and yet one of determined , stalwart Republicanism . I think you will find that speech one that you will want to quote largely from , and , perhaps , entire . Then the electoral count came up . Now , it is said I went down to New Orleans as a " visiting statesman . " I went down there , and when Mr. Potter afterwards came to make his investigation he found no fault whatever with me in his report . Nobody charged that I did or said any unjust or unfair thing . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the election in one parish , West Feliciana , and to write out a careful , brief , and judicial statement of the official testimony as to the conduct of the election there , and bring out my 3onclusions , which formed a part of the general report ; but my report on West Feliciana was written separately . In it I analyze the Kuklux Rifle Club 's movements in that parish , which broke up the election , and I confine myself to that ; and I stand on everything I did there as being straight , and true , and fair , and I would stand by it any time . When we got back and the electoral count came up , there was an effort made finally to make this Electoral Commission on the assumption that the Vice-President had not the right to count the vote , but that Congress had the right to count it . I made a speech on the electoral count January 25th , 1877 , in which I took the ground that the Vice-President had the right under the Constitution to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertook to count it ; that Congress was present only as a witness of a great solemn ceremony , but not as an actor ; and I voted against the bill establishing the Electoral Commission , and this speech was leveled against it . I was opposed to it on principle . Question. - " Was the Electoral Bill a suggestion of the Demo-crats ? " Answer. - Certainly , Henry B. Payne was one of the Coinmittee. // Well , I do n't know as I should say it was a suggestion of the Democrats . It may have been suggested by McCreery , of Iowa . He was one of the Committee that got up the bill , but the Democrats joined heartily ; came out and said it was a high patriotic thing to do . It afterwards turned out that they supposed they had got it fixed so that Judge Davis , who had really turned Democrat from being a Republican , would hold the casting vote . Payne afterwards admitted in a speech in Cleveland , that they never would have passed the Electoral Bill if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but just as the Commission was about to be selected from the Supreme Court , Illinois elected Davis as Democratic Senator , and thereupon it became improper to choose him as a representative of the bench ; and they put on the two out and out Democrats that were there , and the three other judges , and those three were Republicans . Well , the Lord came in , you know , just at the proper moment , and removed from the bench just the one man that the Democrats had relied on for the casting vote . Although I had voted against the Electoral Bill , and spoken against it , yet , when it was by common opinion decided that the Republicans should have two from the House , and the Democrats three , the Republicans met and unanimously chose me as the man to represent them ; and then they chose Mr. Hoar . " Well , now , " I said , " you have appointed me to serve in this capacity . I can serve on a committee , though I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . You will find in the volume that records the electoral count , the proceedings of the Commission , which you will find in the Astor Library , as part of the records of the Globe , only in a separate volume . You will find there two opinions delivered by me in my capacity as Commissioner which you had better look over . You may want to print some of them . Then , when Hayes came in , there was that tremendous row in our own party-division from Hayes . Then the attempt of the Potter Committee to investigate Hayes 's title and to turn him out ; and in that we had some fiery talking . In there came a speech on " Louisiana and Pacification. ** I held the role then of trying to protect our party from splitting ; and being the acknowledged leader of the House , I did it by keeping our people for six months from having a caucus , except to meet and choose officers , or something of that sort-from // having a sentimental caucus at all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , I was every time after that unanimously nominated for Speaker of the House by the Republicans and voted for by them . I was voted for three times as Speaker , once after Kerr died and Randall was elected for the short term , then when Randall was elected for the long term , and then for the second term . The tendency of a part of our party to assail Hayes , and denounce him as a traitor , and a man who was going to Johusonize the party , was very strong ; and his defenders were comparatively few for a little while ; but we agreed , a number of us , that we would prevent a row in the party by not having a caucus on any question ; and we did not have one until Potter made his motion for an investigation of Hayes 's title . That united the party almost immediately . Then we called a caucus denouncing the Potter investigation as revolutionary , and we worked harmoniously together , and you have seen how Hayes at last has been restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacificator of the party was very effective , and my speech on " Louisiana Affairs , and the Policy of Pacification , " you will find here , dated February 19th , 1878 . Then , during the whole of 1878 , came the resumption struggle , when the Democrats tried to repeal the law of resumption . About the last thing , you know , the Republicans did before they went out of power was to pass the resumption law  --  the law nearly four years in advance , so as to get ready for it . Of course , the Democrats said it could not be done . Speeches were delivered , essays were written , and reports were made , to show it could not be done . Tilden , in his letter of acceptance , had denounced the Republican party for not having accumulated a reserve of coin for resumption-as much as to say , " Put us into power , and we will resume . " Then we passed the law , and got started on it . Then the Democrats denounced us for hoarding gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man failed anywhere he was " Sherman 's victim , " - " the victim of the Republican party . " The papers were full of it . Those terrible times fell upon us ; and during the whole of the time they continued to denounce us as the cause of their woe . During all that time I stood up and mad.e no concession anywhere . Then came the silver fight with all its ferocity , and in a circle // of nine States around Ohio and including Ohio , I was the only man on either side that voted against the silver bill . All the rest were for trying unlimited silver . I was not opposed to silver , only I wanted it silver that would be equal in value with gold , so that every dollar should be equal before the law . We reached it finally by modification-not unlimited silver , but keeping within limits of so much a month ; and we thus , by having the limitation put on , saved it from utter ruin . Then came the extra session , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speeches on the election law . These are pretty full , and explain themselves . Probably the most effective speeches I have made are there . Then , on the tariff , there is a speech delivered in March , 1878 , that you have not here . That is my fullest speech on the tariff . I went into Congress from an iron district . There are nineteen iron furnaces in my district and a great many rolling mills . My studies led me to believe that , as a mere matter of abstract theory , the doctrine of free trade was the true doctrine ; but that , in a country situated as ours is , free trade was not the thing that could practically work at all , only as we came up to it , through a long series of protections. until , one by one , the various articles of manufacture were so on their feet that they could be liberated and stand the strain alone . In 1866 I made a speech , which you will find in the Record , and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position that I was in favor of that sort of protection that would ultimately lead to liberating , one by one , the articles of free trade ; that I was opposed to prohibitory protection , but was in favor of a tariff high enough for our people fairly to compete and keep the national industries alive , but not so high as to enable the manufacturers to combine and monopolize prices and have no competition from abroad . On that doctrine I launched myself . That doctrine was not satisfactory to the free traders , because they wanted free trade right along , nor was it satisfactory to the extreme protectionists , because they wanted to make just as much money as they could by having the highest possible tariff , and having a monopoly of the business . I was , therefore , denounced by the extreme protectionists as a free trader , and by the free traders as a sort of protectionist . It is the only position in my life where I have stood in the middle between two extremes . I have usually been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the equator , and there insisted that the true doctrine was the point of stable equilibrium , where you could hold a tariff that would not be knocked down every time the free traders got into power and boosted up when the protectionists got into power , but to give the country a stable policy , where the tendency would be toward amelioration all the while . I have held that equitable ground all through , and held it against assaults , now from one side , now from the other , and I esteem it one of the greatest of my achievements in statesmanship to have held that equipoise . You will find the theory of it fully summed up in the speech delivered in March , 1878 , covering the whole subject . There is a speech here , made in 1870 , on the tariff . The historical part of it is the best thing of its kind I have ever done ; that is , the part where I state the policy of England toward the United States , which led to the Revolution , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawers of water , mere subjects and labor operatives for England . That part of it you will do*very well to draw on.
