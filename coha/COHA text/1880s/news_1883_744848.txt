txt A war unnecessary in its beginning and most unreasonably protracted through the pride and perversity of one of the combatants has been brought to an end by the treaty signed on Saturday by the Peruvian General IGLESIAS and the representatives of the Chilian Government . The terms of the treaty , unless they have been modified since the draft of the instrument was published , are more severe to Peru than those she might have obtained at any time within a year after the fall of Lima , which practically ended the war so far as she was concerned . It was a wretched policy for the unhappy and helpless republic to pass through the perils of anarchy and ruin in a vain protest against the cession of territory which her adversary was strong enough to take in spite of her . But it must be remembered that selfish ambition is a more common attribute of Peruvian statesmen than lofty patriotism , and the men who came to the fore in the time of the republic 's distress aroused a strong popular feeling against a peace based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal gain from such a course . Gen. IGLESIAS , who has shown himself to be the real savior of the country , has apparently won to his support a majority of the people , and , as his rivals of the old Calderon regime are scattered and discredited , he will probably have no great difficulty in reorganizing the Government upon an orderly , constitutional basis . The people of the United States have a peculiar obligation to be prompt and cordial in their congratulations to the two republics , for the long and futile higgling over the terms of the treaty , with all the miseries which Peru has suffered during the last two years , was due in a large measure to Mr. BLAINE 'S reckless and censurable policy of meddling during the period when , to the great danger of this and other republics in this hemisphere , he held the post of Secretary of State .
