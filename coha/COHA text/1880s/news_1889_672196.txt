txt The troubles and turbulent scenes at Homestead caused by the strike of 2,500 employes of Carnegie , . Phipps &; Co. ' s steel mill are on the increase . To-day Sheriff McCandless sent up a small army of deputies , 124 in number , to preserve order . At the mill they were met by a large crowd of strikers and their , sympathizers , and mostly through entreaties of women and children all but fifteen deputies returned to Pittsburg and left the strikers in possession of the town . President William Weihe of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers counseled peace , but a determined crowd ' surrounded the gates to the mill yard , which the company did not open . One hundred Pinkerton detectives arrived from Philadelphia this morning for Homestead . They were armed with rifles and revolvers , and were under the command of the celebrated Capt . R. J. Linden , who achieved fame during the Molly Maguire disturbances in the anthracite coal regions of Pennsylvania . The vast army of Pittsburg workingmen say this is a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Mr. Andrew Carnegie has said he will spend a million dollars before he surrenders the interest in the fight exceeds that of any other strike in the history of Pittsburg . The three special cars bearing Sheriff McCandless 's deputies , under command of Col. Joseph Gray , reached Homestead about noon . Here a hundred strikers got on board . and , as the train proceeded to Munnall , the station nearest Carnegie , Phipps &; Co. ' s works , they signaled to their comrades all along the line to gather at the point of disembarkation . At Murtha ! " at least a thousand men , women , and children were assembled about the station . The deputies stepped off both sides of the train , forming two lines , which were completely surrounded by the strikers and their famines . Another large body of the strikers stationed themselves in front of the gates to the mill yard . About this time President Weihe , who is a giant in stature , elbowed his way toward the deputies , and to the strikers he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our struggle depends in a large measure on how you conduct yourselves to-day . These men did not come here to work , and have the right to enter the mill . " Mr. Weihe was prevented from further speaking by deafening ( timers . The front rank of the strikers then began a friendly conversation with the deputies and pleaded with them to resign their positions . In ten minutes a dozen deputies had deserted . One took off his blue coat and badge and threw them up in the air and the multitude cheered . The wife of a striker succeeded in persuading three deputies to take off their badges . One deputy who deserted the service of the country said : " A poorly-dressed woman with a bade suckling at her breast came up to me and said : ' For God 's sake go home . If you men stay here and help the company to beat the men you will drive us to starvation . ' She then began to cry , and said her husband had died but a few weeks ago and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by boarding employes of the steel works . i could not stand such an entreaty and threw up the sponge . " Ex-Alderman James Barry or Etnaborough , this county , and forty other deputies returned to Pittsburg on the same , train . They all told the same story . They could not withstand the pathetic appeals or the women and children . Considerable ill humor was displayed uy some of the mob . Noblows were struck , but in some instances deputies had their coats , hats , and badges torn from them . , Some women were armed with car-coupiing pins and stones , but did not utilize them . They did their lighting with their mouths , and some of the deputies got a severe tongue lashing . Secretary William Martin of the Amalgamated Association , who had charge of the strike yesterday , returned to Pittsburg to-day for the purpose ? of engaging a competent - attorney. should any legal-complications - arise , ? He was replaced by President William Weihe and Vice President James Nutt of Youngstown , Ohio . Beginning at the city limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side of the Monongahela River and every station on the Monongahela Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad on the Homestead side is watched by a group of strikers who will at once notifly headquarters of the progress of any body of imported workingmen . The clerks at the mill refused to put on badges and be sworn in as special policemen . They said their lives would not be safe . ' They were discharged at once . Ten special policemen appointed by the Town Council of Homestead are all strikers . Business men say it throws the responsibility of preserving peace on the shoulders of their labor organization . When the Pinkerton detectives arrived in Pittsburg to-day they remained in their two spe Mal cars , luncheon being sent in to them . Their ears were hauled to Homestead by an extra engine , via the Pennsylvania main line and its Monongahela Branch . Many of the Pinkerton men carried cases in which were Winchester rifles . Save their leader , they did not know their destination until they reached the Pittsburg station and were informed by newspaper reporters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon they received sudden notice to report at the Broad-Street station for duty near Pittsburg , where a strike was in progress . They were accompanied by their own cooks , and their first work in Homestead will be to establish a headquarters cook house , sleeping apartments , &c.; They have experienced some trouble heretofore in having to depend upon the people of a town for their supplies . At one time a number of them were badly poisoned . Some one had slyly put some poison in a spring from which they ' obtained their water . All these things will be provided for this time . Up to a late hour to=night the Pinkerton detectives had made no attempt to enter Homestead . They are expected between 3 and 5 o'clock to-morrow morning , and the Strikers openly declare that when they do come they will be driven out , come what may , and that is all there is of it . The prospects are therefore that there will be stirring scenes , if not actual bloodshed , at daybreak to-morrow . Every approach to the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentinel , so that when the Pinkertons come the ' whole army of strikers may be called out . One Deputy Sheriff who dropped into town this afternoon was asked who he was . His reply was " None of your ? business . " The next instant the deputy lay on the turf with his cheek split open from a terrific fist blow . He scrambled . to his feet and has been more polite ever since .
