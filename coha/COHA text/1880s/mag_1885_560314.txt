I. SENATOR YATES was a man of shining qualities , and a universal favorite . He was the war governor of Illinois , and performed unexampled labors in marshaling her soldiers for the great civil strife . A regiment of Illinois young men , a thousand strong , had been brought into camp near Chicago . The men were not gathered from the schools and farms of the State , but from the rongher classes of the cities and larger towns . They were good material for soldiers , as the sequel showed , ready for any service for their country , but unaccustomed to restraint , and wild almost to lawlessness . They did not like their colonel , and , determined to get rid of him , they resorted to absolute mutiny . One day , as the governor was telling a number of gentlemen met in the executive department of this turbulent and troublesome regiment , Elihu Washburne remarked that he thought he knew a man who was admirably fitted for its colonelcy . He was a Captain Grant , living in his own town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen service in the Mexican war ; a still man , but of great determination and courage ; a man who would soon bring such a regiment into military order , and win their confidence and admiration . Grant , from the first moment of the war , had been ready for any place where he might render aid to the government that had given him his military education . It had been suggested that , from his connection with the artillery service in the Mexican war , he might be useful in the Ordnance Bureau in Washington , and at this date he was about starting for the capital to offer himself for such routine work . " For heaven 's sake , " was Governor Yates 's instant reply , " tele // graph for him at once , and offer him , in my name , the command of this regiment ; for it is taking all my time , and worrying the life out of me . " The next morning , among the earliest callers at the governor 's office was the plainly-dressed , snug-built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor expressed his delight at his prompt response . He teld the captain what Washburne had said of his training and good qualities , and described the insubordinate regiment . He said they had set the colonel at absolute defiance , and were now " corralled " out on the prairie , under the guard of two other regiments and the trained guns of a battery of artillery . " Here they are to-day , a thousand Hellions " ( as the governor always called them ) ; " are you willing , Captain Grant , to take the colonelcy of such a regiment ? " " If such is your desire , " was the quiet response . " Do you think you could make soldiers out of such mutinous Hellions ? " " From what you have told me of them , with a little patience and firmness , I think they might in time be made a good regiment . As to this mutinous spirit , I think the articles of war will be found sufficient for its restraint . " The commission was signed , a carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp of the mutineers . They rode through the two regiments on guard , by the trained guns of the artillery , and found the men sullen with mortification and anger . They were gathered for an address by the governor . He told them of all his anxiety on their account , of his more than willingness to listen to all the requests of his gallant volunteers , so far as he might with a supreme regard for military discipline ; that a regiment , just starting for the front , was anxious for the services of their colonel ; that he had decided to change his command to that regiment ; and that Captain Grant , of Galena , the gentleman whom he now presented to them , hereafter would be their colonela man who knew war , both from the books and from service in the field , for Captain Grant was a graduate of West Point , and went through the Mexican war , with marked honor , in command of a battery of artillery ; that he was a man of courage , as resolute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the hardest fighting was to be done , and in all things would share with them the soldier 's fortune . " Of Colonel Grant , " he concluded , // " and this regiment , I expect , henceforth , to hear nothing but glorious tidings of obedient and brave warfare. ** There was a moment of painful silence . The men clasped each other 's hands , and looked into each other 's faces ; then , from a thousand throats , came shout after shout for Governor Yates , for Colonel Grant , for the old Stars and Stripes ! Colonel Grant took command . The regiments and the battery on guard returned to their own camp . For the next ten days the boys thought there was more time given to drill than any present prospect of active service demanded , but all orders were cheerfully obeyed . At the end of ten days the regiment was ordered to St. Louis . Transportation seemed to be a little crowded , as so many regiments were moving in that direction ; and Colonel Grant made no second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to make the march on foot . So his regiment marched over the hot prairie roads from Chicago to St. Louis ! Soon afterward Colonel Grant , with his regiment , was ordered to garrison the important post of Cairo . Here the self-possessed and resolute soldier found himself directly in that line of promotion which led him to the head of the army . Referring to this incident , Governor Yates was wont to say : " How wonderfnl indeed are the ways of providence ; how , out of seeming disaster , in Heaven 's beneficent ordering , often spring most cheerful results ! If it had not been for that regiment of Hellions , my most troublesome experience in all the war , in all probability the nation would have had no General Grant , only Captain Grant , a faithful clerk in the Ordnance Bureau at Washington . " II . Three times was General Bnrnside offered the command of the Army of the Potomac , and three times , with unaffected diffidence , he declined . Finally , it was pressed upon him by positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refuse it . In addressing General Halleck , after his appointment , he said : " Had I been asked to take it , I should have declined ; but being ordered , I cheerfully obey . " He was a frank , brave , generous man . Said a soldier who knew him well : " When victory crowned his efforts , and congratulations poured in upon him , his reply always was that the laurels did not belong to him , but to his brother officers and to the brave soldiers . When a great disaster befell him , he at once // telegraphed to his government : The fault was mine . The entire responsibility of failure must rest on my shoulders . ' " Immediately after his great victory at iRoanoke Island he had occasion to make a hurried trip to Washington . A friend , who , by a happy chance , was at the White House when General Burnside called to pay his respects to President Lincoln , told me that " the meeting was a grand spectacle . " He said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as they warmly clasped each other for some minutes , " they wept like women in their joyous agitation . " When General Buruside was about to leave for his hotel , the President inquired " Is there anything , my dear general , that I can do for you ? " " Yes ! yes ! " was the quick reply , " and I am glad you asked me that question . My three brigadiers , you know , glorious fellows ,  --  everything depended upon them , you know ,  --  and they did their duty so grandly ! - Oh , Mr. President , we owe so much to them ! I should so much love , when I go back , to take them their promotions . " " It shall be done ! " was Mr. Lincolu 's hearty response , and on  --  the instant the promotions were ordered , and General Buruside had the pleasure of taking back with him to Foster , IReno , and Parke , their commissions as major-generals . III . Early in his life at Natick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he was an active member . It met on one evening every week for the discussion , usually , of such questions as were agitating the public mind . It was in this humble association that he learned that plain , simple , straightforward way of presenting his argument which characterized his speeches and debates in his subsequent career . He also persuaded his fellow-students at Concord to form a similar association , of which , also , he was the most active spirit . His first appearance as a public speaker was under these circumstances . In 1837 , and a few subsequent years , the young men of New Hampshire had a State association , devoted to the interests of the rising movement against negro slavery . The membership of the association was found chiefly in the schools of the State , the college at Hanover , and the academies at Exeter , Plainfield , New Hampton , Concord , Gilmanton , New London , and Pembroke . With their contribu // tions these boys kept one or two eloquent lecturers in the field , . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three days ' duration . In August , in the year in which Wilson was in attendance at the Concord school , this association held its annual gathering , to which he had been elected as one of the delegates from the branch association of that town . It was largely attended by many spirited and noble young men , who , in the intervening years , have become distinguished as leaders in the progress of the times . Stephen S. Foster was there , a man of considerable intellectual force , who , through all the years of the anti-slavery conflict , rendered the most faithful and self-sacrificing services . But at this convention  --  and it was a common habit with him-he allowed his zeal to outrun his discretion . He introduced a resolution severely censuring John Quincy Adams for some recent utterance in Congress , wherein that noble old man had not come quite up to the . high-water mark of the more advanced anti-slavery sentiment . During the previous year young Wilson had been in Washington , and had made the acquaintance of Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the single-handed fight he was making against the slave-power . He believed , therefore , that the venerable statesman deserved the hearty approval and encouragement of the anti-slavery people of the North , and not their censure , even if he did apparently halt at some points of their faith . A young man from Dartmouth College , Horace Eaton ( afterward well-known as a warm-hearted and philanthropic Presbyterian clergyman ) , spoke earnestly against the resolution , and was followed by Henry Wilson in his first public speech . Wilson was always modest , and in those days he was bashful . He felt that the passage of the resolution would be a great wrong , but he shrank from participation in the debate . However , entreated and encouraged by a friend at his side , he timidly rose to his feet , and I had the pleasure of telling the president his name ,  --  as it was called for ,  - -  slightly to Wilson 's confusion . But he was soon under good head-* way , for his most earnest feelings were enlisted . His opening remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . was not many minutes before he began to secure applause from all sides , as he spoke eloquently of the intrepidity of the venerable ex-President making his brave fight almost alone in the midst of the most defiant opposition . He pleaded for word of cheer " // from the generous young men of New Hampshire , and opposed this attempt to inflict a pharisaical censure . It was really a grand speech , and the applause that continued till he took his seat , while testifying that the convention was with him , gave him , also , great encouragement in his determination to become a public speaker . Iv .. While Wilson was thus addressing the audience , a young man , an Apollo in manly grace and beauty , entered the church ; a stranger , evidently , as no one seemed to recognize him , and he took a seat near the door , in the rear of the audience . As Wilson closed , this young man joined heartily in the applause-indeed , he seemed to lead it . Rising and coming forward , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , nor a citizen of the State , even , but deeply interested in the discussion , might be permitted to join in the debate . That silvery voice and princely presence would have commanded a welcome in any gathering , but among these young men came voices from all over the hall , which proffered him the freedom of the platform with a cordial greeting . The president asked his name . " Wendell Phillips , " was the response . Those only who are old enough to remember how hated and despised was the antislavery cause in its early days , and how the peerless eloquence and patrician rank of this young Boston lawyer , this son of her first mayor , this noblest member of one of her oldest and most honored families , whose deeds of virtue and munificent charities had made illustrious every era of Massachusetts ' history , had lifted up that cause from this hate and reproach-they only can imagine the enthusiastic salutation which shook that church on the announcement of his name . Every member of the convention sprang to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than forty years have come and gone since that August day ,  --  years crowded with great historical events ,  --  yet still that scene of welcome remains as vivid in my mind as if it had occurred but yesterday . Mr. Phillips made one of his rarest speeches-first , in warm praise of the generous spirit and practical sense of the eloquent young man who had last addressed the convention , and then in glowing eulogy of the " old man eloquent , " the brave champion , // in Congress , of free speech , and of the right of petition . At his close , Mr. Phillips made his way to the pew in which Mr. Wilson was seated , and , taking him warmly by the hand , repeated to him , personally , what he had said to the convention ,  --  his most hearty approval of what had fallen from his lips ,  --  and assured him of his pleasure in making his acquaintance . From that time dated a warm friendship between these two men destined to play conspicuous parts in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great anti-slavery orator , and the applause of those hearty young Abolitionists , sprang the open and public attachment of Henry Wilson to the anti-slavery cause , which never once faltered until Abraham Lincoln , grasping in his strong right hand the power of a million armed men , smote the monster to the earth . V. Senator Ransom came out of the war not only with shattered health , but , like most of the officers of the confederacy , with shattered fortune as well . He had a fine plantation on Roanoke River , one of the best in the country , and , with a large family growing about him , the general was naturally anxious to retain the old home with all its fields intact . This was not easy , with the circumstances surrounding the man , as well as the entire Southern country , in the years immediately following the war ; but the affectionate father , looking into the anxious faces of his wife and children , determined to make the attempt . My readers may be glad to know that he succeeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortgage on crop and field had to be often repeated before the grand property was lifted of all encumbrance . Senator Ransom has a son named Joseph , who does not in any . large measure inherit the rare suavity of his father , but he is a very sensible although a frankspoken boy , and , as will be seen , he was not a dull observer of his father 's expedients in saving the old homestead . It was a few days after the general 's second election to the Senate , and some of the good matrons of the neighborhood were entertained by Mrs. Ransom at tea . At the table , Mrs. Smith was very profuse in her expressions of friendly admiration of the general , and of the great delight of all the neighbors at his success ; and she added the hope , as well as expectation , that some day they would have occasion to rejoice // over his higher triumphs , even his election to the White House . Joseph , who had remained silent up to this time , concluded , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue had been reached . " I thought , Mrs. Smith , that you said you were a friend of my father ? " " Certainly , Joseph , but why do you ask that question . " " Why , I do n't understand , " remarked the lad , " how any real friend of my father could want him in the White House ; for if he were there , it would n't be three months before he would have a mortgage on it ! " VI . Henry G. Davis , of West Virginia , from the humble position of a brakeman on the railroad , had fought his upward way to recognized position in society ; to the highest reputation as a business man ; to the possession of a large fortune , and to two honorable elections to the Senate . He was an industrious , useful , honorable senator ; a diligent , conscientious worker in the Committee on Appropriations , and an active member of the Select Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard , earnestly seconding all efforts for improving and cheapening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of food . Senator Davis was thoroughly at home on all railroad questions . He had been educated in their working , was largely concerned in their ownership , and hence took a lively and intelligent interest in everything pertaining to the question of transportation . It is wonderful how the power of early habit clings to us in after-life . Senator Davis once gave the Senate an emphatic demonstration of this noted fact . Judge Thurman , being a generous snuff-taker , carried a big , red bandana handkerchief , and , when he rose to speak , usually , as a preliminary , grasped his nose with this red bandana , and gave a blast like a trumpet . It was well toward morning of a wearisome all-night session , and Senator Davis was asleep-his head resting upon his desk ( but I will say for the Senator that he was not often asleep in the Senate ) . Senator Edmunds had provoked Judge Thurman to a speech ; and by way of introduction , the judge unfurled the red bandana , and blew a blast of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his old railroad days ; at any rate , he sprang to his feet , in // a half-dazed condition , and catching sight of the red flag ( the old signal of danger ) , and seeming to imagine that he had heard the shriek of alarm from the open throttle of a locomotive calling for " down brakes , " he seized his desk , and by the brakeman 's firm , quick twist , wrenched it from the floor . I was not present on this occasion , and therefore can not assert the entire truth of the story from personal knowledge ; but it was often repeated about the Senate-chamber , and I never heard any of the details called in question . VII . Garret Davis , of Kentucky , was a venerable man , who had come down from a former generation , bristling alike with integrity and with prejudices ; a man who so honored the old , and the established , that he could hardly tolerate the new moon , and the succession of the seasons was to him an abomination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who prefer a whipping-post to a school-house ! He was a small , gray-headed man , full of nerve , remarkably alert for his years . Planting himself well back upon his heels , with face erect , he was always ready for the fight , and it mattered not to him whether he encountered one man or a legion , for his courage , moral and physical , was matchless . Mr. Davis well represented the fighting spirit of his State , the only one of the Union that in the recent civil war raised its full quota of soldiers for both sides . His stamping-ground was the " constitution of our fathers " ( as interpreted in Kentucky ) , and there he stood , ready for all comers . Honest to the last degree , and as garrulous as he was honest , after speaking three days on some question , he asked for the setting apart of another day , as " the remarks he had already made were but preliminary to the discussion of the great constitutional points involved ! " He was largely interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminently in dangerthe Constitution and the Treasury . In his excited imagination , pretty nearly all of our public men were intent upon smashing the Constitution ; and especially one of the senators from Kansas was determined to deplete the Treasury . Probably he had as good reasons for his fears in the one case as in the other . As he was constantly on guard against these depredations , it was not strange that , one day , he was weary , and sought sleep . But , before laying // his head upon his desk , he reminded his neighbors upon the right and left ( Senators Thurman and Sanisbury ) that he was for a few minutes going to give up the watch ; but if any danger portended , he begged to be instantly awakened . It was not long before the senator of especial danger  --  the senior senator from Kansas-was on the floor with a bill from the Railroad Committee , of which he was a member . In an instant both senators , Thurman and Saulsbury , were shaking the Kentucky watchman from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special alarm , " Kansas " and " Pacific Railroad . " The fierce little man was upon his feet before he was half awake . The senator from Kansas , meanwhile , remarked that he had in his hand a bill that simply proposed the amendment of some defective clause in the charter of one of the branches of the Pacific Railroad , and suggested that it might as well be put upon its passage at that time ; and then , noticing the bustling in the neighborhood of the Kentucky senator , he added that he had looked the bill through , and he could assure the Senate that there was no " steal " in it . " Mr. President , " cried out the half-awakened senator from Kentucky , " the senator from Kansas says that he has carefully examined the bill , and that there is no steal ' in it . If the senator from Kansas can not find any steal ' in the bill , I am sure there is none there , and I think we can safely consent to the motion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Senate-chamber is always maintained ; so , while but a few were left to record their votes on this occasion , the cloak-rooms were thronged . But the people will forget his foibles and his temper , and Garret Davis will be honorably remembered for hig unbending honesty through many years of public service ; for the frank and bold expression of his opinions ; for the rare simplicity of his habits , the purity of his private life , and , above all , for his steadfastness to the Union when the great mass of the public men with whom he had been associated for more than a generation yielded to the clamor of secession . VIII . It was the summer of 62 , and McClellan 's sojourn in the swamps of the Chickahominy had filled the hospitals , far and near , with the sick . Colonel Scott , of a New Hampshire regiment , laid // low with fever at Newport News . One of the noble women connected with the Sanitary Commission , in attendance at the hospital where the colonel was being nursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her of his home among the cool mountains of New Hampshire , and of his noble , brave wife , and precious children , and how he felt as if he could rally from this scorching fever if only he could reach that home and sit for a day in the shade of the maples where his children were playing-grand big trees , planted all about the old house , and on both sides of the road , up and down , as far as his farm ran , planted by his father when he came home from . the war of 1812 . Or if he could only bathe his fevered brow in the mountain brook that runs in the pasture close by ; or , if his wife could come to him , her cool hand upon his burning forehead would stop this throbbing . And then , he whispered through his tears , if he was to die , he should die so much easier if he could only have hold of her hand . The good nurse wrote to the wife of the condition of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital remarked that morning , as he visited her ward , " that special care must be given Colonel Scott , for he was a very sick man , and the country could ill spare so brave a soldier . " The very day that the wife received this letter she started for Virginia . In Washington , she found some difficulty in getting permission to go to the front ; but her love and anxiety made her persistent , and , finally , she secured a pass and transportation on a steamer which was taking supplies to City Point . She found her husband alive , and her courageous spirit and loving assiduity soon began to tell in his improving health . In a week , leaning upon her loving arm , he was able to walk a little about the hospital . And then , when she could lead him out-doors , and under the shadow of the trees , where he could get the invigorating breath of the ocean as it came up Hampton Roads , he gained rapidly . A great battle was daily expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington such of the patients as could bear removal , that room might be made for the expected wounded . Mrs. Scott found no difficulty in getting her husband designated among the several score that were thus to be sent north . That evening , just as the steamer turned from the bay into the Potomac , she came in collision with a transport coming down , was badly stoven , several state-rooms being carried away , with their sleeping occupants , and some twelve or more of these sick men and // their attendants were drowned , among the number the faithful and noble wife of Colonel Scott . A few who were thrown into the water were rescued , but when all hope of saving others was at an end , the steamer proceeded on her way . The next day a telegram was received at the War Department , telling that the people residing in the neighborhood had found the bodies of several of the victims of the collision , and had given them burial in such manner that they could be identified if friends called for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of Mrs. Scott . This information coming to Colonel Scott , he naturally was anxious to return down the river , that he might receive the body of his devoted wife and take it to New Hampshire for sepulture . A grand forward movement at the front then being in contemplation , for a day or two there had been an order at tfie War Department that no passes or transportation down the Potomac should be allowed any one , save those actually engaged in co-operating with the movement . So , when Colonel Scott applied to Secretary Stanton for permission to go down the river , he was refused , and no time permitted him for entreaty . From Mr. Stanton , Colonel Scott hurried to the White House . It was late Saturday afternoon , and Mr. Lincoln had left , wearier even than was his wont , for his retreat at the " Soldiers ' Home ; " and in the hope of an undisturbed evening , and a quiet Sabbath , that he might gather some strength for the coming week , expected to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire friend , who knew Mr. Lincoln , and the way to the " Old Soldiers ' Home . " When they reached the gray stone cottage , where Mr. Lincoln spent his weary nights and thoughtfnl Sundays of that anxious summer of 62 , it was in the deepening twilicrht . The house was still and dark-not a lamp lighted ; not a sound , save the " Katydids " in the old elm calling to the " Katydidn'ts . " The servant who answered the bell led the way into the little parlor , where , in the gloaming , entirely alone , sat Mr. Lincoln . In his escape , as he had supposed , from all visitors , and weary with the care and heat of the day , he had thrown off coat and shoes , and with a large palm-leaf fan in his hand , as he reposed in a broad chair , one leg hanging over its arm , he seemed to be in deep thought , perhaps studying the chances of the impending battle . // Uninterrupted by a single word from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness , the coming to him of his wife , her terrible death , the finding of the body , and his desire to reach it and take it to his home . Then he added that he had been to Mr. Stanton , been refused permission to go down the river , and so , in his despair , had come to him . At this point , Mr. Lincoln rose to his feet , and , in a voice of mingled vexation and sadness , asked : " Am I to have no rest ? Is there no hour or spot when or where I may escape this constant call ? Why do you follow me out here with such business as this ? Why do you not go to the War-office , where they have charge of all this matter of papers and transportation ? " The colonel repeated the fact of his going to Mr. Stanton , and his refusal . " Then , probably , you ought not to go down the river . Mr. Stanton knows all about the necessities of the hour ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enforced . It would be wrong for me to override his rules and decisions in cases of this kind ; itmight work disaster to important movements . And then , you ought to remember that I have other duties to attend toheaven knows , enough for one man !  --  and I can give no thought to questions of this kind . Why do you come here to appeal to my humanity ? Do n't you know , Colonel Scott , that we are in the midst of war ? That suffering and death press upon all of us ? That works of humanity and affection which we would cheerfully perform in days of peace are all trampled upon and outlawed by war ? That there is no room left for them ? There is but one duty now , that is to fight . The only call of humanity now is to conquer peace through unrelenting warfare . War , and war alone , is the duty of all of us . Your wife might have trusted you to the care which the government has provided for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vex me with your family tronbles . Why , every family in the land is crushed with sorrow ; but they must not each come to me for help . I have all the burden I can carry . Go to the War Department . Your business belongs there . If they can not help you , then bear your burden , as we all must , until this war is over . Everything must yield to the paramount duty of finishing the war . " Colonel Scott was terribly disappointed and crushed by this totally unexpected rebuff . He knew that there was no hope in re // turning to Mr. Stanton , so he retired to his hotel , and walked his room until morning , when , throwing himself upon his bed , he had scarcely fallen asleep when he was awakened by a hurried footstep in the hall , and a sharp rap at his door . He opened it , and was seized by both hands by Abraham Lincoln , who , in a voice as buoyant and sympathetic as last night it was weary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a brute last night . I have no excuse for my conduct . Jndeed , I was weary to the last extent , but I had no right to treat a man with rudeness who had offered his life for his country , much more a man who came to me in great affliction . Colonel Scott , I honor you for your attachment to the memory of your wife , and for your desire to take the dead body to your home and kindred . She was a devoted , heroic wife , worthy of your love ; and to think that I should have made any criticism , as I did last night , upon her being away from her home , and in the place of danger . This war , Colonel Scott , has shown great qualities on the part of our people ; b#Lt in my soul I have no higher admiration than for the nobility of our women , in the patriotic ardor with which they give up husbands and sons for the service , and the tender devotion with which they follow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had any hut words of warm consideration for such a woman , hurrying to her husband 's sickbed , or been seemingly indifferent to the terrible grief , my dear colonel , which crushes you , I can not understand . I have had a regretful night . Now , my good man , hurry and get ready . I have seen Secretary Stanton , and he has arranged all . They are getting up the fires on a boat at the Navy Yard , which will take you down the river . An undertaker , with his assistants , in the service of the Quartermaster 's Department , has been ordered aboard the boat , to give you all needed help . You will find everything aboard necessary for your sad errand . Now , get ready ; do n't stop for breakfast , you can get that on board the boat after you start , and I have my carriage here , and will go with you to the wharf . And , colonel , when you get home , do n't tell your children of my conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share in their sorrow for the loss of so good a mother . And , colonel , notwithstanding my apparent indifference last night , I honor you from the bottom of my heart for your manly love for your wife and devotion to her memory . The President , in his carriage , took Colonel Scott to the steamer , // and seeing that every needed detail had been attended to , stood by until the boat cast off , and then rode back his six miles to his breakfast . Such was the great , true , warm-hearted Abraham Lincoln . He was our countryman  --  and God be thanked that when the most terrific war of history beat upon our government he was our President .
