PREFACE In keeping with the purposes of the present series , the following plays of Bronson Howard are now published for the first time ; heretofore these plays have existed only in manuscript form or in privately printed editions . All of these plays but one have been produced and are thus a part of our stage history ; at least two of the plays were outstanding hits in their time , one was a success , and two others had recurrent performances . Three of the plays were produced abroad . Like most other successful playwrights , Howard wrote for production and not for publication . In fact , he was averse to the public printing of his plays . Note : 1kb An examination of Howard 's manuscript materials reveals how consistently the idea of stage production dominated his methods of composition ; the plays themselves are evidence of this approach . Note : 1Kb The present volume , therefore , will appeal primarily to those interested in the drama ; but the general reader as well may find value in the story , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various plays . The editorial policy has been to provide factual material relative to each play , and to minimize critical interpretation . Accounts have been given of the first performances , of subsequent productions , and of prominent casts ; the bases of the present texts have been described ; a bibliography of Howard 's plays and a general bibliography have been provided ; and , where possible , sources of the plays have been indicated . With respect to the latter point , it may be noted that a play is presumed to have no specific external source unless otherwise shown . The reason for this is that Howard was exceptionally scrupulous in acknowledging every borrowing or influence . As an illustration of his care in this regard , we have the Moorcroft incident related by Brander Matthews : Howard " was always most scrupulous in declaring whatever indebtedness he might be under to any predecessor . He printed on the programme of Moorcroft an acknowledgment that he had derived the suggestion for the play from a short story by John Hay , although what he had borrowed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suspected his own share in the work if Bronson Howard had not called his attention to it . " Footnote : 1kb This is a fitting place for the present editor to acknowledge his own indebtedness at many points to the extensive researches of Professor Arthur Hobson Quinn in the field of American drama . He also wishes to state that the approach , the play texts , and many data have been provided by Mr. Barrett H. Clark , general editor of the series . A. G. H. Bucknell University , 1941 . BRONSON CROCKER HOWARD 1842-1908 Bronson Crocker Howard was born October 7 , 1842 , in Detroit , Mich . His mother , Elizabeth Vosburg , was of Dutch descent , and his father , Charles Howard , came from an English ancestry that numbered dukes among its members . Charles Howard was a man of prominence : he was a prosperous commission merchant , he was elected mayor of Detroit in 1849 , and he was publicly eulogized at his death in 1883 . After attending schools in Detroit up to 1858 , Bronson Howard entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intention of continuing his studies at Yale ; however , he changed his plans and went into newspaper work . While working on the Detroit Free Press , Howard wrote humorous sketches and several plays , all but one of which were discarded . Fantine , based on an episode in Hugo 's Les Misrables , was produced in Detroit in 1864 . The following year Howard went to New York , where he became a reporter on the New York Tribune under the editorship of Horace Greeley . For four years Howard wrote plays for the wastebasket . In 1870 he sent a play to Laura Keene , who thought so highly of it that she recommended it to Augustin Daly for production . Acting upon her suggestion , Daly produced Howard 's Saratoga December 21 , 1870 ; it had an exceptionally long run of one hundred one nights and was subsequently produced in London as Brighton . The success of this play materially encouraged Howard and launched him upon his long , prosperous career as a dramatist ; his later plays included such hits as The Banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and Shenandoah ( 1888 ) . In London , in 1880 , Howard married Miss Alice Wyndham , sister of Sir Charles Wyndham . Travel in Europe provided Howard materials for such international contrasts as One of Our Girls ( 1885 ) and Aristocracy ( 1892 ) . Other activities of Howard included lecturing on the drama and campaigning for stronger copyright laws . He was founder and president of the American Dramatists ' club and a member of several other literary clubs . He died August 4 , 1908 , at Avon-by-the-Sea , N.J. SURVEY OF HOWARD 'S PLAYS Though Bronson Howard 's development as a dramatist was continued and gradual , yet his career falls readily into two parts : from 1864 , when his first play , Fantine , was produced , to about 1882 , most of his work was either farce or melodrama ; from 1882 on , his plays became more realistic in technique and increasingly attentive to problems in contemporary life . Fantine , produced in Detroit in 1864 , is a dramatic sketch based on episodes in Hugo 's Les Misrables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brisk farce concerning the watering place , staged by Augustin Daly in 1870 ; this piece shows an early interest in the contemporary American scene . Saratoga was produced in London as Brighton and in Germany as Seine Erste und Einzige Liebe . Howard 's next play , Diamonds ( first produced in 1872 ) , is a comedy of manners and continues Howard 's interest in the current scene as dramatic setting . Moorcroft ; or , the Double Wedding ( 1874 ) is a melodrama dealing with a slave situation ; it is based in part on a short story by John Hay . Footnote : 1kb Lilian 's Last Love ( 1873 ) pictures the danger in marrying for duty instead of love ; this drama is of especial interest because it is the first phase of a three-version play , analyzed in Howard 's Autobiography of a Play . Note : 1Kb The second stage of the play , The Banker 's Daughter , was produced in New York in 1878 ; the third version , The Old Love and the New , appeared the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Love Letters ( 1878 ) , is a sentimental treatment of reawakening love . It was first presented as a curtain-raiser to Howard 's " comic drama , " Hurricanes ( 1878 ) . The next year saw the production of Wives , a comedy adapted from Molire 's L ' cole des maris and L ' cole des femmes . Baron Rudolph , a melodrama of poverty , riches , and villainy , had its premire in England in 1881 . The last of Howard 's farces was Fun in a Green Room , produced early in 1882 . Probably belonging to this same period is the sentimental comedy of English life , Knave and Queen ( at first entitled Ivers Dean ) ; Footnote : 1kb according to the title-page of the manuscript , this play was written in collaboration with Sir Charles L. Young , Bart . The second part of Howard 's career shows a greater attention to realism in technique and a growing concern with the problems of contemporary life . Footnote : 1kb Young Mrs. Winthrop ( 1882 ) reveals how absorption in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls ( 1885 ) contrasts American and French ideas relative to maidenhood and marriage . The ruthlessness of big business , more particularly Wall Street , is exposed in The Henrietta ( 1887 ) ; Note : 1Kb this satire on money-making was highly lucrative to Howard . Met by Chance ( 1887 ) involves an international contrast , a theme in several Howard plays . The next play was the popular romance of the Civil War , Shenandoah ( 1889 ) . A second historical play is Peter Stuyvesant ( 1899 ) written in collaboration with Brander Matthews . Note : 1Kb Howard made one of his most extended studies of society and social climbing in Aristocracy ( 1892 ) . An unpublished and unproduced play , The Title ( wr. 1895 ) , is an early discussion of woman 's suffrage . The novel-drama , Kate ( 1906 ) , reveals Howard 's modernity in its theme of love versus ritual as the sanction for marriage . Footnote : 1kb Though not in true drama form , Kate epitomizes the main features of Howard 's continually maturing art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 27 , 1878 , with the following cast of characters : Mrs. Lucy Batterson , a weak woman Marie Wainwright Mrs. Partridge Compton , a weak woman Mrs. Allen Blanche , a weak woman Rose Osborn Julia , a weak woman Agnes Elliott Alfred Batterson , a strong man James Lewis Gen.
