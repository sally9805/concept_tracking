txt The mishap that befell Gen. BOULANGER in his duel with M. FLOQUET is far from uncommon , though the prominence of the duelists makes it seem so . On the fencing floor one of the most ordinary devices to stop an opponent whose style is furious is to extend the arm rigidly* on the shortest line to his body , with the hope that in the hurry - to makes point he will fail to see his danger and impale himself . As BOULANGER lunged , forward with the perhaps excusable impetitosity of a man of smallersize.and less reach than his adversary , - the latter appears to have occupied with a stiff arm that shortest line . BOULANGER 'S lunge brought his neck just before the point , and it was neatly impaled . It is a fact that with the foils this stop is very much in request to damp the ardor of the novice , an ardor ' which is extremely dangerous to swordsmen who have become accustomed to a grave and measured style of fencing , conducted with all sorts of conventional allowances . Used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expert manages to move the straight point off the shortest line the adversary 's arm has to be unbent and a true guard resumed . This occupies a half breath of time , but that should . be enough for the expert to pink his man . What occasions most talk is the fact that a General should be beaten by a lawyer and a younger man by a politician whose snowy mane has lent , venerableness to the presiding chair of the Chamber of Deputies . M. FLOQUET is a very handsome , tall , and . distinguished-looking man , full . of vigor , it is true , bent tho last person in the world one would expect to see on the field of honor . There is always something boyish and absurd about a duel ; it is the fisticuffs of youth , to which the possibility of a fatal result seldom lends any dignity . Nowadays duels are rare , because most men who would like to fight are afraid of ridicule . Certainly the spectacle of M. FLOQUET , in flowing white looks and eyeglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already of middle age , lacks all the elements of the heroic . They seem like boys . The sentiment of Europe which commends , and indeed compels , exhibitions of the kind , undoubtedly belongs to an inferior stage of civilization . Given the necessity , however , there is no question as to the wisdom of using the dueling sword on the field of honor in preference to other weapons . That practice which secures a reasonable proficiency-in the sword is one of the best exercises in the world for those - who live in cities , and constitutes at the same time a game which may be ranked with chess for interest . Practically it is the only game of athletics in France , and probably , does more to keep up the number of hale old gentlemen in Paris than any other thing . Old Frenchmen are careful in diet and habits , but much of their vigor must be ascribed to a gentle exercise that stirs the liver , opens the pores , and causes the blood to circulate and the lungs to act without violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a man of the sword by profession , has handled a foil since childhood . so that while retaining his color and robustness by the practice of a pleasant game , he has come to a moment when that exercise has saved his life . In . France the army has no monopoly of the sword . The crack performers are not in the army , although at Joinville le Pont there is a school at which so many mastersat-arms graduate every year . The surprise at M. FLoQurr 's success is , therefore , not great . But were it otherwise , there would be no room for wonder . Swordsmanship is about as fair a game as exists . The expert whom nobody oan touch only lives in romances . The finest swordsmen and maitres &armee; are constantly touched , though some of them have a foible to explain away or deny the fact . Had BouLANGER the reputation of MERIGNAC with the foils , the result might have been the same . ALPHONSE DAUDET , oddly enough , had . just invented a duel similar to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroborate the fame of the novelist for accuracy in depicting modern life . L'Immortel has a duel between Paul Astier and the Prince d'Athis , in which the quarrelsome BOULANGER may be seen as Paul and M. FLOW as the Prince , for Paul is the younger and is a steady practicer with the foils . They begin , and . the Prince , a livid worldling , who has betrayed the woman who picked him out of the gutter , perceives that his moment has come . " Ile was to be - killed , that was certain . And while , his big thin arm stretched out , he backed away , and the bell hilts of the swords rang out , for the first time remorse came to him for the contemptible desertion of his mistress , of her who dragged him up out of the mud and replaced him in society . All of a sudden  --  violent , brutal voices : Enough , enough ! Stop , will you ? ' What had happened ? Danger has disappeared ; the sky has regained its immobility and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet on the trampled and torn ground spreads a large pool of blood which blackens the yellow earth , and in it lies Paul Astier stricken down , his bare neck pierced from one side to the other  --  stuck like a pig . " In this duel the Prince is a. coward , and is not compared with FLOQUET . The comparison , of course , is only with the blows , and . intended to point out this remarkable coincidence , an imaginary duel repeated in real life , while the novel in which it appears is at its high tide of success . The duel of fact does not demonstrate that M. FLoquET is more expert with the sword than Gen. BOULANGER : the duel of fiction . gave the success to the ' coward and . rusty swordsman . The game of the sword has two grand merits  --  it puts-nearly. on an equality men of different size , age , and . experience , and . it permits of duels in which only a small proportion are fatal .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
