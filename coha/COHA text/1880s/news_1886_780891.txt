txt Within one hour yesterday " market " values in Wall-street shrunk $10,000,000 . The Stock Exchange was the scene of such a battle as has never been fought there before without precipitating panic and widespread disaster . Bulls and bears faced each other full of a desperate courage . It was not long that the contest lasted . The bears were the stronger . They had the better generals . They had ammunition , too , abundant . In one day  --  for almost to the very close of business the downward sweep cut everything in its way  --  in one day was wiped out absolutely and completely what it had required a six months ' bull campaign to build up . Since the days of the Grant &; Ward entanglement , when disaster looked out from every quarter , there has been no scene on the Stock Exchange worthy to be likened to that which marked the opening hour yesterday . Every " pool " was crowded with excited brokers before the Exchange clock was within many minutes of pointing to the hour of 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chairman fell , then there was what any initiated observer in the galleries above would have naturally recognized as a jubilee of 500 dangerous lunatics . There was a waving of arms , a thrusting of fists , a clamoring of voices , until it seemed as if each one of the entire 500 was the mortal enemy of every other there , and all bent on murderous revenge . And the hurly-burly grew , rather than lessened . All day it lasted . There was many a man in the surging crowds whose fight was for his own solvency . And on the opposite side was many another man who saw in the vantage that the bears were holding the chance of a lifetime to get rich . A fight on such grounds could not flag , could not lack animation , could not cud short of utter rout on one side or absolute triumph on the other . The result : sweeping victory for the bears . Louis Marx , whom everybody knows as one of the biggest hearted men in Wall-street , a broker always on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take big risks , went down to his Exchange-place business office yesterday morning worth $200.000 . Last night he went to his home at the Windsor Hotel without a penny to his name . He failed early in the day ; his whole fortune was extinguished ; in place of his $200,000 he had instead liabilities of $40,000 or more . " Poor Marx ! I 'm sorry ! " That 's what every man in Wall-street said when they heard of the trouble that had overtaken the hopeful fellow . Rumors passed en . tent all day of dangers imminent in other quarters . One prominent house on Exchange-place , with European connections , and a Broadway firm with a large out-of-town clientage , were mentioned in the whispers that floated freely around . There , too , were significant hints of a bank caught in its support of a big operator whose collateral was insuflicieut . These rumors were as a club poised over the bull head ; from minute to minute there was no telling what dire disaster was not about to dawn . Yet the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By reason of a mistake , 900 shares of stock were sold " under the rule " for the account of J. Rhinelander Dillon : but Mr. Dillon made his settlements quickly . and his financial ability was not questioned anywhere . The Stock Exchange never before did so much business as was transacted yesterday . Over 1,100,000 shares of stock were dealt in , of which nearly 175,000 were Reading . That stock was the centre of the fight , Only about a week ago it was buoyant above 53 and seemed bound forthwith for 75 . Yesterday it was , after a brief battle , converted into a football bounding down Bill . Once started it seemed impossible to stop it . For a time it halted about 39 , bat soon all support gave way , and whole points at a time it skurried down to 30 before it stopped . Sales were even made at 28 , though in the excitement of the hour the " tape " did not record that figure . New-England Railroad stock , too , was a centre of the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cyrus W. Field having got vindication by putting in his ownBoard of Directors and Witting out President Clark and " that man " Higginson , was given the further compliment of a slump in the stock from 6414 , where it sold on Monday , the day before election , down to 44 , a thirdlof the market price . And Mr. Field was made equally unhappy over his much advertised Manhattan consolidated stock , which dropped down from 164 a week ago to 154 yesterday . The day before yesterday Mr. Field had his couriers flying around in Wall-street offering 163 for thousands of shares ; yesterday he had the chance to Ell his order at a good deal smaller price . Manhattan broke wide open ou sales of a single thousand shares . All of the " fancies " suffered . Sonic of the " wildcats " had the life smashed completely out of them . It was a day of judgment all around . Here is a table of the more prominent stocks which shows the fluctuations of the day , and compares yesterdays 's prices as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the weapon that the bears used to smash things . There was some talk of afflictions to be visited upon the railroads by the passage of the Inter-State Commerce bill ; there were hints of financial distress impending in and out of this city ; there were assertions that the banks were going to demand wider margins on stock collateral ; there were a score of bear weapons , but the onethat was powerful , that with which they bore down all opposition and put the whole market at their mercy , was tight money . It loaned from 6 per cent . up to nearly 300 per cent . Financial conditions are such that men of large resources can lock up money in this market at their own option . The process is easy- . The profits are big . Nobody questions that Jay Gould and Russell Sage , entering upon the bear campaign , used this money situation to their own advantage . Brokers with big loans to carry were yeste  --  day confronted with the fact that renewals which they were obliged to make would cost early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate of over 45 per cent . per year ; this before noon doubled , and at 1 o'clock 34 was charged , while in some instances it was reported that borrowers had to pay as high as 34 per cent . per day . or 270 per cent , per year . Money in Loudon rules easy , and cable dispatches from Wall-street have ordered several millions brought here at once . The bear leaders themselves averred that yesterday 's break could never have been possible but for the recent and almost criminal wildcat speculation that lately has prevailed in Wallstreet , by which lots of securities without any inherent value whatever have been skyrocketed . The bear leaders themselves , too , said at the market 's close that all danger of a panic was now averted , and that with stocks put closer to intrinsic values there are fair opportunities for safe investment . The corridors of the Windsor Hotel were crowded last night by brokers ana speculators whom the driving storm of snow and sleet could not keep at home . On all sides there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a threatened panic had been averted , and that now on a safer basis stocks in which the chief liquidation had taken place would be a purchase . Addison Cammack and Charles D. Keep , who have been the recognized generals iu the recent campaign , agreed that there was now a chance for better things . " There remain some stocks , " said Mr. Keep , " which are much too high , considering their market value in contrast with their intrinsic worth , and in such stocks further liquidation may naturally be expected . But the financial situation as a whole is vastly improved by what has taken place . It can hardly be expectedethat a general bull market is to set in right away . It takes time to regain public confidence after such a shock as this last break inflicted . Prices have been marked up so regardless of real values hitherto , bubbles have been blown so abundantly , that more or less popular distrust will have to be met . But , ultimately , the good effects of this settlement  --  this bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them-selves decidedly for good . "
