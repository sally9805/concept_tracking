To tliose who are familiar with the subject it has long been evident that there exists in the public mind a wide-spread misapprehension as to the amount and the system of physical training in American colleges . The tone of current newspaper comment ,  - -  often humorously intended , to be sure ,  --  is nevertheless misleading to readers whom it unconsciously influences . Athletics , gymnastics and aquatics are not the chief subjects of college instruction , as certain editors would have us believe , and as a certain proportion of otherwise intelligent people seem really to suppose . And in the present article we desire , as briefly as possible , to correct this mistaken notion and to call the attention of educators to the urgent need of some system of physical exercise in our higher institutions of learning . During the past few years the science of physiology and hygiene has made rapid advancement . The elementary laws of health have been more widely diffused and more intelligently followed by the people at large . The medical profession are trusting less to drugs and more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when properly administered , are great remedies as well as great preventives of disease , and doctor and patient alike begin to realize this fact . Our houses are better ventilated , our tables more healthfuliy provided , our time for sleep is lengthened , outdoor games are growing popular , and our styles of dress have been perceptibly modified in favor of health and comfort . This spirit of the age is recognized by the governing bodies of our colleges and seminaries , who announce in the catalogues of their institutions that due attention is given to health and physical training . Parents are attracted by these announcements , and send their sons and daughters to college in the confident hope that they will receive physical as well as mental training and development . But their expecta // 167 tions are seldom realized . The intelligent system of physical culture which they had been led to expect exists only in the imaginations of the trustees and faculty . It is true that nearly all of the larger seminaries and colleges in the New England and Middle States are provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for practicing physical exercises . In a few of these institutions light gymnastics are made a part of the curriculum , and are conducted under the eye of a capable instructor . The apparatus used consists of wooden dumb-bells , wooden wands and Indian clubs , which vary in weight from one to four pounds each . The movements are arranged in a progressive series , and are designed to call into gentle activity all the muscles of the body . The time allotted to these exercises varies from one hour to two hours a week , and extends over a period of from three to eight months . In some cases regular attendance is required for the first year only , in others it is kept up throughout the school or college course . The maximum of required gymnasium work in any institution is not over two hours a week , and in one instance it is but one hour a week for a single term . No one acquainted with the structure of the human frame , or knowing anything of its natural requirements , will undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular exercise is excessive , especially when the apparatus used is of the lightest description . Yet this is all that is provided in the way of physical culture by the corporation in the best of our literary institutions . Now , what does the student do for himself ? This depends partly upon his temperament and disposition , and partly upon * * If he is strong and robust , overflowing with life and vigor , he takes naturally to outdoor sports ; if he is of a studious turn of mind , or of a phlegmatic or melancholic temperament , he is less inclined to active exercise and falls more readily into sedentary habits . These inherited tendencies are sufficiently strong , we think , to warrant us in grouping college students in four great classes : ( 1 ) The athletes ; ( 2 ) The sporting men ; ( 3 ) The scholars ; ( 4 ) The idlers . The class of athletes is made up of those who give most of their time and energy to boating , base-ball , football , and general gymnastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of their peculiar fitness for the position to be filled . A candidate for the university crew must possess at the // outset a large and vigorous frame , must be especially strong in the back , loins , and legs , and have great powers of endurance . These qualifications , we say , must be possessed at the outset , or n man can not hope for a place in a college or a class crew , and outside these crews very little rowing is done by individual students . The improvement in the art of rowing has shut out the majority from participation in this sj*ort . If they own boats , well and good ; they can row when they like , and as long as they like ; but , unfortunately , this luxury can be enjoyed only by the few . Moreover , other obstacles , such as rough water , rainy weather , low tides , obstructions in the river , and its distance from college , combine to render this sport impracticable and unreliable as the sole agent in any system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render this exercise accessible and attractive , but a very small percentage of the students avail themselves of it . At Harvard , Yale , Columbia , and Cornell , less than five per cent . of the students row regularly ; and in the smaller colleges we find that , unless a regatta is anticipated , the boat-house is hardly opened at all . A few years ago several of these smaller institutions sent representative crews to Springfield and Saratoga . The money raised to defray the expenses of these crews was subscribed under the pretense of awakening a general interest in boating , whereas it benefited only those who underwent the three months ' training , and was of personal interest only to those whose physique insured them a place in the next year 's crew . And when we look over the ground to-day we find that the only men who are enjoying the advantages of boating are the men who do not need them . These remarks in regard to the boating men are almost equally true of the ball-players . The game has been reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary skill and experience can hope to belong to the nine . In most cases this skill is acquired long before entering college , and the tendency thenceforward is to develop to the extreme the abilities that have already displayed themselves . To maintain the standard of excellence now required of college players necessitates from two to three hours ' practice daily in the field and a winter 's work in the gymnasium . This is more time than is needed to keep the body in good working condition , and more than the mass of students can spare . Hence , to the majority the advantages of base-ball are practically denied . Only eighteen men can play at // a time , and two regular nines are all that the largest of our colleges maintain . The game , therefore , is limited to a class of experts , and only those who are members of the nine get the benefit of systematic training . The game of foot-ball opens a somewhat wider field . More men are required , the rules are easily mastered , and the qualifications demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy in heart and lungs , and able to stand thumping and bumping for an hour or two with impunity . If to this hardiness be added a fleet foot , strong limbs , quick perception , and presence of mind , one has the requisites of a foot-ball player . But , as even this game is now played , skill is of the highest importance , so that here again we see the same tendency to raise the standard of the sport , and to narrow participation to the capacity of the few . Moreover , there are serious objections to this game . We have not the space to discuss them . It is a rough-and-tumble contest from the beginning to the end ; bruises , strains , or internal injuries are its natural accompaniments . Of all college games this is the most accessible , and yet for the average and untrained student it is unquestionably the most dangerous . The athletic contests , or " field days , " of spring and fall open a still wider field for physical achievements . The exercises comprise running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammer , and similar sports . These afford an excellent chance for the specialist to display his abilities , and only specialists enter them . In their case the entire energy of the system has been concentrated on the development of special powers , and everything else set aside as useless . This is the great objection to athletic exercises as they are at present conducted . The gymnasts , as a separate class have , of late years , been rapidly diminishing in numbers . Outdoor sports have grown in popularity , and the gymnasium is now used , regularly and systematically , chiefly by the boating men and the ball-players , as a means of keeping up their strength during the long winter months , and of adding something to the skill required in their chosen sport . We have thus seen that the whole system of college athletics is based upon a spirit of competition . Symmetry of development is never thought of , nor is it ever acquired by exclusive reliance upon any of our popular sports . Indeed , we would venture to // select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball-players , and the gymnasts , simply from their peculiar innscular development . In many cases these peculiarities are so marked that one can readily distinguish a starboard from a port oar , the pitcher , catcher , and short-stop from the rest of the nine , and tell the piece of apparatus upon which a gymnast has won his distinction . To devote themselves wholly to some favorite sport ; to make a " record " that shall be talked about by future classes ; to become famous as oarsmen , or pedestrians , or ballplayers : these are the ambitions of the men who are giving their time to such exercises . The tendency of college students to-day is to look upon college athletics simply as a field for rivalry . We have thus far been speaking of the men whom we termed collectively the college athletes , but this class comprises only a small proportion of those who attend our literary institulions . There is a second class , whom we have called sporting men . In what does their physical culture consist * Mainly in attending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at a distance , a tramp to either calls for a little exertion , but in the exercises themselves the sporting men never participate . " Taiorizing " is for them a more convenient method of making up for physical deficiencies . They do the betting , and contribute largely to the financial support of the several athletic organizations ; but they are never seen in the waist of a boat or on the floor of a gymnasium . From this class of men , however , often comes the best athletic material . Their spirit and buoyancy are indicative of a good natural heritage , and with these innate qualities for a basis , a thorough system of training produces the most favorable results . It is just this kind of temperament that should find a legitimate channel for activity in systematic exercise . Let this exercise be mental or physical , laborious effort of some sort should be exacted daily . Perhaps the fatigue following physical effort is for this class the most beneficial , as it is rarely accompanied by nervous irritability , and it sets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe mental application . Still another class is composed of those men who attend strictly to the college requirements , and who may appropriately be termed the scholars . In this group are to be found the hardest intellectual workers , men who study almost incessantly during their waking hours , and among whom are some of the most // highly organized and finely balanced students in college . It is needless to say that these men take no time for exercise or recreation . They never go to a boat-race or a ball-match , and the feats of the gymnasium are distasteful to them . A hurried walk into the country some Saturday afternoon , or a ride to the seashore , gives a little exhilaration ; but physical effort of all kinds is irksome to a close student , and , unless he is accompanied by an agreeable companion , his mind is invariably brooding over some lesson or problem as he saunters along . Walking in this manner is merely taking an airing , and is no more beneficial than sitting by an open window . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively small number who direct their college course intelligently to the acquirement of symmetrical culture . Systematic habits of study are supplemented by systematic habits of exercise , and they would no more neglect one than the other . Such men are often called machine-workers , but they are the ones who profit most by their exercise , because they take it regularly and make it subservient to their highest aims . Of the idlers little need be said . They differ essentially from the classes we have considered , but chiefly in a negative way . They have no favorite pursuit , either intellectual or physical . They are surrounded by the stimulating influences of college life , but their inertia is seldom overcome , the golden days of youth are wasted , and the opportunities of mental and bodily training are carelessly thrown aside . In enumerating these four great classes we have not attempted to deal with the exceptional cases . That there are many such cases in every college we are well aware . But our purpose has been to bring out the prevailing characteristics of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompt them to exertion , and to review their efforts in the direction of physical culture . To summarize , we may say that the athletes devote too much time to the development of special powers , and sometimes carry their exercises to excess ; that the sporting men rely upon their inheritance , physical and financial , and make no attempt to renew their capital ; that the scholars , as a class , take too little exercise ; and that the idlers take no exercise at all . When we consider the relative numbers in these several classes in all our colleges , it is safe to conclude that , of the whole number of students , not more than ten per cent . give any attention whatever to physical exercise , and that less than six // per cent . take it systematically as a means of culture and development. * Surely , then , the charge that too much time is given to muscular education in our literary institutions has the slenderest possible foundation in the facts of the case . And it must be evident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nines are not in any proper sense representatives of the physical condition of the average students in their respective institutions . The bane of American college life to-day is the spirit of prize-getting which underlies and inspires the entire system . It is equally powerful in every department of education . It utterly destroys harmony of development . It unduly cultivates a student 's powers in one direction , and dwarfs and stunts his growth in every other . The valedictorian has no time for exercise , or is too weary to take it ; the champion athlete has no time for study , or is too stupid to begin it . One sits in his room with a wet towel about his head , and conscientiously works out his allotted task the other stretches himself upon a lounge and has the day 's lesson poured into him by admiring comrades . Both are toiling for fame , though in opposite directions . Both have won honors for their Alma Mater ; so she gives them the same certificate of acquirements . And as to subsequent usefulness in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a recognition of the supreme value of unity in education , of the harmonious cultivation of a man 's mental , moral , and physical nature . Now , we ask , if physical exercise is thought by our college faculties to be of so much importance that they should permit and encourage a certain class of students to devote two , three , and four hours a day to body culture , often to the neglect of their studies , would it not be well to make some provision for those who are not athletically inclined , but who are more in need of exercise , and to whom , if judiciously applied , it would be of the greatest benefit ? This is to be accomplished only by furnishing every fitting school and every college with a well-equipped gymnasium , by making its exercises a part of the regular curriculum , and by having them executed under the supervision of a competent instructor . By many institutions these requirements have been met in part ; that is , one college * The reader will understand that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the general interest in physical training among the students of Harvard , Yale , and some others of our larger Eastern institutions is exceptional and not representative . // is provided with a fine gymnasium , another has a good instructor , and a third has made its exercises obligatory . We know of but two or three institutions in the country where all these advantages are combined . The gymnasium is , and has been since the days of ancient Greece , the great school of physical education . All its appliances were invented for that purpose . And as gymnasiums are used to-day , why are they not a success ? Simply because they do not accomplish the object for which they were established : they fail to give every man who has access to them a complete and thorough physical training . But this is not the fault of the gymnasium in itself . Let us look at the building and the apparatus provided by some of our colleges , then at the manner of conducting the exercises , and then inquire as to the character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department and the principles upon which they are appointed . We shall doubtless find that the want of interest has not been wholly due to the obstinacy of students , but that the fault may be traced back , directly or indirectly , to the faculty or the boards of trustees and overseers . A gentleman gives forty or fifty thousand dollars for the erection of a gymnasium . The planning is handed over to an architect who has no idea of the kind of building required , but who feels it his duty to get up something that will at least be an ornament to the campus . He generally succeeds in doing this , and the donor and the corporation are satisfied . But what can be said of the structure , as to its fitness for a temple of health ? It is a building eighty feet long and half as many wide , poorly lighted , heated , and ventilated . The bath-rooms are on one floor , and the dressing-rooms in the attic or cellar . The walls , roughly finished in brick or granite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter . The floor is made of spruce , and its seams are filled with graveL In fact , incongruity and unfitness meet us on every side and in almost every detail . Why should this be so , when the amount of money contributed is large enough to meet all demands , and the ground space allotted is ample ? Because the architects and builders employed do not know the requirements of a good gymnasium , and seldom seek the advice of those who have practiced gymnastics for years , and have made a life-study of the subject . The result is an edifice not adapted to the work for which it was designed . Exceptions should be made of the finely constructed gymnasiums // at Harvard and Princeton ; nor would we judge too sternly those institutions which have been obliged to remodel an old building in order to have any gymnasium at all . Having put up a building , the authorities proceed to fill it with apparatus made by the college carpenter . This is arranged for appearance* sake rather than for use . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with little knowledge of its object or design . Hanging ropes are made of hemp , and stiffly tarred to make them durable . This object is effected , for they are never used twice by the same person . The parallel bars are broad at the base and narrow at the top , so as to render the grip insecure ; and they are generally made of some splintering material , in order to remind the performer which way he is going . The trapeze is bolted to a beam in the highest part of the room , and left pendent twenty-five feet from the floor . Its bars are made of wood or iron , two inches in diameter , and , that the novice may have every opportunity of losing his balance , holes are made in the ends of each bar , the ropes put through and tied with knots underneath . The rungs on the horizontal ladder are three-quarters of an inch in diameter , and left rough , so that they may be firmly grasped , while in the vertical ladders they are smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first case , every swing forward raises a blister ; and in the second case , every step upward is attended with positive danger . The sand-bag weighs seventy-five pounds , and is covered with the heaviest kind of canvas . One solid blow removes the skin from every knuckle , and makes an impression that lasts for a life-time . This performance is never repeated . The mattresses weigh four hundred pounds each , and are filled with excelsior , or corn-husks , which from constant rolling have become matted together in lumps . One had better land upon the floor than upon one of these cradle-knolls , for the former only occasions a little tingling of the feet , while the latter invariably causes a sprained ankle . The weights are neither boxed in wood , nor framed in iron ; but they start from a trough filled with saw-dust and dirt . Every movement is accompanied by a cloud of dust and a deafening rattle and bang . This is a fair representation of college gymnasiums throughout the country . They are built without intelligent plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perilous apparatus , and then left open to the hap-hazard experiment of all who choose // to try them . With however good intentions of self-improvement a student may enter a college , he is disheartened at the outset by such a gymnasium as this . He finds no appliances adapted to his needs as a beginner , and no provision for progressive development . Constant assistance and direction are offered him in every branch of college work save this ; here he finds nothing worthy of the name of instruction . When we consider that two-thirds of the students who enter college are not strong enough to use the heavy apparatus with pleasure or profit , the need of introductory apparatus becomes apparent . Wooden dumb-bells and Indian clubs do not meet this need . Something is demanded by which the biceps and triceps may be brought into alternate action , and the muscles of the back , loins , abdomen , and chest , according to their requirements . If those desiring to use the heavy apparatus would prepare themselves for it by bringing the required muscles into gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step through a progressive series of exercises , they would not only find themselves increasing in power , but they would experience a certain satisfaction and acquire a discipline from the accomplishment of difficult maneuvers , which no mechanical exertion can give . The apparatus which leads one gradually up to the beneficial use of the heavy appliances may be termed adjustable weights and pulicys . These can be so arranged as to act upon any set of muscles and be adapted to any condition of strength or weakness . In order that they may be used wisely , some one should be in attendance who has a thorough knowledge of animal mechanics and the action of the muscles , as well as a comprehensive idea of the structure and function of the various organs upon which vital action depends . This brings us to a consideration of the men who are chosen to superintend the department of physical education . For every other branch of college instruction men of recognized ability are selected , and they are then required to maintain a certain standard of excellence . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen fit to make an exception . When we find the gymnasium almost deserted , there is a cause aside from poor apparatus and unattractive quarters . It is the lack of a suitable man , with sufficient authority , at the head of the department  --  a man who is a college graduate , a practical gymnast , and an educated physician . Such a man , we say , must have sufficient authority ; for , unless he is supreme in // his own department , and can have the cooperation of the faculty , lie can do no better work than an inferior man with more freedom . Many instructors possess one or more of these qualifications . Thus , some are college graduates , others are educated physicians , and a few are practical gymnasts ; but all the requirements are seldom found'in the same person . This is only because there has been no demand for such men . So long as college boards look upon the position as one of minor importance , and pay but a mere pittance to its incumbent , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for its arduous duties . Consequently these positions to-day are occupied by men who are nuder-graduate students working for their tuition , students in medicine or law , tutors in some other branch of college instruction , or resident physicians . In only three or four instances are thoroughly trained gymnasts employed to superintend the gymnasinm . Under such circumstances the men are obliged to make their gymnasium work a secondary consideration , and a man can not do his whole duty by this department and attend to another at the same time . Yet this is what nearly every college instructor in gymnastics is doing . He intends to make his present position a stepping-stone to something else . He devotes as little time as possible to its duties , and expends his energies in preparing for his life 's pursuit . As soon as he gets his diploma he resigns his position and makes room for the next incumbent . It matters little who his successor is , but to meet the demands of the times some one must be catalogued for the place . The demoralizing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can readily be seen by those who care to visit our college gymnasiums . We say , then , that the proper physical training of our youth can never be accomplished until our gymnasiums are put in good hygienic condition , are furnished with appropriate apparatus , and are placed in charge of thoroughly competent instructors . To these requirements we will add the most important one of all : that the gymnasium exercises be made a part of the regular curriculum . So far as relates to the training of the mind , a system of required exercises has been universally adopted ; but the training of the body has seldom been deemed of sufficient importance to merit like care and attention . We can not but believe that this mistaken idea has arisen from a misconception of the real function of physical exercise , and of // its powerful influence upon the system at large . So long as body and mind are kept in antagonism , and the demands of one thought to be prejudicial to the interests of the other , but little advancement can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that the object of muscular exercise is not to develop muscle only , but to increase the functional capacity of the organs of respiration , circulation , and nutrition ; not to gain in physical endurance merely , but to augment the working power of the brain ; not to attain bodily health and beauty alone , but to break up morbid mental tendencies , to dispel the gloomy shadows of despondency , and to insure serenity of spirit ; when men shall have learned that much of the ill-temper , malevolence , and uncharitableness which pervade society arises from feeble health , and that the great mental and moral disturbances which sometimes threaten the stability of a government may be traced to physical causes , then will the training of the body rival in dignity and importance the training of the mind , for the interests of mind and body will be recognized as inseparable . This time is coming , though as yet some of our best and greatest thinkers , while admitting the value of physical exercise as an agent of health , still doubt the expediency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a college is designed to give a boy an intellectual training , and is in no way responsible for his health and physical welfare . But when we consider that it takes from six to twelve years for a boy to complete his education , that during this time he is almost constantly away from home , and that it is a period with him when the body is peculiarly susceptible to good or evil influences , it would seem that those under whose charge he is placed should have some intelligent care of his physical as well as of his mental and moral training . When boys come from the fitting school equally prepared in body and in mind for the duties before them , it will then do to talk of making our higher institutions of learning training schools for the intellect alone . But , while they are filled with students whose minds have been forced and * in order to build a reputation for masters and tutors ; while class after class enters college well grounded in the classics and totally ignorant of the first principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the want of physical stamina ; while precarious health is the rule and a sound and vigorous constitution the exception , it is little // less than criminal folly to talk of such a course . The body must be eared for , and when and how are the only questions open for discussion . If our preparatory schools were more generally patronized , and more liberally furnished with appropriate appliances , we should say that here was the field for physical training . But under present conditions the work , if done at all , must be done in college ; and in college the first essential is to put this work on an equal footing with every other . If attendance at chapel or recitations is required , then attendance at the gymnasium should be insisted upon . Make this one of the stated requirements , and the student will look upon it as upon any other college duty . The great majority of students are disposed to do what is thought to be best for them , and the complaint arises-when complaint is heard - from a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make provision for regular advancement in the exercises which they have introduced . To keep a class drilling from two to four years with wooden dumb-bells and Indian clubs only , is as great a mistake in a scheme of physical education as it would be to confine the same class exclusively to the study of geometry , with a view to giving them a thorough mental training . Such exercises are elementary in their nature , and in a prescribed course they should precede all others . But , after they have done their work , which is to supple the joints , rather than to develop the muscles , the student should be allowed to go higher . A change is necessary , not only to meet the demands of increasing strength , but to keep up an interest . The pupil must have something to look forward to , something to struggle with and to master . In no place can a system of physical culture be carried out better than in a well-disciplined college . Before the freshman class begins gymnasium work every member should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before entering college . Then , instead of putting all in one class , and adapting the prescribed exercises to the capacity of the weakest , grade the class according to the needs of its individual members , and arrange the exercises to correspond . Those with flat chests and consumptive tendencies should be put in one squad ; those with weak backs and slender waists in another ; those with strong bodies , but undeveloped limbs , in a third ; and so on , until the whole class has been divided into squads composed of men of like capacity , and requiring similar treatment . The duration // of this special training would , of course , depend upon the condition of each student , and should be left to the discretion of the instructor . After personal deficiencies have thus been corrected , the students should be transferred to the regular gymnastic class , and the members of this class should be led on from one piece of apparatus to another , until all the popular appliances of the gymnasium have been brought into service . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowing some freedom of choice , a lively interest could be maintained which would add greatly to the benefit of the exercise . At the close of the first year the class should be examined in their work , and be grouped the next year according to their proficiency . The books of the director should be open to inspection , and the vital statistics of each man recorded at the beginning of the year could be compared with those taken at the close . By such a system the physical condition of every student in college could be readily ascertained , and the value of regular and progressive exercise be put to the test . The course that we have described is essentially practicable ,  --  is , indeed , substantially that pursued at Harvard University ,  --  and we believe it to be the only one by which the gymnasium can be made to minister to the wants of all , and its exercises rendered educational . As a rule , students take about the same rank in required gymnastics that they do in their regular studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better morale , we will not attempt to say . But we can say that those who fail in their studies , for want of application or habits of attention , will be likely to fail in gymnastics for the same reason . Mental characteristics always manifest themselves in physical exercises . We mention this in order to dispel the idea so generally entertained , that , in the so-called physical exercises , brute strength always predominates . Brain and nerve-substance is behind every wellcontrolled muscular movement . Indeed , the two are so closely connected that it is hard to tell what is due to the mind , and what to the body . In the system which we propose , we do not leave out of consideration boating , base-ball , and other popular pastimes . But we would have them regarded as recreative exercises , and as such taken during the hours allotted to pleasure and relaxation . So far as they go , they afford the best kind of development ; but , to // those who pursue these sports vigorously and earnestly , gymnastics must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a course adapted to bring into action the muscles which their particular pastime has left unemployed . By such a method the gymnasium is made not only a school of physical training , but a school of moral discipline . The accomplishment of difficult feats may not in itself amount to much ; but the required development , the habits of self-control , and the rapid and responsible exercise of judgment which is so frequently called for , are powers gained , and can not fail to be of service to a man in any vocation in life . In looking over the whole field of physical sports and games we can find nothing so well adapted to the complete muscular education of youth as the exercises of a well-appointed , wellconducted gymnasium . Every variety of apparatus can be in* troduced , all the movements can be arranged in a progressive series , and the entire system can be adjusted to meet and remedy the physical defects of each individual student . The times are ripe for action on this subject . Public thought is turning to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if nothing can help them to resist the destructive wear and waste of American business life . When insanity and the hundred forms of nervous diseases are on the increase , and when thousands of our educated young men are falling out in the battle of life for the want of strength and vigor , there is room for anxious questioning about our methods of physical training . Help must come from some source . And the suggestions which we have briefly offered in the present article we believe will secure the approval , because they will appeal to the reason of iritefligent thinkers . D. A.
