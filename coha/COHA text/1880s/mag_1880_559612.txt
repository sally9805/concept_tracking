THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY JUDGED BY ITS HISTORY . THE time is far distant when the people of this country can be persuaded to judge a political party by its platform and professions , without reference to its practices and history . Having been taught this lesson in the severe school of experience , the Democratic party is now earnestly striving to unload its history ; to cast off its old and bad character . Unfortunately , it makes no satisfactory effort to substitute , in place of the old one , a new history which will be beneficial to the country or creditable to itself , or to build up such a new character as can only be done by a complete change of conduct . The Democratic party of to-day is substantially the Democratic party of 1860 . It had a solid South then ; it has a solid South now . It rallied around its banners then the great mass of the dangerous classes in the large cities ; it rallies them still . The draft-rioters of 1863 in the city of New York were Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in 1860 counted for its success upon the States of New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , and Indiana , to add to its solid South ; it counts upon those States still . In 1860 it asserted the sovereignty of the States , and denied the right of coercion ; in 1880 it , to all intents and purposes , announces // the same doctrine in its denial of the authority of the General Government to enforce its laws , even after their constitutional validity has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States . Time has made ravages in its ranks , but nevertheless its membership is practically the same to-day as in 1860 . Toombs , Jefferson Davis , Hampton , Hill , Gordon , and Lamar , were among the leaders of the Democratic party South in 1860 ; they are to-day . Hancock , Seymour , Bayard , English , Thurman , and Ben Butler were among the leaders of the Democratic party Xorth in 1860 ; and they are so still . The rank and file remain substantially the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , in the main , the places made vacant by decease or casualties are made good by immigration and by the natural increase of population in the quarters where Democratic majorities are usually found . In 1856 the Democratic party declared that " Congress has no power to charter a national bank ; that we believe such an institution one of deadly hostility to the best interests of the country , dangerous to our republican institutions and the liberties of the people , and calculated to place the business of the country within the control of a centralized money power and above the laws and the will of the people . " It affirms this doctrine in 1880 , for its platform asserts , " We pledge ourselves anew to the constitutional doctrines and traditions of the Democratic party . " In its platform of 1856 it resolves : " That the Democratic party will faithfully abide by and uphold the principles laid down in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions of 1798 , and in the report of Mr. Madison to the Virginia Legislature in 1799 ; that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of its political creed , and is resolved to carry them out in their obvious meaning and import . " Having pledged itself anew to its constitutional doctrines and traditions , the conclusion is inevitable that the Democratic party of to-day is as thoroughly committed to the doctrines of " State sovereignty " as it has ever been . Endorsing those doctrines in 1856 , as " constituting one of the main foundations of its political creed , " and resolving to " carry them out in their obvious meaning and import , " it renews that pledge in 1880 . In 1860 both branches of the Democratic party reaffirmed the platform of 1856 . In 1864 it resolved , " That , in the future , as in the past , we will adhere with unswerving fidelity to the Union under the Constitu // tion . " It also more specifically sets forth its doctrines and purposes in the resolution declaring " That the aim and object of the Democratic party is to preserve the Federal Union and the rights of the States unimpaired . " Making practical application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does explicitly declare , as the sense of the American people , that after fouir years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war , during which , under the pretense of a military necessity or war-power higher than the Constitution , the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every part , and public liberty and private right alike trodden down , and the material prosperity of the country essentially impaired , justice , humanity , liberty , and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities with a view to the ultimate convention of the States , or other peaceable means , to the end that at the earliest practicable moment peace may be restored on the basis of the Federal Union of the States . " It will not escape observation that , in its platform of 1864* , the Democratic party was entirely silent as to the right of the Government to prosecute the war for its own preservation . It reaffirmed the State-sovereignty ideas of its previous platforms ; it denounced the measures which the Government employed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " experiment , " and that experiment a " failure " ; it demanded a cessation of hostilities and a restoration of peace on a basis consistent with its old doctrines . Unchanged in spirit and policy , the Democratic party in 1880 pledges itself anew to its " constitutional doctrines and traditions . " The courage , patriotism , and endurance of the people answered the Democratic platform of 1864 , crushed the rebellion , and defeated its armies . The war was not a failure . The work of reconstruction followed , and , looking to peace and security for the future , the loyal masses determined that the Union should be restored upon a basis that would secure to all its citizens perfect equality of political privileges and immunities ; an unmistakable denial of the Democratic doctrine of State sovereignty , a denial of the right of ' secession , and the extirpation of slavery . True to its history and to its " constitutional doctrines and traditions , " the Democratic party opposed this method of reconstruction . It demanded in the platform for 1868 " Immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union under the Constitution , and of civil government to the American people . " // It emphasized its general demand by specific denunciations and declarations . It resolved that any attempt by Congress to interfere with any State in regulating the suffrage of its citizens " is a flagrant usurpation of power which can find no warrant in the Constitution , . . . and that we regard the reconstruction acts ( so called ) of Congress , as such , as usurpations , and unconstitutional , revolutionary , and void . " It indulged in the most gloomy forebodings as to the future if the reconstruction policy were pursued , and , speaking of Congress , held this solemn language : " Under its repeated assaults , the pillars of the government are rocking on their base , and , should it succeed in November next and inaugurate its President , we will meet as a subjected and conquered people amid the ruins of liberty and the scattered fragments of the Constitution . " It concluded its declarations , denunciations , and resolutions concerning the aggressive measures of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future by an unqualified endorsement of Andrew Johnson in these words : " That the President of the United States , Andrew Johnson , in exercising the power of his high office in resisting the aggressions of Congress upon the constitutional rights of the States and the people , is entitled to the gratitude of the whole American people , and in behalf of the Democratic party we tender him our thanks for his efforts in that regard . " To all these doctrines the Democratic party has in the year 1880 pledged itself anew with especial emphasis , for it has placed at the head of its ticket one who was in full sympathy with that platform ; who so expressed himself at the time of its adoption by the Democratic Convention ; who helped to make up the history out of which the platform itself was constructed ; who in New Orleans assisted Andrew Johnson in resisting the " aggressions of Congress " ; who attempted to nullify the reconstruction measures , which this platform denounced as usurpations , unconstitutional , revolutionary , and void ; who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Sheridan ; who left the field of duty , to which he had been assigned by Andrew Johnson , in disgust , because General Grant stood behind him and revoked him and his policy ; who endeavored to restore rebel civil authorities in a State in which Congress declared " no legal State government or adequate protection for life or property " then existed ; and who in most vehement language denounced any one who assumed that he did not thoroughly // concur in and endorse this platform , upon which he ( General Winfield Scott Hancock ) declared that he unqualifiedly stood . These declarations of principles , thus from time to time made by the Democratic party , are emphasized by the action of that party in Congress upon all measures looking to the reconstruction of the Union upon a solid and just foundation . That party opposed the fourteenth constitutional amendment ; for in the vote upon that amendment in the Senate every Democrat voted nay , and in the House the negative vote was a solid Democratic one . The reconstruction acts were opposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed the fifteenth constitutional amendment . The vote stood-in the Senate , yeas thirty-nine , all Republicans ; nays , thirteen , all Democrats , including James R. Doolittle : in the House , nays forty-four , all Democrats . These amendments having been adopted , it steadily and solidly opposed all legislation looking to their enforcement . The enforcement bill passed the Senate May , 1870 , encountering there a solid Democratic opposition , and also a solid Democratic opposition in the House . It has repeatedly refused to affirm the validity of the fourteenth and fifteenth constitutional amendments . This steady and persistent opposition to those great measures has extended to the States . The Democratic Legislatures of the States of New York and Indiana withdrew the previous ratification by preceding Republican Legislatures of those amendments . In 1871 a resolution reciting the action of the Indiana Democratic Legislature , and reaffirming the validity of those amendments , encountered in the House a negative vote of seventy-six , all Democrats , and that party also opposed by a solid vote the Ku-klux and amendatory enforcement acts . In 1872 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for a resolution ratifying the validity of those amendments . In 1875 it opposed by a solid party vote in the House and in the Senate the supplementary civil rights bill ; and in National Convention assembled in 1880 it declares , " We pledge ourselves anew to the constitutional doctrines and traditions of the Democratic party as illustrated by the teaching and example of a long line of Democratic patriots and statesmen . " On these great questions the Democratic party is , from its history , doctrines , and traditions , shown to have been , and to be , reactionary and revolutionary . Denouncing the reconstruction measures in 1868 as usurpations , revolutionary , unconstitutional* and void , and renewing its pledge // to its former doctrines and traditions in 1880 , it is fair to assume that , if the opportunity presented by an enlargement of the Supreme Court to have that doctrine judicially declared unconstitutional , the Democratic party would avail itself of such an opportunity , and wreck not only those reconstruction measures , but the constitutional amendments which have their foundation upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly forewarned . The havoc which would come from the successful carrying out of Democratic doctrines and traditions , involving all business interests , all legitimate enterprises in ruin , is too obvious to require comment . In 1872 , made wiser by long-continued defeats , the Democratic party undertook to conceal its heretical notions of State sovereignty under the jingling phraseology of home rule and local self-government . Repudiated in 1872 and again in 1876 , in its platform in 1880 it is content to declare in general terms , " Opposition to centralizationism and to that dangerous spirit of encroachment which tend to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one , and thus to create , whatever be the form of government , a real despotism " ; and again , by its third plank , for " home rule . " These are merely different coverings for the same idea , and taken in connection with a solid South  --  a South made solid by midnight raids , by a system of terrorism which drives all opposition from the polls , or by a fraudulent count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to doubt that the Democratic party of today is as dangerous in spirit and purpose to the best interests of the country as it has ever been . Its record on financial questions has been continuously bad . I have noted the fact that in 1856 it declared against a national bank and denied the power of Congress to charter one . I may add that during the war it opposed all schemes for the creation of the national currency  --  the greenback and the national-bank note ; that in Congress it denounced both as unconstitutional ; that it has been a constant menace to the public credit ; and that at the first opportunity which presented after the close of the war , in its National Convention in 1868 , it demanded a line of policy which , had it been pursued , would have involved the country in the crime and covered it with the shame of repudiation . It demanded the payment of the public debt of the United States as rapidly as practicable , and yet declared , " Where the obligations of the Government do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made under which they were issued does not provide they shall be paid in coin , they ought // in right and justice to be paid in the lawful money of the United States , " thus demanding the payment of the national debt in greenbacks . It also demanded equal " taxation of every species of property according to its real value , including Government bonds and other public securities . " Upon this issue it went before the people in 1868 and was defeated ; and this suicidal and dishonest doctrine received the hearty and unqualified endorsement and approval of their present candidate for President , General Winfield Scott Hancock . In 1876 Mr. Tilden took charge of the " literary remains " of the Democratic party , and manufactured a platform which could be made available at the North , embodying in it some sound financial views , but denouncing the Republican party as being- guilty of impeding resumption . The rank and file of the party understood the purpose of the platform perfectly well , and were not deceived or misled by it , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their national platform had been adopted , they demanded the immediate repeal of the resumption act . The doctrines of the party on financial questions should be sought in the action of the representatives of that party on those questions in Congress . In 1869 the public credit bill was opposed in Congress by the nearly solid vote of the Democratic party . In January , 1876 , the bill to repeal the resumption act received one hundred and twelve votes , all Democrats but one . In June , 1876 , as a rider to the civil appropriation bill , an amendment repealing the resumption act received solid Democratic support . Evidently the party had not been converted by its platform . In August , 1876 , a measure to repeal the fixing of the time for resumption received in the House one hundred and six votes , all Democrats but three . And as late as 1878 , in very many States , Democratic Conventions demanded the immediate repeal of the resumption act . These are the doctrines of the party , not merely as declared by its representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party , in National Convention assembled , declares : " We pledge ourselves anew to the constitutional doctrines and traditions of the Democratic party as illustrated by the teaching and example of a long line of Democratic statesmen and patriots . " It makes in its platform of 1880 high-sounding pretensions of reform , and claims to have reduced the public expenditures forty millions of dollars per year . But the methods by which this- pre // tended reduction of expenditures has been effected are , when properly considered , gross extravagances . It has reduced the army and cut down the pay of its officers ; it has refused to make appropriations for the payment of judgments against the United Statesthus making no real reduction in expenditures , for these judgments must ultimately be paid ; it has refused to make appropriations for the payment of the expenses of our Federal courts , thus in very many districts throughout the country reducing us to the necessity of adjourning courts from time to time , because no means have been furnished to pay juries or defray the ordinary court expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public buildings , thus in the long run increasing the expenditures rather than diminishing them ; it has cut down the service in the Department of the Interior , and other departments , to such an extent that business in the Patent-Office and in the Pension Bureau is greatly in arrears ; it has refused to make adequate appropriation for the revenue-cutter service ; it has refused to make adequate appropriations for the repair and protection of navy-yards , stations , armories , and arsenals ; it has refused to make adequate appropriations for lighthouses , beacons , and fog-stations . These were not wise and economical reductions of public expenditures ; they were wasteful and demagogical extravagances . In the mean time the volume of Southern claims for losses during the war has multiplied , and the demands made by the South for appropriations for the improvement of their rivers , and for other purposes , are becoming more and more vehement . Their platform calls for a free ballot , and General Hancock asserts that " neither fraud nor force must be allowed to subvert the rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit instrument for collecting the votes of freemen " ; and that " it is only by a full vote , free ballot , and fair count that the people can rule in fact , as required by the theory of our Government . " This is certainly sound doctrine , but he should apply it to his own party  --  the party of which he is to-day the head and representative . There is no free ballot in the South , from which he confidently expects 138 electoral votes . In 1872 the Republican vote of Alabama was 90,272 ; in 1878 it was nothing . In 1872 the Republican vote of Arkansas was 41,373 ; in 1878 it was 115 . In 1872 the Republican vote of Mississippi was 82,175 ; in 1878 it was 1,168 . These enormous reductions of the Republican vote can not be attributed to the conversion of Republicans through the agency of Mr. Tilden 's Literary Bureau , or by le // gitimate methods . That vote was reduced by terrorism , by violence , by fraud . The Democratic majority in the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is returned at 92,000 ; but this , all concede , is larger than the entire Democratic vote of the State . Surely , in the language of General Hancock , " it is only by a full vote , free ballot , and fair count that the people can rule in fact . " But here are instances where upon one side there is no vote ; where upon one side the ballot is fettered ; where upon one side the ballot is not counted at alL Ordinarily the bayonet is not a fit instrument for collecting the votes of freemen , but the constitutional amendments guarantee this free vote , and provide that Congress shall enforce the provisions of those articles by appropriate legislation . If the ballot can be gathered in no other way than by the bayonet , I know of no better use to which the bayonet can be devoted . And , if the ballot-box is surrounded by men organized and armed to prevent the casting of the ballot , the bayonet will be employed for a very lofty purpose if used to prick those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national guarantee of the free ballot must be respected and must be obeyed . So far as the industrial interests of the country are concerned , the Democratic platform of 1880 voices the long-known and wellunderstood ideas of the party . It hates protection , it has always opposed it , and in its present platform it speaks unqualifiedly for a tariff for revenue only . That General Hancock is in full accord with this doctrine of the party is evident from his letter of acceptance , for he says , " The principles enumerated by the Convention are those I have cherished in the past , and shall endeavor to maintain in the future . " The Democratic Convention enumerated its principles , and under the fourth enumeration is found the doctrine of a tariff for revenue only . General Hancock declares that this principle he has " cherished in the past , " and further avers that he will " endeavor to maintain it in the future . " The position of General Garfield upon this question is outspoken , clear , and unmistakable . From 1866 down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent friend of protection to American industries . He has exhibited this friendship to this great interest not merely by.his speeches , but by his votes . He joined with other Republican members of the Committee of Ways and Means in a minority report opposing Mr. Wood 's tariff bill , and his votes during the last session of Congress have always been found on that committee in harmony with his position . // General Hancock declares in his letter of acceptance that the constitutional amendments are inviolable , but he will hardly undertake to declare that he would veto any measure which a Democratic majority might pass for the enlargement of the Supreme Court , or that he would veto any measure which the same party might pass repealing the laws now on the statute-book for the enforcement of those amendments . With the Supreme Court thus enlarged and those statutes repealed , the constitutional amendments would be ( as every one knows ) nullities . Declaring himself to be in favor of a free ballot , he must be quite well aware that his party in Congress has repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone can anything approximating a free ballot and a fair count be secured in our great cities in the North , through which alone can the perpetration of gross frauds in the ballot-box in the great Northern cities be prevented . The solid South does not desire the repeal of those election laws for its own purposes - the shot-gun , the midnight raid , and the fraudulent count have sufficiently nullified those laws there . Their repeal is demanded , however , by the Democratic party , in order that the States of New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut may be added to the solid South . And surely General Hancock will not undertake to say that , in the event of his election , should those statutes be repealed , he will veto such repealing measures . But without such veto we should have neither a free ballot nor a fair count . In view of the history of the Democratic party , which I have thus hurriedly traced , drawing it from its platforms and its votes in Congress , it is not at all strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but a people who have suffered , so much from that history will not forget it . With this history behind it , with no honest effort to reverse its policy , which in the past has been so dangerous , the Democratic party , failing to furnish any additional reasons for an increase of public confidence in it or in its policy , demands that the public confidence , so long withheld , shall be restored to it . Standing in the midst of an unrivaled prosperity , due in a great measure to an honest administration of public affairs , which the Democratic party has steadily opposed , occupying a position where all business and industrial interests are solidly thriving , the people of this country desire no change which would reverse the policy that has led us up to these magnificent results .
