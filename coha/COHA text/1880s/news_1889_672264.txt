txt The story of Jacob Hess 's connection with Edward Lauterbach 's Anchor Brewing Company of Dobbs Ferry made by THE TIMES yesterday interested professional politicians almost as much as professional electricians . In the case of each the prevalent sentiment was the same . It was felt that the bottom had begun to drop out of a combination which was full of danger to public interests , and which bad been realizing for some months the absence of its architect and its soul , Maurice B. Flynn . For , in all that has yet been learned of the delay in putting the wires under ground , which has won for Commissioners and subway company alike the distrust of the public , the personalty of the dead contractor seems to be the hinge on which everything hangs . Flynn 's estate , now owned chiefly by his widow , the daughter of Theodore Moss , Secretary of the Board of Electrical Control , is known to be still heavily interested in the stock of the Subway Construction Company , which . claims , and to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building o1 subways in this city . Flynn 's estate is represented by Edward Lauterbach , who is also counsel for the Subway Construction Company . He appears to have thoroughly appreciated the future importance of electricity in its manifold applications . The electric railway at Richmond , Va. , in which he invested , is the one which is cow causing litigation and trouble to Mrs. Flynn . Richmond has no Board of Electrical Control bequeathed to is by Flynn . Such an institution might be ol great service in smoothing over difficulties . Political friends of Jacob Hess were loud hr their denunciation yesterday of the " assault " which THE TIMES was said to have made upon the Commissioner . They said Mr. Hess had " played in hard luck , ' but had never been . guilty of any other offense against the not too rigid code of morality in politics . They were slow to believe that he had really come under the control of the Flynn dynasty in electrical affairs . Mr. Hess himself , however , did not seem to take the matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his officesin the rooms occupied by the Board of Elect-Heal Control since it moved out of the theatre which Mr. Moss owns . He said the story in THE TIMES was " misleading . " but would not say it was false . " It is true , " he said , " that on the first organization of the Anchor Brewing Company I was elected Vice President . It is true that my name appears among the incorporators of that company . But I never held a share of stock in that concern and never saw a share of it . I was in the West when the incorporation took place . Prior to that time  --  about three years ago , I think  --  I was approached by Mr. Deatech , whom had known tor years . and was informed that he had bought out a brewery at Dobbs Ferry . He asked me if I could n't do something to help push the sale of the beer . I agreed to do anything I could in that way . That was the last I heard of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did u .. t go near the meetings of the Board or Directors . In fact , I never attended one of them , and had nothing to do with the management " " How many shares of stook were transferred to your name when you became one of the incorporators and an officer of that company 1 " " I do not know . I never inquired . I have no doubt I should have heard of it if more than the single share of stook necessary under the law had been put in my name . But the fact is I never thought of myself as one of the owners of that concern . I had not invested a dollar in it then , and never have . But I presume that I have a right to a private business if I choose to have one . " " Did you keep your promise to help push the sale of the beers " " I did . and have done so right along . " " And what was to be your remuneration for such work I " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gash or stock . was ever stipulated for . I d knew the men ( unlearned , an had no doubt that if-the . brewery ever became a . paylng propertyl'should be fairly treated . " " And your brother 4 " ? " My brother was for some time Superintendent of their Dottling establishment . He was on salary . and had no earthly connection with the ownership . " In conclusion , Mr. Hess denied that he had ever been influenced in his official action by this indefinite connection with Mr. Lauterbach . " I have known Lauterbach for thirty years . " he exclaimed , " and it would n't grieve me a bit It he were to give me an opportunity to make some money in a square way . But I never did make a dollar out of my acquaintance with him in any way , shape , or manna : up to the present time . " Mr. Lauterbaola was also visited by a TIMES reporter yesterday afternoon . He was not half so positive in his denial of Mr. Hess 's connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . What troubled him most was that he had been put in a position where he might be suspected or having tried to suppress the truth . Any such desire had been furthest from his mind . " I was busy with other matters , to which I have to give a little time , " said lie , " when the representative of THE TIMES called on we yesterday . It was true , as I told him , toot Mr. Hess never invested a cent , never drew out a cent , and is not in any manner interested in the Anchor Brewing Company . But the tact that he was one of the incorporators named when the articles were filed had actually slipped my recollection . " " Hew much stock has Mr. Hess ever held in that companyr " I am not sure that he ever held any . Certainly he did not have more than a single share , and I am not at all certain that we really complied with the statutory demand and transferred that snare to him . I think , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active mover in that affair all the way through , though I put up most of the money . I remember , now that I have had time to recall the facts , that when we needed live incorporators he ? suo'kested that Mr. Hess would act , and , having known the gentleman fur many years , I acceded to the proposition . " " . What was Mr. Simon Hess 's position in the company I " " Only that of a salaried employe . He was strictly a selling agent , and in his ettorts in that capacity , his brother helped him . He had been originally employed at Mr. Jacob Hess 's request . That is the only favor or benefit the latter ever has received from the Anchor Brewing Company . " e Was he to get nothing for pushing the sale of your besrl " " Nothing was premised him . I supposed be was doing it in order to help Simon Hess keep his position . " The Manhattan Electric Light Company is another of the corporations for which Mr. Lauterback Is counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any injunction in toe present crisis and has not been interfered with . The Commissioners explain this curious fact by the assertion that this company is of later organization than others and has always used ? heavier copper wire and more perfect insulation . Mr. Hess declares that the board has shown no partiality to this concern , and is as ready to out off wires of the Manhattan 's as of any other company if their insulation is found to be imperfect . But the failure to obtain an injunction is held by most observers to be au evidence of security on the Part of that company fairly worthy of note . It has not yet appeared that either Commissioner Moss or the estate of his son-in-law is directly interested in the Manhattau Company . The latter furnishes arc lights and uses the regular high-tension current to supply them . Its insulation is substantially the same as that on the new wires- now being put up by the United States and other companies . A well-known electrician who has watched the present struggle very closely remarked yesterday : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run . Proper insulation under ground , exclusive of the subway rentals , would cost nearly a dollar a foot . Toe wire would have to be surrounded with gotty percha or rubber , paratline and heavy lean , or iron pipe . The best insulated wires now being put up in place of old ones are comparatively inexpensive . And by doing this work on overhead wires now , while the injunctions are pondInv , the companies will be able to keep public opinion quiet and keep the wires above ground for years to come . That is what they want , of course , and the refusal of the Board of Electrical Control to support Mayor Grant in me proposal to break tip the subway building monopoly probably gave the companies wore real satisfaction than any other course that could have been taken .
