txt The notion of a single organization embracing " labor " and aiming to benefit it at the expense of capital lay at the foundation of the order of Knights of Labor . As was shown theoretically when the order was established , and as has been shown practically since , this notion is a great delusion . As VON MOLTKE said of the notion of universal peace , it was " a dream , and not even a beautiful dream . " For there is no ground either in theory or practice for believing that if men who work for wages controlled our industrial and social affairs they would use their power more wisely or more unselfishly than men who pay wages . The delusion lay in supposing that 10,000 men out of work were any stronger , except for purposes of riot and destruction , than 1,000 , or that they could inflict any inconvenience on society from which they themselves would not be the first and worst sufferers . But if one general organization of labor be impossible , and injurious if it were possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one such organization . Yet in point of fact it appears that there will soon be no less than three contending for the allegiance and the assessments of labor . POWDERLY has withstood all the efforts of ambitious and dissatisfied Knights to oust him , and will continue to manage what is left of that noble and holy order to suit himself . Then there is the American Federation of Labor , the plan of which differs in detail from that of the Knights , but has the same object of securing associated action among men engaged in different industries and distributed over a great area . Finally , the mutineers against the rule of POWDERLY are organizing a third order . This reduction to an absurdity of the notion of a general organization of labor can scarcely fail , one would suppose , to impress the dullest of unskilled laborers with a doubt whether he will get anything in return for any contributions he may be induced to make to the treasury of any one of these three societies . As soon as he makes up his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have this in common , that they enable the eulogists of manual labor to live without resorting to it . POWDERLY 'S salary list is said to amount to about $50,000 , being the wages of 100 unskilled laborers . The other two orders can scarcely hope to be so successful in catching gudgeons , but it will go hard if they do not attract a membership large enough to enable their organizers to live better and more easily than they could live by working at their trades . When the Knights were at the height of their power it was doubtless a satisfaction for a striker to reflect that , even if he did not succeed in getting more pay or less work , he had power enough in virtue of his connection with the Knights to injure his own employer and other employers , and to obstruct business and industry generally . The or-. der was efficient for that purpose , though no workingman can now say that he is the better for its existence , unless he be one of the select workingmen who draw salaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row for his money , and the new order is not likely to give him even so much return as ho received from the Knights . The Federation of Labor is in its plan somewhat more rational than either of the other organizations , because it does not aim to comprehend all labor . but only such trades as havoa#9ady unions of their own , audit is an aggregation of these unions . Even here , when one particularly inquires into it , it is seen that the interests of the different trades are not identical , and that there is really nothing that an organization of , all of them can do for the members of any one that could not be better done by a strong union of that trade alone concerning the whole country . Such a union , sensibly administered , is a great force , as the history of the Brotherhood of Engineers sufficiently shows . But the benefits of organization can not be carried beyond the limits of a single trade , or at most a single branch of industry , as , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , not nearly so wild a dream as a union of all labor , skilled and . unskilled . To make such a union effective it would need to be rich enough to support in idleness all the unemployed who would otherwise apply for the vacancies that were made by every strike of unskilled labor .
