txt A brief and unsuccessful careersof speculation in the Chicago grain markets was to-day ended by suicide . The ' V ' atm was J. A. West , of Cincinnati , an Englishman , of fine appearance , who is understood to be connected with a wealthy English family of the same namo . West came to Chicago about five weeks ago from Cincinnati , where ho had been in business as a cotton broker , leaving his wife and family at home . Iie took up quarters at the Commercial Hotel , and at once began speculating In grain on the open board , Dr. Morrioal being his broker . He was quite communicative to his broker regarding his family affairs , stating that ho had wealthy connections in England upon whom he could at any time call for fund : . West 's deals were almost uniformly unsuccessful , and the few hundred dollars he brought with him were soon exhausted . Last Monday he gave chocks for about $500 on banks in Cincinnati , and to-day the cheeks came back dishonored . Ile told Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England for money , and was sure to receive a large credit by telegraph . This forenoon ho said ho had heard from England , and should go at noon and draw against his newly arrived funds . This statement proved to he untrue , as no money had been placed to his credit . : Nothing more was seen of West until about 5 o'clock this afternoon , when a cnambermaid at the Commercial entered his room and found him lying on his bed , a towel saturated with chloroform tied over his mouth . Ile was quite dead , and life had evidently been extinct for some time . On the table , open and without address or signature , lay the following brief note , written in a plain , steady hand : " I am sorry to have wronged any who had trented me kindly and advised me well . No one but myself is to blame for this . My body may he given to any doctor who wants a subject . It is not to be sent to Cincinnati . My family being left destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their address Is corner of Forest and Main avenues , Avondale , Cincinnati . Please telegraph them . " On the ton of the note lay a fifty-cent piece , evidently left there to defray the cost of a telegram to Mrs. West .
