METHOD OF REVELATION . J.-REVELATION AND THE BIBLE . Chillingworth 's famous work , " The Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation , " occurs a sentence which passed into an adage : " The Bible , and the Bible only , is the religion of Protestants . " In the sense in which the phrase was used by that acute logician - a writer who had outgrown the narrowness of the school of his godfather Laud , in which he had received his early training - nothing can be more true . It is not from an infallible church that a Protestant derives his creed . With him the Scriptures are the rule of faith . They are the guide , at once authoritative , and sufficient or exclusive , on all matters pertaining to religious belief and moral conduct . These are the customary formulas , and the saying of Chillingworth is a strong assertion of the Protestant position , which stands opposed , on the one hand , to that of the Church of Rome , and , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a subjective standard , be it one 's own reasonings or feelings , for the Bible . Statements like this aphorism of Chillingworth have the value and attraction which belong to any terse enunciation of an important principle . They serve as watchwords in defensive warfare when adversaries approaching from opposite quarters are to be repelled . There is small danger of extravagance in praising the Bible , as every one will allow who appreciates what the Bible contains , surveys the influence of this book in the past , and knows its indispensable service in awakening and supporting the life of religion in the souls of men . It is the simple truth , and no mere conventional compliment to the Scriptures , to say that Christian piety cut off from contact with their light-giving and life-giving lower would wither away like plants robbed of the sunlight . But we need not examine the Bible long to become aware of problems and perplexities which the current axioms relative to the sufficiency and authority of Scripture do not clear up . The searcher for truth , on opening its covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise in which are methodically set down the articles which he is to believe and the things which he is to do . His Bible is not a Tridentine Creed , nor an Augsburg Confession , nor a Westminster Catechism ; nor does it wear the aspect of a systematic account of " the whole duty of man . " To be sure , doctrines and precepts are strewn , here and there , along its pages . But they must be picked out ; and when thus collected they do not always appear at first to agree with one another . The reader discovers that numerous commandments were issued at epochs far back in the past ; that they were addressed to a specific people , or to particular individuals , and have no very perceptible application to present circumstances or to himself . The Bible , from which he is expected to ascertain the purpose of life and how that purpose is to be fulfilled , turns out to be a voluminous collection of miscellaneous writings . They emanate from numerous authors , not all of whom are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed long ago , and at different times-a portion of them at dates extremely remote . Here are histories , some of them traversing the same ground , and with striking differences in the point of view , to say the least , from which they were written ; poems , among them a copious collection of devotional lyrics , and one metrical drama which may be styled , in the better sense of the term , erotic ; likewise , a book filled with dirges , besides a considerable number of other compilations of discourses by ancient seers ; another drama , dealing with the mystery connected with the allotment of evil by Divine Providence ; a collection of proverbs , also ; letters of Apostles to Churches ; the whole ending with a book made up of visions . This multifarious literature , so far as the older grand division of it is concerned , the ancient Jews distributed into three departments- the law , the prophets , and the hagiographa , or **psalms** the last of the sections being a group that was brought together after the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later or New Testament division , several narratives of the ministry of Jesus and one narrative of the labors of the Apostles are followed by the Epistles and the Apocalypse . In neither of the two main divisions of the Bible are the component parts united even by the external tie derived from the order in which they were written . In cases not a few , the date of books is unsettled . Differences of opinion on this point prevail among the scholars who are versed in such inquiries . With reference to certain books ,  --  for example , the first 272 // six historical books of the Old Testament ,  --  this diversity of opinion is very wide . No doubt the disagreement on these questions of date is owing partly to the influence of a dogmatic bias in one direction or another , to subjective leanings which are void of scientific value , but rather stand in the way of an unprejudiced verdict . But when the refraction due to innate or acquired prepossession is discounted , there is left still no small residue of uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors whose productions have been brought together in the Bible is plainly marked by personal traits which are reflected in both his thought and his style . Obvious limitations belonging to time and place , and to varying types of mind and culture , are stamped upon their pages . The peculiarity of the composite volume which we call " the Bible " - even this title , it is worth while to remark , was originally a plural - is strikingly felt when it is compared with the sacred books of other religions . The Vedas , the ancient Brabmanical Scriptures , are mainly collections of hymns . The Koran is composed exclusively of communications alleged to have been made by an angel to one person , Mohammed , and all within an interval of a little more than twenty years . These oracles , flowing as they do from the single mind of the founder of Islam , are identical in their style and their general spirit . It is only a minor portion of the Koran that consists of narratives ; and these are only stories of the patriarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any direct acquaintance on the part of Mohammed with the Old Testament records . Islam is preeminently the religion of a book , held to be supernatural in its origin , with nothing before it , or beneath it , or after it . Various as the books of the Bible are , however , in authorship , themes , and style , it is no exaggeration to say that one spirit animates them . He who approaches them in a merely critical , much more in a carping , temper , may miss the perception of it . A certain activity of conscience and moral sensibility may be requisite for the discernment and appreciation of it . This is not to fall back on a mere subjective impression , invalid save for the individual who experiences it . A deaf man , or a man with no ear for music , might as reasonably bring the same objection to one who is thrilled by an oratorio of Handel or a symphony of Beethoven . A noted American champion of disbelief , as I am credibly informed , not long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made the remark with all sincerity that the admiration expressed for the masterpieces of the great painters and sculptors is all a pure affectation , having no better ground than a contagious fashion , and that there is really nothing in these world-famed works of art to merit praise or elicit enthusiasm . But where perceptions , be they esthetic or moral and religious , are confined to no single breast , where they are awakened in a vast number of human beings , and are to a great degree independent of time and place and of peculiarities of race and education , and where , moreover , they stand related to the noblest development of character as their concomitant or fruit , they must be allowed to have a catholic worth . They assume the character of an objective proof . It is vain to decry them as morbid fancies . They are not to be dismissed as dreams of a mystic . They are the voice of human nature - a recognition by man of realities , the denial of which on the part of individuals here or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrophy " of powers , an eccentric quality of some kind in the dissenting skeptic . How shall we designate this peculiar characteristic of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures , taken as a whole ? It may be denominated the spirit of holiness . It pervades the Bible as an atmosphere . It imparts to it , if one may so say , a supernal quality - a quality not of earth . Here are not speculations uttered by sages about man 's nature , duty , and destiny . Here are not precepts such as may be read in the wisest of the heathen - for example , in Plato and Epictetus , and in the pensive chapters of the philosophic emperor Marcus Aurelius . Where there is some likeness in the content , yet the tone is dissimilar . We feel the breath of God . To say that the ethical injunctions of the Bible are " morality touched with emotion " is too vague a description . It is morality inculcated as by a voice out of the unseen . Underlying all is the relation , taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and eternity . Sanctions reaching out beyond this world of time and space give a solemn emphasis to the commandment . And the distinction here accorded to the Bible belongs to the Old Testament as well as to the New . Attempts have been made in ancient and modern times to sever the two parts of the Book and to discard the earlier collection . Such was the proceeding of Marcion , in the second century , and like views have been brought forward again and again in recent times . It is not the force of a settled tradition that has baffled every such enterprise . It is not even the recognition accorded to the Old Testament by the New which has been the prime obstacle in the way of endeavors of this nature . Rather is it the consciousness that the two parts of the Bible , differ as they may , are not at bottom incongruous and hostile , and a prevailing sense of the fact that grand elements belong to them in common . The same spirit of holiness pervades // them both , unites them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general . The Bible not only interprets God in his holiness and unfathomable love and pity , to man ; it is the interpreter of man to himself . Coleridge tells us that having striven to cast aside all prejudice , he perused the books of the Old and the New Testaments - " each book as a whole and also as an integral part . " " And need I say , " he testifies , " that I have met everywhere more or less copious sources of truth , and power , and purifying impulses ; that I have found words for my inmost thoughts , songs for my joy , utterances for my hidden griefs , and pleadings for my sh*tme and feebleness ? In short , whatever finds me bears witness for itself that it has proceeded from a Holy Spirit , even from the same Spirit which of old entered into the prophets . " This is not the experience of one mind alone , but of a multitude out of many kindreds and tongues , age after age . It is true that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all its books are in this regard , in their power to sound the deep places of the soul , on a level . We find ourselves from the beginning in an elevated region , yet a region where there are hills and valleys . It is vain to pretend that , in the quality referred to , all parts of the Bible are on the same plane . Isaiah and the Psalms , John the Evangelist and the leading Epistles of Paul , are among the portions of the Book that rise like lofty peaks in a mountain range . There are many pages within the compass of the Canon which , while not without their significance and value as parts of the collection , lack comparatively the spiritual quality which I have attempted to point out . Most readers of Scripture seldom turn to them . There is another fact to be noticed here . There are parts of the Bible which it is hard to understand . Wholesale assertions about the perspicuity of Scripture have to be qualified . The learning of the most erudite scholars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of a not inconsiderable number of passages in the sacred volume . Protestants have always been obliged to encounter the Roman Catholic objection to the popular use of the Scriptures , that they can not be understood by the generality of readers . The only way of meeting the objection is that adopted by Chillingworth ; namely , to insist that all essential truth , truth essential to salvation and the conduct of life , is easily discernible on their pages . In this answer it is tacitly conceded that there is left a pretty broad margin which is- to the common man , to say the least - obscure . Even one of the sacred writers pronounces some things in the Epistles of Paul abstruse ( 2 Peter iii . i6 ) . Why is this so ? it might be asked ; why all these dark places in Scripture , if it was directly and expressly written to serve as an authoritative text-book in religion ? When one considers the difficulties of the Bible , not in any captious spirit , as if to hunt up materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one looks at the difficulties which obtrude themselves upon the attention of those who are at all familiar with modem discoveries in natural and physical science , and with modern studies in history and ethnology ; still more , when one takes into view moral difficulties in certain parts of biblical doctrine , especially in portions of the Old Testament , one may be pardoned for inquiring , Was this body of writings , in its primary intention , designed to be a manual of religious and ethical instruction ? We may concede joyfully a high providential purpose in connection with the composition of the books which it contains , with their preservation ,  - -  although it must be remembered that they themselves allude to lost books which were regarded evidently as of equal authority with those in the Canon ,  --  and with their foreseen place and office in the Christian Church . But this is quite different from saying that they were originally composed with all this in view on the part of their authors . Especially does it leave out of sight a fact respecting the Scriptures which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the right use of them - a fact that furnishes a clue for the solution of the major part of the difficulties which have been adverted to . The thesis to be here propounded is this : It was not the Scriptures that made the religion , but the religion that made the Scriptures . The Scriptures of both the Old and New Testaments are the offshoot of a great historical movement , begun and carried forward to its consummation by an agency , supernatural and divine , yet a movement that is , notwithstanding , an integral part of the history of our race . The roots of the sacred literature mustbe sought in the historical events and transactions that gave rise to it . It were as strange an error to consider the records of the French Revolution , the memoirs of the leaders and minor actors , the discourses and expositions called forth , at the time and afterwards , by this series of momentous events , the songs and ballads of that stormy period  --  to consider these multiform writings the Revolution itself , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to identify the books of the Bible with the religion out of which they sprung . To see the justice of this remark , it is only needful to glance at the origin of the New Testament Scriptures . John the Baptist wrote nothing . Jesus wrote nothing . He lived and taught , he gathered about him a // band of disciples , he died and rose from the dead , and the Holy Spirit , the source of a new spiritual power and enlightenment , descended upon his disciples . Jesus laid the foundation for an organization of his followers . He created a society . It was not books that had been written or that were to be written that he styled " the light of the world " and " the salt of the earth . " It was the men who believed in him and followed him . It was through them personally that the good which he brought to mankind was to be diffused abroad . By them the proclamation of God 's forgiveness and love , or the Gospel , was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the sayings and doings of Jesus got themselves recorded . It was the living interest taken in those real occurrences , a curiosity on the part of Christians to know more of them , and , as we learn from the introduction of Luke 's first narrative , an increasing sense of the value of a correct knowledge of them , that occasioned the composition of the four Gospels . The book of Acts owes its existence to a similar cause . As to the Epistles , of course the Churches had to be founded before they could be addressed . It is desirable to remember that Christianity was preached and believed in before anything was written about it . In an age of letters , it was inevitable that the events which form the subject of the New Testament should very soon give birth to writings . We can understand why it was impossible that the American civil war should pass by without giving rise to the composition of letters by those actively engaged in it , and the publication of books of history and reminiscence . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity by Christ and the Apostles . If the number of those who desired to know the facts and to be taught the significance of them was at the outset small , it rapidly increased , and their interest in the subject was deep , and absorbing . Of course the creation of the New Testament literature was an act of Providence of essential consequence in its bearing on the subsequent propagation of the Christian faith . Our business is now with the second cause that led to it , and , in particular , with its relation to the historical facts out of which , as from a fruitful soil , it grew up . What has just been said of the New Testament is applicable to the Old . Stretching along , as it were , underneath the heterogeneous books that make up the Old Testament - heterogeneous as to their particular themes and their style - is the groundwork of history , of the history of God 's dealings with the nation of Israel in earlier and later times . This history is related in specifically historical writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color to the form of the books which do not belong under this head . For example , the prophecies of Isaiah are a series of fervent harangues having reference to the circumstances of those to whom they were in the first instance directed . Psalms find Proverbs embody the devotional sentiments and the practical philosophy of living men at definite epochs in the career of the Hebrew people . It need not be said that we do not forget the inspiration of the prophets and the quality of their utterances , which is dependent upon it , although the fact of the Divine call of the several prophets , in the exigencies in which they appeared , is part and parcel of the series of historical events . It is simply meant that , be the peculiarity of the Old Testament writings which is derived from supernatural influence what it may , the discourses of Isaiah , and the Proverbs of the wise man or men who were the authors of them , have an historical basis not less real and substantial than is true of the sermons of Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Almanac. ** When the first martyr Stephen spoke for the Christian cause before the Jewish council , he spread before them an *array of historical occurrences . He went back to God 's disclosure of himself to Abraham in the far-off time , and passed in review , one after another , leading personages and facts of the past down to the mission and death of the Righteous One . In the same spirit , the Apostle Paul traces everything back to a person - to Abraham and to his personal convictions respecting God . He was " the father of all them that believe , " the founder of a people becoming more and more numerous , and finally bursting the confines of national kinship . At the same time the Apostle Paul understood the value of the Scriptures . It was the signal advantage of the Jews that to them had been committed " the oracles of God . " A sacred deposit had been intrusted to them . The promises of God recorded in the ancient Scriptures were in their hands . It is not alone as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organs of revelation . They are inspired to look forward and partly lift the curtain that veils the future . Thus they discharge an office in opening the way for subsequent scenes and events in the drama of Providence as it gradually unfolds itself . The fundamental reality is not the Bible . It is the kingdom of God . This is not a notion . Rather is it a real historical fact , and the grandest of all facts . No other kingdom or commonwealth ever had a more substantial being . It is older than any other ; it has proved itself stronger and more enduring than any other ; if there is any good ground for the Christian 's faith , it will embrace or overspread them all . // XVhat is this kingdom ? It is the society of believers in God - the society of his loyal subjects and children . In its immature stage , under the old dispensation , it existed in the form of an organized political community . Among the nations there lived one people which had true thoughts respecting God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They became conscious-it was he who inspired them with the consciousness - of standing in an immediate , peculiar relation to him . That they were a " chosen people " was a conviction ineradicably planted within them . Has not this conviction of theirs been verified in the subsequent history of mankind ? They were made to feel that they were not thus distinguished for their own sake , or on account of any merit of their own , but were chosen to be witnesses for God to the rest of mankind . There was a divine purpose of redemption , in which the entire race were to have a share . The civil polity and the laws of the chosen people were to reflect the will of God , as made known from time to time through holy and inspired men . The whole course of their lives was to be regulated by prescriptions issuing from the same divine source . After the monarchical form of government was established , revelation still remained the source of law . Side by side with the kings there stood the prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler , and , if need be , to exhort the people to disobedience . The one supreme concern of this Hebrew nation was , and was felt to be , religion . Their function among the nations of the earth was consciously wrapped up in this one interest . As they well knew , other religions besides their own were national . All ancient religions were national . But other religions were on false foundations and were doomed to pass away . When the political independence of the Israelites was lost , their civil polity shattered , the conquered people dragged off into idolatrous lands , this consciousness of being possessed of the true religion and of a grand and triumphant future awaiting them not only survived but grew more confident . It not only outlived political ruin ; under overwhelming calamities it burned with a more intense fervor . More strange than all , there was a foresight of a great advance to be made in the intrinsic character of this divinely given religion , as well as in the extent of the dominion to be gained by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God with the people . But the days were to come when there was to be " a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah . " Religion was one day to become more spiritual ; obedience would then no longer be legal or constrained , but spontaneous ; the knowledge of God and his ways would be confined to no class , but would be diffused among all ; forgiveness would be full and free . Such is the remarkable prediction of the prophet Jeremiah . Centuries flowed on , but the epoch thus foreseen at last arrived . The Person through whom was to be achieved this vast revolution and expansion of the kingdom , dimly discerned from afar in certain grand outlines , at length appeared . Jesus , the Christ , became the founder of a spiritual and universal society . Whoever will look into the Gospels will see that it was in this character of the head of a kingdom that he appeared . It was of the kingdom of God that John , the forerunner , spoke as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king , however the nature of that claim was misrepresented by his accusers , that Christ was put to death . The prophecy began to be realized when he began to teach and to attract to himself disciples . The kingdom was there . This he taught when , in answer to the question when the kingdom was to begin to be , he said , " The kingdom of God cometh not with observation " ; lo . . . the kingdom of God is within you , " or in the midst of you . The kingdom was constituted by Jesus and the group of disciples who acknowledged him as Lord and Master , and who , like him , were devoted to the doing of the Father 's will . This last was the criterion of membership in the kingdom and of a title to its blessings . Those who were one with Jesus in this filial allegiance were hailed by him as brother , and sister , and mother . Yet the consummation of the kingdom lay in the future . Hence the kingdom , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore a kingdom to come - to come in a double sense , in its moral progress among mankind , and in mysterious final scenes of judgment and victory . So that the prayer of all disciples was still to be , " Thy kingdom come " - a supplication that points both to the continuous progress and transforming influence of the Gospel in the world , and to the goal of that progress , the final epoch . Precisely how " the kingdom of Christ " or " the kingdom of heaven " should be defined is a point on which all are not agreed . It was declared by Jesus not to be a " kingdom of this world . " Its origin was not earthly , but from above . It was not , like human sovereignties , to be maintained and spread by force . The end of the Founder 's mission was to bear witness to the truth . The kingdom was to be made up of those who heard his voice , who believed and obeyed the witness which he gave . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , which tended to regard the Christian state , with the Roman emperor at its head , as the realization of the // kingdom . In the West it was the Church in its visible organization under the Papacy that was identified with the kingdom of Christ . A broader view would bring within the circumference of the kingdom all the baptized , in whatever Christian fold . A still broader view is that which includes within its pale all souls who , accepting Christ as their Lord and Sayiour , live to do the Father 's will . Passing by the dispute about boundaries , the existence of a society which sprung out of Judaism , but is sj ) iritual and universal , is an unquestionable fact . One might as well doubt whether the sun is in the sky as to question the reality of that new creation which gives its distinctive character to " the Christian era . " It may be added here that all organized bodies which hold the Christian faith , including the Church of Rome as well as Protestants , unite in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ and the Apostles . The Church of Rome makes tradition an authorized channel for the transmission of this truth . But all agree that Christianity is the absolute religion . There is a progress in the understanding of it , from age to age . But the religion itself is not defective , and , therefore , is not perfectible . Christianity is not to be put in the same category with the ethnic religions , which contain an admixture of error and are capable of being indefinitely improved . The religion of the Gospel is absolute . The allegiance of the follower of Christ is unqualified : " Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so Jam . " Keeping in view this historic kingdom , which stands forth as an objective reality , beginning in the distant past and carried forward to its perfected form by Jesus of Nazareth , we have to inquire what is the relation of the Holy Scriptures to it . The answer is that they are the documents that make us acquainted with the kingdom in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures we are made acquainted with the facts and the meaning of the facts . And , as in the case of all documentary materials , viewed in contrast with literary products of later elaboration , we are brought face to face with the historic transactions and with the persons who took part in them . This is the peculiar character of the Scriptures , and is at once the secret of their transcendent value , and the occasion of countless obscurities and difficulties . By no other means could we become possessed of knowledge so immediate and so vivid . Yet they give occasion for the same sort of inquiries that always devolve , in historic investigation , on those who delve in the sources . Let us take an illustration from secular history . We will suppose that the later narratives , such as those of Bancroft and Palfrey , by which VOL . XXXIX. - 39. a New Englander learns the origin and growth of the communities to which he belongs , and their historic relations to other parts of America , had not been written - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , including under this head older accounts whose authors stood nearer to the circumstances which they relate than the historians of to-day . We are shut up , we will imagine , to this mass of documentary materials . There is Bradford 's pathetic story of the Pilgrims , of their flight from their English home to Holland , their voyage across the Atlantic , their settlement and their experiences at Plymouth . We have other writings also - the " Compact of Government " drawn up in the cabin of the Mayfower ; the diary and the letters of John Winthrop , the Massachusetts governor ; the earlier and later codes of colonial law ; the " Bay Psalm Book " ; Cotton Mather 's " Magnalia " ; later still , the history of Hutchinson ; and , along with other productions , we have discourses of the most influential preachers in the successive generations . As we approach the epoch of the Revolution we have the letters and speeches of the patriotic leaders ; the records of the first congresses , local and general ; the Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Constitution of the United States , and expositions of it by Madison and others who took part in framing it ; official papers of the first President and his Cabinet , etc . Imagine a comprehensive collection of these documents . It would consist of prose , and poetry , of orations , disquisitions , letters , and so forth . Obviously there would be inconveniences , especially to an untrained , unlearned student . There would be things hard to understand , obscure allusions , apparent and real discrepancies of more or less consequence . A consecutive history prepared by a modern student of sound , critical judgment would plainly have its advantages . But one superlative advantage it would fail to have . The reader would not , in anything like an equal degree , be brought into the atmosphere of the former days . He would not , in anything like an equal degree , come into living contact with the events and into direct personal intercourse with the participants in them . His impressions , if in some particulars more exact and more systematic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are to be caught alone from the documentary sources . The difference is like that between a treatise on geography , or even the desiriptions of a traveler , and an actual journey through a country which we seek to know . Let one read either of the numerous lives of Jesus which have been written by learned scholars in recent times , even when imaginative power re*nforces the erudition of // the author , and then turn to the pages of the Evangelists . He xviii feel at once the difference between second-hand and first-hand accounts ; between those who see through their own eyes and those who have to use the eyes of others . The modern scholars furnish us with collateral information of value , illustrative of the Gospels ; they collate the several narrators ; they apply the canons of historical criticism with more or less skill ; but where is that living , speaking portrait of Jesus , of his walk and his talk , which the original historians , the Apostles and their companions , give us ? It is the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the herbarium the classification is better , but we miss the bright hues and the aroma of the blossoms . To the botanist the herbarium is important , and botany is a useful science in its place . But the rosebush , or a grapevine with the clusters of fruit hanging upon it , has a charm of its own which the botanist not more than the unlettered man would be willing to spare . The beginnings of old kingdoms and empires are commonly obscure . They start on their career in the txvilight . It is not until the day has fairly dawned , until some progress has been made on the path of civilization , that written records arise to be transmitted to later times . Even these contemporary writings are likely to be scanty and fragmentary . Traditions exist and are handed down , but they are subject to the influences that affect the oral transmission of narrative matter from generation to generation . Thus when the past comes to be studied in an enlightened age , there is no escape from the necessity of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow . The facts of a remote time are to be reached only by exploring in places where the light is dim . Great rivers may traverse empires , spreading fertility along their banks , but we have to hunt for their sources . If the circumstances of the rise of the Kingdom of God should be found to accord with this analogy , there would be no cause for wonder . There would be no ground afforded for a naturalistic theory as to the origin of that kingdom , unless indeed it were mistakenly imagined that the primary design of God was not to plant religion in the souls of men , to raise up a people , and to work out historically the redemption of mankind , but rather to produce a body of writings . In this day of critical research it is the early part of the Old Testament history respecting which debates and perplexities most frequently arise . These relate largely to the Pentateuch , and the traditional views relative to its authorship . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repute , in what is called the " advanced " school , who assign so great a part of the Pentateuchal legislation , as well as the accompanying narrative matter , to a later than the Mosaic period , do not feel justified by their interpretations of the evidence in questioning the existence of Moses , or the grandeur of his work as a leader , lawgiver , and prophet . For example , Reuss , who claims to have been first in the field with the ideas which his pupil , Graf , independently developed , says : " Moses was for all times the Lawgiver of Israel . . There may be a dispute as to what strictly belongs to him . But his spirit- in this proving itself to be a divine spirit - ruled the judgment of the centuries , and impressed on the national development its own stamp and direction . The continuers of his work , even the most gifted and energetic , and at the turning-points of history , did not find it needful to forget or to ignore his name , which a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , " etc . In addition to what he did in revealing a purer knowledge of God in the midst of the barbarism of the heathen , says Reuss , " there belongs to him without doubt the regulation and ordering of the ntual , as it afterwards existed in Israel , at least in its outlines . " A critic as little wedded to accepted views as Hermann Schultz finds it unreasonable to call in question the fact of the revelation of God to Moses at Mount Sinai . He styles Moses " the man who was properly the founder of the true religion , the effects of whose influence conditioned the entire religious development of Israel . . . . Moses is , with the exception of Jesus , the most important of the religious personages concerning whom really trustxvorthy information remains to us . " So it continues true , even in the creed of the critics of every stripe , that " the law came by Moses " as well as " grace and truth by Jesus Christ . " It is confessed on all hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on the firmest historical ground . What the religion of Israel was in the eighth century B. C. , the great age of prophecy , is clearly and vividly exhibited to us in their writings . Whatever the prophets may not presuppose , they certainly do imply a course of teaching and of revelation , extending far back of their day . Revelation is not magic , and the lofty plane on which the prophets are found to stand was not reached at a single bound . Not until after the sun has slowly climbed the sky does it shine down upon us in the blaze of noonday . Amos , the shepherd of Tekoa , uttered his prophecies early in the eighth century . It was to Israel that he spoke , the people whom the Lord had " brought up out of the land of Egypt , " saying , " You only have I // known of all the families of the earth . " Nothing can surpass the eloquence in which the universal sovereignty of God is set forth . It is " He that formeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto man what is his thought . " It is " Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion , and turneth the shadow of death " - or the deep darkness - " into the morning , and . maketh the day dark with night ; that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth ; that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong , so that destruction cometh upon the fortress . " In the prophets of that age the nations of the world , even the mighty Assyrian power that was trampling kingdoms under foot , and advancing seemingly to universal dominion , are in the hand of God and are managed for his purposes . " This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth : and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations . For the Lord of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ? " The Assyrian , the Lord exclaims , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off nations not a few . " The religion which was full of so lofty conceptions of God , both of his power and moral attributes , and of his providential plan , was not born in a day . The religion which had in itself vitality enough to survive the complete overthrows of national independence , and even to rise to more exalted heights of faith and devotion , must have had a long history behind it . There must have been , as one has said , a tap-root extending far down in the earth . There is no rational way of dispensing with the creative and organizing influence of Moses in the Hebrew commonwealth and religion . But back of Moses , in the mist of a much more remote antiquity , stands the figure of Abraham , the progenitor of many nations . Against the extreme skepticism that would sweep off the stage of authentic history this heroic character , the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillmann , whose unsurpassed learning and impartiality are acknowledged by all the critics . " The possibility at least , " says Dillmann , " that out of the period from the twenty-second to the twentieth century before Christ historical personages may live on in recollection of after times can not on general grounds be contested . We are not surprised when among the Egyptians , Babylonians , and Assyrians written historical memorials from those centuries confront us . Why then should not the Israelites , when they appear , somewhere about the year i 500 , upon the theater of history , have preserved historical recollections out of that time ? " Then , after pointing out that the oldest Hebrew historians manifest a consciousness of the difference between those old times and the later with which they are conversant , Dillmann adds : " The main thing , however , is that the entire work of Moses admits of no historical explanation except on the supposition of a preparatory , comparatively pure type of religion due Vors/ufe ludherer Religion , such as , according to Genesis , belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity presupposes personal agents or standard-bearers . As states can be built up only through leading spirits or heroes , in like manner and much more are advances in matters of religion linked to persons rising above their fellows ; and the memory of them is wont to abide in the minds of those coming after who have gathered about their faith as a center , and to hold on more persistently than even the recollection of political founders . As the head of a purer belief in God in the midst of the darkening power of heathenism that had already come in , as a man eminent for his sense of God and faith in him , who was accustomed to listen for the voice of God and to follow his guidance in all the exigencies and events of his life ; as one who advanced in the knowledge of the nature and will of God , and implanted this higher knowledge in his household and among those about him - thus do the ancestral legends in Genesis represent Abraham . His existence there has in it so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume it unless we throw overboard , at the same time , as unhistorical the connection of Moses with the God of the Fathers . " Dillmann calls special attention to the credibility of the narrative , in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis , of the arming by Abraham of his dependents for the rescue of Lot , taken captive by Chedorlaomer and his allied kings . It is a narrative which in various particulars is corroborated by the cuneiform inscriptions . The substance of the narrative seems to have been drawn by the Hebrew writers from written sources east of the Jordan . On the whole , then , until stronger evidence to the contrary shall be adduced than has yet been found , we are justified in believing that Abraham lived and was an immigrant from Chaldea , leaving his kindred to escape from the contagion of the incoming and spreading idolatry . These , be it remembered , are historical questions such as might arise in connection with the rise of Roman power or with the Saxon invasion of England . Even if they are variously answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office it has fulfilled in the course of human history , remain as undeniable facts . // In the prolegomena to the annals of Israel as an organized community ,  --  becoming such by the leadership and legislation of Moses ,  - -  and prior to the story of the patriarchs , we find the opening chapters of Genesis , with their narratives ; some of them double , indicative , many scholars judge , of distinct sources - narratives of the creation and of the primal transgression , of the flood , of the division and dispersion of mankind . In these narratives are mingled fragments of ballads , genealogies , etc. - all these materials being strung together on a chronological thread . Here we have the background of Hebrew history . The resemblance of the contents of these chapters to the legends of kindred nations , especially the Assyrians and Babylonians , is too marked to be the result of accident ; yet , at the same time , the dissimilarity is equally striking . Both call for explanation - the unlikeness not less than the likeness . There pervades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are defining characteristics of the Old Testament religion as a whole . They are thus in their inward spirit of a piece with Revelation , and even homogeneous with Revelation in the final or Christian stage of its advancement . Without exaggeration it has been said of the first three chapters of Genesis that they contain more moral and religious truth than all other books taken together which have been written independently of the Bible . Whence were these ancient narratives derived ? How and when did they originate ? That they were brought in at a late day in the development of the Hebrew religion from Assyrian and Babylonian sources is a theory fraught with improbabilities . It would imply that for an indefinitely long period the Hebrews were content to be destitute of any conceptions respecting the origin of things and the early life of mankind . It implies , moreover , that they were ready to borrow mythological tales from their heathen neighbors and oppressors . In the present state of knowledge , no hypothesis is so probable as that when Abraham and his companions left their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the past , of the race to which they belonged . In that region these may not then have been disfigured to the same extent as afterwards by the admixture of mythological matter . In the light of the revelation of God made to Abraham and to his descendants , this stock of inherited narrative was purged of whatever dross of heathenism was intermingled with it . The primeval traditions and tales were so transformed as not to clash with the fundamental principles of revealed religion , and were thus left to serve as an adequate vehicle for conveying essentially right religious impressions , until the age shoukl arrive when physical science and , historical investigation should supply the knowledge which then , at the dawn of civilization , it would not have been possible for men to comprehend as it was not the office of Revelation to communicate it . If the Hebrews were left , for example , to share in the belief of their ancestors that the world was made in a week 's time. , they were not worse off than Christians have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispossess ourselves of the notion that the Divine Author of Revelation began with casting out of men 's minds the whole stock of beliefs which were included in their inheritance . There was a world of knowledge about the way of creation and other mundane things which natural science and historical study in after times would unfold to view . And natural science and historical study are not alien and inimical to religion . They , too , are methods through which God in another way discloses truth to men . From the historical point of view the student - in fact , every one who desires to find out what really occurred in the past-craves contemporary evidence of a trustworthy nature . Those who were immediately concerned in the events , and those who were in a position to be correctly informed in relation to them , are the competent witnesses . Tradition is of no value except so far as their testimony can be reasonably thought to be contained in it . The chief interest which the historical inquirer has in criticism applied to any portion of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have we contemporary evidence or its fair equivalent ? As regards the life of Jesus and the planting of the Church , including both the facts and the teaching , there can be no reasonable doubt . The genuineness of the leading Epistles of Paul has not been questioned at the present day by the most learned skeptics , the starting-point of whose disbelieg be it observed , is commonly the assumed demands of speculative philosophy far more than real difficulties ofan historical nature . But these Epistles imply on the part of the Apostles - the pupils , friends , and companions of Jesus - the testimony to the fact of his resurrection . It is in the highest degree improbable that they could have believed it had they not been prepared , by their real or supposed previous observation of exertions of miraculous power by Jesus , for giving credence to so astonishing a miracle . We are not left , however , to inference in respect to this point . The assertion is often thrown out that we have no good evidence of the existence of the Gospels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , despite proofs that ought to satisfy every candid // person . There is no reason to doubt , and there are the strongest reasons to conclude , that the first three Gospels were written within the limits of the generation contemporary with the events recorded , and were written by perfectly veracious persons who had the means of knowing what the facts were which they undertook to record . The effort to bring the fourth Gospel down into the second century , and to ascribe its authorship to any other than to the Apostle John , encounters difficulties far more serious than those which it aims to avoid ; and the only plausible alternative theory , where the Johannine authorship is given up , is that the book was composed by one of his disciples . We bear it said that in that age , the age of J osephus and of Tacitus , there was no appreciation of the nature and the value of testimony . The statement is sometimes so qualified as to make it applicable only to the Gospel writers . This would imply that Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relate to others what they had heard and seen , who were destitute of the essential qualifications of witnesses . Assumptions of this character are overthrown by a little attention to the New Testament writings . Open the earliest of the Gospels , that of Mark , an attendant of Peter . We read : " And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none . For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together " ( xiv . 55 , 56 ) . This looks as if the Evangelist , and those from whom he received his information , had some iciea of the need of testimony to substantiate assertions , and of the necessity of comparing it and sifting it . Open the Gospel of Luke , an attendant of Paul , and hear him say that the reason of his writing was that-for so the passage is correctly rendered in the Revised Version - he had " traced the course of all things accurately from the first , " having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-witnesses . " This looks as if Luke was aware of the importance of being careful not to mistake fiction for fact , and understood the importance of going to the right sources of information . " Ye are witnesses of these things , " are words of Jesus to the Disciples , which Luke also records . Peter , as we learn from the Acts , declared to his fellow-believers that , on account of the defection of Judas , it was requisite to choose another in his place from those who had been with the Apostles all through the public ministry of Jesus , " beginning from the baptism of John . " And why from this class alone ? Let Peter answer : " To become a witness with us of his resurrection . " This looks as if the Apostle Peter understood what the function of the Apostles was , what they had been chosen for , and what were the proper qualifications for the office . This account of the proposal of Peter is a portion of the book of Acts which has been accepted even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how carefully the Apostle Paul , in the fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians , reviews the testimony of the Apostles to the resurrection of Jesus , and his emphatic declaration , " If Christ be not risen . . . we are found false witnesses . " It is evident , as one has said , that Paul was no easy convert . Christianity is a religion of facts . They are not appendages - ornaments , so to speak , about the neck of a king , with regard to which it matters not whether they are worn or discarded . Luther and the other reformers were wise in feeling " the extreme danger of substituting their belief for the object of it , and so destroying the reality of both . " Miracles are more than proofs ; they are constituent elements of revelation , which unveils not only the mercy and tenderness , but also the power of God , and his sovereignty over nature . The sign-seeking spirit , the appetite for marvels , the disposition to find nowhere except in miracles evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , the demand for an extraordinary , stupendous sign from heaven , Jesus rebuked . But this is all . Especially is the resurrection the perfecting of his own person , the " first-fruits " as well as the sign of the redemption of man 's entire being . It is consistent for those to reject the miracles who , like the author of " Robert Elsmere , " hold that " personality or intelligence " has no meaning " as applied to God . " The real , but often unperceived , issue is between a distinct theism in which the personality of God , as well as of man , is fully recognized , and a real , though it be a vague , undefined Pantheism . The attempt to resolve the miracles of the Gospel into subjective experiences is to dissolve Christianity into thin air . It belongs in a scheme of Pantheistic idealism . The remark that " miracles do not now occur " is of no weight . The questions ought to be whether in case Jesus Christ were on the earth they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the introduction of that spiritual and universal society of which he was the founder . That nature is not supreme and man a slave to blind laws , it was surely well for the divine Head of the new kingdom to demonstrate , and thus to meet the yearnings of the race for the revelation of a power superior to material forces . Unless there is a demonstration that " the world is subject to God and not to chance or nature ; that there is an order , far more beautiful and perfect than that of sun and stars , in which men are intended // to abide , and in which everything that is great and noble within them receives its full development - I see not how this materialist superstition can fail to become the creed of every nation and to bring about the decay of all institutions and political life , all feeling , affection , hope . " " If , " adds Maurice , from whom the foregoing passage is quoted , " Christianity be the manifestation of a spiritual kingdom ; if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be that which was to exhibit through all the complications of after ages what is the law which governs them , and who is the Giver of that law-then we can not see how it could enter the world without miracles , or how those miracles should not be such as the Bible affirms that they were . " If the stories of the miracles of Christ are " in accordance with the scriptural idea of the Founder of a spiritual and universal kingdom . . . we should require evidence to account for their omission in any record proposing to convey the history of such a person . We should have a right to ask , Why did he give no signs that he came to connect the visible with the invisible world ; why did he do nothing to break the yoke of custom and experience ; nothing to show men that the constitution which he pretended to reveal and establish has a true foundation ? Take away the miracles , and there is an inexplicable chasm and inconsistency in these records which it would require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is plain that a great deal of the current criticism of the historical writings of the Bible is affected by a preexisting bias against the supernatural element in these narratives . There is a prejudice at the start which warps the judgment respecting their date and authorship and their general credibility . This prejudice , when the purpose and scope of revelation are properly conceived , will be felt to be unwarrantable . At the same time it is evident that the wide concurrence of Christian scholars in rejecting the rigid doctrine of an absolute inerrancy in these historical writings is owing to no spirit of skepticism of the sort described . Modified conceptions on this subject have arisen and spread among students of the Bible within the Church who are not lacking in faith and reverence . They have been adopted as an inevitable incident of the conscientious examination and comparison of the writings themselves . That Apostles and Prophets were inspired of God to set forth the contents of divine revelation ; that even the historical books composed by them are permeated with the ideas drawn from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants of the Apostles partake of the same character and are penetrated with the perceptions that flowed from the authoritative teachers near whom they stood ; that misinterpretations of the essential nature of the Gospel were precluded by the agency of the Spirit who was to throw light on the sayings of Christ , and on the events the meaning of which was at first so dark to the minds of the Disciples , but was to become clear in the retrospect - all this is a part of the common faith of Christians . It is another thing to say that beyond this inspiration a certain divine assistance was forever at hand , when Evangelist or other historian took up his pen , to check him by a negative influence - acting after the manner of the demon of Socrates - when the author was about to misplace the date of an occurrence , or to vary from rigid accuracy in matters of circumstantial detail . What a stupendous miracle would be involved in imparting this impeccable character to so large a body of historical writings as the Bible contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what avail would it be , unless not only the original writers , but also amanuenses and transcribers , were all to be equally guarded to the end of time ? Exaggerated statements on this subject are the occasion , at present , of two great evils . One mischievous consequence of them is that the truth and divine origin of Christianity are staked on the literal correctness of even the minutest particulars in the copious narratives of Scripture . The conscientious student , seeing that such views are untenable in the light of fair historical criticism , is virtually bidden to draw the inference that the foundations of the Christian faith are gone . Moreover , some of the most impressive arguments in defense of historical Christianity , which depend on the presence of unessential discrepancies , showing the absence of collusion , and in various other ways confirming the truthfulness of the main features of the narrative , are precluded from being used , whenever the obsolescent theory that the biblical narratives are drawn up with the pedantic accuracy of a notary public is still insisted on . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the sacred historians themselves do not allege . When Luke will indicate to Theophilus that his narrative is to be relied on , he appeals to the opportunities afforded him for getting possession of the facts , through the personal intercourse which he has had with those who were directly cognizant of them . To the historical student the magnifying of dissonances and the forcing of harmonies are alike obnoxious . They are equally an affront to the moral sense . They both count for nothing when confronted by a critical tact which sees where the truth lies , divines the secret of inconsistencies , and leaves undetermined whatever the documen // tary source offers no means of settling . Nothing that the human hand touches , no record of the past , is utterly free from blemishes . Lord Mahon writes of the Duke of Wellington : " The conversation turned as to how testimonies vary and how difficult it is to get at a real fact . The duke gave some instances of it . Thus there is one event noted in the worldthe battle of Waterloo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree as to the exact hour when it commenced . " ' Lord Mahon was an unusually accurate and careful recorder of what he heard Wellington say . Yet he quoted the duke as having remarked that he had counted " the presence of Napoleon at a battle was equal to a re*inforcement of forty thousand men . " But the duke in a memorandum made a correction . " It is very true , " he wrote , " that I considered Napoleon 's presence in the field to be equal to forty thousand men in the balance . This is a very loose way of talking ; but the idea is a very different one from that of his presence at a battle being equal to a reinforcement of forty thousand men . " There is a curious lack of agreement in the contemporary records of the last words spoken by Martin Luther at the Diet of Worms , and a consequent difference of opinion as to what he really said . On the whole , there is good reason to conclude that the common account accords with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a careful collation of evidence . Variations not unlike the above meet us in the New Testament historical writings ; for example , in the accounts of the denials of Peter , of the crucifixion , of the resurrection . They are not to be gotten rid of by artificial adjustments . Some of the ' mosaics formed in this way are mechanical , and anything but edifying . The same critical judgment must be called into exercise that is requisite in dealing with all other historical documents . Is it said that the common man is not possessed of the requisite leisure and skill for such an undertaking ? The answer is , first , that neither is he qualified for textual criticism and for making the choice between disputed readings ; secondly , that he is under no greater disadvantage than he is subject to in connection with other authentic narratives , including the most approved histories of his own country ; and thirdly , that the impression , the aggregate impression , made on the mind may be quite true and adequate , despite a degree of uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible of parallel narratives covering the same field , as in the case of the four Gospels , puts it in our power not only to see how the events appeared from somewhat different points of view , but also to combine complementary accounts and to rectify imperfections . It seems an ungracious task to advert even to slight imperfections in a book so precious as the Bible , as it is an ungracious task in a child to touch on the faults of a parent . But there stands the great saying of the Apostle : " We have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us . " In the case of the writings and of the men the jewel was not to be confounded with the casket that held it . Some there are who are so dazzled by the treasure 4hat they imagine the vessel to be also of gold . Others , seeing that the vessel is earthenware , hastily and obtusely fancy that its contents are of the same coarse material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
