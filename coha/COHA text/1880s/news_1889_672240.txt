txt To naval officers the non-arrival of the Atlanta at Newport is regarded as a very serious matter . Tue cruiser left this port on Monday morning , taxing the outside passage around Montauk Point . The weather was overcast and cloudy when she put to sea , and through the Narrows the waves were rolling in a most threatening manner . Toward afternoon the storm appeared to increase in force , and as the wind was from the northward and eastward the cruiser must have had to encounter the full force of the waves , head on . Capt . Blatchford of the schooner Latham managed to get across the bar and up as far as the Narrows on Monday afternoon . He reported , as related in TEE TIMES or Tuesday , passing the Atlanta well outside the Hook . . The cruiser , he said , was keeping only a few points off from the sea , and was taking the water aboard right up to her superstructure . She appeared to be moving along at a smart pace , though running her bows clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ship appeared void of all buoyancy , and ho imagined her anything but a comfortable craft at sea that night . The Atlanta should have rounded Montauk Point before midnight of Monday , and should have been in Newport the following day . Under any circumstances her commander would have had to telegraph his arrival in any port other than the one to which he had been ordered , and explain , his reasons for going there . There is no place on the southern coast of Long Island into when a vessel of the size of the Atlanta could have run during  --  a storm , and even were there such a port , and had the Atlanta run into the harbor , her whereabouts would have been telegraphed to the Navy Department immediately . Had the Atlanta succeeded in rounding Montauk Point she would have had little trouble in crossing the Sound . The only cause to which can be ascribed the non-arrival of the Atlanta is the possible heading of the vessel to the southward to get her before the sea . But even then she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , though ? there would be eliminated the pushing and straining occasioned by driving the vessel head on to a sea . ESSThere are many naval officers who have criticised the model of the Atlanta and Boston more than once . The appearance of either of these ships can best be pictured by imagining a vessel with her rails but a few feet above the water . Now place on this vessel a structure of nearly the shape of a cigar box , so built that there will be about thirty feet intervening between the after end or the box and the stern of ? the ship , and the same distance between the forward end of the box and the bow . This box-shaped affair is called the " superstructure . " and its sides are in the soiree perpendicular line as the rails of the vessel . From the forward end of the superstructure to the bow the sea has a clean sweep across deck . as it has also from the alter end of the superstructure to the stern . In " heavy-weather ships " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . This is to overcome either a head or a following sea . But in the case of the : Poston and Atlanta this rule has been wholly disregarded and the very opposite plan adopted . Few officers are willing for one moment to believe that the Atlanta is lost . She may have sustained damage to her rudder , but even then she ought to have got in with a hawser . If her machinery has broken down she has her sails , by which she can " heave to . " It is considered most likely that her machinery has come to grief , as was the case at Newport . Had Capt . Howell found himself unable to " buck " the seas he could have turned around and made New-York without difficulty . He would then have had the seas from a quarter permitting him to run with ease . " Hove to , " or at the end of a " sea anchor , " it is thought that the Atlanta could ride out the storm , but , as far as the vessel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly supposed that Capt . Howell would resort to such metuods . The weight of opinion is that the machinery is broken down and that the vessel is " hove to . " There are on board the Atlanta , all told , about . two hundred and twenty-five men . The vessel is one of the ' first of the new navy . She is one of the Roach cruisers , and is a sister ship to the Boston ..
