THE THIRD TERM : REASONS AGAINST IT . " Resolved , That in the opinion of this House the precedent established by Washington and other Presidents of the United States , in retiring from the Presidential office after their second term , has become , by universal consent , a part of our republican system of government , and that any departure from this time-honored custom would be unwise , unpatriotic , and fraught with peril to our free institutions . " This is a resolution passed by the House of Representatives on the 15th day of December , 1875 . It was offered by Mr. Springer , of Illinois , after consultation with leading friends of the principle , and was carried immediately and almost unanimously , being op* posed by the votes of only eighteen members out of two hundred and fifty-one . It received the support and approbation of all par . ties . Men who quarreled bitterly upon all other political subjects were of one heart and one mind , when it came to be a question whether the custom established by Washington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be respected or could be safely departed from . And now here , to wit , in the pages of this Review , comes Mr. Howe , of Wisconsin , and on the part of General Grant , for whom he appears , denounces the resolution aforesaid , impugns the doctrine embodied in it , and assails the integrity of its supporters in the most violent manner . I am asked , " Under which king , Bezonian ? " Do I give in my concurrence ? If not , what grounds of vot. cxxx. - No. 280. 14 // opposition can I presume to stand on ? Believing in the resolution of the Representatives , and dissenting from Mr. Howe 's article , the readers of the Review shall have the why and the wherefore not because my individual opinions are worth a rush , but because , on a subject so important , truth is entitled to every man 's defense ; because this faith is shared , in our time , by the most respectable citizens of all classes ; and because it is delivered to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best men that have lived in all the ages . A President of the United States may legally be elected and reelected for an indefinite number of terms ; there is nothing in the Constitution to forbid it ; but the two-term precedent set by Washington , followed by his successors , consecrated by time and approved by all the public men of the country , ripened into a rule as efficient in its operation as if it had been a part of the organic law . A distinguished and very able Senator of the Grant party , who had carefully inquired into the state of popular feeling , told me in 18Th that the sentiment which opposed a third term was stronger than a constitutional interdict ; the people would more readily assent to a breach of positive law textually inserted into the Constitution than to any disturbance of an unwritten rule which they regarded as so sacred . Certainly it was adhered to by all parties , with a fidelity which some of them did not show to the Constitution itself , down to 1875 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Grant for a third election . This was everywhere received by the rank and file with mutterings of mutiny , and the most devoted partisans responded with curses which if not loud were deep . The movement , as Mr. Howe tells us , was met by solemn warnings from the newspaper press , by strong protests from political conventions , and finally by the resolution quoted at the head of this article , which was a rebuke so overwhelming that the supporters of the third-term candidate fled from him in fear , deserted him utterly , and left him without a single vote in the nominating convention of his own party . Mr. Howe has no doubt that this resolution was the sole cause of Grant 's defeat in 1876 . He is equally certain that it was all wrong . He gives the Republicans who supported it no credit for sincere belief in the principle they professed . He says they were not " brave and conscientious " enough to " stake the post-offices " on Grant 's election ; he charges that they were moved only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they abandoned their chief in the midst of his struggle . It is not for me to say whether this imputation of cowardice and dishonesty is or is not a slander on the Republicans , but I think I know a good many of the gentlemen accused who are at least as brave and conscientious as Mr. Howe himself . It is doubtful if even the contractors and office-holders under General Grant were quite so godless a crew as Mr. Howe represents them to be . However that may be , the present intent of Mr. Howe is to rally the routed third-termers , and restore the courage of the recreants by the assurance that the jobs and offices are safe , after all . To that end he tells them that their panic was caused by a " spook , " they were frightened by a " strange fulmination , " they were " scared by a senseless clamor , " and by " reiterated vociferations , " and the Springer resolution , he says , was " a champion piece of charlatanry enacted in the House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps it may bring some of them back . But it proves nothing against the Springer resolution , and to destroy the effect of it is the task which Mr. Howe has set himself . His ultimate design is to elect General Grant , and no true lover of American liberty can vote for Grant with a safe conscience if he believes that a departure from the Washington precedent is " fraught with peril to our free institutions . " For this sufficient reason , and with this end in view , Mr. Howe goes seriously about the work of blackening the character of the Springer resolution and bringing it into public infamy , contempt , and hatred . He makes four specific and distinct charges against the resolution , and avows that the aim and intent of his article is to make these charges good . He " thunders in the index " and opens upon the resolution with these appalling threats : It is , therefore , the purpose of this article to show that in those few lines quoted from the Journal of the House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 2 ) a gross libel upon its framers ; ( 8 ) a base counterfeit of our political history ; and ( 4 ) a wanton insult to our common sense. * These are grave accusations . If the resolution is guilty of all this , it ought to be not only expunged , but cut out of the record and burned by the common hangman . It is worth while , therefore , // to see whether Mr. Howe 's arguments and proofs do accomplish the declared purpose of his article : I. I am not sure that I know what he means by impeachment of the Constitution . He certainly does not mean the violation of it . The wildest orator on a Western stump would not say that we are commanded by the Constitution to elect the same person three times . Mr. Howe himself goes no further than to say that the Constitution " clearly permits it . " He has some misty and confused idea in his head that we dishonor the Constitution , or fly in the face of it , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fundamental law , " he says , " puts no limit to the number of terms for which the people may elect the same man to the Presidency , " and from this proposition he jumps to the conclusion that the Constitution is impeached ( whatever that may mean ) when the representatives of the people affirm the danger and impropriety of giving more than two terms to the same person . A gentleman who has occupied the seat of a Senator in Congress ought to know that the Constitution " clearly permits " many things which , nevertheless , ought not to be done . Without encountering any prohibition , we might make the criminal code as bloody as that of Draco ; or keep a standing army of half a million of men in time of peace ; or starve labor by taxation to stuff capital with bounties . But is it any impeachment of the Constitution to say that such measures would be " unwise , unpatriotic , and fraught with peril to our free institutions " ? Mr. Howe alleges loudly , learnedly , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is now eligible-that is to say , capable of being elected notwithstanding his two previous elections . To show this he has spread himself over many pages of dreary and commonplace writing . His success is perfect , if success it can be called to prove what no human being in the world ever thought of denying ; but from this conceded truth , so elaborately set forth , he draws the absurd inference that we can not refuse to elect him without an impeachment of the Constitution . This kind of logic , if we adopt it , will lead to curious consequences . If one citizen must be elected because he is eligible , what are we to do with the millions of others who are equally eligible ? We can not elect every male native over thirty years of age , but , if we do not make them all Presidents at once , we impeach the Constitution , which provides that any one of them may be chosen . The Constitution " clearly permits " us to elect a third-term candidate or a // new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violate duty by rejecting one as much as the other . The fifteenth amendment makes an African eligible ; therefore we impeach the amendment every time we elect a white man , andwe impeach the original instrument if we choose a negro ; " either way we 're sped . " The logic of Mr. Howe will apply to State officers and to subordinate officers of the United States with as much force as to the President . Mr. Robinson was Governor of New York , a candidate for reelection , and clearly eligible ; his defeat was , in the opinion of many good men , most improper , unwise , and unpatriotic , but neither his friends nor his enemies thought the Constitution impeached by the election of his competitor . Mr. Howe was a Senator , and when his term expired he was anxious above all things to be reelected , but for some reason , of which I know nothing , he was rather badly beaten . He himself may have believed that the Legislature of Wisconsin impeached the Constitution when it chose Mr. Carpenter in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . The friends of a third term may complain that I am taking an unfair advantage of Mr. Howe 's loose language . Perhaps his meaning may be more precisely expressed thus ; The Constitution permits the same man to be elected three times or oftener ; the Springer resolution declares it unwise , unpatriotic , and dangerous to elect any one more than twice ; and this is an impeachment of the Constitution , because , in effect , it affirms that the Constitution " sanctions an act malevolent in its tendencies . " But , after all the help we can give him in stating and restating his view , it remains as preposterous as ever . The Constitution leaves to the people an unlimited discretion in the choice of their Chief Magistrate . To any man 's pretensions they have a legal right to say no as well as yes . They and their representatives may certainly deliberate and determine how that discretion shall be exercised , and to put their decision into the form of a general rule or political principle which will exclude classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus we might resolve against the propriety of electing a drunkard or a gambler , though there is nothing in the Constitution which makes a sot or a blackleg ineligible . The Constitution " clearly permits " one who is or has been an officer of the army to be made President ; but , when General Jackson was a candidate , all the antiDemocrats of that day resolved and re-resolved that the election of a military chieftain would be not only unwise , unpatriotic , and dangerous , but a calamity to the country worse than war , pestilence , and // famine combined . This was false , no doubt , but it was not suspected then or since of being an impeachment of the Constitution . All , or nearly all , citizens of the South who fought for their " lost cause " are eligible to the Presidency , but Mr. Howe would concur without hesitation in a resolution declaring the election of a Confederate brigadier " unwise , unpatriotic , and fraught with peril to our free institutions , " and it would never strike him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act so malevolent in its tendencies. ** This allegation that the Constitution has been impeached is so weak and so shallow that it would not deserve refutation if it were not the main objection of the leading third-termer to a wise and salutary rule , established by the fathers of the republic and concurred in by all parties of the present day ; for this two-term rule is not only recommended by its intrinsic soundness , it is orthodox according to St. Augustine 's definition of orthodoxy : " Quod u6ique , quod semper , quod a1* omni6us creditum est . " That which is believed to be right everywhere , always , and by all persons , must be defended by the faithful even against the puniest assaults of interested and ill-natured schismatics . II . It is asserted , in the second place , that the resolution of Congress is a gross li6el upon the framers of the Constitution ; that is to say , it slanders the character of the men who made the Constitution , and maliciously injures or attempts to injure their good repute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross libel " ? General Washington , " the foremost man of all this world , " presided at their deliberations , and , next after Washington , the most conspicuous member of the body was Madison , who took so large a part in framing the Constitution that he has ever since been called the father of it . These two illustrious men afterward became President under the Constitution which was the work of their hands . Although they were not required to lay down their charge at any specified period of their service , yet both of them did voluntarily retire after serving two terms . During all their subsequent lives they were followed by the approving benedictions of their countrymen ; and their graves are hallowed ground . They rested from their labors , and their righteous works did follow them , time-honored , through later generations . When the Romans desired to honor a deceased benefactor , they went up to the Capitol and publicly crowned his statue with laurels : // the Representatives of the American people , in December , 1875 , did for Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one voice commended their example as worthy of all imitation . This commendation , expressed in language implying love and admiration as perfect as could be on this side of idolatry , is what Mr. Howe calls a gross lilel on them and all the framers of the Constitution ! Can the absurdity of mortal man go further ? III . Besides this , the resolution , according to Mr. Howe , is a lase counterfeit of our political history . Here he takes me entirely out of my depth . I can not form the remotest conjecture of what he would be at . I have fairly tried to comprehend him , but I give it up . Congress expressed its belief in a certain political principle or rule of action , and Mr. Howe calls the expression a counterfeit of history ! When an ex-Senator undertakes to be a public teacher , his utterances ought to have some kind of meaning in them , but this appears to be mere " sound and fury signifying nothing . " JSf* He has another objection to the resolution : he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ordinary style of a disputant who knows he is angry but does not know why ; it is the usual explosion of rage without reason ; it was Mrs. Moriarty 's objurgation upon O'Connell when he told her the fish was not sound ; it is the commonest kind of scolding , for which there is no answer and no punishment except the ducking-stool . It was the express purpose of Mr. Howe 's article to show these four allegations against the Springer resolution to be good and true . He has ignominiously failed at all points , and therefore the article itself is such a manifest abortion that it might be allowed to pass without further notice . But he has other arguments for a third term . They are not true or powerful or even plausible , but they are curious enough to invite attention and , perhaps , to reward examination . From the conceded fact that the Constitution does not forbid reelection , he reasons that in practice r&amp;Mections should go on without Limit ; and he thinks he strengthens this argument if he shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored by the men who framed and adopted it . Therefore he says : " No one idea was so prominent or so universal in the Constitutional Convention as this : Presidents must be redigilile . " He emphasizes this in screaming italics , and follows it immediately by citing at great length certain proceedings of the Convention-votes , speeches , reports , and // propositions-which , instead of supporting , flatly contradict the assertion with which he started out . They prove incontestably that in fact and truth there was no one idea about which there was so much difference , doubt , hesitation , and change of mind . The idea , supported for a long time , and with great firmness , by a large majority , was exactly the reverse . That Presidents must not be reeligible-never at all  --  but confined strictly to one single term , was a proposal not only made and debated , but adopted and carried time and again , though earnestly opposed by Gouverneur Morris , Roger Sherman , and Rufus King . It was not until the very close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final adjournment , that the present plan of choosing the President by electors coupled with reeligibihty was agreed to . And all this is made manifest by Mr. Howe 's own citations from the debates and journals . Other partisans before now may have been as reckless in assertion as he ; but I am not aware that any one has so incontinently refuted himself . He says , " The records of that great debate do not preserve the name of a single man of judgment so debauched as to object to the reëligibility of Presidents , if only the choice could be preserved from legislative control . " Here he measures his . words with a caution he does not often use . He wishes it to be understood that the only opposition to r&amp;iligibility was grounded on the mode of election by the Legislature , and to make this impression he declares that no other objection was urged in the de6ate which took place while legislative election was a part of the plan . This can be contradicted only at the expense of examining all the speeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegation , even if true literally , is substantially false . That was not the only nor even the principal objection . There was a general desire to limit the time during which the office might be held by the same person , irrespective of the mode in which he should be elected . Nobody-certainly no undebauched man of that day-professed a wish to see the executive power iu one hand continually . They were founding a free republic , to last not for a day , but for all time , and they knew very well that a republic with executive power and patronage perpetually wielded by the same person would soon cease to be a republic either in form or in substance . That this was the general if not universal sentiment is shown by the specific declarations to that effect of the most eminent and best informed among them , and by the practical action of all in the formation of their State governments , which uniformly provided for short limitations upon the // tenure of their principal magistrates . Besides all this , here is another fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not-namely , that the objection to reëligibility was kept np after the present mode of election had been agreed to and settled : New York proposed that the President should not be eligible a third time ; Virginia and North Carolina expressed their wish that he should be made incapable of serving more than eight years in any term of sixteen . Mr. Howe 's allegation on this point is true so far , and so far only , that the opponents of r&amp;Aigibility ceased their determined struggle against it when the present plan of electing the President became a fixed part of the Constitution . Their fears were in a great measure quieted when the power to control the choice was taken away from the Legislature and put into the hands of electors appointed by the States ; for that was virtually leaving it to the people , and the people , under the great chief who had led them through the perils of the Revolution and surrendered his commission at the close of it , could be trusted to act rightly without being bound up by express legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , would certainly be first in the administration of the new government , and sure to set an example which none of his successors would ever depart from . The event justified their faith . Washington was the first President . He was elected and re*ilected unanimously . No name could stand for a moment before the competition of his . But at the end of his second term he retired to private life . This gave the crowning glory to his character , called forth the plaudits of the civilized world , and all men wi/*h joint acclamation agreed that*nothing in his great public careerbecame him better than the ending of it ) Those who succeeded him did likewise , and strengthened the authority of his example by repeating it . So it came to pass that no President who reached a second term , from the organization of the Government to the centennial year of Independence , asked for a third term , or suffered himself to be named as a candidate again . But in Mr. Howe 's estimation all these examples go for nothing . Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion they are pernicious and fit only to be the cause of senseless clamor and popular panic . His manner of depreciating the value of the precedents and belittling the characters of the men who set them is worth looking at . He argues that Washington 's conduct in retiring ought not to // be imitated because his reasons were " not patriotic , " but personal . Washington had an intense desire for the rural tranquillity of Mount Vernon , and Mr. Howe cites against him his passionate declaration , that he " would rather be on his farm than be made emperor of the world . " A man of such sentiments , Mr. Howe thinks , ought not to influence the behavior of another who has no taste for agriculture ; and he professes his total inability to see why the refusal of a third term by Washington , who did not want it , should be quoted nearly a century later against Grant , who does want it very much . Washington longed to lay aside the trappings of power , " which galled him while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grant , who would gladly wear them for life ? Popular veneration for the men who built up our institutions is the strongest support for the institutions themselves . It is not only a great good intrinsically , but also the motive principle to other virtues which are indispensable in a government like ours . Anything , therefore , which unjustly detracts from their reputation is a grievous public injury . This applies most especially to Washington , who is acknowledged , not only by us , but by every nation , tongue , and kindred under heaven , to have been incomparably the greatest man that any country ever produced . An indecent criticism upon him shocks and shames us like blasphemy . Nevertheless , we would not abridge the liberty of speech . A raging thirdtermer has as good a right to sneer at the Father of his Country as an independent Hottentot has to beat his mother . But Mr. Howe 's censure of the Washington precedent is based upon a false morality . It supposes that the virtuous act of a public man is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be treated with total contempt by any successor whose personal inclinations are averse to it . This leaves no distinction between right and wrong , except what is made by the passions and interests of each individual . Cincinnatus assumed the dictatorship of Rome at the urgent call of his country , drove away the Gauls and relieved the city from its imminent danger as rapidly as possible ; then , laying aside the lictors and the fasces , and the curule-car , and the purple robe , he hastened immediately home to his plowing , which he had reluctantly left unfinished . By the influence of this example the Romans were saved from slavery a score of times , and their liberties were finally lost by disregarding it ; but , according to Mr. Howe 's notion , it was not binding on any subsequent dictator , unless he was , like Cincinnatus , particularly fond of plowing . Very // probably the sycophants of Marius and Sylla and C*esar presented to them exactly this view of the subject . General Grant may accept it at the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that a point has been made against Washington strong enough to do the cause of third term much good . Mr. Howe appears to be under the erroneous impression that Mr. Adams the elder was twice elected ; but , inasmuch as nobody asked him to be a candidate for a third term , his example " furnishes no more sanction to the Springer resolution than does the example of Mr. Washington . " Mr. Howe 's habitual want of precision may sometimes make him seem to be ignorant when he is not ; but , if he had known that Mr. Adams was defeated when a candidate for a second term , and , therefore , could not possibly be cited as an example for or against a third term , he would certainly have spared us the irrelevant and pointless assertion that the examples of Adams and Washington are alike worthless as a sanction to the doctrine which favors retirement after a second term . Jefferson also comes under review . his precedent , whether good or evil , is at least " to the purpose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey , and Pennsylvania , dated on the 10th of December , 1807 , and printed in the " Aurora " at Philadelphia on the 19th of the same month , he solemnly and publicly announced to the country that he would not disregard the precedent of his illustrious predecessor by accepting another election . His reasons are brief , simple , and clear , like all the productions of that master-hand , and expressed in language so transparently truthful and dignified that no man of rightly constituted mind can read the paper without being stirred by the strongest emotions of respect and admiration for its author . It compresses into a few sentences all that needs to be said in favor of the two-term limitation , and is at the same time a perfect answer to all objections . Mr. howe is fair enough to take a passage from it and incorporate it with his article ; it shines there like a piece of solid gold set in a shapeless mass of lead . Confined as I am in time and space , and unnecessary as it may seem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page by quoting entire the letter of which Mr. Howe has given a part . In these times , when the subject is up for renewed consideration , this letter should be read again and again ; every citizen ought to have it by heart and teach it to his children , write it on the lintels of his door , bind it as a frontlet between his eyes , and make it the subject of his meditation day and night : // Deeem6er 10 , 1807 . To the Legislature of Vermont . I received in due season the address of the Legislature of Vermont , bearing date the 5th of November , 1806 , in which , with their approbation of the general course of my Administration , they were so good as to express their desire that I would consent to be proposed again to the public voice on the expiration of my present term of office . Entertaining as I do for the Legislature of Vermont those sentiments of high respect which would have prompted an immediate answer , I was certain , nevertheless , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premature agitation of the public mind on a subject so interesting as the election of a Chief Magistrate . That I should lay down my charge at a proper period is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully . If some termination to the services of the Chief Magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution , or supplied by practice , his office , nominally for years , will in fact become for life ; and history shows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance . Believing that a representative government responsible at short periods of election is that which produces the greatest sum of happiness to mankind , I feel it a duty to do no act which shall essentially impair that principle ; and I should unwillingly be the person who , disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor , should furnish the first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office . Truth also requires me to add that I am sensible of that decline which advancing years bring on , and , feeling their physical , I ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to perceive and to obey this admonition of nature , and to solicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of age . For the approbation which the Legislature of Vermont has been pleased to express of the principles and measures pursued in the management of their affairs , I am sincerely thankful ; and should I be so fortunate as to carry into retirement the equal approbation and good will of my fellow citizens generally , it will be the comfort of my future days , and will close a service of forty years with the only reward it ever wished . Two days after the publication of the foregoing letter , to wit , on the 21st of December , 1807 , he wrote to the Appomattox Association ( Baptist ) thus Believing that a definite period of retiring from this station will tend materially to secure our elective form of government , and sensible , too , of that decline which advancing years brings on , I have felt it a duty to withdraw at the close of my present term of office ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutary . That others may be found whose talents and integrity render them proper deposits of the public liberty and // interests , and who have made themselves known by their eminent services , we can all affirm of our personal knowledge . February 3 , 1808 , he told the citizens of Philadelphia , in town meeting assembled : " Your approbation of the motives for my retirement from the station so long confided to me is confirmation of their correctness . In no office can rotation be more expedient ; and none less admits the indulgence of age . " On the 16th of the same month he said to the citizens of Wilmington , Delaware : " It is a consolation to know that the motives for my retirement are approved ; and although I withdraw from public functions I shall continue an anxious spectator of passing events , and offer to Heaven my constant prayers for the preservation of our republic , and especially of those its best principles which secure to all its citizens a perfect equality of rights . " Similar expressions are scattered all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after he retired to Monticello he continued to repeat them . His conviction deepened , as the years rolled on , that the principle of two terms was the only safe one , and he constantly expressed his gratitude for the universal approval of his conduct in adopting it . How is this met by the late Senator from Wisconsin ? Mr. Jefferson ' s reasons for retiring are opposed by objections none of which rises to the dignity of a quibble . The best specimen of hypercriticism that can be selected from among fhem is embodied in the charge that Mr. Jefferson 's declination deprived the people of the right to choose whom they would for President . The very words of the article are these : " The people had not free choice but restricted choice , and their freedom was impaired by the act of Mr. Jefferson . " If this oracular judgment be correct , we must take it hereafter as settled law that whosoever declines being a candidate for the Presidency commits a crime against the freedom of elections . Nevertheless , Mr. Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are satisfactory . " Still he is not satisfied . Having demolished General Washington , he does not think it well to let Mr. Jefferson stand . Therefore he sets about the serious work of making Jefferson altogether infamous . He avers ( in his own loose way , of course , but still intelligibly enough ) that Mr. Jefferson was an impostor , utterly faithless and insincere through all this business ; that , so far from wishing to retire , a ccording to // the precedent he professed to believe in , he was actually a busy candidate for a third term ; that he engaged for thirteen months in an active canvass to get himself elected ; that there was a Jefferson boom in which Virginia , his own State , obstinately refused to join ; that he gave up the chase only when he found himself beaten by Madison , and then he falsely pretended that he did not want a third term ; that his tardy declination was merely an attempt to frame his disappointment into a law which should prevent any of his successors from serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were true , the conclusion would be natural and just , that a precedent made or a practice established by Jefferson deserves only the disdain of honest people . But every well-informed man in the country , except Mr. Howe , knows this whole accusation to be false in every point and circumstance . Mr. Jefferson never sought a third election , or engaged in any canvass with that object , or expressed by act or word any desire to be chosen again . On the contrary , Mr. Madison , then his Secretary of State , and always his devoted friend , was a candidate with his fullest approbation , and received from him all the support which he could becomingly give . The charge now made , that he was unfaithful to his friend , his country , and his own expressed convictions of public duty , is unsupported by a single spark of evidence . Mr. Howe 's belief in it pretends to rest on nothing except the naked and solitary fact that Mr. Jefferson published his declination , and gave the reasons for it , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chosen , although one of the addresses on the subject ( that from the Legislature of Vermont ) was dated a year previous . This has not the slightest tendency to prove it , or even to suggest a suspicion of it , in the mind of any fair man who considers how many and how proper might be the reasons for delicate silence about everything concerning the Presidential election of 1808 until the State elections of 1807 were overpassed . But the charge becomes a scandal and a shame when we look at Mr. Jefferson 's own explanation of his delay , as given in that part of the Vermont letter which Mr. Howe has not published . It is worse still-it is an outrage upon truth-when it is seen to be inconsistent with every material fact which the history of the time discloses . This is a fresh calumny upon Jefferson  --  the latest of many thousands . I do not impugn the personal veracity of Mr. Howe when I say that his party , at all times and under all of its many // names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Democracy . It has not forgiven , and it will never forgive him , for maintaining the rights of the States and the liberties of the people , while he preserved the powers of the General Government in their whple constitutional vigor . It seems a useless labor to vindicate him ; for the enemies of the fr*e system which he did so much to sustain are continually reviving old slanders or fabricating new ones . The spider , whose web is broken by the broom , invariably reconstructs it or spins another from his bowels : " Destroy his fib or sophistry-in vain ; The creature 's at its dirty work again . " But Madison also adopted the principle of his two predecessors , and retired at the end of his second term . Can nothing be urged against the Father of the Constitution to depreciate his authority or make his example worthless ? Was not he also unpatriotic and selfishly fond of his farm ? This could be as easily said , and is not harder to believe , of him than pf Washington . The charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a third term , declining only upon the failure of a Madison boom ; and history would not contradict it more emphatically than it contradicts the story of Jefferson 's boom . But not a word have the third-termers to say about him in the way of detraction , except that he is libeled by the praise of Congress . Except for that , we are graciously permitted to take his precedent and follow it with respect undiminished . And there was Monroe , apparently " so clear in his great office " that rivalry itself shrunk from his presence , and he was elected a second time without effort , without opposition , without one vote against him . Is it nothing to the purpose that he acknowledged the value of the Washington precedent ? Concede that he , the most popular of all Presidents , except the first one , could not have got a third term if he had asked for it , then his retirement proves not only that the two-term practice was right in his individual opinion , but that the general judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in point of fact , that at that time , and for long before , the precedent set by Washington " had become by universal consent a part of our republican system of government , " and the whole people , much as they loved Mr. Monroe , would have frowned him out of countenance if he had attempted to resist it . Still , it is odd that the abuse by the Federalists of Mr. Monroe , or even the // vituperation of Burr , should not have been fished up and reproduced to show that his example is as worthless as that of the other Presidents . Perhaps Mr. Howe , as a matter of literary taste , thinks it proper to deal only in original slanders . General Jackson does not get off so easily . We are told that " there is ground for believing that if Mr. Van Buren had not secured the succession to General Jackson the latter would have been retained for another term . " This is like the account we have of Jefferson 's boom . If there was any practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference than another , it was their voluntary retirement after a proper period of service . He was wholly opposed to the indefinite continuance of power in the same hand , and he expressed his opinions on that , as on other subjects , with an emphasis which left no chance for misapprehension . The ground for believing that " in a certain contingency he would have been retained another term " is not anything he ever did or forbore to do-nothing that he ever wrote or spoke-nothing that ever was authorized by him or by the party which supported him , or by any representative of either . Mr. Howe has found somewhere an old newspaper , of date not given , but called the " Herald , " and printed at Philadelphia , no one knows by whom , which was so obscure while it lasted , and ceased to exist so long ago , that nobody living recollects anything about it  --  and this paper ( a Democratic paper , if Mr. Howe is correct ) said , at some time or another , on its own irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there should be serious division in the Democratic ranks , the National Convention would nominate Jackson for a third term . This prediction , which it is not pretended that Jackson ever saw or heard of , is " the ground for believing " that Jackson would have been retained , and constitutes the head and front of that great man 's offending against the Washington precedent which he believed in so devoutly and acted upon so faithfully . It is impossible to take such idle trash into serious consideration . We let it go for what it will fetch , assuring Mr. Howe that , though patience is not our special virtue , we are able , by the grace of God , to endure this harmless kind of nonsense about General Jackson without losing our temper . Such is the outcome of Mr. Howe 's assault upon the line of our great retiring Presidents , from Washington to Jackson inclusive . It must be admitted that , if the predetermined object of the attack was to make himself ridiculous , it is a marked success ; but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame , lower their standing , // or shake the confidence of the country in their virtue , then it is the flattest failure in his essay  --  and that is saying a great deal . It is not simply the unworthiness of those Presidents who have adopted the two-term practice which makes it so odious in the eyes of Mr. Howe ; their authority , he thinks , is overruled by the different and inconsistent practice of others . He says that " a majority of our Presidents have retired after a first term , " and then puts the very pertinent question , " Why should the two-term precedent become a part of our governmental system more than the one-term system ? " The answer is , that Mr. Howe is mistaken about the fact . A majority did not retire after a first term . Previous to the time of General Grant , fourteen citizens had been elected to the office of President . Five of them-Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and Jackson-were elected twice and retired after their second term . Two-Harrison and Taylor-were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died during his second term . Four-John Adams , J. Q. Adams , Van Buren , and Pierce-were elected only once . They did not retire after their term expired , but were candidates for a second term . Only two of all the fourteen-Polk and Buchanan-retired upon one term without asking a reciection . It is exclusively the last two named that can be quoted as examples of retirement after a first term . Where , if not in Louisiana , did Mr. Howe learn that two were a majority of fourteen ? But , suppose it to be true that a majority of our Presidents had voluntarily and actually retired after their first term , setting aside the two-term precedent , and substituting in its place the one-term principle " as a part of our governmental system , " how would that help Mr. Howe 's argument ? He is opposed to the two-term rule , and wants to prove that three terms are better ; thereupon he asserts that the highest authority is in favor of only one . He does not see that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots . In the article we are reviewing , the author , after denouncing the Washington rule , tries to evade its operation upon his candidate by saying : " It only enjoins retirement after a second term . Grant retired at the end of the second term in strict accord with the precedents and the resolution . " This is a dodge , and not a very artful one either . Grant never retired . He was , according to Mr. Howe 's own testimony , a candidate in 1876 , defeated by the influence of the Springer resolution and the cowardice of his party friends ; he has // been a candidate ever since , and is a candidate now . Call you that retirement " in strict accord with the precedents and the resolution " ? He was compelled to forego his claim to a third term when his second expired ; but he stood back for the time , only to thrust himself forward again at the first opportunity . How does that accord with the precedents ? An obligation is not measured merely by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to its sense , spirit , and equity . It is held under every code of morals and of law , in all civilized countries , that a performance which keeps the word , of promise to the ear and breaks it to the hope is no performance at alL For instance , an agreement to discontinue a pending action is not complied with by formally dismissing the suit and then immediately bringing another ; a contract to deliver a certain quantity of cloth in pieces is broken if it be cut into pieces so small as to make them useless ; a covenant to retire from the possession of land is not fulfilled when the occupant goes out to-day and comes back tomorrow . This principle of private and public morality , which detests shams , might be supported by innumerable cases if it were not too plain to need illustration . It will certainly be acknowledged by every candid man that , if General Grant , after two elections , kept himself in the field as a persistent candidate for a third term , the pretense that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the imposture is not chargeable upon him . He does not pretend to have retired . He is a candidate for another term in contempt of the precedents . He does not evade , but boldly defies th' authority of his predecessors . He has , and is entitled to , some credit for obtuseness of moral perception , but still he is conscious that equivocation is as bad as direct falsehood ; and we have no right to suppose that he ever adopted the Know-nothing philosophy , which teaches its disciples to " Palter with us in a double sense , And lie like truth . " Thus far I have been answering objections to the two-term rule , and to the character of the men who made it . I think it may be affirmed with some confidence that Washington was not unworthy of the profound veneration in which he is held in this country and throughout the world ; that succeeding Presidents , when they followed his footsteps , not only acknowledged his wisdom and patriotism , but showed their own ; that the American people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate who had already // served for two , were not behaving like cowards scared by a senseless clamor , but doing what a prudent regard for their true interests required ; that when the House of Representatives , in obedience to the universal sentiment of its constituents , unanimously and without distinction of party , put upon its records and published to the world its solemn declaration that the example of Washington must be adhered to in the future as in the past , they did not enact charlatanism or repeat a vociferation , or issue a strange fulmination , or impeach the Constitution , or li6el its framers , or counterfeit history , or insult common sense , but spoke what they at least believed to be the words of truth and soberness . But perhaps it is not enough to have negatived Mr. Howe 's allegations . We are not to set up political dogmas or invoke a blind faith even in the founders of the republic . The mere authority of names , however great , ought not to command our assent . We should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of season to give them when asked for . But a fundamental doctrine , self-evidently true , though easy to defend , is the hardest of all things to support by affirmative argument . We can not help but sympathize with the indignation of Pitt when he thundered out his refusal to look at books or listen to logic in defense of English liberty . In a free country , the man who would be faithful to his fellows is necessarily inclined to take as a postulate whatever manifestly tends to the preservation of the public right . In the matter before us , it should be plain to every " reasonable creature in esse " that long continuance of supreme executive power in one hand is not only perilous to free institutions , but perfectly certain to destroy them . Some fixed time there ought to be when the people will not only have the right , but exercise it , to displace their Chief Magistrate and take another . If they do not possess this right , they are political bond-servants by law ; if , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make themselves , quoad hoc , voluntary slaves , and they soon come to be governed in all things by the will of their superior . A lease for years , renewable and always renewed , gives the tenant an estate without end , and makes him lord of the fee . Where the Chief Magistrate is vested , as ours is , with great power liable to gross abuse , if there is no law or practice which forbids him to be reelected , he can remain in office for life as easily ' as for a term . He has the appointment of all officers , the making of all public contracts , and a veto upon all legislation , besides the cornmand // of the army and navy . By an unscrupulous use of these means he can coerce not only his horde of immediate dependents , but he can control the corporations and become the master of all the rings , put the business of all classes under his feet , corrupt the venal , frighten the timid , and check all ambitions but his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry by the bayonets of his army . If that falls , he can order a false return , and pay for it out of the public Treasury . The people would soon perceive opposition to be useless and accept the situation ; elections would be as mere a matter of form as they were in Rome when such consuls as Nero and Domitian were elected regularly every year under the supervision of the pretorian guards . If these were no more than remote possibilities , prudence should guard us against them . But they are near probabilities ; the signs of the times warn us that the peril to our institutions is imminent ; the danger is already on the wing . It is vain to remind us that the President swears to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution and see the laws faithfully executed . That is true ; and it is also true that , if there be no perjury in the case , the Constitution , laws , and liberties of the country are safe . But the last twenty years have given us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a President who is incited by ambition , rapacity , or strong party feeling , to break it . It is true that this presupposes a people much degenerated and a magistrate animated mainly by the vulgar love of power for its own sake ; but exactly such a conjunction of things has always been feared with good reason , and hence comes the desire to put every check on that tendency to " strong government " which is now manifesting itself in many quarters . What is the remedy ? How shall we avert the dire calamities with which we are threatened ? The answer comes from the graves of our fathers : By the frequent election of new men . Other help or hope for the salvation of free government there is none under heaven . If history does not teach this , we have read it all wrong . In the republics of ancient and modern times the chief magistrate was intrusted with only temporary power , and always went out of office at the end of a short period , fixed and prescribed by law or custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial distinction between them and the monarchies around them . An unpunished transgression of the customary limitation was uniformly followed by destruc // tion . Everywhere and always it was the fatal symptom of decay  --  the sure forerunner of ruin . When C*esar refused to lay down his consulship , as his predecessors had done , at the end of a year , and was reelected time after time with the acquiescence of the Senate and the people , all that was real in Roman freedom ceased to exist . Two republics in France were brought to an end in the same way . Napoleon began by being Consul for a term , then was elected for life , and finally became Emperor , with the powers of an absolute despot . The last Bonaparte was President for four years , was reelected for ten , and ended , like his uncle , in grasping the imperial crown . " May this be washed in Lethe and forgotten " ? Shall these lessons be lost ? Shall the lamp which guided our forefathers be extinguished ? Shall the broad daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark lantern manufactured at Milwaukee ? I think this can not be done ; " the eternal verities " are against it . The most powerful third-termer may as well try to blow out the sun , as he would a tallow candle , with the breath of his mouth . Moreover , the two-term principle ought to be adl*ered to by us and by those who come after us ( if there were no other reason ) , simply because it was a practice of those who went before us . It is to the traditions of the fathers that we owe our civilization . All that we have which is holy in religion , pure in morals , or perfect in politics , is so derived and so transmitted . Without that , we could not be a nation in any proper sense of the term , but a mere collection of barbarians , tame or savage according to circumstances . The practice of one generation is and ought to be law for another . In England every custom favoring civil liberty , once adopted by general consent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs make up the body of the common law , and the English Constitution itself is but a collection of them . " Honor thy father and thy mother , that thy days may be long in the land " : - this command was addressed to a people , and it was length of rational life that God promised as the reward of obedience . The later prophets spake as they were moved when they warned that same people that their institutions would perish if they were given unto change , and exhorted them to be conservative  --  to " look at the old paths and stand upon the ancient ways . " I do not expect anything I can say to be received as a vindication of the two-term rule . Nor is it necessary . All the support it requires was long ago furnished by another , the latchet of whose // shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose . Jefferson , the stainless citizen , the sterling patriot , the unequaled statesman-at once the greatest apostle and the truest prophet that human freedom ever had-gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule , but expressed his convictions after they were strengthened by many years of later reflection . His brief autobiography , written in the retirement of Monticello , contains the following passage This Convention met in Philadelphia on the 25th of May , 1Z87 . It sat with closed doors , and kept all its proceedings secret until its dissolution on the l'Tth of September , when the results of its labors were published all together . I received a copy early in November , and read and contemplated its provisions with great satisfaction . As not a member of the Convention , however , nor probably a single citizen of the Union had approved it in all its parts , so I too found articles which I thought objectionable . The absence of express declarations insuring freedom of religion , freedom of the press , freedom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the habeas Corpus , and trial by jury in civil as well as in criminal cases , excited my jealousy , and the reëligibility of the President for life I quite disapproved . I expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Madison and General Washingto* , my approbations and objections . How the good should be secured and the ill brought to rights was the difficulty . To refer it back to a new Convention might endanger the loss of the whole . My first idea was , that tbe nine States first acting should accept it unconditionally , and thus secure what in it was good , and that the last four should accept on the previous condition that certain amendments should be agreed to ; but a better course was devised , of accepting the whole and trusting that the good sense and honest intuitions of our citizens would make the alterations which should be deemed necessary . Accordingly , all accepted , six without objection and seven with recommendations of specified amendments . Those respecting the press , religion , and juries , with several others of great value , were accordingly made ; but the hcdeas corpus was left to the discretion of Congress , and the amendment against the reSligibility of the President was not proposed . My fears of that feature were founded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might excite among ourselves , if continuable for life , and the dangers of interference , either with money or arms , by foreign nations to whom the choice of an American President might become interesting . Ex- , amples of this abounded in history ; in the case of the Roman Emperors , for instance ; of the Popes , while of any significance ; of the German Emperors ; the Kings of Poland , and the Deys of Barbary . I had observed too , in the feudal history , and in the recent instance particularly of the Stadtholder of Holland , how easily offices or tenures for life slide into inheritances . My wish , therefore , was that the President should be elected for seven years and be ineligible afterward . This term I thought sufficient to enable him , with the concurrence of the Legislature , to carry through and establish any system of improvement he should propose for the general good . But the practice // adopted , I think , is better , allowing his continuance for eight years , with a liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a period of probation . That his continuance should be restrained to seven years was the opinion of the Convention at an earlier stage of its session , when it voted that term by a majority of eight against two , and by a simple majority that he should be ineligible a second time . This opinion was confirmed by the House so late as July 26th , referred to the committee of detail , reported favorably by them , and changed to the present form by final vote , on the last day but one of their session . Of this change three States expressed their disapprobation-New York by recommending an amendment that the President should not be eligible a third time , and Virginia and North Carolina that he should not be capable of serving more than eight in any term of sixteen years ; and , though this amendment has not been made in form , yet practice seems to have established it . The example of four Presidents voluntarily retiring at the end of their eighth year , and the progress of public opinion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of precedent and usage ; insomuch that should a President consent to be a candidate for a third election , I trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views . It is time now that we come to the concrete part of the subject . The practical object of Mr. Howe 's article is to make General Grant President for another term . It is not for an abstraction that he denounces the two-term precedent and vilifies the Springer resolution . The rule might stand if Grant could be elected without breaking it down . But Mr. Howe thinks that the superiority of his candidate is so very great that all authorities which oppose him should be disregarded , and he supports this opinion by assertions so extravagant that we only wonder how any man in his sober senses could have made them . He pictures Grant as " the foremost man of his age " ; says " he stands upon the mountain-top , " and declares that " the eager world has set the seal of its primacy " on him . Grant 's competitorsBlame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them-are described as " mere metallic calves , " and all his opponents are scared miners , with candles in their caps , " going into subterranean depths to quarry out a President . " This imagery is bold and original , though not highly poetic nor very gracefully turned . It is Mr. Howe 's way of saying that he will be very wroth if Grant is not made President a third time , in spite of the salutary principle which forbids it . But we are more afraid of General Grant than we are of Mr. Howe ; we would infinitely rather be scolded by the one than scourged by the other ; and therefore we , the yeomanry of the country , driven to a choice of evils , presume to withstand Mr. Howe , // and tell him in his senatorial face that his master shall not be ours if we can help it . When it comes to the tug , General Grant may be too much for the nation , but it shall not be said that we are frightened by this preliminary blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean a third term only , but any number of terms that he chooses to demand . The imperial method of carrying all elections by corruption or force , or of declaring them to be carried when they are not , is to be permanently substituted for the system of free , popular choice . The figure of Grant standing with the seal of primacy on the mountain-top and looking down on the inhabitants of the plain below gives a measure of the elevation which his sycophants flatter him with the hope of attaining . They urge the necessity of a strong government almost in the very words used by the adherents of Qesar and the two Napoleons . Strong government , in their sense , means weak laws and a strong ruler-in other words , a substantial monarchy , powerful in its scorn of all legal restraints . If Mr. Howe does not know this to be the design , he is not fit to share in the third-term movement , much less to lead it . He should learn the views of his faction with all possible haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is not a " metallic calf " nor a scared miner , but a worshiper of the man on the mountain as eager as himself . Let him look at the idea of a strong government as given in the February " Atlantic Monthly " ; let him listen to the diatribes of all his associates , who speak with habitual contempt about the rights of the States , or let him go up to the mountain and ask His Primacy what he himself thinks of a President who is tame enough to keep his oath of fidelity to an old Constitution which forbids him to trample upon the rights of the people . We the people-I do not speak by authority , but truly as far as I know-we the people are not in every event , and in all possible contingencies , unalterably opposed to a strong government with General Grant for a monarch . If his instatement can be accomplished by the direct application of physical force , without any shams or false pretenses , it may be a comparative good for us . If , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , he will candidly declare it abolished , and have no perjury in the business , we may accept our fate , and accept it uncomplainingly , lest a worse thing come to us . A rotten republic is an infi .. finitely worse thing . A free democratic republican system of government honestly // administered by agents of the people 's true choice ; a government such as ours was intended to be , with the powers of the Federal Government , the rights of the States , and the liberties of the people so harmoniously adjusted that each may check the excesses of the other-such a government , scrupulously administered within its constitutional limits , is , without doubt , the choicest blessing that God in his loving-kindness ever vouchsafed to any people : On the other hand , it is quite as sure that the false administration of a government theoretically free ; which acknowledges the rights of the people , and yet continually treads them under foot ; which swears to save and perjuriously works to destroy ; which receives and promises to execute a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then dishonestly breaks the engagement-such a government , so conducted , is an unspeakable curse . It is not only an oppression , but a most demoralizing cheat ; a base imposture , more degrading to the nation which submits to it than the heaviest yoke that despotic tyranny can fasten on its neck . If , therefore , a constitutional and legal administration of our national affairs be out of the question-if our only choice lies between a perverted republic and a monarchy-then stop this hypocritical pretense of free government , and give us a king . And who shall be our royal master but Grant ? That he will serve the turn as well as if not better than another , will , I think , be admitted by all who attend to the reasons now presently to be enumerated . In the first place , a new monarch ( that is , one who has no hereditary claims ) ought to be an approved good soldier , with skill to enforce obedience ; otherwise his sway could not last long over people disposed to be turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal lines have been military men from Nimrod downward . It is vain to deny that General Grant 's reputation for military talent is well founded . It is more than doubtful if any officer of our army could have subjugated the South so completely even with all Grant 's advantages , or taken so many defeats and still won a complete victory in the end . It is not , however , what he has done , but what he has shown himself capable of doing , that gives him his leading qualification for masterdom now . The fear that goes before him will make actual violence unnecessary . His strength of character will frighten his subjects into submission where a weaker man would be compelled to butcher them for insurrection . General Grant is a good hater of those who thwart him , which is natural , and not a serious fault ; but he is not fiercely vindictive , // and his career has been marked by no act of savage cruelty . He could not be an Antonine or a Titus , but we can trust him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his moral behavior and mental acquirements do not bring him up to the mark which ought to be reached by the permanent ruler of a great , intelligent , and highly civilized nation . But in this respect he is as good as the average of sovereign princes . The present reigning family of England has never had a male member who was his superior . For centuries past the potentates of Continental Europe , with only a few exceptions , have had habits as coarse as his , and he is wholly free from some terrible vices to which many of them were addicted . It seems to me that he will do well enough to " herd with vulgar kings . " The nepotism from which our democratic tastes revolt is virtue in a king . All monarchs are expected to look after their own families first , and all have their minions and favorites whom they fatten , spoil , and corrupt . Who among them has not given his protection to a worse set than Grant ? The favor which Grant bestows upon corrupt rings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be elected , as President he can not sustain himself , without their support ; but enthrone him and he can afford to defy them . May we not reasonably hope that he will use his power , when it becomes omnipotent , to make these bad combinations cease to plunder the people ? What we call the greediness of General Grant for the wages of official iniquity would be entirely proper in the supreme ruler of an absolute government . It is not bribery to buy the favor of a king with presents , and a king is not guilty of stealing when he helps himself to public money without legal right . It looks to ns like a terrible outrage for a President to have himself represented at a State election by the bayonets of his standing army , to install Governors that were rejected at the polls , to tumble the chosen Legislature of a free State out of its hall , to procure the fabrication of false returns and force them on the people . But General Grant 's lawlessness would be lawful in a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where there is no law there can be no transgression . But while General Grant has some qualities which would make him a tolerable king , and none that would make him an unendurably bad one , he is not at all the kind of person that is needed as President of the tTnited States on the assumption that our system of gov // eminent is to be continued . I think it is to be continued . Unlike Mr. O'Conor , I believe that the struggle to get it honestly adininistered is not hopeless . We are not yet reduced to the necessity of choosing between a republic wholly corrupt and a monarchy founded in pure force . Therefore I conclude with Jefferson that , if any man ( General Grant particularly ) " consent to be a candidate for a third election , I trust he will be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views .
