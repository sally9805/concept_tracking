txt Every few years somebody rises up and . insists that ' we must-have a ' new national hymn , and . that a committee should be appointed , with power to send for Poets and verses , and that a contract for the production of the desired hymn should be-awarded bo.the lowest ? bidder ... A large . number of persons have been setting forth this scheme within the last few - menthe , and doubtless others will follow in their useless footsteps while the Republic endures . Of course : it is very true that we have no real national hymn . . We nearly all agree in secret , whatever we may-say in the presence of the foreigner ; that " Yankee Doodle " is a barbarism , more worthy of Australian savages than of enlighted Christians : that " Hail Columbia " is probably the most dreary production of the human mind ? conceding , for the sake of argument , that the human mind - ever had anything to do with the words of that oppressive song ; that - the " Star-Spangled Banner " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is as cheap and tawdry as the verse , and . that " America " should be ignored by all persons who do-not wish to be classed as ' receivers of stolen goOds . These are simple facts which are familiar to everybody , but the periodic assertion of them does .. not help us to obtain ' a new national hymn in. the place of those which now lay claim to a sort of nationality , and it is difficult to see how any committee could ever be able to evolve a truly American national hymn from the chaos of poetic and musical idiocy which it would be their unhappy lot to read and hear . But if we have norcally national hymn , we have succeeded in developing a variety of ballad which.may  --  fairly be called American . The distinguishing feature of the American song is the- . fact that its theme is always death . A statistician has recently ascertained that 91 per cent . of all songs written in the United States are , as he calls them , Mortuary songs . They refer either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cemeteries , tombstones , coffins , and like cheerful matters . The singer in 83 per cent . of American songs always expresses his longing . to .. die and to occupy a coffin , or to become : the rightful owner of a private and personal tombstone . Sometimes he grieves over the loss of some youthful consumptive girl who is represented as having faded away in the early Autumn ; and at other times we are told of whole families  --  sisters , cousins , and aunts ? who have gone ' to the cemetery and unfortunately left the singer behind . The smell of the undertaker 's shop pervades this whole class of songs , and the singer is never satisfied with the effect he has produced unless he has compelled some one to weep . The reason for the lugubrious character of the distinctively American ballad is doubtless the Puritan persuasion that love was essentially immoral , and that no decent person should listen to a love song . Poor benighted Papists , like the Italians , might write profane songs on immoral subjects , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to make acquaintance with the stocks . The Puritan influence was strong enough virtually to stamp out the love song on . this continent ; and as the Americans , like all other people , demanded some little particle of sentiment in. their songs , it came to pass that grief , instead of love , became the pervading sentiment of the American ballad . These churchyard songs are weakening to the eyes , the intellect , and the whole moral nature ; but they are nevertheless the only distinctively American achievement in music . If we want to have a national hymn that will be eminently American , and that never for a moment can be mistaken for a piece of stolen musical goods , - like " America , " we should fill it full of coffins and tombstones . It might begin by calling upon the patriot to weep over the death of WASHxxGroN.and other distinguished men down to . let us say , the death of Gen. GRANT . It would then describe the various national cemeteries wherein lie the Federal and Contederate soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mexican war . The last verse but one might mention in flattering terms the achievements of American inventors in devising " metallic caskets " ' and other funereal paraphernalia . and in the last verse the singer would naturally express his longing to die and recommend all true Americans to die as soon as possible . As for the music , it should , of course , be one long wail ; but , inasmuch as gloom would be the one great and national merit of the song , ' almost any musical fault would be forgiven in its composition provided it were made gloomy enough . Were we to secure such a song as this we should have an AmeriCan national song of which we could honestly maintain that it was purely American . Perhaps , however , it would be better to wait until we have outgrown the fondness for ' graveyard ballads before trying to produce a new national hymn , for , after all , the grave is not the one sole object of American thought and desire , and we de , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have nothing whatever to do with tombstones , although , of course , no one would dream of such a thing after listening to an American ballad .
