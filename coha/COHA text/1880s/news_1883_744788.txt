txt There is no need to say that the acquittal of FRANK JAMES is a miscarriage of justice . The man has been for years a professional criminal , and nobody in Missouri , not even the men who acquitted him , can doubt that he has been guilty of robbery and of murder . The reports have not and could not have been so full as to enable a person at a distance to judge whether the evidence left room for the reasonable doubt of the prisoner 's guilt which the law requires . But it appears , from the account of the closing scenes of the trial , that the evidence had very little to do with , the verdict . The verdict was not a judgment upon the evidence but an expression of " popular sympathy . " And it is confidently predicted that although JAMES is urgently " wanted " for several crimes besides the one of which he has just been acquitted , the feeling of the Missouri public in his favor will prevent the infliction of any punishment upon him for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal more serious than all the crimes of the JAMES brothers . Those might have been committed in any thinly settled country by a gang of bold banditti , and it would be no reproach to the community either that they were committed or that the criminals enjoyed a long immunity . But that , after the criminals have been caught and indicted and arraigned , the prosecution should fail for lack of evidence is a scandal to the administration of justice , while that they should be set at liberty by " popular sympathy " is a scandal to the whole community from which the jurors were drawn and which it is to be presumed that they represented . It Is as unaccountable as it is scandalous . It is inconceivable that in any community , civilized or barbarous , the people who live by plundering the rest should be in the majority , or even in a minority large enough to be considerable . The jury which has acquitted JAMES must be composed of men who get their living by honest industry , and to whom it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be plundered of the fruits of their labor by robbery . And yet they acquitted JAMES . Such an exhibition of the sympathy of the lambs with the wolf was seldom seen before . The " sympathy " with JAMES seems somehow to be connected with an antipathy to the regular course of the law . For JAIIES has not made himself more popular by a career of crime than the Governor of Missouri by procuring his brother , an outlaw of the same stamp , to be shot through the head by another outlaw in an entirely off-hand and informal manner . The same sympathy which led a Missouri jury to acquit FRANK JAMES , when he was brought to a formal trial , would doubtless lead another Missouri jury to acquit any Missourian who should take upon himself the execution of wild justice upon JAMES . Gov . CRITTENDEN , therefore , has another opportunity at once to vindicate law and order and to endear himself anew to his constituents by hiring a mt.n to remove the surviving JAMES . The trouble with this method is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and unpunishable murderer . But this trifling difficulty might be obviated if the FORD boys , who have already imbrued their hands semi-officially in gore , were regularly appointed murderers to his Excellency the Governor of Missouri .
