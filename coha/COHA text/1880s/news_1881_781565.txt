txt The arrangement which has been patched up at Constantinople by no means removes the Greek question from European politics . In the first place , it is not certain that the Greeks will accept it , even as a temporary settlement of their claims , without a good deal of urging and pressure ; the latest dispatches indicate that they will not . They have spent large sums of money in raising and equipping an army . The war spirit runs high among the people . The Tricoupis Ministry was overthrown not long ago because it was not bellicose enough to please the Chambers . The King himself has stood in no little danger of losing his throne on account of the popular dissatisfaction with the modgration of his utterances . At the ordinary pace of European diplomatic negotiations it ought to take until midsummer to persuade the Hellenes that they must accept this half-loaf as better than no bread , and there is always the ' chance that they may conclude to help themselves to what they happen to want , regardless of the counsel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they choose what at this day is doubtless the wiser course and consent to take Thessaly and leave Epirus , the unaccountable Turk would , of course , discover at the last moment that it was wholly out of his power to cede Mussulman territory to an infidel State , and , regretting his inability to restrain the patriotic ardor of his faithful subjects , he would inform the powers that the fulfillment of his agreement in regard to Thessaly was quite out of the question . There would follow an exchange of notes and circulars , the wheezy strains of the European concert would be heard again , and naval demonstrations , conferences , congresses , protocols , and commissions of delimitation would occur and recur until the Sultan and hi ? associate brigands consented to give up Thessaly . So we shall not be deprived of our daily dish of gossip about the Eastern question for months to come . Even supposing ' the Province of Thessaly comfortably set over to the Hellenic nation , there still remain over 4,000,000 Greeks in Thrace , Macedonia , Epirus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less eager than their compatriots in Thessaly to throw off an allegiance they detest and become Greek in name , as in blood . and speech . The contemptible vacillation and fatuity of the powers in their dealings with Greece and Turkey bear fruit in the constant springing up of harassing questions which threaten to bring on a general war . When the boundary line of 1832 was fixed , the short-sighted plenipotentiaries declared that the negotiations in which they had been engaged were terminated " never to be renewed , " and that " the Greek question is irrevocably settled . " It was not in the power of diplomacy in that day , nor is it now able , to settle the Greek question . Ambassadors and plenipotentiaries can no more deal with it than a council of milliners could prevent a thunderstorm . Diplomacy is so much occupied with petty equities and the nice adjustment of the balance of power that it loses sight of the great forces that are at work in the East . Christian Europe has made the most extraordinary efforts to aid and strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connived at or assisted in a policy of strangulation toward Greece . But destiny defies even the great powers . By a process of natural development the lusty and vigorous Greek is displacing the dying Turk. , The trade and commerce , the industry and the moneymaking , of the East are in Hellenic hands . Their right to their ancient possessions in Europe and Asia has not lapsed through Ottoman occupation , and unless Austria or Russia , or all the powers together , unwilling to permit the rising of a powerful State on the ruins of the Turkish Empire , should violently interfere , the Greeks will at no distant day be the rulers of the entire littoral of the AEgean Sea . The retrocession of Thessaly within the limits proposed will give Greece a territory of rather more than 4,000 square miles , including the vast and fertile plain in the basin of the Salembria and its tributaries . The strictly Greek population of Thessaly number nearly 300,000 souls , and the Moslems and Jews about 60,000 : The sentiment of the people is overwhelmingly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sentiment prevails . There are nearly twice as many Greeks in Epirus as in Thessaly , the most trustworthy authorities putting the number at more than half a million , but the Epirotes have imbibed something of the Albanian desire for independence . They would gladly accept cession to Greece as a means of escape from a hateful bondage , but recent travelers represent them as chiefly anxious to establish a free and independent Epirus . This dream can hardly be realized . Epirus can not easily escape her manifest destiny to unite with Greece , and . if the privilege of removal were accorded to her Shkipetar population she , would become a homogeneous part of the reconstructed nation . If the Hellenization of Thessaly is followed by happy local results , the Epirotes will in a few years be found entirely willing to seize any opportunity for a union with Greece . Such opportunities are likely to be created in the natural course of events , not only for Epirus , but for Thrace and Macedonia as well .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
