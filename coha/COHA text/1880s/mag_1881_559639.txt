" Our virtues live in the interpretation of the times . " PARTY names are found the most inapt or deceptive of terms . Sometimes they have in themselves no political meaning , and come into being from the most insignificant of circumstances , or from mere local similitudes . Tory , the name for now 200 years of the great and so-called Conservative party of Great Britain , was borrowed , and applied as an invective , from the name of a set of ruffians in the disturbed districts of Ireland while Whig , for an equal length of time the name of that party in England which professed to defend the rights of the people against the aggressions of the Crown , was appropriated , and applied , also , as an epithet of discredit , from the name of a certain Scotch cheesecurd , or that of Scotch cattle-drivers . Sometimes-as the names in our own politics of Federalist , Republican , and Democratthey , in themselves , import more or less clear and broad ideas of principles and policies , but they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and designs were the reverse of those indicated by the party name . The Democracy of Athens was as intolerant of opposition and of equal rights as any tyrant could be , and the Republic of Rome bore but the faintest resemblance to the republics of the present time . For more than thirty years of its existence , the present Democratic party was persistently devoted to the preservation and propagation of the institution of slavery , and the largest part of its effective strength finally plunged into a rebellion for the same end . Intelligent people , therefore , will place little or no reliance upon the name of a party as indicating what it believes in or what it intends to do . A successful party is not likely immediately to break up its organization ; a defeated one may or may not , according to the // coherence and harmony of the ideas of its members , or to the probabilities of its future success . The Democratic party , so completely defeated at the recent election , ma disband and cease to exist as at present organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have opinions and purposes in common , will , if their views as to measures are opposed to those of the Republicans , naturally recombine under another name , and the self-same rose by any other name " will smell as * as before . Nomenclature with parties , except as a trap to catch the unwary , is of little consequence . The principles of government shared in by a body of people , and a general concurrence in the methods of legislation and administration by which these principles are to be applied to affairs , and the funda. mental and coherent forces that cause political parties , other than associations of mere spoilsmen , to come into being and to endure , are the determinate causes of party existence . Whether it is the cohesive force of a genuine love of liberty and justice protected and administered by law , or " the cohesive power of public plun* it is , in either case , the community of opinion and of design that is the plain bond of party existence . Wherever there is a government in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , political parties must and ought to exist so long as there is any difference of opinion in the state either as to the principles upon which , or the methods by which , the government ought to be carried on . The manifest and just objects of a party in a free state are not only the concentration of the voting force of all who think alike upon a single candidate for office , but essentially the free discussion of the points of difference with its adversaries , in order that conclusions may be fairly formed from a view of both sides , and made effective by the largest possible preponderance of voices in the election . All this is too evident for extended discussion , although recent experience in many parts of the United States seems to show a state of things practically quite different from this theory . It is evident that any party which prevents , or in any manner discourages , the free and peaceful discussion of public questions by its adversaries , or which abets or tolerates any interference with free and lawful voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hostile to free institutions . If such a party happened ( as has generally been the case even in the worst of parties ) to contain some really patriotic // members , they would naturally leave it and unite with their former adversaries to overthrow it ; for , although they might not agree with them in a single point of business polity , yet the preservation of the liberty of discussion and political action being essential to the very existence o* a free government , questions of commerce , or of revenue , or of currency would cease , for the time , to be important compared with the paramount duty of preserving the vital principles of the government , upon which all honest parties must depend . The patriot does not hesitate to reject a tariff or free trade if he is to win it at the expense of stilling a single voice of opposition , or at the price of the false return of a single vote . If he can not have the chief magistrate he prefers , unless the agents or associates of his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or forge and put forth letters and documents which , if true , show the candidate of the other party to be unworthy of public trust , he does not hesitate to adopt the advice of Plato to the members of his republic , to " choose everywhere and at all times the best of what is possible , " and he votes cheerfully with the other party . If , in a less urgent crisis , the honest partisan finds that the ruling majority of the party he has acted with intends to resort to measures he thinks injurious to the industries of his fellowcitizens , or to the commerce or trade of his country , he proves that the best partisan is he who is independent of party coercion , and places the weight of his influence along with those , by whatever name they may be called , whose measures he has found to be in these respects wholesome . In the formation and career of parties , chieftainship exercises a large influence , not only as assisting to form just and prudent policies and measures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities of intelligent citizens to unite in their support , but , independently of such broad considerations , from circumstances of personal station and influence derived either from traditional family power and position , transcendent service to the country in war , and long and faithful service in harmony with the views and efforts of some association of his fellow-men , or from the audacious determination to lead and control , from the single and selfish motive of being at the head and reaping the personal benefits supposed to flow from such a station . The readers of this review , in running over the // field of history , will instantly fill these classifications with the names of many men whose leadership has borne large results of good or ill to their party and their country ,  --  Pitt , and Walpole , and Thurlow ; the Grenvilles ,  --  wlio , it has been said , in every change of parties raised the question , " What course should we take now ? " - Marlborough and Wellington , Gladstone and Disraeliare fair English types of what we are describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Webster , Clay , Calhoun , and Grant are , in our own country , illustrations that will be recognized as just . To mention any now officially connected with our public affairs might seem to be invidious ; and to refer by name to those of our citizens now living who have disgi*aced or overthrown their own party by grasping selfishness or unscrupulous methods , would be unkind . These , we think , are some of the chief elements and characteristics of those party associations and operations which , in a republican government , are a necessity . But it must not be forgotten that this very necessity implies , in exact proportion to the freedom and power of the people , the right of independent personal opinion , and the duty of free personal action in the choice of " the best of what is possible . " The lines of Tennyson have a deeper significance here than with the people to which they were applied : " It is the land that fre6men till , That sober-suited freedom chose ,  - -  The land where , girt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will . " Yet how many men have been deluded by a party name or bullied by their party associates into supporting it , when they did not believe in the measures the party proposed , were ashamed of the methods resorted to for party success , and held the characters of the leaders and managers in abhorrence , and their abilities in the smallest esteem . But leadership and management are nearly as essential to party success as to the success of an army , and the want of good leadership and honest management is often quite as disastrous in the first case as in the last , provided the members of the party are sufficiently informed to know what good leadership is , or sufficiently pure themselves not to be tolerant of dishonest methods in others who manage their canvass . Falling under one or the other of these alternatives , the // events of 1879 in Maine have been supposed to be significant , while the turning of the scale in two or three States , in the recent Presidential election , by the official and persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " alleging it to be gennine , is a striking illustration of the unpleasant fact in politics that temporary success is not difficult to be won upon grounds that are shamelessly false , and that men standing by selection as the heads of a party and the directors of its affairs will persist in circulating a forged paper intrinsically suspicious , after it has been denonnced , in order to gain votes for their candidate , and who , even when the perjury ( suborned by somebody , and paid for out of party funds ) committed to screen the guilty has been confessed , take no steps to aid in pursuing the crime to its fonntain head , and do not even apologize to the voters who have been deceived by their indorsement of the genuineness and their circulation of the forged letter . When the chiefs of a party reach such a position , either their party must itself be profoundly corrupt or be very wickedly represented . In the younger days of the republic , the Democratic society of Philadelphia declared as a fundamental principle of true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the offices of the government , it is essential to the existence of a free republic that every citizen should act according to his own judgment , and , therefore , any attempt to corrupt or delude the people in exercising the rights of suffrage , either by promising the favor of one candidate or traducing the character of another , is an offense equally injurious to moral rectitude and civil liberty . " These golden words are as true in 1880 as they were in 1795 , and , in the light of some phases of modern politics , they warn us of one of the greatest perils to republican institutions . Political parties , like all other associations of men , necessarily take their nature and tone from the average of the characier and intelligence of the persons composing them . In the long run they are not much better and not much worse than their individual members , and so , to be useful to the state , ftieir principles must be , if not perfectly just , at least sincerely and intelligently believed in , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in legislation and administration , fair and honest . The history of parties in the United States for the first forty years under the Constitution , fulfilled in general thes&amp; conditions . The division of the first parties into Federalist and Republican , // arose from necessary and intelligent differences of opinion in respect of the best means of securing the States and the people of the Union against the danger of anarchy from the want of sufficient central power , and from the unrestrained excess of democratic notions in government , which had wrecked earlier republics , on one hand , and from the danger of a relapse into an aristocratical and quasi-kingly rule , such as that from which the people had just liberated themselves , on the other . Both parties were sincere , and their leaders , generally , pure and patriotic , and , to a degree , each was right , for there was danger in both directions . One great social element  --  the institution of slavery-constantly tending , as with the force of gravity , to an aristocracy , existed in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be safely concluded from the ordinance of 1787 , from the provisions of the Constitution , and from the writings of great political leaders like Jefferson , that it was expected that it would not be allowed to spread under national authority , and that it would gradually become extinct . Other tendencies to the consolidation of power in the hands of the few existed , as did also , in the opposite direction , the extreme and fanatical opinions of the old commonwealths men , and the ideas that liberty implied the right to resist all unpleasant laws , as was soon illustrated by the whisky insurrection and other disturbances . We have not space to trace in detail the course of parties through successive administrations down to that of General Jackson , be*nning in 1829 . Names and organizations of parties changed , different administrations succeeded each other , but the course of the government was much the same ; order was maintained , justice fairly adirninistered , revenues collected and accounted for , industry and trade developed , and faithful administrative public officers were not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reason with each change of President . And so strong was the devotion of the people to the Union and the Constitution , that even a suspicion that something hostile to their permanence was contemplated by the convention at Hartford in 1814 , proved destructive to the existence of the Federalist party . With the election and administration of Jackson began the effective existence and domination of the present Democratic party , and of the opposition to it by the Whig party and the Republican party that succeeded it . // The Democratic party ( itself in some sense a coalition ) , by its success in that election , accomplished the theoretic good of breaking down the coalition that elected Mr. Adams in 1825 ; for few things are more degrading and injurious to the public welfare than most coalitions of parties . As they are not usually founded upon any coincidence of principles or policy of government , but merely upon a common desire to defeat a common adversary , they are in their nature corrupting , and their success a question of present spoils , leaving opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaders without having been passed upon at all by the people at the elections . Their utter and almost ludicrous hollowness is well iliustrated by the recent circumstance of a gallant and estimable hard-money Democratic candidate for President feeling compelled to congratulate a gallant and estimable Greenback Republican candidate for governor of a State , upon the triumph of great principles in his election by the aid of Democratic votes ! From 1829 to the rebellion of 1861 , the preponderating influences within the Democratic party were devoted : First , and chiefly , to the protection of the institution of negro slavery , and to its expansion into the Territories and new States , with all its aristocratic consequences of creating a small body of great land-holders , of confining education and political and social power to the hands of a few , who would exert upon the laws and other affairs of the republic the same quantity of power that in the free States was distributed among the whole body of the people . Second-To the propagation and defense of the dogma of socalled free trade , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national conclave of that party , a " tariff for revenue only , ** under which it was supposed that the slave-holding cottongrower could exchange his products for those of the underpaid/ labor of Europe without giving any encouragement to the free labor and free schools of the non-slave-holding States . Third-To the confinement of the national jurisdiction and the national laws withjn the narrowest limits in respect of the election of representatives in Congress , the privileges of citizens of one State domiciled in another , and the improvement of the means of internal communication between the States . Fourth-To the repression of the jurisdiction of national courts , and Fifth-To the propagation of the doctrine that it was the // constitutional right of each State to secede from the Union whenever it should think it best for its interests to do so . The overthrow of the rebellion has removed the first of these objects from the arena of practical politics . Whether the last has received its quietus remains for the future to determine . The party has not in any of its national conventions pronounced against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings of the last and present Congress of the phrase , " war between the * as descriptive of the rebellion , would seem to indicate that the doctrine is not abandoned . In respect of internal improvements , the attitude of the party appears to have undergone a change since the rebellion . The votes of its members in Congress are now almost unanimous in favor of expenditures for such objects , which are " liberal** to the point of recklessness , and are , in many instances , for works that neither party had before supposed to be , in any sense , national in their character . In regard to the other topics referred to , the Democratic party appears to occupy its old ground with a more aggressive tenacity than it had shown in its earlier history . In the domain of jurisprudence , its members in Congress-where the generalities and evasions of the platforms of conventions disappear , and where the real differences between parties are laid bare-have endeavored to cut off or cramp the jurisdiction *f the national courts in cases that concern the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their character as citizens of the United States ,  --  a jurisdiction that the Supreme Court , when Marshall was its chief-justice , held to be clear , wholesome , and necessary ,  - -  and laws some of which in their character are precisely like those recommended and signed by Jackson when he was President , on the occasion of the attempt by South Carolina to nullify and resist the constitutional legislation of Congress . In the field of economic politics , the position of the party , as shown by its platforms of 1876 and 1880 , and in Congress , is still in favor of laying customs duties in such a way as to produce the greatest revenge from a given commodity , without any reference to securing the labor of our citizens against unfair and injurious competition in foreign countries ; and it has , in Congress , given convincing evidence of its opposition to any definitive resumption of specie payments by voting , with a unanimity nearly , if not quite , absolute , against the resumption act of 1875 , and afterward passing , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely are its collective views ( except as to the underweighted and overvalued silver dollar , which it , with the aid of some Republicans , voted to create ) in relation to other aspects of the currency question ,  --  such as the legal-tender quality of paper money in time of peace , the expansion of the paper issues of the government , and the national banking system ,  --  it is not easy to say with certainty . Its platforms are not clear upon these points , although the speeches and votes of its members in Congress have usually been in favor of an expansion of the issues of government paper as " indefinite " as that expansion of territory which some of its great lights used to advocate . It follows from such a policy that the system of national banks must be superseded and abolished , and the whole volume of the currency , and so , in a degree , the relative values of credits , property , and labor , made to depend , from year to year , solely upon the discretion or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of the new constitutional amendments , consequent upon the events of the rebellion , has put the old question between State and national jurisdiction , in certain respects , into an attitude of new prominence and importance , and has drawn into dispute , also , the extent of the power of Congress over the Congressional elections , which the original Constitution , in plain terms , placed under the ' paramount control of the national government . These amendments need not be quoted here . They are familiar to every reader of the REVIEW . The first ( thirteenth ) prohibits slavery . The second ( fourteenth ) declares a national citizenship and prohibits any denial of equal civil rights , etc. ; it is the essence of the Magna Charta of our English ancestors , and in perfect harmony with the spirit of the original Constitution , and secures , under national protection , all the rights upon which civil liberty and free government depend . The third ( fifteenth ) prohibits the denial of the political and conventional right of suffrage on account of race , color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide , in terms , that Congress shall have power to make them practical realities by legislation , just as the Constitutions of the States provide that their legislative power shall make laws to carry their provisions into effect for the security of liberty and good order in society . In these amendments , then , there is , under our system of government , no diminution of true State rights , for they only secure those rights // without which the political unity and welfare of the whole people and of all the States could not exist , and they logically provide that the legislative power of the whole people and of the States collectively may be exerted to enforce them . They are in furtherance of the provision of the Constitution of the fathers , that " the United States shall guarantee to every State a republican form of government . " The provision in the original Constitution in regard to the election of members of the House of Representatives , is as follows " The times and places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives **51;266;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make and alter such regulations , except as to the place of chusing 5enators. ** The doctrine of the Democratic party as to these amendments is that the duties they involve are the duties of the States in their character as such , and that no legislation by Congress operating , like other laws , upon the persons of citizens is " appropriate . " This is shown by the language of the party platform of 1880 , which " accepts " these amendments , but makes no reference to the laws of Congress to carry them into effect ; and by the debates and votes in Congress , where the party has opposed and voted against every feature of legislation to carry them into effect , and has endeavored to procure the repeal of all laws already enacted for that purpose . So , too , in regard to the laws of Congress providing for the registration , scrutiny , and other means of securing fair and peaceful elections of members of the House of Representatives , the same party has opposed them all , and sought their repeal even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing to such repeal at the peril of having no appropriations of money with which to carry on the government , although it is a self-evident proposition that the national House of Repre* sentatives is a body representing the whole people directly , as one people , and that the citizens of every part of the country have a direct interest in the freedom and fairness of the elections for members in every other. * * It is a valuable illustration of the slowness with which great reforms for the protection of liberty come to be truly understood by those whose party education has led them to look in an opposite direction , that an able and representative Democratic writer in the last number of this review still styles these measures " usurpations , " and believes their object and tendency to be the possession of irresponsible power . // In all the respects before mentioned , the present attitude and future policy of the Republican party can be understood from what has been stated of what it has done , and of the position of the Democratic party . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , as it respects the chief of the matters that the founders of the Union truly thought vital , viz. : the election of President and Vice-President , the records of Congress show that the Republican party has voted for laws binding the authority canvassing the votes of electors to recognize and obey the decision of each State in regard to all questions of the choice of its electors , and that the Democratic party has voted against such laws , and endeavored to draw to the two Houses of Congress an unlimited and undefined jurisdiction over the subject . Such , then , is a general sketch of the position of the two great parties of the country at this time . The people and the States in the election just past chose between them . What is their future f It is a grave and misleading mistake to suppose that the present opposition of parties is in any correct sense sectional , although every " Southern** State has , per fas ant per nefas , voted for the Democratic candid ate , and every Northern and Western State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the crime of the forged " Morey letter " ) has voted for the Republican candidate . This division of parties is essentially institutional , and not geographical . Every State in which slavery recently existed has voted for one thing , and every State ( with the exceptions named ) in which slavery has not ( if ever ) existed within more than half a century , has voted for another thing . No one will deny that the same result would have occurred had the people of Louisiana , with her institutions and history , been established on the shores of Massachusetts Bay , and the State of Massachusetts , with the principles and traditions of her people , grown up at the mouth of the great river that waters eighteen degrees of latitude , and bears on its beneficent stream half the commerce of the continent . If geographical divisions were the cause of this so-called sectionalism , all the attacks made upon it would be a warfare upon geography , and might continue forever without effect . The difference is a difference of ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of the respective States , and not at all upon the particular part of the country they happen to occupy . When the ruling classes of the late slaveholding // States come to be imbued with , and put in practice , the principles of the old free States ,  --  as no doubt they will in time ,  - -  there will be no longer any broad sectional divisions in politics . It may be hard for the small portion of the people of the Southern States who have been educated and accustomed to govern , and to regard labor as servile , to find themselves suddenly outnumbered by a mass of political equals who have been hitherto nothing but laborers and chattels , and who , as a whole , are uneducated and inexperienced ; but this is a misfortune inevitable from the defeat of the rebellion , and one that with time and justice will grow into a blessing . It can not be cured , consistently with the idea of a republican government founded on equality of rights , by violent domination , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing elixir will be found in a totally opposite course . Other States feel and bear with patience analagous evil influences arising from the importation into great sea-board cities and the adjoining regions of vast numbers of foreigners who become citizens , and vote without educa* tion and without adequate knowledge of the true nature and operation of our institutions ; but a generation or tWo assimilate these untoward elements into the life , the orderly freedom , and the restraints which regulate the rest of society . The Democratic party , in every effective sense , is , as it was before the rebellion , nothing else than a party founded and existing upon the ideas of a slave-holding system , which has always been , wherever it has existed , a corner-stone of aristocratical governments . The party has survived institutions that have , happily , perished . Its professed , but quite inconsistent , championship of State rights , is based solely upon a resistance to the new amendments of the Constitution being practically enforced by the national authority , because it is known that many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the old free States both their spirit and letter are accepted as easily as is the sunshine and the rain . Of such a party we may repeat the phrase applied to one of the earliest of Democratic parties : " And of all the enemies they had , they themselves were the most fatal . " When the effective , but sometimes slow , influences of time and justice , se%*urity and education , cure the evils that in these States now affect both races in general , and , perhaps , still more severely those patriotic freemen who bore everything for their love of the Union during the rebellion , or those // who , with absolute and affirmative fidelity , accepted all the consequences of its overthrow , and endeavored to defend the political and civil equality of the liberated race , the mainspring of the Democratic party will be broken , and the inhabitants of all the States will be at one in respect of the fundamental principles of the government , and , in general , in respect of the means by which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be no longer any apparent geography in politics . There is no such diversity in geographical or climatic conditions in our vast republic as , with the existence of the railway and the telegraph , can create , save m a very small degree , sectional differences in regard to questions of political economy in legislation , or of policy , foreign or domestic , in administration . The importing and mercantile classes may be in favor of " free trade , " thinking that , as in the case of the abolition of the duty on coffee ,  - -  which was not produced at all in this country , and which abolition brought no benefit to the consumer ,  --  it will increase their profits , while the farmer and the mechanic may favor " protection " ; but , these influences will operate indiscriminately in New England and the Gulf States , in New York and on the Pacific coast . The Greenbacker may pursue his delusion , or his philosopher 's stone , but he and all his fellow-citizens will know that a system of currency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , or the reverse , and that there can be no sectional collision of interests concerning it ; and so of everything about which intelligent equals , having a common interest and a common destiny , may differ . Will the controlling men of the old slave States , who are the backbone of the Democratic party , not see , then , that the victory of the Republicans is not one of passion or animosity , or of a section , but that it is a triumph of the spirit of perfectly free and . equal institutions , such as are established by the Constitution as it now is ; that it means peace and good-will to all and every part of a people who , in this new era , are , through universal education , undisturbed and well-ordered liberty , and free inter-coinmunication and development , to grow more and more homogeneous and prosperous ? If they will see it , they will see that their **giants* strength " should not be exerted in the direction of reaction , or to the retardation of the inevitable consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of this republic , as we may hope , forever . Whatever // may be the future of the present Democratic organization , it may fairly be expected , with the brave , just , and steady adininistration of affairs upon the principles of the Republican party that we have a right to anticipate , that out of the discussions and events that have taken place the minds of many men who have called themselves Democrats have received impressions and formed conclusions touching present parties and their measures , and future , politics , that , like writing in sympathetic ink , will come forth in the warmth of good government to the support of that party which increases the public credit and reduces the public debt , which provides an equable and universal currency of ftxed value , which recognizes and fulfils the duty of so imposing taxes and duties as to develop and encourage the industries of its own people , which practices a wise and rigid economy in all departments , and which endeavors to elevate and promote the character and stability of the civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on the great fundamental work of defending liberty and order , the successful party has striven with some success to accomplish , and to which , beyond doubt , it will continue to devote itself by whatever name it or its adversaries may be called .

All i*hese , interesting and important as they are , must be left to other hands .
