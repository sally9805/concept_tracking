ARTICLE 111. - REFORM. 11. - THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE . THE conduct of public affairs in the United States from ' the death of Lincoln in 1865 , or better perhaps from the snbmission of the last amendment of the Constitntiou for ratification in 1869 , down to the election of Cleveland in 1884 , may be described in two words . It was immoral and unintelligent . Morality in the conduct of public affairs is self abnegation , the administration of a trust exclnsively according to the intention or in the interest of the principal . It is of little avail without an adequate intelligence of the powers delegated and of the uses that may be made of them . Both of these quantities were wanting to the Republican administration after it had accom - plished its original mission of restoring the Union and completing the constituency . It did not understand , and so far as State obligations were concerned , did not really much care what it was doing . This absence of public motive and coherent plan lends a real simplicity to the seeming confusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is an exceedingly complex thing , founded upon the experiences of the race and expressing the highest wisdom and conscience of the most advanced communities . If it be withdrawn from the sphere of public affairs , where like any other late and difficult form of culture , it is not perfectly at home , the original instincts of human nature come into unobstructed play at once , and these are hardly more involved in their action than the appetites of the animal or the forces of inorganic nature . Finding itself in possession of prerogatives and powers which the rightful owner has forgotten about or is unattentive to , the government sets up promptly for itself , as a chemical affinity would do in a new medium , or a continental seedling drifted to a coral-reef , or a savage tribe in a conquered territory . IN othing is more instructive than the occasional eruption of these primitive forces among the institutions and conventions of a culti // vated society . They are really at the bottom of everything and break out anywhere , but when they break out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire people , they take the government back to the prehistorical starting-point of all political evolution . The return to elementary forces and primitive conditions is , of course , a great and perilous retrogression , for a social organism of our time , with all its complexities , is a structural unit " moving all together , if it move at all , " and must suffer in the effort to keep the order it has acquired from lapsing into barbarism along with the organs of its political activity . Bnt , on the other hand , it is sometimes a very salutary thing , that a people prone to over-confidence in the sufficiency and stability of its institutions , to whom its culture has become a second nature , should be rudely reminded that all these beautiful adjustments are the outcome of secular conflicts , the equipoise and not the exhaustion of the crude barbaric energies involved . If the society is vigorous enough to stand the strain while the experiment is going on , it may be worth all the cost to be compelled to take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured by one set of men , and disputed by another , and how out of the first partitions arise necessities for other and larger ones . Only the experiment must go on continuously , and not wind up in a final partition that is a conclusive conquest . So far as considerations of public interests are concerned the conflict may be as immoral and unintelligent as a fight between rival herds for a pasture ground . But it is fatal only if it stops ; when a triumphant coalition ends all differences in a settlement which no one is left to dispute . So we do not need to go to the other hemisphere or to ancient history to learn how governments grow . The whole cycle is given in the last twenty years of Republican rule here at home , when the representatives of the party resolved to hold on to office after they had done their work , for all sorts of patriotic reasons , but at bottom because they found it profitable and pleasant to hold on . They were forced to pay roundly for the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest kind to importunate interests . This was bad , bad in every way ; in morals , because the honor and profit // of administering the people 's trust should be conferred by an honest majority of the people , and not bought of an interested class ; as practical politics , because the ally is sure to sell out to the highest bidder whenever it becomes safe to do so . Nothing , for example , could be more foolish or reprehensible in its way than the purchase of the manufacturing interest by the exorbitant gift of the protective tariff . But then suppose there had been no necessity for making any offer for support , the people inattentive , the opposition impotent , the manufacturers satisfied . This clearly would have been worse still , for it would have left the governing body in exclusive possession ; whereas the partition of profits with the manufacturers was distinctly a process of decentralization and redistribution , the creation of a new monopoly as against the people , but at the expense of what would have iieen a narrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , too , of the far more scandalous transaction with the horde of office-seekers , to which we owe the inestimable boon of the Machine . To buy up a vote , or the control of votes , by giving an office would be the extreme of political immorality and unintelligence , had not the law gone a step farther and made the purchase of votes by money without an office , a penal offence . But here again , imagine a monopoly so secure in its intrenchments , surrounded by a population so unconcerned , that there was no necessity of ceding any part of the possession to save the remainder . This , equally , would mean that the political sense of the community was dead , and its progress towards the recovery of alienated powers ar*rested by the barriers of an immovable usurpation . But as it was , the furious clamor for place was at least better than silence and death . It had this about it , that it was a positive force which must be reckoned with , which kept every issue open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all this expansion and development took place within the Republican party , and found the means of stopping there . The various classes which gave their support to this party , really represented an active opposition , but an opposition with this peculiarity , that it sought to come to terms with the government . The source of their strength throughout the negotiations , lay in the fact that beyond them // waited a more powerful opposition which would uot come to terms . What the manufacturers , the office-seekers , the temperauce reformers , and the rest said , in effect , to the iRepublican leaders was : Give us what we demand , or we will put the Democrats in your places and try our fortune with them . As their help was supposed to be indispensable they got what they demanded . But when all claims had been satisfied , and the last ally had been taken in , when the policy and the composition of the governing body had been completely transformed in the interest of the invaders , the standing menace was as available as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the Democrats had grown more formidable than before . The movement which had begun by.terrorizing the leaders , ended in a triumphant coalition which terrorized the party . Now-the warning was-if we are not left in quiet possession of what we have got , if you take off protective duties and put other men in our places , you will break up the grand old party and bring back the abomination of desolation into the sanctuaries of the State ; the rebels will win at the polls what they lost on the battle-field , they will pay their war debt out of your pockets , re-enslave the negro , and rule you with a rod of iron as they did before the war . Granting the incorrigible perversity of the Democrats this was all obviously true . The fiscal energies upon which the reviviug energies of the country had been made dependent could not be repeated , the elaborate organization which had spread its ligaments everywhere could not be torn away , without dislocations which would have prepared the way for the opposition . So what seemed the safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the development within the party which had gone on continuously while rival interests were in conflict came to its inevitable term when the interests were satisfied ; on the one hand in the perfect unmobility of the governing body , on the other in the entire exclusion of the supporting party . From this time on no serious attempt was made to modify the composition or control the policy of the victorions monopoly . All power of reaction against abuses for which it was directly responsible vanished from the party , and the last humiliation came upon it that if its enerni&amp;s did not save it , it could not be saved . It had // set up the Machine to keep out the Democrats , with the necessary consequence that at last there was nothing left but the Democrats to overthrow the Machine . What qualifications had the Democratic party for the role thus thrust upon it by the very fact that it was the party of the opposition ? According to its adversaries , none at all . The standard Republican criticism was that it had learned nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was as destitute of political sense , as vicious in political temper as at the close of the civil war . But this requires us to suppose that half or nearly half of a great community can be stubbornly insensible and alien to the movement of the other half . Or if it be said , as it is said by philosophers of the calibre of Mr. Evarts , that both parties were what they had been at the close of the war , then we must suppose that the whole community stood still politically for nearly a quarter of a century , with old generations going out and new ones coming in , and in the midst of the most astonishing social development the world has known in modern times . While all these things were happening , the population of the country had been carned from thirty to nearly sixty millions , the area of territory recovered from the wilderness about doubled , and the productive energy of the people far more than doubled by the acquisition of new appliances and a higher organization of all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a revolution in the economic conditions of all civilized societies . That a community can have done all that and done nothing , good or bad , in politics , is incredible . The notorious fact is that this intermingling and codperation of the people in industrial enterprise followed and was founded upon an immense political pacification . The doctrines of the prerogatives and functions of the State brought to the decisive trial of civil war had been triumphantly vindicated by one party and , with whatever variety of sentiment , completely accepted by the other . Neither could any longer be distinguished by them or make any reasonable pretensions to govern in the name of them , because they were the common property of both . The consequence was that having settled everything apparently at issue in the most conclusive fashion , having nothing left to // fight about and a paramount interest elsewhere , the people went into business with one accord and left politics to take care of themselves . This is the real charge against the Democrats , not that they stood still but that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the party organization in both cases , and in one as much as the other , fell into the hands of those who were personally interested in it ; and equally of course , out of the adjustments of conflicting interests there came in time a Democratic Machine , identical in character with the other , permanently separated from the other only by the fact that both wanted the same thing and were prevented by the situation from sharing it between them . If they had been able to come to terms in the midst of a preoccupied and inattentive population , as the administration and the manufacturers or as the office-holders and the office-seekers had done within the Republican party , they might have carried on the arrested movement by forming a new coalition vaster than its predecessors . This is what they actually did-where the situation permitted . In local and limited constituencies like the city of New York , where general public interests were not directly involved and where business preoccupations reached their extreme of intensity , the rival rings dropped their animosities to make sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the same organism . Thus the impending collision was not in any real political sense between Democrats and Republicans , the party in power and the party iwopposition . There was no party in power , and none in opposition with a prospect of power since each had been dispossessed of all control over its own representatives . The sovereign people , divided by antipathies that had no further meaning in them , but united by one of those great agreements which are the epochs of American history , stood aloof , its sovereignty for the occasion reduced to a choice between two hostile systems so indistinguishable in principle , so sympathetic in temper , aims and methods of action , that there seemed to be nothing to choose between them . In fact it can not be said that a distinct choice was made . Mr. Blame was defeated , Mr. Cleveland was elected , but in the midst of a confusion so universal , by hazards so uncontrollable and a majority so slight , // that for a week the result was uncertain and to this day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Independents , who had made alliance with the Democrats , as the temperance men had done with the Republicans , knew perfectly what they were about , that they cast the decisive vote , and settled the character of the incoming administration . But their movement owed its entire effect to a situation over which they had no control , an equilibrium they had weight enough to disturb but had in no sense created . We are here still in the turmoil of immoral and unintelligent forces , and need not stop to inquire whether the organization that came victorious out of the struggle was the more rational affair of the two . The question is whether it did not in fact break up the immobility of the governing body and prepare the way for that final redistribution of prerogative and power in the interest of the whole people which is the goal of all political evolution . In the first place , whatever its intrinsic character , the Democratic Machine had rendered the country the service of delivering the Republican party from long bondage . It was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters by parading the bogie of Democratic rule . That ghost at least was effectually laid , for the worst had happened and the Democrats were there . The place which had been filled by a paralyzing spectre was taken by a reality which however monstrous was obliged to disclose its true character in broad-daylight , among all the tests and difficulties of ordinary human experience. - It could not promptly fulfill the forebodings it had inspired , by destroying the Union or paying the rebel debt or other like enormity ; it could only attempt to do these things , with very inadequate preparations and against all manner of obstacles . Or if , postponing an enterprise of this pith and moment to a more convenient season , it descended to the humbler role of taking things as it found them in order to build up a safe and comfortable monopoly of its own , its portentous prestige collapsed on the spot . Nothing could be more comprehensible , matter-of-fact , and absurd . In any event the Republican party got out of the region of enchantment , where half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of realities . It recovered the use of its facul // ties in presence of an event whose dimensions could be easily measured or calculated , and whose consequences could be controlled by familiar expedients . Moreover , along with the morbid fear of an unimaginable disaster had vanished the trust in the futile expedients of fear . There could no longer be any serious thought of resorting to the machine for salvation for it had been completely discredited . Not only had it lost its hold upon public affairs and gone to pieces within , according to the inexorable laws of all monopoly ; * it had proved itself worthless for that particular purpose for which it had loudly proclaimed itself indispensible . Its abuses had been condoned on the understanding that it was to keep out the dangerous Democrats , and the Democrats were in . If the long subservience of the party to a close corporation , maintained by contrivances of fiscal legislation and by lavish distribution of offices and treasure , had only ended in handing over all these instrumentalities to the enemy , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganization upon other lines and other principles . It is true that at this writing the party has not yet found them , but that is no proof it is not in search of them and on the way to them . Men do not come out of a nightmare into waking without some confusion and bewilderment . There is a pathetic interval of perplexity between the two when they are still inclined to think there are " visions about , " until the world of realities resumes its place and restores their lucidity of mind . So we need not be surprised that the party externally is very nearly where it was and what it was two years ago , the old fabric standing , the old leaders to the fore , the old shibboleths all current . But within there are deep searchings of heart and much unwonted meditation , astonishment , disillusion , the consciousness that a grievous mistake had been made , and all the rest of the inarticulate travail that goes on while men are coming to their senses and their better selves . What forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new organization or the renovation of the old one , is doubtful nor does it in the least matter . What is essential and certain is that the party can not return to its real self without returning to *its real traditions , the great series of State doctrines which it summed up in the // triumphant enactments of the civil war . Nor indeed has it any option in the matter . Tf the exploitation of public power by a coalition of interested classes has ceased to be a practicable policy for the Republican party , the only alternative is administration in the interest of the people . The opposition having thns cleared away , by the very fact of its victory , the obstrnction which had blocked the political development of the conntry , it remains to enquire what intention and means it had of setting up an obstruction of its own . At this point perhaps it would be better to dismiss , as eluding all the methods of practical criticism , the notion that the Democrats fought their way into possession of the State for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any of the purposes of the conquered rebellion . I am arguing the case on the assumption of their incurable perversity , but hardly feel justified in arguing it any farther on the assumption of their impenetrable stupidity . The tender memories of the departed confederacy , which lingers among its old subjects as the fetichism of Congo lingers among the freedmen , are not a force in politics which we can take any precautions against or give any intelligible account of . All we can do with them is to let them die out in their own time , or take their place as a historical curiosity among other monuments of an irrecoverable past . Every people which has done a great deal of fighting in its time has its traditions of the sort and is no worse for them . It may be some of the " rebel brigadiers " came back into office with the slim hope that the State might be hocussed in some way into redeeming the confederate paper , or pensioning the confederate heroes , or compensating the owners for their lost slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or active resistance . They must be left to take their chances with other pensive illusions and use themselves up by rubbing against hard realities . If we look the whole situation over carefully the only intelligible motive , of a bad kind , which we can find for the Democratic hunger of power was its manifest usefulness for Democratic purposes . The Republicans had shown in convincing fashion what can be done with it , if you get hold of it , and know how ; and in this way had done more to reconcile the rebels to the odious Union than all the magnanimity of // their conquerors . So when we say in our large , general way that the Democratic Machine was animated by all the worst sentiments of our fallen nature , we mean specifically that it wanted to get out of the administration of the State all the other Machine had got out of it ; and the one important question is , what was the likelihood of its being able to do so . It held the state by the same title and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the same terms and in the some situation ? The answer to this question depends upon who they were who wanted to share the possession and profit by the conquered power . The new governing body could not possibly confiscate the whole prize to its own uses : it had to submit in its turn to the inevitable necessity of surrendering a part to save the remainder . What was there to give , and to whom was it to be given ? There were , for example , the manufacturers , as resolved as ever to keep foreign products out of the country by legal contrivances . But the purchasing power of the protective tariff had been exhausted already , and the alliance founded upon it worked for all it was worth by the Republicans , it was clear that the precarious victory must be consolidated by transactions in other quarters , long before the Democratic administration could dream of tempting the manufacturers out of their old allegiance . So long as the IRepublican party retained any reasonable prospect of returning to office it would profit by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were other infant industries which had been quite overlooked and had never got any protection at all . If anybody had thought of it something might have been done by contriving a tariff for their benefit . Nobody thought of it because they had not thought of it themselves . They did not ask to have their infirmities sheltered by an artificial market , and were not offering political support on those terms . The fact was , that the whole system of adjusting fiscal laws to the exigencies of particular classes , which had so perfectly served the turn of the Republicans , was worthless for the Democrats . No one expected them , or would give anything for them . This made an immense difference , for it left nothing to drive a bargain with but the government offices and // treasure . The conquered power was of no use to the conquerers in this way , so far as the process of its creation was concerned ; they had to get out of it what they could in the process of its employment . Their alliances must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the incidence of taxation . But here again the Republicans had anticipated them and spoiled the situation . For twenty years the powerful magnet of government patronage had been searching the country through , until it had drawn together all the ambitions and avidities within reach of it , like particles of iron in a heap of sand . It had even sifted out a good deal of loose material from the Democratic party itself , and beyond it had left nothing worth nothing that was not provided for in the great Republican monopoly . To be sure the men who had been convinced of sin and led into the true faith , by gift of a contract or an office might be converted to the opposite side by confirming the gift . But if they could take themselves over from one camp to another they could not take their organization with them , and that was the important thing . It would be long before they could get at ease in their new uniforms and learn the new drill . They were worth exactly the number of votes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn them out and let in the hungry crowd , who had waited so many weary years for their places , and were already well up in the Democratic manual and had made good their claim by faithful service on many a hardfought field . Thus there was no more to be gained by the offices than by the laws . The whole conquered power had lost its efficacy for partizan uses by previous exhaustion of all the partizan methods . Now this might have been reckoned a complete and happy deliverance from troublesome importunities , had it not been for the fact that , meanwhile , a class of another order had been slowly forming , which had no special favors to ask and no classinterests to further , but whose support had come to be absolutely indispensable . It was made up in a large measure of the younger generation of voters , to whom the rebellion was as much matter of ancient history as the Mexican war ; // and it included in its numbers all those whom business preoccupations , or the scandals of political management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no programme , but it wanted good government because the conntry needed it , and specifically a government founded firmly on the great settlements of the past , and the consecrated order of American ideas . In a word , it represented , as a political force , the fundamental unanimity of the people which everywhere underlay the waning antipathies and senseless divisions of party strife . It already held the balance of power , and all effective solutions depended upon the direction it took or the manner in which it divided overcoming issues . We may compare it to the electorate which Mr. Glad . stone added the other day to the British constituency , and which by sheer force of the unknown an incalculable has disconcerted the tactics and broken up the discipline of Liberals and Conservatives alike . The difference in the situation here is mainly a difference of the circumscription of the new issues that are possible . No one can tell what changes may not be wrought in the constitution of British society by the untried voters , or whether their power solicited with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Gladstone , and Chamberlain , and Saulisbury , is not the power of the revolution . Of course the revolution may be coming here too ; so may another revolt of the South , or an insurrection of the freedmen , or a universal strike of labor against capital . But it is certainly not coming from the quarter I have indicated , for there , whether in the indifference to party rivalries or in the sound understanding of common interests , are the sober sense and conservative strength of American society . Its attitude is not ignorance and indecision as to anything essential , but expectancy . It simply waits for an issue worthy of national positions and adequate to national wants ; and meanwhile it is upsetting all calculations by excentricities that to the political veteran must seem the height of caprice and unreason . It was here the Prohibitionists found the material for their party in 1884 ; and here the Independents , had they possessed the faith , the truculent intransigeance and the staying power of the Abolitionist , might have // formed the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter , part of the multitude went with the Republicans , part stood contemptuously aloof , part went with the Democrats . When the smoke and dust of the battle had cleared away it was found that these last had taken the victory with them . What was to be done for them ? They had arrived opportunely , like a troop of guerillas who gallop up at the turning point of a light and strike a blow for the weaker side , half out of chivalrous sentiment , half for the fun of the thing . Their natural reward would have been an invitation to the subsequent banquet and a share in the spoils . But here was where the guerilla character gave out ; they were not hungry and not roving for spoil . As their real interests lay elsewhere it was impossible to detain them for future fights by any prodigality of the usual bribes . The dilemma in which the Republican party had been caught now caught the Democratic Machine . Administration in the interest of special classes had ceased to be practicable politics all round ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the people . Moreover , again as before , this only possible alternative imposed itself as a stringent necessity . In the universal relaxation of party ties and the incessant waste of party material , the inconstant throng of neutrals was waxing more numerous day by day . They expressed the general temper and tendency , and were to be satisfied with nothing less than the terms which sooner or later would be insisted on by the nation . The only chance for any party *Vas in an act of self-renunciation and the frank acceptance of the inevitable programme of the future . There could be no assured tenure of power upon any other condition than the recovery of the government from long abuses to its proper functions as the organ of the State . One can not help wondering what would have followed had the Democratic leaders been blind to the signs of the time and fearlessly set their Machine running in the approved fashion for the Machine purposes . Suppose a fine old Bourbon like Mr. Hendricks had been made President and had gathered around him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lavish use of public power . We should have had simply a four years ' riot with the offices , during which the party would have gone to pieces a great deal faster than it was // built up , and at the end of which the chastened Republicans would have come back mightier than before . Or if the Republicans meanwhile had learned nothing of the sweet uses of adversity , their return to office could only make the demonstration more complete than ever . The longer the absurd dualism of the State continued with its alternating despotisms , the more thorough the exhaustion of the rival systems would be , the more certain and entire the resumption of control by the people which furnishes and owns the power . But the Democrats builded better than this and , since they were so bad , better than they knew . No doubt to conceal more skillfully their secret propensities and intentions , they put at the head of their ticket a gentleman who was at once a Northerner , a war Democrat , and a reformer ; who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken his party seriously as the regular opposition in a representative government , with a paramount mission of putting a stop to the abuses of the party in rule . What was true of General Grant is true of Mr. Cleveland-when he went into office he took the situation with him . Without a distinct mandate from his party , nay , against enormous pressure of the party , he has done what none of his predecessors from Washington down had ever done in equal measure ; he has revived the initiative of the government for the specific purpose of anticipating the march of events and the inevitable agreements of the American people It would be absurd to say that no mistakes have been made , that there have been no half-measures and no untimely conciliations . All this has happened for all this too is part of the situation ; but through it all the great principles at issue have been more distinctly defined , the great interests at stake more clearly vindicated . Mr. Cleveland may go out of public life at the end of his term or die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in the line of presidents , and his administration a turning point in the political history of the United States . I have said in the previous paper that the collapse of the Republican Machine was itself half a reform , and that the other half was sure to come if the body-politic was left with vitality enough for the necessary reactions . There can be no qne*tion as to the vitality ; and as for the reaction it has been the curious fate of the Democratic Machine to prepare the way .
