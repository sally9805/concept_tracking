FOREST preservation , as a national question , must soon occupy public attention . Tlie problem involved is one of grave import , and its solution is not easy and can not be immediate . The part taken by the forest in the economy of nature , and its relations to the wants of man , are complex , and the American people are still ignorant , not only of what a forest is , but of the actual condition of their own forests , and of the dangers which threaten them . The future prosperity and development of the country , however , are so largely dependent upon the preservation of the forest that these lessons will in time be learned , although , judging from the experience of other countries , they will be learned only at the cost of calamities which a better understanding of the subject might perhaps have averted . It will be necessary , in order to more clearly comprehend the importance of the forest question , and the dangers which threaten the American forests , to briefly consider their position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided , in regard to its forest geography , into Atlantic and Pacific regions by the line of the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains . The forests of these two regions differ as widely in character and composition as the climate of Eastern differs from that of Western America . It will be seen , however , that the position and nature of these different forests largely depend upon the amount and distribution of the rain-fall which they enjoy . Since the time of Mahomet , men have been repeating after him " The tree is father to the rain " ; he might , with greater truth , have reversed the aphorism , and declared the rain father to the tree . Forests do not produce rain ; rain produces the forests , and without a certain amount of rain they can not exist at all . The position of the forests and plains of North America can be explained upon no other theory . // The Eastern border of the continent enjoys a copious and well distributed rain-fall ; the forests which covered it in one unbroken sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico were not surpassed in variety , wealth , and beauty by those of any other part of the world . If portions of this forest were destroyed , it reproduced itself with astonishing rapidity ; and the energies of the early settlers were often taxed to the utmost to prevent the forest from taking possession again of land which agriculture had torn from its grasp at the cost of aimost superhuman labor and hardship . The western third of what has been described as the Atlantic region presents climatic conditions widely different from those of the eastern portion ; it consists of the elevated plateau , which falls away from the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains , forming what is known as the Great Plains . Remote from the Atlantic , the Gulf and the Lakes , cut off from the Pacific by innumerable mountain ranges , this great interior region receives a meager and uncertain rain-fall , sufficient to insure , indeed , a growth of herbage , but not sufficient to sustain even the scantiest forest . The transition from the forest-clad eastern portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between the region where the forest holds complete sway over the land , and the region where absence of moisture checks entirely the growth of trees , there is a broad strip of debatable ground , where a struggle between the forest and the plain is continually going on , and where there is just moisture enough to insure , under normal conditions , forestgrowth . So equally balanced is this struggle that any interference on the part of man turns the scale . If he plants trees just beyond the area which the natural forest covers , they thrive , and the plain is pushed back a little . If he destroys the outposts of the forest , it will reclaim them slowly or not at all , and the plain will encroach upon the area formerly forest-covered . The forests of the Atlantic region at the time of the settlement of the country by Europeans were rich and varied . Their main features were a broad belt of spruce and pine spreading south from Labrador over Canada and the whole of Northern New England and New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appalachian Mountain system . The same forest extended north-westward from Hudson 's Bay to within the Arctic circle , reaching the Pacific , greatly reduced in // vigor and density in the valley of the Yukon . It embraced the Great Lakes and extended to the sonth-west nntil checked by the dry plateau drained by the Saskatchewan and the Red River of the North . A second forest of pines extended in a narrow belt , less than two hundred miles in width , along the coast , from the capes of Virginia to the Brazos River in Texas . West of the Mississippi the same forest , increasing greatly in width , spread northward over Arkansas and Sonthern Missouri . The remainder of the Atlantic region from the ocean to the eastern edge of the central , treeless plateau , with here and there an exception where a peculiar geological formation favored the growth of pines , was covered with a dense growth of broadleaved trees , often of enormous size and great value . These different elements , the great pine and sprnce forest of the north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-leaved forests of the Appalachian Mountain slopes and the basin of the Mississippi , formed the Atlantic forest-region . The distribution of the forests of the Pacific region not less clearly illustrates the influence of moisture upon forest-growth . The rain-fall of the north-west coast is very large , exceeding that of any other part of the continent ; it gradually decreases with the latitude , and on the coast at the southern bonndary of the United States is rednced to an average annual precipitation of less than ten inches , not quite one-eighth of that received on the southern coast of Alaska . High monntain ranges , parallel with the coast and extending from Alaska through the peninsnla of Lower California , dissipate much of the moistnre attracted from the Pacific Ocean , leaving the whole of the vast interior region east of these mountain ranges , and lying between them and the eastern edge of the Pacific region , imperfectly supplied with water . It is a region of light , nncertaiu , and nneqnally distributed rain-fall , heavier at the north , as on the coast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole of the Pacific region is composed of the mass of mountain ranges and narrow valleys which form the Cordilleran system . The precipitation of moisture , both snow and rain , is , of course , heavier on the mountains than in the valleys between them , increasing , other things being equal , in proportion to their height . In the case of the region in question , the western slopes of the mountains facing toward the ocean receive a larger precipitation of moisture than their opposite eastern ones . The // forests of this region correspond with its rain-fall . Along the north-west coast there is a strip of forest unequaled in density by any forest outside of the tropics ; but this heavy growth does not extend east of the western slopes of the main coast-ranges . It pushes southward along the California coast , where the redwoods illustrate the maximum of forest productiveness it decreases in density with the latitude on the slopes of the Sierras , disappearing entirely from the California coast-range sonth of Point Conception . Throughout the Pacific region the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forest-clad , at the north the higher ones often heavily ; at the sonth these mountain forests are light , often disappearing entirely from the lower ranges . In South-eastern Arizona , and the adjacent parts of New Mexico , the forests , under the influence of heavier and more regularly distributed rain-fall , are , however , denser than those in the same latitude farther west . Bnt the forests of this whole interior region , north as well as south , are the forests of a dry country . They are nowhere luxuriant as compared with the forests of the Pacific or the Atlantic coast . The trees have grown very slowly , and are often of immense age ; underbrush and seedling trees , which characterize a vigorous forestgrowth , are wanting , except at the extreme north , or in the cafions of some of the highest ranges . Everywhere these forests show that their struggle for existence has been a severe one . They hold the mountains , but they just hold them , and no more . The drier valleys are treeless , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of recent scientific investigations , that even so recently as the time when some of the immediate ancestors of the trees which form these forests were growing , the whole interior region , now believed to be gradually drying np , enjoyed a more abundant rain-fall than it now ; eceives , and that these forests thus originally grew nuder more favorable conditions than at present . If this hypothesis is correct , it will be easy to understand why , under less favorable circumstances , their reproduction will be difficult . The interior forests at the north may be expected , however , thanks to the present rain-fall of that part of the country , to reproduce themselves slowly ; but so slowly must this process go on , that , judging from the age of existing trees , many hundred years will have passed , if these forests are destroyed , before their succes // sors can attain sufficient size to be of economic importance . Through all the southern part of the interior region the stinggle for life has been so severe that the stnnted groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only sncceeded in finding a foot-hold in the high caiTions about the heads of the scanty streams . The age of some of these small trees is immense ; few young trees are growing up to replace those which perish in the course of nature ; and , once destroyed , the reproduction of these forests is so doubtful , or must at least be so slow , that the possibility of it , even , need not be considered in any practical discussion of the question . Unlike the forests of the Atlantic , those of the Pacific region are composed of a few coniferous species generally of wide distribution . Broad-leaved trees are almost entirely wanting in these forests , or , where they occur , are confined to the valleys of the coast , and to the banks of mountain streams . They nowhere form , as in the Atlantic region , an important element in the forest composition , and , economically , are of little importance . The distribution of the forests , then , over the continent , shows that where the rain-fall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is light and unequally distributed the forest is proportionally light ; and that where the annual average rain-fall sinks below a certain amount , about twenty inches , the real forest disappears entirely . It will be necessary , before discussing the future of the American forests , to briefly examine , also , their actual condition and the immediate dangers which threaten them . Fatal inroads have already been made into the great pine forest of the North Atlantic region . Its wealth has been lavished with an unsparing hand ; it has been wantonly and stupidly cut , as if its resources were endless ; what has not been sacrificed to the ax has been allowed to perish by ifre . The pine of New England and New York has already disappeared . Pennsylvania is nearly stripped of her pine , which only a few years ago appeared inexhaustible . The great north-western pine States , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota , can show only a few scattered remnants of the noble forests to which they owe their greatest prosperity , and which not even self-interest has saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests of the Northern States is true of the less valuable and less productive pine forests of Canada . The extent and character of these forests have been the subject of // much exaggeration , and as factors in this country 's pine supply they need not be seriously considered . The spruce forests , both north and south of the boundary , although of late years heavily drawn upon to furnish a substitute for the failing pine , are still extensive , and with proper management should be able to meet for a long time any demands which may be made upon them . The southern pine-belt is found to be more important , both in area and composition , than has generally been supposed . On the Atlantic and eastern Gulf coasts the timber accessible to the streams and to existing railroads has been removed , and much of the remainder has been injured in the manufacture of turpentine . West of the Mississippi River , however , a virgin forest of pine still spreads far and wide . The whole southern pine-belt is greatly injured by the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thus seek to improve the scanty pasturage which these open forests afford during the early season . These fires destroy not only the rich surface humus , but all seedlings and young trees too tender to withstand them . The present condition of the southern pine-belt as a reserve of timber for immediate use is satisfactory , but the future of this great forest is , under existing management , precarious and doubtful . A forest in which a regular succession of young trees is not coming on is always in danger of speedy and entire destruction . A new forest of pine will , thanks to the climate of the Southern States , succeed the present forest ; but the soil , robbed of its fertility by the yearly burnings from which it has long suffered , will not , it is probable , produce again the species to which these forests owe their great importance ; others , of little commercial value , will replace it ,  --  species which are already too frequently springing up on the abandoned lands of the South . Under a sensible management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fire , but all browsing animals for whose benefit such fires are set , and which should restrain within proper limits the turpentine industry , they might supply indefinitely the wants of the world . But such management would require some little sacrifice of present income to future prosperity on the part of the owners of this forest property , which would , perhaps , be too much to expect of them . It will be as difficult to make the South understand that there is a limit to the extent and productiveness of its forests as it would have // been , a few years ago , to make the inhabitants of Maine or Pennsylvania realize that the pine forests of those States were not inexhaustible ; and , like Maine , Pennsylvania , or Michigan , they will not believe that a forest can be destroyed until it is too late . The broad-leaved forests of the Atlantic region , although greatly reduced in extent by the needs of agriculture , and culled , especially at the North , of many of their best trees , still contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnnt is practically exhausted , and other trees , like cherry , hickory , and ash , are no longer abnndant , and have greatly increased in value . The flanks of the southern Appalachian Mountains , and the States immediately west of the Mississippi River are still , however , covered with hardwood forests , unsurpassed in variety and productiveness , and fully able , under proper management , to long supply all demands which are likely to be made upon them . The broadleaved forests , especially of the southern Atlantic region , are injured by animals ranging through them , to the entire destruction of all young seedling trees . Fire is the greatest enemy to the American forest ; next to fire , the browsing animal inflicts upon it the greatest damage ; and the American people , in generally using their wood-land for pasturage , have adopted the surest method to compass the final destruction of their forests . The heavy forests of the Pacific region are still almost intact ; other forests of this region , less productive , although from their position perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests of fir of the north-west coast hardiy show the marks of thirty years of cutting and annually increasing fires . In this humid climate , young trees of the same valuable species spring up so quickly on land stripped of its original forest-covering , and these new forests grow with such remarkable rapidity , that there is little danger of their final extinction . Any attempt to estimate even the productive capacity of this belt of forest is vain , although it is safe to assume that it contains the largest and most valuable body of coniferous timber remaining in any part of the world . The noble forests of pine and fir which grace the western slope of the California Sierras are still , so far as their mature trees are concerned , largely intact , although the increase in the number of forest-fires in this region is alarming . The Sierra forests , thanks to their usually inaccessible position , have so far , for the most part , escaped the organized // attacks of the lumberman . Serious , and often fatal injury has been inflicted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven up by thousands to pasture in the *cool , moist subalpine meadows of these high mountains . The sheep , enforced by great bands of horses , cattle , and goats , clean everything before them ; nothing but the large trees and the most stubborn and thorny chapparal escape their voracity . Every young tree , every bud , and every blade of herbage , is devoured ; everything green is destroyed ; and the sheep tread out from the dry , gravelly hill-sides the roots of all young and delicate plants . The Sierra forest is , over most of its extent , a forest largely composed of full-grown trees , containing but few young seedlings , and little undergrowth to shelter and protect them ; its condition , then , is critical , and unless measures can be taken for effectually limiting the range of browsing animals , its total extinction must be merely a question of time . The belt of red-wood forest along the California coast has already suffered severely at the hands of the lumberman , and many of its finest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this valuable timber is still standing-less , however , than has generally been supposed ; and at the present rate of cousmuption the commercial importance of this forest will have disappeared at the end of a few years more . It will , however , owing to the large annual precipitation of moisture received by this portion of the California coast , and the unusual vitality of the red-wood tree itself , spread again through the cafions of the coast range ; but centuries must elapse before such new forests can rival in productiveness or extent those which California is now so rapidly dissipating . The forests of the northern interior region are still comparatively intact ; few demands upon them have yet been made , although extensive and destructive forest-fires sweep bare every year great areas along the mountaiu sides . The northern forests are largely composed of the valuable species of the north-west coast , and , with proper protection , will long supply with fuel and building material the agricultural population now rapidly pushing into this part of the United States . The great pine forest which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Arizona , nearly along the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude across the New Mexico boundary , has , up to the present time , escaped serious injury . Less valuable in its composition than the forests // of Montana and Idaho , and yielding timber of comparatively inferior quality , this broad belt of pine is-owing to its isolated . position between wide stretches of desert-of prime importance to the future development of this region . The remaining forests of the interior region , including those of the high Colorado Mountains , are largely wasted ; the mining industry has already made serious drains upon them , and fires are licking them np in every direction . It is hardly possible to realize the damage which has been inflicted upon these forests during the past twenty years ; they are scarcely reproducing themselves anywhere ; and in a few years , unless the present rate of destruction can be reduced , they will have entirely disappeared . The forests of the United States , taken as a whole , are still capable of yielding annually a large amount of material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The white-pine forests , it is true , are nearly exhausted , but with this exception none of the great sources of the country 's supply are yet in immediate danger of extermination , although the California red-wood can not long withstand the increased demand which a scarcity of white pine will entail upon it . The effect of local exhaustion is , however , already felt in many parts of the country , and the constantly increasing distance between the forest and the great centers of distribution is advancing the price of all lumber to the consumer ; the days , however , when the United States will experience a real timber-famine are not yet very near , and we can still boast , although in somewhat less exalted terms than formerly , of the forest-covering so generously spread out for us . The proper relations of the Government , both general and State , to the forest have of late somewhat occupied the public mind . The discussions which this subject has given rise to have , it is true , been generally vague and unsatisfactory ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be overlooked . The first point clearly to be settled in such a discussion is whether the Government call properly interfere at all in the management of the forest , and whether the laws of trade may not safely be trusted to.regulate , in the long run , the extent and nature of the forest-covering of the country in the same manner that they may be trusted to regulate the volume and character of other crops . If the area of productive forest could be extended as quickly and with as much certainty , in response to the demands of // larger consumption , as the area of other crops can be extended , or if the forest had no other function to perform than to supply the world with lumber , the laws which regulate the supply of any commodity , by the demand for it , might well be left to work out the future of our forests . But a forest crop , unlike other crops , is slow to mature ; its area can not be extended or reduced from year to year in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period which must elapse between the first growth of a forest and its maturity increases enormously the risks to which all crops are subjected . A forest fire may destroy in a single day the growth of five hundred years , and what another five hundred years can hardly replace ; the forest is subject , too , to dangers which do not affect other crops of quick maturity ; it can not always be extended at will , or extended or renewed at all except within certain limits . The laws , then , which in the long run regulate the supply of wheat or corn can hardly be depended upon to deal exclusively with the future of the forest , even if its only office was to furnish lumber . The forest plays another and more important part in the economy of nature . It is now well understood that the influ-. ence of the forest upon rain-fall is not great . The removal of a forest from any region will not diminish the amount of rain falling upon it ; nor can the increase of forest area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gradual drying up of countries once fertile within the history of the human race , but now barren and almost uninhabitable , must be traced to gradual geological changes , of course entirely beyond the reach of human control , and not to the mere destruction of the forest . It will be well to bear these facts in mind ; the popular belief that forests affect the rain-fall has too long con*. fused the discussion of the forest question and carried it far beyond its legitimate limits . But if the forest does not cause rain to fall , it husbands it after it has fallen . It serves , to borrow an expression of the gardener , as a mulch on the earth 's surface . It prevents the water which has fallen from flowing away too rapidly over the surface of the ground ; it protects springs ; it delays the melting of snow ; it checks evaporation and equalizes temperature ; it breaks the force of destructive winds ; it holds the soil on the sides of steep mountain declivi. ties and prevents it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regions from which the forest covering // has been removed is irregular and uncertain . Heavy rains flowing over the frozen surface of the ground , freed from the natural barrier which the trnnks and roots of trees offer to rapid snperflcial flow , or snow , deprived of the shelter of the forest and melting suddenly , reach the stream so rapidly that it is unable to carry off the unusual volume of water : the banks are overflowed and finally destroyed , and destrucfive floods ensue . If the river flows from a high mountain range the dangers attending the removal of the forest from about its sources are greatly increased ; and the rapid melting of the great body of snow which accumulates at high elevations during the winter months is followed by more disastrous results . Torrents are formed which every year increase in force and extent ; first the soil and then the rocks themselves are torn from the steep mountain sides and hurled into the valley below . The damage done , the stream ,  --  which during a few weeks had poured down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  its natural reservoirs quickly exhausted , dwindles into a slender brooklet or dries up entirely . This has been the history of many European streams heading in the Alps and other mountain ranges of Southern Europe , and this must always be the history of every stream flowing from a high mountain range on which the forests which regulate and protect its flow are incautiously disturbed . Southern Europe has thus lost many of her fairest and richest provinces ; and , judged by the dangers which have followed its removal under such circumstances , it is perhaps not too much to say that the highest claim for care and protection which the forest can make upon man lies in this power which it possesses to regulate and protect the flow of rivers . It is not , then , merely as a collection of trees to be cut down and sawed into lumber that the forest must be regarded ; although in its purely economic aspect the American forest is well worth the greatest care and protection . It now yields every year not far from four hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives employment directly and indirectly to nearly a million pairs of hands , and its manmum productive capacity is not yet nearly reached . But the great value of the forest , in which lies its real claim to public consideration , is not its capacity of production , however great they may be , but its power to protect the surface of the ground from degradation , // regniate the flow of rivers , modify temperature , and preserve the rain which falls upon the earth . If the necessity and propriety of government aid in the preservation of the forest can be shown , in what manner can it best be executed ? So far as concerns the Atlantic region , the time has passed for government action . The Government domain in Eastern America has either passed , or is passing so rapidly into private hands , that the Government has practically no forest left , in the Atlantic region , to protect . It should not be asked to plant trees on the public domain beyond the belt where trees grow naturally ; for trees can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the proposition occasionally advanced that , following the example of some European governments , the nation should buy up waste land in the older States for the purpose of planting trees , can never be seriously entertained . And , even if the Government could properly interfere in the working of the Atlantic forest , there would be little real necessity for its doing so . That part of this region which was originally wooded can always be recovered with forest without great difficulty ; and that part which was naturally destitute of forest will remain so , until some gradual change in the surface of the earth shall have increased the rain-fall over the central plateau of the continent . So far , then , as the General Government is concerned , the extent and character of the Atlantic forest may be safely regulated by individual effort . If it can be shown that private capital invested in forest property can secure profitable returns , capital will find no difficulty in raising forests in any of the Eastern or Central States and capital thus employed , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward in proportion to the intelligence with which it is applied to such new enterprises . But the forest , as has already been shown , runs risks which do not affect other crops ; it may therefore , perhaps , with proprietyreceive special care at the hands of State Governments . Fire threatens the forest at every stage of its existence , and a ifre may often inflict as much damage upon a fully mature forest ready for the ax as upon one just emerging from the seed ; and , as long as such fires are allowed to spread unchecked , there can be no security in forest property , and capital will avoid such investment . Stringent State laws , which shall make punishable all persons starting forest fires , and hold them responsible for the losses occa // 398 sioned by such fires , must be passed by every State ; and public opinion must make the execution of such laws possible , before forests can be generally looked upon as possible investments . Until this is accomplished , there can be no security in holding forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness or wanton mischief , and it would not be difficult , in a community roused to the importance of preserving the forest , to fix the responsibility of their origin . In the northern pine forests-where the damage caused by fires has far exceeded in immediate loss that experienced by any other part of the country-they are started , not in the dense , uncut forest , but in the rear of the logging operations , where masses of tops and branches have been left strewn over the ground among the small and hall-grown trees unfit for market , but which , if protected from fire , might soon yield another crop of logs . Such debris becomes dry as tinder by midsummer , and furnishes the best conceivable material to feed the flames of a great fire . Such fires destroy , not only all trees which the ax has spared , but so change the nature of the soil itself that it will not yield another crop of pine until the growth and decay of generations of other plants have gradually restored its fertility- As the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State laws should be passed compelling the logger , under the penalty of fine , or even imprisonment , to carefully collect and burn during the winter in which the trees are cut every part of them not carried away . That such a law could be enforced , and that its enforcement would be followed by beneficial results , can not be doubted . It would slightly increase the cost of manufacturing pine lumber to carry out the provisions of such a law , and its enforcement would entail some little expense upon the State ; but if this legislation could prevent one such fire as recently drew upon Michigan the attention and sympathy of the civilized world , the money which it would cost to enforce it were wisely spent . Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota are in immediate need of such laws , if they hope to continue much longer the production of pine , because in these States , more than in any other part of the Atlantic region at least , a reckless disregard for the future of the forest prevails- a recklessness born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Additional and better State laws are needed in many States // to regulate the ranging of cattle and other browsing animals in the forest . The right of every man to use his wood-lands as pasture can not be denied ; it is equally evident that a man may be properly restrained from allowing his animals to range through his neighbor 's woods . Free ranging of browsing animals through the forest is the relic of a barbarous and unprofitable agriculture ; and animals might with equal propriety be allowed to graze at will in the midst of other agricultural crops . The passage of fencing laws in States like Missouri and South Carolina , which had long suffered from the free range of cattle , has been followed by the most marked and gratifying improvement of the forests , and the example should be promptly followed by every State where such laws do not already exist . Apart from the benefit which the forest would derive from such legislation , its passage , in doing away with the necessity of fencing cattle out of cultivated land , would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heaviest item in the cost of producing our crops . Forest protection for the Atlantic region , then , should be sought from the State , and not from the General Government ; in the Pacific region different conditions in the forest necessitate different action . The General Government still controls immense areas of forest stretching over the mountain ranges of the Pacific region , and here , if anywhere , the experiment of government protection of the forest can be tried . On the coast , the climatic conditions will always insure forest growth , and if the Government undertakes to preserve any portion of the coast forest it should do so only because it will seem a profitable business transaction to withdraw from immediate sale land which promises soon , with a larger demand for timber , to increase enormously in value ; but it is in the interior region that the Government can perhaps enter with more propriety upon forest preservation , as the forests of the interior can not long survive the wasteful and short-sighted methods of individual management . These interior forests either do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do not , when once removed , grow at all again . They are capable , however , if properly protected , of supplying for a long time the wants of a considerable population ; they protect the flow of streams on which the agriculture of a large part of this region must depend ; they guard the great California valley against the // dangers of mountain torrents ; and their total destruction can be predicted with much confidence unless active protective measures can be adopted to save them . Under the peculiar conditions of the distribution and growth of these interior forests , the practicability , then , of preserving certain portions of them as Government forest reserves , is worthy of the most careful consideration and study . It would seem perfectly practicable to withdraw entirely from entry or sale for such purpose , for the present at least , certain forest lands still belonging to the nation in Montana , Idaho , Colorado , Arizona , and California . It is , of course , impossible here to indicate exactly where such reserves should be made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should , however , of course be selected with regard to the protection of important streams and the preservation of a supply of lumber , where probable future population will most require it . Such forest reserves , if sensibly managed , would , at the north at least , continue to produce lumber indefinitely ; and , entirely apart from the influence they would exert upon the general prosperity of the region , could be made self-supporting . The Government has , however , already ceded to different railroad corporations alternate sections of much of the territory in question , and as such forest reserves must , to be successful , extend uninterruptedly over large areas , such a plan as is suggested could only be developed to its greatest possibilities through some arrangement between the Government and the railroads for joint forest preservation . What benefits the community benefits , in the long run , the railroads also ; and those which cross the continent , or penetrate into the wilds of the Pacific region , might wisely join in any scheme for the protection of these forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , the law known as the Timber Culture Act should no longer be allowed to disgrace the statute book ; originally intended to encourage the growth of forests in the treeless parts of the country , it has - failed entirely in accomplishing what it was honestly expected to accomplish . It has given rise to gigantic frauds , and has already cost the Government several million acres of land which have passed into private hands without any return whatever . Apart from its worthlessness as a means of securing the growth of forests , this law is deceptive , and therefore dangerous . It encourages the planting of trees where trees can not grow unless // artificially irrigated , and thus entails losses upon honest settlers , deceived in the belief that the Government would not encourage impracticable and useless planting . Looking , then , over the whole field , it is seen that the forests of the country , with a single important exceptiou , are still capable of large production . It is evident , however , tliat grave fears should be felt for their future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central States legislation is required to protect the forest from fire and indiscriminate pasturage , and that in the interior Pacific region experiments in forest protection could , perhaps , be wisely undertaken , unless this region is to be entirely stripped of its forests . All protective legislation , however , will fail to accomplish the results expected from it , uuless backed by popular belief in the vahe of the forest . Such belief will come only with a better understanding of the importance of the subject ; and the American people must learn several economic lessons before the future of theii ' forests can be considered secure . They must learn that a forest , whatever its extent and resources , can be exhausted in a surprisingly short space of time through total disregard in its treatment , of the simplest laws of nature ; that browsing animals and fires render the reproduction of the forest impossible ; that the forest is essential to the protection of rivers ; that it does not influence rain.fall , and that it is useless to plant trees beyond the region where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been learned , forest protection in the United States will be possible and can be made effectuaL Cw4iu**s S.
