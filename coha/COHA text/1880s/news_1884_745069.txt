txt After the death of John Wilson , an aged miser of Walden , this county , last October , a will was found by which he bequeathed his wealth , between al , 000 and $40,000 , to a young woman named Minnie Oldham . Subsequently another will , leaving the greater portion of his riches to a sister , the whereabouts of whom no one knew , was discovered , and also one in which an eccentric character named Howard Kidd was made a legatee . Other wills bequeathing money to different parties came to light . The result was that the courts were requested to unravel the complicated state of affairs which these different documents gave rise to . In all the proceedings before the Surrogate which have been held from time to time , no representatives of the miser 's sister were present . nor was she heard from in any way . The decision of the Surrogate was ' tieing awaited by the parties to the suit , when a few days since a man , representing himself as a son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her heirs to the money , she having died in a Western State , leaving five children , none of whom had heard of the death of their uncle until a week or so ago . The new-comer in the case presented to the Surrogate the alleged proof of his identity , and his authority to represent his relatives in the matter , and employed a lawyer to look after his and their interests . The papers and claims of the stranger are being investigated by the Surrogate , and if they are found to be satisfactory the case will be reopened . John Wilson lived for 50 years in Walden , and acquired his fortune by the most miserly habits . He was a stone-mason by trade , and for 40 years ' workea at his occupation without the loss of an hour 's time . He sponged for his living wherever he could , frequently compelling his mother , who supported herself by domestic drudgery , to contribute to his wants out of her hard-earned pittance . Ten years ago he took up his abode in the garret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a hermit until the house was torn down , when he was forced to buy a miserable ' house in an out-of-the-way Place , where he lived until he was found dead one morning in the midst of his filth and wretchedness . During all the time that he lived in the barely habitable garret of the old stone house , and the miserable but afterward , only one person was permitted to cross his threshold without permission , and he held voluntary communication with but one other . A tax collector named Bradly forced an entrance into the garret once , and succeeded in collecting the first tax that the miser had paid in over 15 years . The welcome visitor to the garret was Minnie Oldham , the I7-yearold daughter of a poor laboring man . She he had known from a baby , and was a favorite of his . She visited him daily , showing him many kindnesses , and attending to the only household work he would allow done in his wretched quarter . The other friend was Howard Kidd , an eccentric character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the garret , but never allowed him to enter . Wilson 's mother toiled for her subsistence until she was 80 years of age . At fourscore , worn out by hard work and years , the old woman applied to her son for support during her few remaining years . She had a great horror of the poor-house , and her son was aware of it . He told her that he would see that she was taken care of . He purchased her a new pair of shoes , and then walked her 20 miles to the county almshouse . Taking the shoes from her he left her at the poor-house and went away without a word . She survived the disgrace she had long fought against but a few days , and was buried a pauper . Wilson was a typical miser in appearance , tall and gaunt , and clothed in garments that he had swim for years . It is said that he had not permitted a comb , razor , or pair of shears to touch his hair or beard for a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government bonds .
