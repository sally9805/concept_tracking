THE SALOON IN POLITICS . THE various temperance organizations of the country have been endeavoring for some time to secure the appointment , by Congress , of a commission to inquire into and report upon the effects of the liquor traffic . During the last session , a bill providing for such a commission passed the Senate ; that being the sixth time the upper chamber had testified its willingness to make the investigation . The annual report of the National Temperance Society relates succinctly the further fortune of the measure : " In the House of Representatives the Senate bill has been reported adversely , with a minority report in its favor , by the Select Committee on the Alcoholic Liquor-Traffic . It is not probable that the bill will pass the present House . " When it is remembered that the public conscience is at present manifesting unprecedented sensitiveness on the temperance question , and that the gravity and extent of the drink-evil are recognized more generally to-day than ever before , the apparent apathy of the popular branch of the national legislature is the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for would , if appointed , effect little . But the mischief done by drink is so palpable , the waste of capital upon it is so enormous , its action as a generator of crime is so direct and patent* its agency as an obstacle to progress and a check to civilization is so positive and undeniable , that it does not seem easy for an ostensibly representative body to make any valid defense of its refusal to inquire formally into a subject of such importance and scope . But it is not Congress alone that in this matter appears to be in opposition to a strong and constantly growing popular sentiment . In two States , New York and New Jersey , the legislatures have recently refused to give the people the opportunity to vote upon the temperance question . In neither of these cases have the politicians who took this course any explanation to offer which can be regarded as justifying their action . How is it , then , that while , in the absence of absorbing political issues , this great question is attracting more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old parties seem to close their ears , shut their eyes , and turn their backs with increasing obstinacy to all demands and solicitations on behalf of temperance ? The answer to this question is not hard to find . It is that party politics in the United States to-day are controlled by the saloon , and that when action against the drink-evil is proposed politicians revolt as from a parricidal proposition . For many years the political corruption of American cities has been a source of perplexity to reformers . All kinds of schemes for amending and purifying municipal government have been devised , but none of them have proved successful . Changes of party control have simply substituted hungry spoilsmen for gorged ones . There have been now and then flashes of improvement , but they have passed quickly , and the old knavery , plunder , and bad government have returned . In vain have Citizens ' parties , Independent parties , all manner of new experiments , been tried . Against every effort at reform the discipline and power of the saloon have prevailed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolished party politics in our largest cities . To-day , in every such city , the local government is vested in neither party , but is in the hands of the saloon itself . Nominally , the government may be Democratic or Republican . Actually , it is in commission by // a hand of venal politicians , who have no convictions or principles , who trade and " swap " opportunities for plunder with one another , who act as agents for the so-called party leaders , but who acknowledge allegiance only to the saloon . A government " of the people , by the people , and for the people " is the ideal of democracy ; hut the American people assuredly do not enjoy it at present , whatever they may do in the future . The delusion that the suffrage as now exercised enables any citizen to express his own opinions is perhaps less widely diffused than formerly , but even yet it interferes with a just comprehension of the hold the saloon has obtained upon our politics . In order to make the situation intelligible a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers 135,000 saloons in the country . These places and the 8000 wholesale liquor stores together absorb every year a revenue estimated at from seven to nine hundred million dollars . It is in the cities that the saloon is most powerful . Now , the ten largest cities in the Union - namely , New York , Philadelphia , Brooklyn , Chicago , Boston , St. Louis , Baltimore , Cincinnati , San Francisco , and New Orleans - contain nearly one tenth of the entire population of the country , while fifty other cities , of 30,000 and over , contain another tenth ; so that sixty cities comprise one fifth of the whole population . It is in these cities that the saloon is most strongly intrenched , and it is here that it exercises that mastery in politics which renders it so formidable and so mischievous . What have the seven thousand saloons of New York city done for her ? They have fastened upon her citizens the most shamefully corrupt government ever endured by a community indulging in the illusion that it was free ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to touch local politics , much less take office ; they have degraded the conduct of public affairs to their own low level ; they have brutalized every institution they have had to do with ; they have perverted and spoiled the democratic system , making a hissing and a reproach of American citizenship and the suffrage , establishing political shambles , pandering to the worst vices of the worst classes , defiling everything decent and pure with their ribald scoffing , and producing at intervals , as proof of their quality , tendencies , and power , such abominable scandals as that of the Tweed Ring , or the more recent sale of votes in the board of aldermen . But evil as are the results of the combination between the saloon and the politicians , it is not just to hold the latter responsible for all the mischief they cause . In truth , they are the result of conditions which could not produce anything better , and it is unreasonable to blame the product while refusing to interfere with the generating agencies . The saloon is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which humanity is afflicted ; a vice which destroys every elevating influence , kills shame , manhood , ambition , family affection , honor , all that makes life worth living ; a vice which fosters brutality , self-indulgence , and all the train of ignoble and degrading passions and inclinations . Now , the purpose and intent of the saloon being what it is , the developments noted are simply what ought to have been expected when so large a share in the government of the country was permitted to be seized by this sinister agency . The American system of government is theoretically sound . The means of education are accessible to all . But when our children have passed through the public schools and enter into active life , if they wish to take part in public affairs they must descend to the saloon for instruction in politics , and in the same institution the foreign immigrants must graduate before they can exercise the right of cit // izenship . These are our political schools , in fact , and they give the tone to our politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for office finds it indispensable to " make himself solid with " the rum power . He must buy the favor of the saloon-keepers . He must frequent these places and flatter the vanity of those who gather there . Through them he must obtain the votes of the idle , the vicious , the criminal , classes . He must become familiar with all the ward " strikers " and loafers . He must be represented at the caucuses which are always held where drink abounds . He must defer to the views of men of the lowest intelligence . He must subscribe to platforms drawn up by demagogues and time-servers . Is it any wonder that self-respecting men so often shrink from these ordeals , and prefer the obscurity of private life to a political career demanding such sacrifice and such debasement ? The foreigner who lands in this country obtains his first ideas of its governmental system from the saloon . There he is introduced to the lowest intrigues of factional conflict . There he is taught that the chief end and aim of politics is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There he is enlisted into one or the other of the great organizations which have reduced party politics to periodical battles for plunder , to contests for the opportunity to misgovern . There he learns that honor and principle are simply " molasses to catch flies , " as a notorious politician once expressed it . There he is made to understand that he is not expected to think for himself , but that he must obey implicitly the party mandates , reverence the saloon-keepers of his ward , submit himself humbly to his " boss , " and on election day be thankful that he can sell his vote for a couple of dollars or a debauch on bad whiskey . This is no fanciful picture . There is not a considerable city in the United States in which purchased votes are not cast by the thou-September , sand at every important election , and these votes are almost invariably bought and paid for in and through the saloon . it is absurd to expect that under such a state of things politics can be anything but corrupt . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon , for enlightened patriotism , progressive policies , or any real care for the welfare of the nation . The country is now in a defenseless condition . All the riches of its sea-board cities lie at the mercy of any fifth-rate power with which we may happen to quarrel . Yet it has been impossible to rouse Congress to action . While throwing itself with feverish zeal into struggles over place and patronage , while exhibiting demagogic eagerness in squandering the public funds upon unnecessary local works , it has shown itself indifferent to this vital question ; has betrayed a want of public spirit which would be remarkable and perplexing , were it not apparent that members have been desirous only of enacting measures redounding to their personal or party advantage . A Congress which refuses to investigate the liquor traffic , and will not authorize the necessary appropriations for the defense of the coasts against foreign enemies , is in one sense a pattern legislature . It is a pattern , that is to say , of the best that can be expected from the saloon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum power . It can not be relied upon to defend the country against invasion from without or corruption from within . But nothing is to be gained by putting all the weight of responsibility upon the congressmen . It can not be too strongly insisted upon that they are what the political system makes them . If the people want a Congress of patriotic , upright , independent , able men , they must provide other machinery for electing them . At present , they are for the most part representatives less of the public than of the saloon , and it would be carping criticism to say that they are The Saloon in Politics . // not worthy of their origin . In the rural districts and in a few Western States , it is still possible for a candidate to be chosen on his merits , without selfhumiliation . But in the cities those who seek office can scarcely avoid demagogism and venality , for they can only run subject to the indorsement of the rum power . As regards municipal offices , the record is so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of political judgment cultivated by the saloon has been exhibited lately in a startling way . What it produces can not be better described than in the words of reni*yson : - " Men loud against all forms of power , Unfurnish 'd brows , tempestuous tongues , Expecting all things in an hour , Brass mouths and iron lungs I However wild and foolish and impolitic the demands of saloon-made socialism may be , nevertheless , he who seeks public office where it is influential must avow his belief in its wisdom and justice , and declare his readiness to further its aims . So it is that fuddled anarchism finds a hearing , and that the subversive doctrines which have been filtered through the beer-keg and the whiskey-bottle are sometimes paraded solemnly as the expression of American public opinion . Yet it will not avail us to rail at the work of the saloon . If we choose to establish competitive examinations in politics on the principle of the Dutch auction , gil.ing the highest marks to those who show the least merit , rewarding demagogism and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public service such as will not stoop to baseness or corruption for their own advancement , we have no right to complain of the results of the methods we have adopted . Nor can we with reason find fault because , after subjecting our least advanced classes to the degrading and brutalizing influences of the saloon , they learn their lessons more thoroughly than we expected , and threaten the country with the danger of a venal proletariat . We are reaping as we have sown . We have chosen to ignore the growth of this evil . We have shut our eyes obstinately to the real cause of the political corruption scourging us . We have allowed partisanship to blind us to the inevitable consequences of alliance or even compromise with the rum power . We have valued votes only , caring nothing how they were obtained . We have let things drift until the influence of the saloon in politics has become almost paramount . Many men of sound capacity have wondered why the idea of woman suffrage has not made more progress in this country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " practical politics , " and a variety of minor objections have been raised , as that women " know nothing of public questions , " that " they are wanting in judgment , " and so forth . When the fearful mess that men have made of politics is impartially considered , it can scarcely be maintained soberly that women , however inexperienced , could do much worse . It is , indeed , hardly possible to conceive of worse being done by any kind of creatures . But there are obviously some things now done by men which women could be trusted not to do . For example , we may be quite sure that they would not squander five hundred million dollars a year in strong drink , and then coolly ignore this extravagance , and threaten to revolutionize the country on the ground that they were not receiving their fair share of the wealth they produced . They would not , we may be confident , strike for eight hours a day while permitting their husbands to work sixteen . They would not , at the wTeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saloon , and then beat their hungry and naked children instead of feeding and clothing them . But when one thinks of the suffering and misery which the saloon inflicts upon woman , // the opposition it exhibits to woman suffrage is perfectly intelligible . There is nothing so cruel , nothing so brutal , nothing so uncivilized , in American politics to-day , as the dominance of the spirit which refuses a voice in the government to that sex upon whose virtues , piety , and long-suffering every worthy hope of the nation depends . But the difficulties of refusing this measure of justice , this logical and inevitable extension of the democratic principle , become greater with every tentative effort in the direction of a ; broader suffrage . The proposition can no longer be rejected on the ground that it is untried . It has been tried , and wherever it has had a fair trial it has produced satisfactory results . Naturally , woman suffrage is hostile to the saloon , whether in or out of politics . It is to woman the serpent of Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman stands for all the elevating influences in this stage of existence . The home , the family , the church , the school , all derive from her their best qualities , their highest capabilities . The saloon stands for all that is retrogressive , destructive , debasing , vile , and evil . It ruins the home , breaks up the family , undermines religion , nullifies educational agencies , checks intellectual and moral growth , fosters brutality , coarseness , immorality , and dishonesty . Yet man , enlightened and civilized as he thinks himself , can not be persuaded to trust his helpmate with even a share of the government whose present abuses weigh so heavily upon her ; can not believe that the judgment and clear-sightedness which , if he is candid and prudent , he is glad to avail himself of in private life would produce as beneficent results when applied to the general concerns . In this perversity the average man takes a course eminently calculated to maintain the supremacy of the saloon in politics . He shuts himself out from the only zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one ally who is pledged , by nature as by condition , to eternal war upon the rum power . It is scarcely necessary to point out that , if women could vote , the saloon as an active force in politics would speedily disappear . Therefore , we may be certain that so long as the saloon holds the reins of power it will oppose all its energies to the extension of the suffrage . This is not , however , an additional argument against the saloon . It is simply one of the conditions of its existence . Having been permitted to attain its present strength , having been recognized as a perfectly legitimate institution , it has a right to fight for its life , and it would certainly do so , whether or not such a right could be demonstrated . The point to be emphasized is that the American people are themselves mainly account* able , and that , while they may take action to remove what has become a gigantic abuse , they are not justified in denouncing those who have profited by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scarcely tacit popular approval . Fairness to the beneficiaries of an evil agency , however , must not interfere with the thorough exposure of the evil itself . We may be - nay , are - all more or less responsible for its continuance . It is a national sin , to be nationally put away and repented of , or to he persisted in at the general peril . But that it is a great and even growing evil there can be no doubt . The corruption of American municipal government is not a diminishing quantity ; on the contrary , close observers of politics must perceive that there is a tendency to the development of " rings " much earlier in the growth of towns than formerly . Once , the curse of local misgovernment fell usually upon the largest cities alone . Now , every town of twenty thousand inhabitants is exposed to the same danger , and not many escape plunder permanent ly . This is not mysterious or wonderful . The tendencies of the saloon in // politics are the same in the village as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities . The saloon everywhere generates the same class of politicians , with the same low standard of action , the same greed , the same cynicism , the same atrophy of public spirit . Jn these days , moreover , the saloon is better organized than ever before . It has its state and national " protective " associations , formidable by reason of their funds and deriving fresh confidence from their union . The prohibition movement has driven the rum power into a more solid and compact organization than it previously occupied , and has caused it to enter politics with more pronounced and ( lefinite aims . Formerly , it may be said to have been content to exercise a general patronage over the worst vices of the community , and to diffuse them as much as possible . Now , it goes farther , and requires that every political candidate shall pledge himself in distinct terms not to favor any temperance legislation , or take his chance of escaping the " knife " of the rum power . The prohibitionists , in fact , while making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have also caused the saloon to reveal something like its full strength , and a very formidable and menacing array it makes when thus brought to bay . The stubborn and persistent opposition of professional politicians to civil service reform has usually been ascribed to other causes , but reflection will show that the saloon influence is the fons et origo mali . Here as elsewhere the theory of governmental administration taught in the saloon is based upon the grossest form of selfishness . The public is regarded from that point of view as a mere aggregation of tax-producing dullards , to be fleeced on every possible occasion by the smart " men who adopt politics as a business . The chief object of politics , in the eyes of the saloon , is to furnish the cover for schemes of plunder . Office is regarded as a means of robbing the treasury , on the one hand , and , on the other , of recompensing partisan service and cementing the organization . This is " the cohesive power of public plunder , " a thoroughly saloon conception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor less than the adoption of common sense business principles in public affairs , must , in the nature of things , be violently resisted by saloon politicians . For whereas it demands efficiency in the public service and the entire removal of opportunities for dishonesty , the saloon in politics can not exist without the constant help of these abuses . All the incompetent loafers who hang about the cross-road taverns , corner groceries , and rum shops of the land ; all the blatant demagogues who make their living by manipulating these loafers in politics ; all the people who keep saloons and all those who furnish them with their stock in trade , are necessarily loud against this reform . To substitute tests of competence , proofs of efficiency , experience of faithful work , for the arbitrary rewards of ward strikers and local " bosses ; " to put the public service upon the rational footing of private business , whence already so large a class of lazy adventurers has been excluded by its vices and its habits ; to put an ei*d to the halcyon state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most intrepid liars , the most brazen hypocrites , the most corrupt knaves , and the most unprincipled demagogues ; to close the avenues to office with an impassable barrier of examinations ; to make fitness the gauge instead of the doing of dirty work , is to carry despair , rage , and disgust to the hearts of all these supporters and beneficiaries of the spoils system . What the spoils system has done to demoralize party politics was strikingly shown the other ( lay , when a distinguished Democratic member of Congress deliberately stultified both himself and // his party by a proposition to emasculate the civil service law , and when other members of the House rose in their places and coolly denounced one of the most obviously righteous and necessary measures on the statute books . If such politicians can not perceive the implications of their position on this question ; if they do not realize that they are declaring themselves in league with public plunderers and corruptionists , and consequently in opposition to the plainest interests of the American people , the fact is attributable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed saloon ethics . When , too , we find public journals speaking contemptuously of the principles of civil service reform , - that is to say , of honesty , efficiency , and trustworthiness , - and sneering at all who uphold those principles as " dudes " or " doctrinaires , " we must credit the saloon in politics with these proofs of moral blindness and perversity , and must remember that it is to pander to this influence that men of education so debase themselves . But the politicians and the papers which oppose the proper performance of the public business , and clamor for the restoration of the old corrupt conditions , are not primarily responsible . It is the people themselves who have indorsed all the evils which they now suffeifrom , and who have suffered abuses to strike root so deeply that their extirpation becomes increasingly difficult . When the politics of the country embraced great and stirring issues , public attention was too much absorbed to take note of the progress being made beneath the surface by the evil elements . Loyalty to party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of this encouraged hypocrisy and demagogism . While weighty questions were before the people , really strong and public-spirited men held their place at the front , and controlled party politics in the main . As the grave questions of the day were one after another determined , and as the two parties ceased to be sharply divided , the worst elements in both acquired greater influence , and especially the influence of the saloon increased . In effect , the character of party politics has been deteriorating for several years , but it is only recently that this has become apparent to any considerable portion of the voters . Habit is a strong tie in all things . In settled times men come to hold their political opinions far more as matter of custom than of conviction . That they should do this in politics is not remarkable , seeing that the same practice is often followed in regard to religion . The tendency to take the line of least resistance is very strong in the average man , and it is one reason why all established abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that the public morals are really debauched , so much as that the public conscience is asleep . Moreover , it must be admitted that the mendacity and slander of factional journalism throw such an atmosphere of doubt over nearly all charges of political corruption that plain men are furnished a plausible excuse for discrediting such evidence when presented to them . So habit intrenches saloon politics , while social custom obscures the worst features of the evil . But the saloon is always active , whether the people sleep or wake , and its work is never of a doubtful character . During the late labor disturbances , for example , it was observed that an element among the workingmen seemed to manifest a marked and growing disregard for property rights . It was not exactly the kind of hatred for private property affected by the socialists and anarchists . It was really one of the effects of saloon politics upon unenlightened minds . rrllere is no phase of life with which workingmen become so soon familiar as that of party politics as conducted in our cities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first thing they realize // is that here is a distinct class , which subsists b4y an organized system of plunder . Of course there is no pretense of concealment when saloon politicians are in their congenial haunts . Newspapers may speak delicately of such things , as a concession to their partisan relations , but the masses do not try to humbug one another . They know what " bosses " are , and how they become rich , and how they keep up their power , and whose money they distrihute , and to what extent the public have to provide them with funds . They see that saloon politics is at bottom an organized method of robbery . they see that it succeeds ; that the boldest thieves get the largest prizes ; that , as a rule , the more they steal , the more they may steal ; that their shameful prosperity entails neither ostracism nor general condemnation ; that , in short , robhery of the public is regarded as venial among a class so numerous that their own lax opinion becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmen , perceiving all this , should fail to draw distinctions between public and private property , and , when heated by disputes with their employers should sometimes apply , in a new and alarming way , the doctrine they have picked up in the slaoons ? In the cities , indeed , labor has had plenty of practical instruction in public plunder , as witness the scores of public buildings and works all over the country , which have been made excuses for perennial appropriations , expended , as every one knows , in keeping up party strength by furnishing subsistence to men who neither do nor are expected to do the work for which they are paid , and often paid above the market rate . rrhe growth of a venal proletariat has proceeded so far that the problem of municipal government is almost given up in despair . Local politics has been reduced to a science of obtaining votes under false pretenses , when they can not be bought outright . It is a structure in which hypocrisy rests on corruption . There is the sounding declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to exercise his free choice ; there is the list of candidates selected by the " machine ; " and there is the solid body of disciplined followers who obey orders without caring two straws about any moral issue involved in their action . Intelligent citizens of course revolt against this condition of things , but when all parties are the same at bottom there is no room for choice , and the machinery is controlled too firmly by the saloon element to permit much hope of reform . Indeed , the state of the cities would before now have become the state of the whole country , but for the fact that the rural vote has hitherto escaped the blighting influence referred to . It is in the rural districts that the integrity of the suffrage is alone maintained . Prejudice , ignorance , blind partisanship , no doubt interfere often with its most effective exercise even there , but the vote of the country districts is to a great extent untrammeled , and it counteracts the vicious tendencies of the urban suffrage on important occasions . No permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and purity of the country vote , for the population of the cities is in creasing much more rapidly than that of the rural districts , and as it increases it tends to fall more and more under the influence of the saloon in politics . In fact , the danger of a merely ignorant vote may be regarded to-day as less menacing than that of a vote which is organized for sinister purposes , and handIed with military precision ; nor , so long as the saloon is permitted to fulfill its normal functions , can there be any reasonable expectation of a change for the better . For this institution has a double hold upon its votaries . It controls them by ministering to an appetite which , when developed , is perhaps the // most masterful of all the vices man is subject to . It debauches the intellects of its followers , and it fosters their egotism on the lowest plane . The man whose fondness for drink leads him to neglect wife and children is already well on his way to the mental condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man whose introduction to politics consists in making the acquaintance of the gaudily attired rowdies who swagger about the bars of political " headquarter " saloons will soon learn to look with admiration upon the methods which produce those flowers of civilization . The nature of whosoever frequents these places is " subdued to what it works in , like the dyer 's hand . " The saloon , too , can emulate the public schools in producing after its kind . Its fecundity is prodigious , and where it flourishes most rankly all the higher forms of life tend to perish . To think of political reform with the influence of the saloon in politics what it is seems almost fatuous . To discuss the subject of political reform without taking this weighty factor into consideration seems almost puerile . To belittle the importance of the saloon is most dangerous . To essay compromise with it is a fatal mistake . In the nature of the case it must be eliminated , or it must dominate everything . Full freedom having been accorded it thus far , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who clearly recognize the perils of the situation , it has become an axiomatic statement that it is useless to oppose the saloon in the cities . If that were true , the prospect would be dark . It is , in fact , an undemonstrated assertion , and really signifies no more than a conviction that such an undertaking must be attended with great difficulties . But we can not afford to make so disastrous an admission , for the future of the country depends largely upon the possibility of abolishing this gigantic evil . All the causes of uneasiness which have appeared of late are , directly or indirectly , subsidiary to this . 1f it does not produce every one of them , it certainly aggravates them all . By debauching politics , by setting and maintaining a low moral standard , by teaching tol .. eration for corruption , by excluding the fittest from politics , by making careers for demagogues and trimmers , by hon .. oring baseness and incompetence , by scoffing at integrity and efficiency , by substituting the bad for the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread demoralization everywhere , and infected all the movements of the day with its own vileness and foulness . What is called " practical politics " is really the application to party of the saloon code of ethics . It is practical politics to disregard all moral considerations ; to traffic and dicker and covenant with all the corrupt elements for the sake of votes ; to exchange , if the occasion seems to demand it , the security of a whole community for enough votes to elect a ticket ; to wink at the most flagitious schemes of robbery , provided their promoters can and will help elect the party candidates ; to break every pledge given to the people in the party platform , if it is necessary to do so in order to secure the adhesion of some influential gang of manipulators . The cheerful theory of the practical politician is that human nature is totally depraved , anyhow , and that it is all nonsense to act upon any other belief ; that , having to do with this omnipresent depravity , it is necessary to humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the party ; and that while ethical considerations may be very well in church , they have no place whatever in the management of public affairs . This kind of politician plumes himself on his entire freedom from narrowness and his adaptability to emergencies of all kinds . He has no embarrassing scruples . He regards the " offices , " with all that the // term implies , as the be-all and the endall of party warfare . In a word , he is a perfect illustration of the ripest results of the saloon in politics . The country has become so habituated to this state of affairs that many very good people really find it impossible to conceive of any other way of doing things . We are all so accustomed to take it for granted that the " political pool " must he " filthy " that we seldom think of reflecting whether a clean pool might not be substituted . If we assume that the saloon is ineradicable , then , indeed , it will have to be admitted that no cleansing process is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthiness to the pool . But is it ineradicable ? That is a question than which none more important can he taken into consideration by the American people . The results of experiments in thinly settled districts or small towns can not afford trustworthy indications for the populations of large cities . But there is iu the results of these experiments one circumstance which seems to give some promise . The staple argument that men can not be made sober by legislation appears to have been to a great extent refuted by the actual facts . It is now pretty clearly demonstrated that the removal of temptation to drink does promote sobriety . There is nothing new in this . Shakespeare long ago observed , - " How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds Makes ill deeds done . " Weak human nature , assailed by strong appetite and cozened by opportunity , falls easily , first into indulgence , then into excess . Nor does the fact that many men will seek the means of intoxication when it is denied them outweigh the former consideration , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily to obtain liquor is undoubtedly much greater than that of those who persist in seeking it . The common argument is probably not altogether sincere , and it is certainly not very formidable . No doubt the drink - habit has been firmly rooted in a large class , but , equally without doubt , quite as large a class has , within fifty years , emancipated itself more or less completely from that habit , and this without the assistance which removal of opportunity constitutes . To this it may he said that the spread of knowledge and the growth of refinement so changed custom that relative abstinence became easy and natural ; but that the same reforming processes would not apply if an attempt to abolish the saloon in large cities were made . The inference from this line of argument would be that the only hope lay in the gradual growth of education and culture among the masses . But the situation is difficult . The saloon is intrenched to-day . It has become an institution . It is an organized , disciplined force . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in state politics ; and it openly declares its intention to exert itself in national politics . Being so formidable at present , the country may well inquire what this element will be in another half century , if left to develop and extend itself freely . In this paper the effects of the saloon upon society have been only touched incidentally , but in any review of the general prospect they would have to be considered carefully and fully . Side by side with its political growth l ) roceed the growths of crime , pauperism , disease , which it fosters . It is obvious that it also constantly produces elements which are incapable of existence in a more wholesome environment , and which , while from their nature dangerous to society , are for the same reason devoted to the agency whence they issue . In a democracy , moreover , the control of the political machinery of both parties in the centres of population is always liable to lead to the control of politics in the country . Should circumstances once // throw such a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be supposed that it would neglect the opportunity to reinforce itself still more strongly , nor is the suggested danger by any means chimerical . What the saloon is and does in American politics has been partially shown here . rUhe first necessity is to awaken public sentiment on the question , and the best way to do that seems to be by telling the truth plainly and unequivocally . One of the most insidious vices of the times is the disposition to compromise . The present stage of social evolution has produced , while softening the hearts and polishing the manners of the educated classes , a reluctance to say and do positive things which is a real and dangerous weakness . It shows itself in forms which sometimes strike foreigners with surprise . When Mr. Herbert Spencer visited this country he observed the meekness with which we put up with the abuse of crowding the cars on all the transportation lines , and he pointed out the mischievous tendencies of this popular complacency and supineness . The habit of avoiding friction , of submitting to inconvenience , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or complain , or invite notoriety , is one which will have to be shaken off , or it will lead to serious practical evils . In fact , it has led to them already , and one of them is the estab- ' lishment of the saloon in politics upon a basis of assumed dignity and respectability . Now , the saloon is utterly base and vile in all its relations and connections , and it is necessary that this should be said , and said plainly . Its influence in politics is altogether depraving and mischievous . It can only paralyze or destroy public spirit , and substitute the worst kind of demagogism . It can only give a preposterously disproportionate weight in public affairs to the elements which should , because of their unfitness , be the least in evidence . It can only discourage and exclude from public life the worthiest and most capable citizens . It can only encourage and thrust to the front the most impudent and incapable . Every vicious and debasing theory , every corrupt " spoils " doctrine , every line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of them which is an insult and a wrong to the religion , the virtue , the womanhood , of the nation , may be traced to the saloon . The placid toleration of so rank and gross an evil is a shame to us as a people . The pretense that we can live in peace and harmony and fellowship with it is a reproach to the general intelligence . This is the question of the immediate future . It will not down at the behests of politicians . It will not cease to disturb the national conscience until remedial action is determined upon .
