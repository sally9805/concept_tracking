After extended search the goods could not be found and the vessel was seized by the Spanish authorities , who held her until a fine of $4.000 was paid , although the value of the goods in question did not exceed $20 . The master and crew were forced to suffer many indignities at the hands of the Governor of the island ' Imo officials acting under his authority . The authorities offered to settle the matter if the Captain of the vessel could satisfactorily explain the whereabouts of the missing packages . After the fine had been paid it was ascertained that the missing goods were delivered by mistake on board the ship Josephus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were placed on the Josefa 's manifest . Explanation was made to the Spanish authorities and the return of the fine was requested . but was refused , and the vessel loft Porto Rico to load cargo elsewhere for this city . James Brett of New-York , managing owner of the Josefa. has filed a complaint against the Snanish Government with Secretary Bayard , and asked that his immediate attention shall be given to the matter . It will be urged that the war ships Galena and Yantio shall be ordered to continue their cruise to Porto Rico and summarily secure redress for the imposition suffered by the Josefa . James E. Brett is a commission merchant with an office at 43 South-street . He said yesterday that the statements Contained in the Philadelphia dispatch were true , with one or two exceptions . Ho did not know anything about the proposition that the Galena and Yautic proceed to Porto Rico and secure redress .

Me. , and myself . I suppose the story was told in Philadelphia by him . I think it was one of the worst outrages committed by a foreign Government . It has been an international question since October , 1887 , about which time the affidavits of the Captain . mate , and crew , certified to by the Spanish Consul here , were transmitted to Secretary Bayard . He presented the claim to the Spanish Government , but what has become of it I do n't know . I have n't had a word from the department yet . If we are not advised before the next Administration goes into power one of our representatives will be asked to pay some attention to it and try and have the next Secretary push the claim against Spain . " The vessel was short only 20 packages of cornstarch , worth probably $50 . The first demand made upon us was for $8,000 , but this was afterward reduced to a fine of $200 for each package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish law . Wo protested and got the American Consul to intercede , but we were finally forced to nay the exorbitant fine in gold . We have never been able to trace the missing cornstarch , but the theory is that it was by mistake shipped to San Francisco in the Josephine . "
