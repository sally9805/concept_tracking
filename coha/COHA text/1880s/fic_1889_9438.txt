Scene  --  Partly in Nordhausen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5th , 6th , 1349 . ACT I.  --  In Nordhausen . SCENE I. A street in the Judengasse , outside the Synagogue . During this Scene Jews and Jewesses , singly and in groups , with prayer-books in their hands , pass across the stage , and go into the Synagogue . Among them , enter Baruch and Naphtali . NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . Hast seen him yet ? BARUCH . BARUCH . Nay ; Rabbi Jacob 's door Swung to behind him , just as I puffed up O'erblown with haste . See how our years weigh , cousin . Who 'd judge me with this paunch a temperate man , A man of modest means , a man withal Scarce overpast his prime ? Well , God be praised , If age bring no worse burden ! Who is this stranger ? Simon the Leech tells me he claims to bear Some special message from the Lord  --  no doubt To-morrow , fresh from rest , he ' ll publish it Within the Synagogue . NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . To-morrow , man ? He will not hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARUCH . BARUCH . Rather let ' s wait , And scrutinize him as he mounts the street . Since you denote him so remarkable , You ' ve whetted my desire . NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . A blind , old man , Mayhap is all you ' ll find him  --  spent with travel , His raiment fouled with dust , his sandaled feet Road-bruised by stone and bramble . But his face !  --  Majestic with long fall of cloud-white beard , And hoary wreath of hair  --  oh , it is one Already kissed by angels . BARUCH . BARUCH . Look , there limps Little Manasseh , bloated as his purse , And wrinkled as a frost-pinched fruit . I hear His last loan to the Syndic will result In quadrupling his wealth . Good Lord ! what luck Blesses some folk , while good men stint and sweat And scrape , to merely fill the household larder . What said you of this pilgrim , Naphtali ? These inequalities of fortune rub My sense of justice so against the grain , I lose my very name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . He comes from Chinon , France . Rabbi Cresselin he calls himself  --  alone Save for his daughter who has led him hither . A beautiful , pale girl with round black eyes . BARUCH . BARUCH . Bring they fresh tidings of the pestilence ? NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . I know not  --  but I learn from other source It has burst forth at Erfurt . BARUCH . BARUCH . God have mercy ! Have many of our tribe been stricken ? NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . No . They cleanse their homes and keep their bodies sweet , Nor cease from prayer  --  and so does Jacob 's God Protect His chosen , still . Yet even His favor Our enemies would twist into a curse . Beholding the destroying angel smite The foul idolater and leave unscathed The gates of Israel  --  the old cry they raise  --  We have begotten the Black Death  --  we poison The well-springs of the towns . BARUCH . BARUCH . God pity us ! But truly are we blessed in Nordhausen . Such terrors seem remote as Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harry Such creditors as we . See , here comes one , The greatest and most liberal of them all  --  Ssskind von Orb . Ssskind von Orb , Liebhaid , and Reuben enter , all pass across the stage , and disappear within the Synagogue . I 'd barter my whole fortune , And yours to boot , that ' s thrice the bulk of mine , For half the bonds he holds in Frederick 's name . The richest merchant in Thuringia , he  --  The poise of his head would tell it , knew we not . How has his daughter leaped to womanhood ! I mind when she came toddling by his hand , But yesterday  --  a flax-haired child  --  to-day Her brow is level with his pompous chin . NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . How fair she is ! Her hair has kept its gold Untarnished still . I trace not either parent In her face , clean cut as a gem . BARUCH . BARUCH . Her mother Was far-off kin to me , and I might pass , I 'm told , unguessed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scornful face . It lures high game to Nordhausen . NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . Baruch , I marvel at your prompt credulity . The Prince of Meissen and Liebhaid von Orb ! A jest for gossips and  --  Look , look , he comes ! BARUCH . BARUCH . Who ' s that , the Prince ? NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . Nay , dullard , the old man , The Rabbi of Chinon . Ah ! his stout staff , And that brave creature 's strong young hand suffice Scarcely to keep erect his tottering frame . Emaciate-lipped , with cavernous black eyes Whose inward visions do eclipse the day , Seems he not one re-risen from the grave To yield the secret ? Enter Rabbi Jacob , and Rabbi Chresselin led by Claire . They walk across the stage , and disappear in the Synagogue . BARUCH BARUCH ( exaltedly ) . Blessed art thou , O Lord , King of the Universe , who teachest wisdom To those who fear thee ! Footnote 1 : 1Kb NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . Haste we in . The star Of Sabbath dawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the strange gaze of those wide-rolling orbs . Didst note , man , how they fixed me ? His lean cheeks , As wan as wax , were bloodless ; how his arms Stretched far beyond the flowing sleeve and showed Gaunt , palsied wrists , and hands blue-tipped with death ! Well , I have seen a sage of Israel . They enter the Synagogue . Scene closes . SCENE II . The Synagogue crowded with worshippers . Among the women in the Gallery are discovered Liebhaid von Orb and Claire Cresselin . Below , among the men , Ssskind von Orb and Reuben . At the Reader 's Desk , Rabbi Jacob . Fronting the audience under the Ark of the Covenant , stands a high desk , behind which is seen the white head of an old man bowed in prayer . Baruch and Naphtali enter and take their seats . BARUCH . BARUCH . Think you he speaks before the service ? NAPHTALI . NAPHTALI . Yea . Lo , phantom-like the towering patriarch ! Rabbi Cresselin slowly rises beneath the Ark . RABBI CRESSELIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abiding ' mid strange peoples ! Ye shall be Cut off from that land where ye made your home . I , Cresselin of Chinon , have traveled far , Thence where my fathers dwelt , to warn my race , For whom the fire and stake have been prepared . Our brethren of Verdun , all over France , Are burned alive beneath the Goyim 's torch . What terrors have I witnessed , ere my sight Was mercifully quenched ! In Gascony , In Savoy , Piedmont , round the garden shores Of tranquil Leman , down the beautiful Rhine , At Lindau , Costnitz , Schaffhausen , St. Gallen , Everywhere torture , smoking Synagogues , Carnage , and burning flesh . The lights shine out Of Jewish virtue , Jewish truth , to star The sanguine field with an immortal blazon . The venerable Mar-Isaac in Cologne , Sat in his house at prayer , nor lifted lid From off the sacred text , while all around The fanatics ran riot ; him they seized , Haled through the streets , with prod of stick and spike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragged him with gibes into their Church , and held A Crucifix before him . " Know thy Lord ! " He spat thereon ; he was pulled limb from limb . I saw  --  God , that I might forget !  --  a man Leap in the Loire , with his fair , stalwart son , A-bloom with youth , and midst the stream unsheathe A poniard , sheathing it in his boy 's heart , While he pronounced the blessing for the dead . " Amen ! " the lad responded as he sank , And the white water darkened as with wine . I saw  --  but no ! You are glutted , and my tongue , Blistered , refuseth to narrate more woe . I have known much sorrow . When it pleased the Lord To afflict us with the horde of Pastoureaux , The rabble of armed herdsmen , peasants , slaves , Men-beasts of burden  --  coarse as the earth they tilled , Who like an inundation deluged France To drown our race  --  my heart held firm , my faith Shook not upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the big black cloud dissolve . Then followed with their scythes , spades , clubs , and banners Flaunting the Cross , the hosts of Armleder , From whose fierce wounds we scarce are healed to-day . Yet do I say the cup of bitterness That Israel has drained is but a draught Of cordial , to the cup that is prepared . The Black Death and the Brothers of the Cross , These are our foes  --  and these are everywhere . I who am blind see ruin in their wake ; Ye who have eyes and limbs , arise and flee ! To-morrow the Flagellants will be here . God 's angel visited my sleep and spake : " Thy Jewish kin in the Thuringian town Of Nordhausen shall be swept off from earth , Their elders and their babes  --  consumed with fire . Go , summon Israel to flight  --  take this As sign that I , who call thee , am the Lord , Thine eyes shalt be struck blind till thou hast spoken . " Then darkness fell upon my mortal sense , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And I have journeyed hither with my child O'er mount and river , till I have announced The message of the Everlasting God . Sensation in the Synagogue . RABBI JACOB . RABBI JACOB . Father , have mercy ! when wilt thou have done With rod and scourge ? Beneath thy children 's feet Earth splits , fire springs . No rest , no rest ! no rest , A VOICE . A VOICE . Look to the women ! Mariamne swoons ! ANOTHER VOICE . ANOTHER VOICE . Woe unto us who sinned ! ANOTHER VOICE . ANOTHER VOICE . We ' re all dead men . Fly , fly ere dawn as our forefathers fled From out the land of Egypt . BARUCH . BARUCH . Are ye mad ? Shall we desert snug homes ? forego the sum Scraped through laborious years to smooth life 's slope , And die like dogs unkenneled and untombed , At bidding of a sorrow-crazed old man ? A VOICE . A VOICE . He flouts the Lord 's anointed ! Cast him forth ! SSSKIND VON ORB . SSSKIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever served Israel with purse , arm , brain , or heart  --  now hear me ! May God instruct my speech ! This wise old man , Whose brow flames with the majesty of truth , May be part-blinded through excess of light , As one who eyes too long the naked sun , Setting in rayless glory , turns and finds Outlines confused , familiar colors changed , All objects branded with one blood-bright spot . Nor chafe at Baruch 's homely sense ; truth floats Midway between the stars and the abyss . We , by God 's grace , have found a special nest I ' the dangerous rock , screened against wind and hawk ; Free burghers of a free town , blessed moreover With the peculiar favor of the Prince , Frederick the Grave , our patron and protector . What shall we fear ? Rather , where shall we seek Secure asylum , if here be not one ? Fly ? Our forefathers had the wilderness , The sea their gateway , and the fire-cored cloud Their divine guide . Us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly desert shall receive . Death crouches on all sides , prepared to leap Tiger-like on our throats , when first we step From this safe covert . Everywhere the Plague ! As nigh as Erfurt it has crawled  --  the towns Reek with miasma , the rank fields of spring , Rain-saturated , are one beautiful  --  lie , Smiling profuse life , and secreting death . Strange how , unbidden , a trivial memory Thrusts itself on my mind in this grave hour . I saw a large white bull urged through the town To slaughter , by a stripling with a goad , Whom but one sure stamp of that solid heel , One toss of those mooned horns , one battering blow Of that square marble forehead , would have crushed , As we might crush a worm , yet on he trudged , Patient , in powerful health to death . At once , As though o ' the sudden stung , he roared aloud , Beat with fierce hoofs the air , shook desperately His formidable head , and heifer-swift , Raced through scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the promptlier bound and killed and quartered . The world belongs to man ; dreams the poor brute Some nook has been apportioned for brute life ? Where shall a man escape men 's cruelty ? Where shall God 's servant cower from his doom ? Let us bide , brethren  --  we are in His hand . RABBI CRESSELIN RABBI CRESSELIN ( uttering a piercing shriek ) . Ah ! Woe unto Israel ! Lo , I see again , As the Ineffable foretold . I see A flood of fire that streams towards the town . Look , the destroying Angel with the sword , Wherefrom the drops of gall are raining down , Broad-winged , comes flying towards you . Now he draws His lightning-glittering blade ! With the keen edge He smiteth Israel  --  ah ! He falls back dead . Confusion in the Synagogue . CLAIRE CLAIRE ( from the gallery ) . Father ! My father ! Let me go down to him ! LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Sweet girl , be patient . This is the House of God , and He hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men surround and raise from the ground the body of Rabbi Cresselin . Several voices speaking at once . 1ST VOICE . 1ST VOICE .

Nay , his heart 's stopped  --  his breath has ceased  --  quite dead . 5TH VOICE . 5TH VOICE . Didst mark a diamond lance flash from the roof , And strike him ' twixt the eyes ? 1ST VOICE . 1ST VOICE . Our days are numbered . This is the token . RABBI JACOB . RABBI JACOB . Lift the corpse and pray . Shall we neglect God 's due observances , While He is manifest in miracle ? I saw a blaze seven times more bright than fire , Crest , halo-wise , the patriarch 's white head . The dazzle stung my burning lids  --  they closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud Had settled on his countenance forever . Footnote 1 : 1Kb Departed brother , mayest thou find the gates Of heaven open , see the city of peace , And meet the ministering angels , glad , Hastening towards thee ! May the High Priest stand To greet and bless thee ! Go thou to the end ! Repose in peace and rise again to life . No more thy sun sets , neither wanes thy moon . The Lord shall be thy everlasting light , Thy days of mourning shall be at an end . For you , my flock , fear nothing ; it is writ As one his mother comforteth , so I Will comfort you and in Jerusalem Ye shall be comforted . Scene closes . SCENE III . Evening . A crooked byway in the Judengasse . Enter Prince William . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Cursed be these twisted lanes ! I have missed the clue Of the close labyrinth . Nowhere in sight , Just when I lack it , a stray gaberdine To pick me up my thread . Yet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied , Some dozen hawk-eyes peering o'er crook 'd beaks Leer recognition , and obsequious caps Do kiss the stones to greet my princeship . Bah ! Strange , ' midst such refuse sleeps so white a pearl . At last , here shuffles one . Enter a Jew . Give you good even ! Sir , can you help me to the nighest way Unto the merchant 's house , Ssskind von Orb ? JEW . JEW . Whence come you knowing not the high brick wall , Without , blank as my palm , o ' the inner side , Muring a palace ? But  --  do you wish him well ? He is my friend  --  we must be wary , wary , We all have warning  --  Oh , the terror of it ! I have not yet my wits ! PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . I am his friend . Is he in peril ? What 's the matter , man ? JEW . JEW . Peril ? His peril is no worse than mine , But the rich win compassion . God is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He said it  --  oh those wild , white eyes ! PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . I pray you , Tell me the way to Ssskind 's home . JEW . JEW . Sweet master , You look the perfect knight , what can you crave Of us starved , wretched Jews ? Leave us in peace . The Judengasse gates will shut anon , Nor ope till morn again for Jew or Gentile . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Here ' s gold . I am the Prince of Meissen  --  speak ! JEW . JEW . Oh pardon ! Let me kiss your mantle 's edge . This way , great sir , I lead you there myself , If you deign follow one so poor , so humble . You must show mercy in the name of God , For verily are we afflicted . Come . Hard by is Ssskind 's dwelling  --  as we walk By your good leave I 'll tell what I have seen . Exeunt . SCENE IV . A luxuriously-furnished apartment in Ssskind von Orb 's house . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath eve . At the table are seated Ssskind von Orb , Liebhaid , and Reuben . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Drink , children , drink ! and lift your hearts to Him Who gives us the vine 's fruit . They drink . How clear it glows ; Like gold within the golden bowl , like fire Along our veins , after the work-day week Rekindling Sabbath-fervor , Sabbath-strength . Verily God prepares for me a table In presence of mine enemies ! He anoints My head with oil , my cup is overflowing . Praise we His name ! Hast thou , my daughter , served The needs o ' the poor , suddenly-orphaned child ? Naught must she lack beneath my roof . LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Yea , father . She prays and weeps within : she had no heart For Sabbath meal , but charged me with her thanks  --  SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Thou shalt be mother and sister in one to her . Speak to her comfortably . REUBEN . REUBEN . She has begged A grace of me I happily can grant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Synagogue , where sleeps her father , A light at head and foot , o'erwatched by strangers ; She would hold vigil . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . ' T is a pious wish , Not to be crossed , befitting Israel 's daughter . Go , Reuben ; heavily the moments hang , While her heart yearns to break beside his corpse . Receive my blessing . He places his hands upon his son 's head in benediction . Exit Reuben . Henceforth her home is here . In the event to-night , God 's finger points Visibly out of heaven . A thick cloud Befogs the future . But just here is light . Enter a servant ushering in Prince William . SERVANT . SERVANT . His highness Prince of Meissen . Exit . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Welcome , Prince ! God bless thy going forth and coming in ! Sit at our table and accept the cup Of welcome which my daughter fills . Liebhaid offers him wine . PRINCE WILLIAM PRINCE WILLIAM ( drinking ) . To thee ! All take their seats at the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparition in the Synagogue , The miracle of the message and the death . Ssskind von Orb , what think'st thou of these things ? SSSKIND . SSSKIND . I think , sir , we are in the hand of God , I trust the Prince  --  your father and my friend . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Trust no man ! flee ! I have not come to-night To little purpose . Your arch enemy , The Governor of Salza , Henry Schnetzen , Has won my father 's ear . Since yester eve He stops at Eisenach , begging of the Prince The Jews ' destruction . SSSKIND SSSKIND ( as he passes the platform ) . Schnetzen is my foe , I know it , but I know a talisman , Which at a word transmutes his hate to love . Liebhaid , my child , look cheerly . What is this ? Harm dare not touch thee ; the oppressor 's curse , Melts into blessing at thy sight . LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Not fear Plucks at my heart-strings , father , though the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , But no  --  I follow thee . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Thou shalt not miss The value of a hair from thy home treasures . All that thou lovest , Liebhaid , goes with thee . Knowest thou , Ssskind , Schnetzen 's cause of hate ? SSSKIND . SSSKIND . ' T is rooted in an ancient error , born During his feud with Landgrave Fritz the Bitten , Your Highness ' grandsire  --  ten years  --  twenty  --  back . Misled to think I had betrayed his castle , Who knew the secret tunnel to its courts , He has nursed a baseless grudge , whereat I smile , Sure to disarm him by the simple truth . God grant me strength to utter it . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . You fancy The rancor of a bad heart slow distilled Through venomed years , so at a breath , dissolves . O good old man , i ' the world , not of the world ! Belike , himself forgets the doubtful core Of this still-curdling , petrifying ooze . Truth ? why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock . He hugs his hate , His bed-fellow , his daily , life-long comrade ; Think you he has slept , ate , drank with it this while , Now to forego revenge on such slight cause As the revealed truth ? SSSKIND . SSSKIND . You mistake my thought , Great-hearted Prince , and justly  --  for I speak In riddles , till God 's time to make all clear . When His day dawns , the blind shall see . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Forgive me , If I , in wit and virtue your disciple , Seem to instruct my master . Accident Lifts me where I survey a broader field Than wise men stationed lower . I spy peril , Fierce flame invisible from the lesser peaks . God 's time is now . Delayed truth leaves a lie Triumphant . If you harbor any secret , Potent to force an ear that ' s locked to mercy , In God 's name , now disbosom it . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Kind Heaven ! Would that my people 's safety were assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where flee ? For all around us the Black Angel broods . We step into the open jaws of death If we go hence . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Better to fall beneath The hand of God , than be cut off by man . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . We are trapped , the springe is set . Not ignorantly I offered counsel in the Synagogue , Quelled panic with authoritative calm , But knowing , having weighed the opposing risks . Our friends in Strasburg have been overmastered , The imperial voice is drowned , the papal arm Drops paralyzed  --  both , lifted for the truth ; We can but front with brave eyes , brow erect , As is our wont , the fullness of our doom . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Then Meissen 's sword champions your desperate cause . I take my stand here where my heart is fixed . I love your daughter  --  if her love consent , I pray you , give me her to wife . LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Ah ! SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold fleece , These Rhine-blue eyes mislead thee  --  she is alien . To the heart 's core a Jewess  --  prop of my house , Soul of my soul  --  and I ? a despised Jew . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Thy propped house crumbles ; let my arm sustain Its tottering base  --  thy light is on the wane , Let me relume it . Give thy star to me , Or ever pitch-black night engulf us all  --  Lend me your voice , Liebhaid , entreat for me . Shall this prayer be your first that he denies ? LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Father , my heart 's desire is one with his . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Is this the will of God ? Amen ! My children , Be patient with me , I am full of trouble . For you , heroic Prince , could aught enhance Your love 's incomparable nobility , ' T were the foreboding horror of this hour , Wherein you dare flash forth its lightning-sword . You reckon not , in the hot , splendid moment Of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall blast and freeze  --  But hark ! I own a mystic amulet , Which you delivering to your gracious father , Shall calm his rage withal , and change his scorn Of the Jew 's daughter into pure affection . I will go fetch it  --  though I drain my heart Of its red blood , to yield this sacrifice . Exit Ssskind . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Have you no smile to welcome love with , Liebhaid ? Why should you tremble ? LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . Prince , I am afraid ! Afraid of my own heart , my unfathomed joy , A blasphemy against my father 's grief , My people 's agony . I dare be happy  --  So happy ! in the instant 's lull betwixt The dazzle and the crash of doom . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . You read The omen falsely ; rather is your joy The thrilling harbinger of general dawn . Did you not tell me scarce a month agone , When I chanced in on you at feast and prayer , The holy time 's bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute , who denied her race To save her race , who cast upon the die Of her divine and simple loveliness , Her life , her soul ,  --  and so redeemed her tribe . You are my Esther  --  but I , no second tyrant , Worship whom you adore , love whom you love ! LIEBHAID . LIEBHAID . If I must die with morn , I thank my God , And thee , my king , that I have lived this night . Enter Ssskind , carrying a jewelled casket . SSSKIND . SSSKIND . Here is the chest , sealed with my signet-ring , A mystery and a treasure lies within , Whose worth is faintly symboled by these gems , Starring the case . Deliver it unopened , Unto the Landgrave . Now , sweet Prince , good night . Else will the Judengasse gates be closed . PRINCE WILLIAM . PRINCE WILLIAM . Thanks , father , thanks . Liebhaid , my bride , good-night . He kisses her brow . Ssskind places his hands on the heads of Liebhaid and Prince William . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , who bringest joy To bride and bridegroom . Let us thank the Lord . Curtain falls .

Ah , such sins The Provost of St. George 's will remit For half a pound of coppers . SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN . Think it not ! No light amour this , leaving shield unflecked ; He wooes the Jewish damsel as a knight The lady of his heart . LANDGRAVE . LANDGRAVE . Impossible ! SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN .

You know her  --  yes , a Jewess In her domestic piety , her soul Large , simple , splendid like a star , her heart Suffused with Syrian sunshine  --  but no more  --  The aspect of a Princess of Thuringia , Swan-necked , gold-haired , Madonna-eyed . I love her ! If you will quench this passion , take my life ! He falls at his father 's feet . Frederick , in a paroxysm of rage , seizes his sword . SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN . He is your son !

Briefly this , my lord . The Jews of Nordhausen have brewed the Prince A love-elixir  --  let them perish all ! Tumult without . Singing of Hymns and Ringing of Church-bells . The Landgrave and Schnetzen go to the window . Footnote 1 : 1Kb SONG ( without ) . The cruel pestilence arrives , Cuts off a myriad human lives . See the Flagellants ' naked skin ! They scourge themselves for grievous sin . Trembles the earth beneath God 's breath , The Jews shall all be burned to death . LANDGRAVE . LANDGRAVE . Look , foreign pilgrims ! What an endless file ! Naked waist-upward . Blood is trickling down Their lacerated flesh . What do they carry ? SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN .

The Landgrave and Schnetzen withdraw from the window . SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN . Do not the people ask the same as I ? Is not the people 's voice the voice of God ? LANDGRAVE . LANDGRAVE . I will consider . SCHNETZEN . SCHNETZEN . Not too long , my liege . The moment favors . Later ' t were hard to show Due cause to his Imperial Majesty , For slaughtering the vassals of the Crown .

The Jews are never innocent ,  --  when Christ Agonized on the Cross , they cried  --  " His blood Be on our children 's heads and ours ! " I mark A dangerous growing evil of these days , Pity , misnamed  --  say , criminal indulgence Of reprobates brow-branded by the Lord . Shall we excel the Christ in charity ? Because his law is love , we tutor him In mercy and reward his murderers ? Justice is blind and virtue is austere .

How keen it sparkles o'er the Venusburg ! When brown night falls and mists begin to live , Then will the phantom hunting-train emerge , Hounds straining , black fire-eyeballed , breathless steeds , Spurred by wild huntsmen , and unhallowed nymphs , And at their head the foam-begotten witch , Of soul-destroying beauty .

Who and how many of that harmless tribe , Those meek and pious men , have been elected To glut with innocent blood the oppressor 's wrath ? PRIOR . PRIOR .

With me , it needs No plausive gift ; the smitten head , stopped throat , Blind eyes and silent suppliance of sorrow Persuade beyond all eloquence . Great God ! Here while I rage and beat against my bars , The infernal fagots may be stacked for her , The hell-spark kindled . Go to him , dear Prior , Speak to him gently , be not too much moved , ' Neath its rude case you had ever a soft heart , And he is stirred by mildness more than passion .

Oh trusting , tranquil Ssskind , who estopped Your ears forewarned , bandaged your visioned eyes , To woo destruction ! Stay ! did he not speak Of amulet or talisman ? These horrors Have crowded out my wits . Yea , the gold casket ! What fixed serenity beamed from his brow , Laying the precious box within my hands !

On their confession The Jews of Savoy were destroyed . To-morrow noon The holy flames shall dance in Nordhausen . PRIOR . PRIOR . Your zeal bespeaks you fair .

Ssskind von Orb ! and Schnetzen 's daughter lives As the Jew 's child within the Judengasse . PRIOR PRIOR ( eagerly ) . What proof hast thou of this ? NORDMANN . NORDMANN . Proof of these eyes ! I visited von Orb to ask a loan . There saw I such a maiden as no Jew Was ever blessed withal since Jesus died . White as a dove , with hair like golden floss , Eyes like an Alpine lake . The haughty line Of brow imperial , high bridged nose , fine chin , Seemed like the shadow cast upon the wall , Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou ne'er Discovered her to Schnetzen ? Schnetzen ? NORDMANN . NORDMANN . He was my friend . I shared with him thirst , hunger , sword , and fire . But he became a courtier . When the Margrave Sent me his second challenge to the field , His messenger was Schnetzen ! ' Mongst his knights , The apple of his eye was Henry Schnetzen . He was the hound that hunted me to death . He stood by Frederick 's side when I was led , Bound , to the presence . I denounced him coward , He smote me on the cheek . Christ ! it stings yet . He hissed  --  " My liege , let Henry Nordmann hang ! He is no knight , for he receives a blow , Nor dare avenge it ! " My gyved wrists moved not , No nerve twitched in my face , although I felt Flame leap there from my heart , then flying back , Leave it cold-bathed with deathly ooze  --  my soul In silence took her supreme vow of hate .

Henry Schnetzen Shall be the Jews ' destroyer ? Ah ! PRIOR . PRIOR . One moment . Mayhap this box which Ssskind sends the Prince Reveals more wonders . He brings forth the Casket from the Cabinet , opens it , and discovers a golden cross and a parchment which he hastily overlooks . Hark ! your word ' s confirmed Blessed be Christ , our Lord ! ( reads ) . " I Ssskind von Orb of Nordhausen , swear by the unutterable Name , that on the day when the Castle of Salza was burned , I rescued the infant daughter of Henry Schnetzen from the flames .

But never would she part with the child , even when she had learned to whom it belonged , and until she was gathered with the dead  --  may peace be with her soul !  --  she fostered in our Jewish home the offspring of the Gentile knight . Then again would I have yielded the girl to her parent , but Schnetzen was my foe , and I feared the haughty baron would disown the daughter who came from the hands of the Jew . Now however the maiden 's temporal happiness demands that she be acknowledged by her rightful father . Let him see what I have written . As a token , behold this golden cross , bound by the Lady Schnetzen round the infant 's neck . May the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob redeem and bless me as I have writ the truth . " PRIOR .

He makes my cause His own  --  and I shall fail upon these heights , Sink from the level of a hate sublime , To puerile pity ! PRIOR . PRIOR . Be advised . You hold Your enemy 's living heart within your hands . This secret is far costlier than you dreamed , For Frederick 's son wooes Schnetzen 's daughter . See , A hundred delicate springs your wit may move , Your puppets are the Landgrave and the Prince , The Governor of Salza and the Jews . You may recover station , wealth , and honor , Selling your secret shrewdly ; while rash greed Of clumsy vengeance may but drag you down In the wild whirl of universal ruin . NORDMANN .
