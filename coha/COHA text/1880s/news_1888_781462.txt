txt The death at the age of 44 of Mr. FRANK ROLL . the English painter , leaves as great a gap as that of CECIL LAWSON some years ago . The British landscape school felt the blow of LAwsoN 's death , but FRANK ROLL was known best for his portraits , some critics maintaining his title to the first place in that line of art . His reputation was made with the paintings of English life , generally scenes tinged with melancholy , for he shared the predilection of the British poets for sad themes . The recognition by the Queen of a simple , wellcomposed interior view called " The Lord Gave and the Lord Hath Taken Away " gave the young artist that patent of nobility which causes loyal Britons to pay pounds instead of shillings with small regard to the question of artistic merit . The Queen ordered a picture of him and he won a traveling Fellowship . Subsequent pictures , as their names testify , appealed to the lightly-won sympathies of the public ; such are " The Village Funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Not Her Will Consents , " and " New-gate : Committed for Trial . " Many of these are well composed , most of them are simple scenes of low and middle class life , and all , when given in black and white , are somewhat touching . But in the management of oils Mr. ROLL was not any happier than other British artists who have risen to , high favor in their own country without gaining the suffrages of connoisseurs in other lands . He told charming stories , but he was not a great master of the medium which the fashion of his day compelled an artist to work with under penalty of laboring without hire . His talents were better suited towater colors , which had sunk to a subordinate position in England at the time he began his career . Of late years it was as a portrait painter that Mr. Flom. kept before the public . Those who scoff at Messrs . WHISTLER and SARGENT as clever but shallow painters approved of FRANK ROLL and found in his carefully-wrought figures . well posed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general thing , the elements that seemed needful to uphold British art against the inroads of Belgians like ALMA TADEDIA , Frenchmen like LEGROS , and . Americans like the Impressionists before mentioned . Mr. ROLL painted almost as many distinguished persons as Mr. GEORGE F. WATTS , and his work was , if never so interesting , more evenly successful than the latter 's . His sitters were more political than literary and . artistic . Fine things are said in some quarters of his latest likeness of a great man , that of Mr. GLADSTONE , painted for presentation to Mrs. GLADSTONE at the recent festival at Hawarden in honor of her golden wedding . When we consider the slaw but constant improvement of FRANK How , in a technical way and his comparative youth , it is evident that British art has sustained a serious loss . His limitations were those common to the artists of his country during his formative years , but he showed that he was capable of freeing himself slowly from the drawbacks of a defective early teaching . What endeared him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his set pictures he tried to the best of his ability to reproduce the life of English people instead of yielding to the temptation to produce more salable , but less true , pictures of foreign scenes .
