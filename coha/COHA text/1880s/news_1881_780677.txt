txt A dispatch to the Inter-Oct-an from Cleveland says : " On their journey with the funeral train from Washington the Republican and Democratic Senators discussed the political situation fairly and reached a plan to adjust matters satisfactorily in the Senate without a wrangle such as that of last Spring , which would shock the country and be unseemly . The arragement was not to be binding on those not present , but it is believed the non-participants will accept the plan . Mr. Edmunds for the Republicans and Mr. Garland for the Democrats were the disseminators of the talk , and they informed their party friends by mail and telegraph that caucuses would be held Oct. 8 , at Washington by their respective parties , and if the agreement were carried out a joint committee of five would be appointed to arrange details . The result of the agreement was that Senator Anthony . or some other Republican selected by the Republican caucus , should be made acting Vice-President pro tem. of the Senate without aissent , and that the Democrats should name a Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant-at-Arms or select his successor , the present committees to be undisturbed . The Senate consists of ' 73 members-37 Democrats , 35 Republicans , and Judge Davis , who will act with the Republicans in organizing the Senate in accordance with his speech last Spring , in which he claimed that the organization of the Senate should harmonize with the Executive . When the Senators from NewYork and Rhode Island are sworn in the Republicans will have a majority . There would therefore be no reason or advantage in taking advantage of the present situation .
