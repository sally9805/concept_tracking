He was evidently from the country , for he wore a suit of brown jeans , or woollen homespun , made up in the natural color of the " black " sheep , as we call it . He shyly sidled up to the school-house door , and looked doubtfully at the boys who were playing , watching the familiar game as though he had never seen it before . The boys who had the " paddles " were standing on three bases , while three others stood each behind a base and tossed the ball around the triangle from one hole or base to another . The new-comer soon perceived that , if one with a paddle , or bat , struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caught directly , or " at the first bounce , " he gave up his bat to the one who had " caught him out . " When the ball was struck , it was called a " tick , " and when there was a tick , all the batters were obliged to run one base to the left , and then the ball thrown between a batter and the base to which he was running " crossed him out , " and obliged him to give up his " paddle " to the one who threw the ball . " Four old cat , " " two old cat , " and " five old cat " are , as everybody knows , played in the same way , the number of bases or holes increasing with the addition of each pair of players . It is probable that the game was once  --  some hundreds of years ago , maybe  --  called " three hole catch , " and that the name was gradually corrupted into " three hole cat , " as it is still called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake to " three old cat . " It is , no doubt , an early form of our present game of base-ball . It was this game which the new boy watched , trying to get an inkling of how it was played . He stood by the school-house door , and the girls who came in were obliged to pass near him . Each of them stopped to scrape her shoes , or rather the girls remembered the foot-scraper because they were curious to see the new-comer . They cast furtive glances at him , noting his new suit of brown clothes , his geography and atlas , his arithmetic , and , last of all , his face . " There 's a new scholar , " said Peter Rose , or , as he was called , " Pewee " Rose , a stout and stocky boy of fourteen , who had just been caught out by another . " I say , Greeny , how did you get so brown ? " called out Will Riley , a rather large , loose-jointed fellow . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes laugh at any one suffering torture , whether the victim be a persecuted cat or a persecuted boy . The new boy made no answer , but Joanna Merwin , who , just at that moment , happened to be scraping her shoes , saw that he grew red in the face with a quick flush of anger . " Do n't stand there , Greeny , or the cows 'll eat you up ! " called Riley , as he came round again to the base nearest to the school-house . Why the boys should have been amused at this speech , the new scholar could not tell  --  the joke was neither new nor witty  --  only impudent and coarse . But the little boys about the door giggled . " It 's a pity something would n't eat you , Will Riley  --  you are good for nothing but to be mean . " This sharp speech came from a rather tall and graceful girl of sixteen , who came up at the time , and who saw the annoyance of the new boy at Riley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was rare sport to hear pretty Susan Lanham " take down " the impudent Riley . " The bees will never eat you for honey , Susan , " said Will . Susan met the titter of the playground with a quick flush of temper and a fine look of scorn . " Nothing would eat you , Will , unless , maybe , a turkey-buzzard , and a very hungry one at that . " This sharp retort was uttered with a merry laugh of ridicule , and a graceful toss of the head , as the mischievous girl passed into the school-house . " That settles you , Will , " said Pewee Rose . And Bob Holliday began singing , to a doleful tune : " Poor old Pidy , She died last Friday . " Just then , the stern face of Mr. Ball , the master , appeared at the door ; he rapped sharply with his ferule , and called : " Books , books , books ! " The bats were dropped , and the boys and girls began streaming into the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying : " Poor old creetur , The turkey-buzzards eat her , " and such like soft and sweet speeches . Riley was vexed and angry , but nobody was afraid of him , for a boy may be both big and mean and yet lack courage . The new boy did not go in at once , but stood silently and faced the inquiring looks of the procession of boys as they filed into the school-room with their faces flushed from the exercise and excitement of the games . " I can thrash him easy , " thought Pewee Rose . " He is n't a fellow to back down easily , " said Harvey Collins to his next neighbor . Only good-natured , rough Bob Holliday stopped and spoke to the new-comer a friendly word . All that he said was " Hello ! " But how much a boy can put into that word " Hello ! " Bob put his whole heart into it , and there was no boy in the school that had a bigger heart , a bigger hand , or half so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long one built of red brick . It had taken the place of the old log institution in which one generation of Greenbank children had learned reading , writing , and Webster 's spelling-book . There were long , continuous writing-tables down the sides of the room , with backless benches , so arranged that when the pupil was writing his face was turned toward the wall  --  there was a door at each end , and a box stove stood in the middle of the room , surrounded by a rectangle of four backless benches . These benches were for the little fellows who did not write , and for others when the cold should drive them nearer the stove . The very worshipful master sat at the east end of the room , at one side of the door ; there was a blackboard  --  a " newfangled notion " in 1850  --  at the other side of the door . Some of the older scholars , who could afford private desks with lids to them , suitable for concealing smuggled apples and maple-sugar , had places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This arrangement was convenient for quiet study , for talking on the fingers by signs , for munching apples or gingerbread , and for passing little notes between the boys and girls . When the school had settled a little , the master struck a sharp blow on his desk for silence , and looked fiercely around the room , eager to find a culprit on whom to wreak his ill-humor . Mr. Ball was one of those old-fashioned teachers who gave the impression that he would rather beat a boy than not , and would even like to eat one , if he could find a good excuse . His eye lit upon the new scholar . " Come here , " he said , severely , and then he took his seat . The new boy walked timidly up to a place in front of the master 's desk . He was not handsome , his face was thin , his eyebrows were prominent , his mouth was rather large and good-humored , and there was that shy twinkle about the corners of his eyes which always marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine-grained face , with marks of suffering in it , and he had the air of having been once a strong fellow ; of late , evidently , shaken to pieces by the ague . " Where do you live ? " demanded Mr. Ball . " On Ferry Street . " " What do they call you ? " This was said with a contemptuous , rasping inflection that irritated the new scholar . His eyes twinkled , partly with annoyance and partly with mischief . " They call me Jack , for the most part , "  --  then catching the titter that came from the girls ' side of the room , and frightened by the rising hurricane on the master 's face , he added quickly : " My name is John Dudley , sir . " " Do n't you try to show your smartness on me , young man . You are a new-comer , and I let you off this time . Answer me that way again , and you will remember it as long as you live . " And the master glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a fence . The new boy turned pale , and dropped his head . " How old are you ? " " Thirteen . " " Have you ever been to school ? " " Three months . " " Three months . Do you know how to read ? " " Yes , sir , " with a smile . " Can you cipher ? " " Yes , sir . " " In multiplication ? " " Yes , sir . " " Long division ? " " Yes , sir ; I 've been half through fractions . " " You said you 'd been to school but three months ! " " My father taught me . " There was just a touch of pride in his voice as he said this  --  a sense of something superior about his father . This bit of pride angered the master , who liked to be thought to have a monopoly of all the knowledge in the town . " Where have you been living ? " " In the Indian Reserve , of late ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where you were born . When I ask you a question , answer that and no more . " " Yes , sir . " There was a touch of something in the tone of this reply that amused the school , and that made the master look up quickly and suspiciously at Jack Dudley , but the expression on Jack 's face was as innocent as that of a cat who has just lapped the cream off the milk . CHAPTER II KING MILKMAID Pewee Rose , whose proper name was Peter Rose , had also the nickname of King Pewee . He was about fourteen years old , square built and active , of great strength for his size , and very proud of the fact that no boy in town cared to attack him . He was not bad-tempered , but he loved to be master , and there were a set of flatterers who followed him , like jackals about a lion . As often happens , Nature had built for King Pewee a very fine body , but had forgotten to give him any mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banter , at any sort of talk or play where a good head was worth more than a strong arm and a broad back , King Pewee was sure to have the worst of it . A very convenient partnership had therefore grown up between him and Will Riley . Riley had muscle enough , but Nature had made him mean-spirited . He had  --  not exactly wit  --  but a facility for using his tongue , which he found some difficulty in displaying , through fear of other boys ' fists . By forming a friendship with Pewee Rose , the two managed to keep in fear the greater part of the school . Will 's rough tongue , together with Pewee 's rude fists , were enough to bully almost any boy . They let Harvey Collins alone , because he was older , and , keeping to himself , awed them by his dignity ; good-natured Bob Holliday , also , was big enough to take care of himself . But the rest were all as much afraid of Pewee as they were of the master , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of the prime minister , Riley , as well as of King Pewee . From the first day that Jack Dudley entered the school , dressed in brown jeans , Will Riley marked him for a victim . The air of refinement about his face showed him to be a suitable person for teasing . Riley called him " milksop , " and " sap-head " ; words which seemed to the dull intellect of King Pewee exceedingly witty . And as Pewee was Riley 's defender , he felt as proud of these rude nicknames as he would had he invented them and taken out a patent . But Riley 's greatest stroke of wit came one morning when he caught Jack Dudley milking the cow . In the village of Greenbank , milking a cow was regarded as a woman 's work ; and foolish men and boys are like savages ,  --  very much ashamed to be found doing a woman 's work . Fools always think something else more disgraceful than idleness . So , having seen Jack milking , Riley came to school happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight to the small boys . " Good-morning , milkmaid ! " he said to Jack Dudley , as he entered the school-house before school . " You milk the cow at your house , do you ? Where 's your apron ? " " Oh-h ! Milkmaid ! milkmaid ! That 's a good one , " chimed in Pewee Rose and all his set . Jack changed color . " Well , what if I do milk my mother 's cow ? I do n't milk anybody 's cow but ours , do I ? Do you think I 'm ashamed of it ? I 'd be ashamed not to . I can "  --  but he stopped a minute and blushed  --  " I can wash dishes , and make good pancakes , too . Now if you want to make fun , why , make fun . I do n't care . " But he did care , else why should his voice choke in that way ? " Oh , girl-boy ; a pretty girl-boy you are  --  " but here Will Riley stopped and stammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of Susan Lanham , with a look in it which made him suddenly remember something . Susan had heard all the conversation , and now she came around in front of Will , while all the other girls clustered about her with a vague expectation of sport . " Come , Pewee , let 's play ball , " said Will . " Ah , you 're running away , now ; you 're afraid of a girl , " said Susan , with a cutting little laugh , and a toss of her black curls over her shoulder . Will had already started for the ball-ground , but at this taunt he turned back , thrust his hands into his pockets , put on a swagger , and stammered : " No , I 'm not afraid of a girl , either . " " That 's about all that he is n't afraid of , " said Bob Holliday . " Oh ! you 're not afraid of a girl ? " said Susan . " What did you run away for , when you saw me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're afraid of anybody that Pewee ca n't whip . " " You 've got an awful tongue , Susan . We 'll call you Sassy Susan , " said Will , laughing at his own joke . " Oh , it is n't my tongue you 're afraid of now . You know I can tell on you . I saw you drive your cow into the stable last week . You were ashamed to milk outside , but you looked all around  --   --  " " I did n't do it . How could you see ? It was dark , " and Will giggled foolishly , seeing all at once that he had betrayed himself . " It was nearly dark , but I happened to be where I could see . And as I was coming back , a few minutes after , I saw you come out with a pail of milk , and look around you like a sneak-thief . You saw me and hurried away . You are such a coward that you are ashamed to do a little honest work . Milkmaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him around by the nose ! " " You 'd better be careful what you say , Susan , " said Pewee , threateningly . " You wo n't touch me . You go about bullying little boys , and calling yourself King Pewee , but you ca n't do a sum in long division , nor in short subtraction , for that matter , and you let fellows like Riley make a fool of you . Your father 's poor , and your mother ca n't keep a girl , and you ought to be ashamed to let her milk the cows . Who milked your cow this morning , Pewee ? " " I do n't know , " said the king , looking like the king 's fool . " You did it , " said Susan . " Do n't deny it . Then you come here and call a strange boy a milkmaid ! " " Well , I did n't milk in the street , anyway , and he did . " At this , all laughed aloud , and Susan 's victory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head , as she turned away : " King Milkmaid ! " Pewee found the nickname likely to stick . He was obliged to declare on the playground the next day , that he would " thrash " any boy that said anything about milkmaids . After that , he heard no more of it . But one morning he found " King Milkmaid " written on the door of his father 's cow-stable . Some boy who dared not attack Pewee , had vented his irritation by writing the hateful words on the stable , and on the fence-corners near the school-house , and even on the blackboard . Pewee could not fight with Susan Lanham , but he made up his mind to punish the new scholar when he should have a chance . He must give somebody a beating . CHAPTER III ANSWERING BACK It is hard for one boy to make a fight . Even your bully does not like to " pitch on " an inoffensive school-mate . You remember AEsop 's fable of the wolf and the lamb , and what pains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a little hard for Pewee to fight with a boy who walked quietly to and from the school , without giving anybody cause for offence . But the chief reason why Pewee did not attack him with his fists was that both he and Riley had found out that Jack Dudley could help them over a hard place in their lessons better than anybody else . And notwithstanding their continual persecution of Jack , they were mean enough to ask his assistance , and he , hoping to bring about peace by good-nature , helped them to get out their geography and arithmetic almost every day . Unable to appreciate this , they were both convinced that Jack only did it because he was afraid of them , and as they found it rare sport to abuse him , they kept it up . By their influence Jack was shut out of the plays . A greenhorn would spoil the game , they said . What did a boy that had lived on Wildcat Creek , in the Indian Reserve , know about playing bull-pen , or prisoner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would go out . But the girls , and the small boys , and good-hearted Bob Holliday liked Jack 's company very much . Yet , Jack was a boy , and he often longed to play games with the others . He felt very sure that he could dodge and run in " bull-pen " as well as any of them . He was very tired of Riley 's continual ridicule , which grew worse as Riley saw in him a rival in influence with the smaller boys . " Catch Will alone sometimes , " said Bob Holliday , " when Pewee is n't with him , and then thrash him . He 'll back right down if you bristle up to him . If Pewee makes a fuss about it , I 'll look after Pewee . I 'm bigger than he is , and he wo n't fight with me . What do you say ? " " I sha n't fight unless I have to . " " Afraid ? " asked Bob , laughing . " It is n't that . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to be pounded or to pound anybody . I think I 'd rather be whipped than to be made fun of , though . But my father used to say that people who fight generally do so because they are afraid of somebody else , more than they are of the one they fight with . " " I believe that 's a fact , " said Bob . " But Riley aches for a good thrashing . " " I know that , and I feel like giving him one , or taking one myself , and I think I shall fight him before I 've done . But father used to say that fists could never settle between right and wrong . They only show which is the stronger , and it is generally the mean one that gets the best of it . " " That 's as sure as shootin ' , " said Bob . " Pewee could use you up . Pewee thinks he 's the king , but laws ! he 's only Riley 's bull-dog . Riley is afraid of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side all the time . " " My father used to say , " said Jack , " that brutes could fight with force , but men ought to use their wits . " " You seem to think a good deal of what your father says ,  --  like it was your Bible , you know . " " My father 's dead , " replied Jack . " Oh , that 's why . Boys do n't always pay attention to what their father says when he 's alive . " " Oh , but then my father was  --  " Here Jack checked himself , for fear of seeming to boast . " You see , " he went on , " my father knew a great deal . He was so busy with his books that he lost ' most all his money , and then we moved to the Indian Reserve , and there he took the fever and died ; and then we came down here , where we owned a house , so that I could go to school . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Bob , wishing to get away from melancholy subjects . " You have got as good a tongue as his . " " I have n't his stock of bad words , though . " " You 've got a power of fun in you , though ,  --  you keep everybody laughing when you want to , and if you 'd only turn the pumps on him once , he 'd howl like a yellow dog that 's had a quart o ' hot suds poured over him out of a neighbor 's window . Use your wits , like your father said . You 've lived in the woods till you 're as shy as a flying-squirrel . All you 've got to do is to talk up and take it rough and tumble , like the rest of the world . Riley ca n't bear to be laughed at , and you can make him ridiculous as easy as not . " The next day , at the noon recess , about the time that Jack had finished helping Bob Holliday to find some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boys took refuge in the school-house . They must have some amusement , so Riley began his old abuse . " Well , greenhorn from the Wildcat , where 's the black sheep you stole that suit of clothes from ? " " I hear him bleat now , " said Jack ,  --  " about the blackest sheep I have ever seen . " " You 've heard the truth for once , Riley , " said Bob Holliday . Riley , who was as vain as a peacock , was very much mortified by the shout of applause with which this little retort of Jack 's was greeted . It was not a case in which he could call in King Pewee . The king , for his part , shut up his fists and looked silly , while Jack took courage to keep up the battle . But Riley tried again . " I say , Wildcat , you think you 're smart , but you 're a double-distilled idiot , and have n't got brains enough to be sensible of your misery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laugh from the school . But before the laugh had died down , Jack Dudley took the word , saying , in a dry and quizzical way : " Do n't you try to claim kin with me that way , Riley . No use ; I wo n't stand it . I do n't belong to your family . I 'm neither a fool nor a coward . " " Hurrah ! " shouted Bob Holliday , bringing down first one and then the other of his big feet on the floor . " It 's your put-in now , Riley . " " Do n't be backward in coming forward , Will , as the Irish priest said to his people , " came from grave Harvey Collins , who here looked up from his book , thoroughly enjoying the bully 's discomfiture . " That 's awfully good , " said Joanna Merwin , clasping her hands and giggling with delight . King Pewee doubled up his fists and looked at Riley to see if he ought to try his sort of wit on Jack . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should turn and pelt them again , they could not be more surprised than were Riley and King Pewee at Jack 's repartees . " You 'd better be careful what you say to Will Riley , " said Pewee . " I stand by him . " But Jack 's blood was up now , and he was not to be scared . " All the more shame to him , " said Jack . " Look at me , shaken all to pieces with the fever and ague on the Wildcat , and look at that great big , bony coward of a Riley . I 've done him no harm , but he wants to abuse me , and he 's afraid of me . He dare n't touch me . He has to coax you to stand by him , to protect him from poor little me . He 's a great big  --   --  " " Calf , " broke in Bob Holliday , with a laugh . " You 'd better be careful , " said Pewee to Jack , rising to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you defend him if I hit him ? " " Yes . " " Well , then , I wo n't hit him . But you do n't mean that he is to abuse me , while I am not allowed to answer back a word ? " " Well  --  " said Pewee hesitatingly . " Well , " said Bob Holliday hotly , " I say that Jack has just as good a right to talk with his tongue as Riley . Stand by Riley if he 's hit , Pewee ; he needs it . But do n't you try to shut up Jack . " And Bob got up and put his broad hand on Jack 's shoulder . Nobody had ever seen the big fellow angry before , and the excitement was very great . The girls clapped their hands . " Good for you , Bob , I say , " came from Susan Lanham , and poor , ungainly Bob blushed to his hair to find himself the hero of the girls . " I do n't mean to shut up Jack , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I stand by Riley . " " Well , do your standing sitting down , then , " said Susan . " I 'll get a milking-stool for you , if that 'll keep you quiet . " It was well that the master came in just then , or Pewee would have had to fight somebody or burst . CHAPTER IV LITTLE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS Jack 's life in school was much more endurable now that he had a friend in Bob Holliday . Bob had spent his time in hard work and in rough surroundings , but he had a gentleman 's soul , although his manners and speech were rude . More and more Jack found himself drawn to him . Harvey Collins asked Jack to walk down to the river-bank with him at recess . Both Harvey and Bob soon liked Jack , who found himself no longer lonely . The girls also sought his advice about their lessons , and the younger boys were inclined to come over to his side . As winter came on , country boys , anxious to learn something about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . Each of these new-comers had to go through a certain amount of teasing from Riley and of bullying from Pewee . One frosty morning in December there appeared among the new scholars a strange little fellow , with a large head , long straight hair , an emaciated body , and legs that looked like reeds , they were so slender . His clothes were worn and patched , and he had the look of having been frost-bitten . He could not have been more than ten years old , to judge by his size , but there was a look of premature oldness in his face . " Come here ! " said the master , when he caught sight of him . " What is your name ? " And Mr. Ball took out his book to register the new-comer , with much the same relish that the Giant Despair showed when he had bagged a fresh pilgrim . " Columbus Risdale . " The new-comer spoke in a shrill , piping voice , as strange as his weird face and withered body . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir , " piped the strange little creature . " Give your full name , " said Mr. Ball , sternly . " My name is Christopher Columbus George Washington Marquis de Lafayette Risdale . " The poor lad was the victim of that mania which some people have for " naming after " great men . His little shrunken body and high , piping voice made his name seem so incongruous that all the school tittered , and many laughed outright . But the dignified and eccentric little fellow did not observe it . " Can you read ? " " Yes , sir , " squeaked the lad , more shrilly than ever . " Umph , " said the master , with a look of doubt on his face . " In the first reader ? " " No , sir ; in the fourth reader . " Even the master could not conceal his look of astonishment at this claim . At that day , the fourth reader class was the highest in the school , and contained only the largest scholars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading in the fourth reader , and the little fellow looked around the room , puzzled to guess the cause of the merriment . " We 'll try you , " said the master , with suspicion . When the fourth-reader class was called , and Harvey Collins and Susie Lanham and some others of the nearly grown-up pupils came forward , with Jack Dudley as quite the youngest of the class , the great-eyed , emaciated little Columbus Risdale picked himself up on his pipe-stems and took his place at the end of this row . It was too funny for anything ! Will Riley and Pewee and other large scholars , who were yet reading in that old McGuffey 's Third Reader , which had a solitary picture of Bonaparte crossing the Alps , looked with no kindly eyes on this preposterous infant in the class ahead of them . The piece to be read was the poem of Mrs. Hemans 's called " The Better Land . " Poems like this one are rather out of fashion nowadays , and people are inclined to laugh a little at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental poetry was greatly esteemed . This one presented no difficulty to the readers . In that day , little or no attention was paid to inflection  --  the main endeavor being to pronounce the words without hesitation or slip , and to " mind the stops . " Each one of the class read a stanza ending with a line : " Not there , not there , my child ! " The poem was exhausted before all had read , so that it was necessary to begin over again in order to give each one his turn . All waited to hear the little Columbus read . When it came his turn , the school was as still as death . The master , wishing to test him , told him , with something like a sneer , that he could read three stanzas , or " verses , " as Mr. Ball called them . The little chap squared his toes , threw his head back , and more fluently even than the rest , he read , in his shrill , eager voice , the remaining lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he read : " Not there , not there , my child ! " The effect of this from the hundred-year-old baby was so striking and so ludicrous that everybody was amused , while all were surprised at the excellence of his reading . The master proceeded , however , to whip one or two of the boys for laughing . When recess-time arrived , Susan Lanham came to Jack with a request . " I wish you 'd look after little Lummy Risdale . He 's a sort of cousin of my mother 's . He is as innocent and helpless as the babes in the wood . " " I 'll take care of him , " said Jack . So he took the little fellow walking away from the school-house ; Will Riley and some of the others calling after them : " Not there , not there , my child ! " But Columbus did not lay their taunts to heart . He was soon busy talking to Jack about things in the country , and things in town . On their return , Riley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " threw a snow-ball from a distance of ten feet and struck the poor little Christopher Columbus George Washington Lafayette so severe a blow as to throw him off his feet . Quick as a flash , Jack charged on Riley , and sent a snow-ball into his face . An instant later he tripped him with his foot and rolled the big , scared fellow into the snow and washed his face well , leaving half a snow-bank down his back . " What makes you so savage ? " whined Riley . " I did n't snow-ball you . " And Riley looked around for Pewee , who was on the other side of the school-house , and out of sight of the scuffle . " No , you dare n't snow-ball me , " said Jack , squeezing another ball and throwing it into Riley 's shirt-front with a certainty of aim that showed that he knew how to play ball . " Take that one , too , and if you bother Lum Risdale again , I 'll make you pay for it . Take a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another ball , but Riley retreated to the other side of the school-house . CHAPTER V WHILING AWAY TIME Excluded from the plays of the older fellows , Jack drew around him a circle of small boys , who were always glad to be amused with the stories of hunting , fishing , and frontier adventure that he had heard from old pioneers on Wildcat Creek . Sometimes he played " tee-tah-toe , three in a row , " with the girls , using a slate and pencil in a way well known to all school-children . And he also showed them a better kind of " tee-tah-toe , " learned on the Wildcat , and which may have been in the first place an Indian game , as it is played with grains of Indian corn . A piece of board is grooved with a jack-knife in the manner shown in the diagram . Illustration : DIAGRAM OF TEE-TAH-TOE BOARD . One player has three red or yellow grains of corn , and the other an equal number of white ones . The player who won the last game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first puts down a grain of corn at any place where the lines intersect , but usually in the middle , as that is the best point . Then the other player puts down one , and so on until all are down . After this , the players move alternately along any of the lines , in any direction , to the next intersection , provided it is not already occupied . The one who first succeeds in getting his three grains in a row wins the point , and the board is cleared for a new start . As there are always three vacant points , and as the rows may be formed in any direction along any of the lines , the game gives a chance for more variety of combinations than one would expect from its appearance . Illustration : JACK AMUSING THE SMALL BOYS WITH STORIES OF HUNTING , FISHING , AND FRONTIER ADVENTURE . Jack had also an arithmetical puzzle which he had learned from his father , and which many of the readers of this story will know , perhaps . " Set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said he to Joanna Merwin . She set down a number . " Now add twelve and multiply by two . " " Well , that is done , " said Joanna . " Divide by four , subtract half of the number first set down , and your answer will be six . " " Oh , but how did you know that I put down sixty-four ? " said Joanna . " I did n't , " said Jack . " How could you tell the answer , then ? " " That 's for you to find out . " This puzzle excited a great deal of curiosity . To add to the wonder of the scholars , Jack gave each time a different number to be added in , and sometimes he varied the multiplying and dividing . Harvey Collins , who was of a studious turn , puzzled over it a long time , and at last he found it out ; but he did not tell the secret . He contented himself with giving out a number to Jack and telling his result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riley turned green with jealousy when he found the girls and boys refusing to listen to his jokes , but gathering about Jack to test his ability to " guess the answer , " as they phrased it . Riley said he knew how it was done , and he was even foolish enough to try to do it , by watching the slate-pencil , or by sheer guessing , but this only brought him into ridicule . " Try me once , " said the little C. C. G. W. M. de L. Risdale , and Jack let Columbus set down a figure and carry it through the various processes until he told him the result . Lummy grew excited , pushed his thin hands up into his hair , looked at his slate a minute , and then squeaked out : " Oh  --  let me see  --  yes  --  no  --  yes  --  Oh , I see ! Your answer is just half the amount added in , because you have  --   --  " But here Jack placed his hand over Columbus 's mouth . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't let out my secret , " he said . But Jack had a boy 's heart in him , and he longed for some more boy-like amusement . CHAPTER VI A BATTLE One morning , when Jack proposed to play a game of ball with the boys , Riley and Pewee came up and entered the game , and objected . " It is n't interesting to play with greenhorns , " said Will . " If Jack plays , little Christopher Columbus Andsoforth will want to play , too ; and then there 'll be two babies to teach . I ca n't be always helping babies . Let Jack play two-hole cat or Anthony-over with the little fellows . " To which answer Pewee assented , of course . That day at noon Riley came to Jack , with a most gentle tone and winning manner , and whiningly begged Jack to show him how to divide 770 by 14 . " It is n't interesting to show greenhorns , " said Jack , mimicking Riley 's tone on the playground that morning . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; then there 'll be two babies to teach . I ca n't be always helping babies . Go and play two-hole cat with the First-Reader boys . " That afternoon , Mr. Ball had the satisfaction of using his new beech switches on both Riley and Pewee , though indeed Pewee did not deserve to be punished for not getting his lesson . It was Nature 's doing that his head , like a goat 's , was made for butting and not for thinking . But if he had to take whippings from the master and his father , he made it a rule to get satisfaction out of somebody else . If Jack had helped him he would n't have missed . If he had not missed his lesson badly , Mr. Ball would not have whipped him . It would be inconvenient to whip Mr. Ball in return , but Jack would be easy to manage , and as somebody must be whipped , it fell to Jack 's lot to take it . King Pewee did not fall upon his victim at the school-house door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . Nor did he attack Jack while Bob Holliday was with him . Bob was big and strong  --  a great fellow of sixteen . But after Jack had passed the gate of Bob 's house , and was walking on toward home alone , Pewee came out from behind an alley fence , accompanied by Ben Berry and Will Riley . " I 'm going to settle with you now , " said King Pewee , sidling up to Jack like an angry bull-dog . It was not a bright prospect for Jack , and he cast about him for a chance to escape a brutal encounter with such a bully , and yet avoid actually running away . " Well , " said Jack , " if I must fight , I must . But I suppose you wo n't let Riley and Berry help you . " " No , I 'll fight fair . " And Pewee threw off his coat , while Jack did the same . " You 'll quit when I say ' enough , ' wo n't you ? " said Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up when you 've got enough . " " Well , then , for that matter , I 've got enough now . I 'll take the will for the deed and just say ' enough ' before you begin , " and he turned to pick up his coat . " No , you do n't get off that way , " said Pewee . " You 've got to stand up and see who is the best man , or I 'll kick you all the way home . " " Did n't you ever hear about Davy Crockett 's ' coon ? " said Jack . " When the ' coon saw him taking aim , it said : ' Is that you , Crockett ? Well , do n't fire  --  I 'll come down anyway . I know you 'll hit anything you shoot at . ' Now , I 'm that ' coon . If it was anybody but you , I 'd fight . But as it 's you , Pewee , I might just as well come down before you begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Had he been alone , Jack would have escaped . But Will Riley , remembering all he had endured from Jack 's retorts , said : " Oh , give it to him , Pewee ; he 's always making trouble . " At which Pewee squared himself off , doubled up his fists , and came at the slenderer Jack . The latter prepared to meet him , but , after all , it was hard for Pewee to beat so good-humored a fellow as Jack . The king 's heart failed him , and suddenly he backed off , saying : " If you 'll agree to help Riley and me out with our lessons hereafter , I 'll let you off . If you do n't , I 'll thrash you within an inch of your life . " And Pewee stood ready to begin . Jack wanted to escape the merciless beating that Pewee had in store for him . But it was quite impossible for him to submit under a threat . So he answered : " If you and Riley will treat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask me , as I always have . But even if you pound me into jelly I wo n't agree to help you , unless you treat me right . I wo n't be bullied into helping you . " " Give it to him , Pewee , " said Ben Berry ; " he 's too sassy . " Pewee was a rather good-natured dog  --  he had to be set on . He now began to strike at Jack . Whether he was to be killed or not , Jack did not know , but he was resolved not to submit to the bully . Yet he could not do much at defence against Pewee 's hard fists . However , Jack was active and had long limbs ; he soon saw that he must do something more than stand up to be beaten . So , when King Pewee , fighting in the irregular Western fashion , and hoping to get a decided advantage at once , rushed upon Jack and pulled his head forward , Jack stooped lower than his enemy expected , and , thrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under him , and by using all his strength threw Pewee over his own back , so that the king 's nose and eyes fell into the dust of the village street . " I 'll pay you for that , " growled Pewee , as he recovered himself , now thoroughly infuriated ; and with a single blow he sent Jack flat on his back , and then proceeded to pound him . Jack could do nothing now but shelter his eyes from Pewee 's blows . Joanna Merwin had seen the beginning of the battle from her father 's house , and feeling sure that Jack would be killed , she had run swiftly down the garden walk to the back gate , through which she slipped into the alley ; and then she hurried on , as fast as her feet would carry her , to the blacksmith-shop of Pewee Rose 's father . " Oh , please , Mr. Rose , come quick ! Pewee 's just killing a boy in the street . " " Vitin ' ag'in , " said Mr. Rose , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English with difficulty . " He ees a leetle ruffen , dat poy . I 'll see apout him right avay a'ready , may be . " And without waiting to put off his leathern apron , he walked briskly in the direction indicated by Joanna . Pewee was hammering Jack without pity , when suddenly he was caught by the collar and lifted sharply to his feet . " Wot you doin ' down dare in de dirt wunst a'ready ? Hey ? " said Mr. Rose , as he shook his son with the full force of his right arm , and cuffed him with his left hand . " Did n't I dells you I 'd gill you some day if you did n't gwit vitin ' mit oder poys , a'ready ? " " He commenced it , " whimpered Pewee . " You dells a pig lie a'ready , I beleefs , Peter , and I 'll whip you fur lyin ' besides wunst more . Fellers like him , " pointing to Jack , who was brushing the dust off his clothes ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you . You 're such anoder viter I never seed . " And he shook Pewee savagely . " I wo n't do it no more , " begged Pewee  --  " ' pon my word and honor I wo n't . " " Oh , you do n't gits off dat away no more , a'ready . You know what I 'll giff you when I git you home , you leedle ruffen . I shows you how to vite , a'ready . " And the king disappeared down the street , begging like a spaniel , and vowing that he " would n't do it no more . " But he got a severe whipping , I fear ;  --  it is doubtful if such beatings ever do any good . The next morning Jack appeared at school with a black eye , and Pewee had some scratches , so the master whipped them both for fighting . CHAPTER VII HAT-BALL AND BULL-PEN Pewee did not renew the quarrel with Jack  --  perhaps from fear of the rawhide that hung in the blacksmith 's shop , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists , or perhaps from a hope of conciliating Jack and getting occasional help in his lessons . Jack was still excluded from the favorite game of " bull-pen . " I am not sure that he would have been rejected had he asked for admission , but he did not want to risk another refusal . He planned a less direct way of getting into the game . Asking his mother for a worn-out stocking , and procuring an old boot-top , he ravelled the stocking , winding the yarn into a ball of medium hardness . Then he cut from the boot-top a square of leather large enough for his purpose . This he laid on the kitchen-table , and proceeded to mark off and cut it into the shape of an orange-peel that has been quartered off the orange , leaving the four quarters joined together at the middle . This leather he put to soak over night . The next morning , bright and early , with a big needle and some strong thread he sewed it around his yarn-ball , stretching the wet leather to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be firm and hard , and the leather well moulded to it . Such a ball is far better for all play in which the player is to be hit than those sold in the stores nowadays . I have described the manufacture of the old-fashioned home-made ball , because there are some boys , especially in the towns , who have lost the art of making yarn balls . When Jack had finished his ball , he let it dry , while he ate his breakfast and did his chores . Then he sallied out and found Bob Holliday , and showed him the result of his work . Bob squeezed it , felt its weight , bounced it against a wall , tossed it high in the air , caught it , and then bounced it on the ground . Having thus " put it through its paces , " he pronounced it an excellent ball ,  --  " a good deal better than Ben Berry 's ball . But what are you going to do with it ? " he asked . " Play Anthony-over ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are boys in these days who do not know what " Anthony-over " is . How , indeed , can anybody play Anthony-over in a crowded city ? The old one-story village school-houses stood generally in an open green . The boys divided into two parties , the one going on one side , and the other on the opposite side of the school-house . The party that had the ball would shout " Anthony ! " The others responded , " Over ! " To this , answer was made from the first party , " Over she comes ! " and the ball was immediately thrown over the school-house . If any of the second party caught it , they rushed , pell-mell , around both ends of the school-house to the other side , and that one of them who held the ball essayed to hit some one of the opposite party before they could exchange sides . If a boy was hit by the ball thus thrown he was counted as captured to the opposite party , and he gave all his efforts to beat his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players of one side were captured by the others . I do n't know what Anthony means in this game , but no doubt the game is hundreds of years old , and was played in English villages before the first colony came to Jamestown . " I 'm not going to play Anthony-over , " said Jack . " I 'm going to show King Pewee a new trick . " " You ca n't get up a game of bull-pen on your own hook , and play the four corners and the ring all by yourself . " " No , I do n't mean that . I 'm going to show the boys how to play hat-ball  --  a game they used to play on the Wildcat . " " I see your point . You are going to make Pewee ask you to let him in , " said Bob , and the two boys set out for school together , Jack explaining the game to Bob . They found one or two boys already there , and when Jack showed his new ball and proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boys stood their hats in a row on the grass . The one with the ball stood over the row of hats , and swung his hand to and fro above them , while the boys stood by him , prepared to run as soon as the ball should drop into a hat . The boy who held the ball , after one or two false motions ,  --  now toward this hat , and now toward that one ,  --  would drop the ball into Somebody 's hat . Somebody would rush to his hat , seize the ball , and throw it at one of the other boys , who were fleeing in all directions . If he hit Somebody-Else , Somebody-Else might throw from where the ball lay , or from the hats , at the rest , and so on , until some one missed . The one who missed took up his hat and left the play , and the boy who picked up the ball proceeded to drop it into a hat , and the game went on until all but one were put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play at it , and Jack 's friends found it so full of boisterous fun , that every new-comer wished to set down his hat . And thus , by the time Pewee and Riley arrived , half the larger boys in the school were in the game , and there were not enough left to make a good game of bull-pen . At noon , the new game drew the attention of the boys again , and Riley and Pewee tried in vain to coax them away . " Oh , I say , come on , fellows ! " Riley would say . " Come  --  let 's play something worth playing . " But the boys stayed by the new game and the new ball . Neither Riley , nor Pewee , nor Ben Berry liked to ask to be let into the game , after what had passed . Not one of them had spoken to Jack since the battle between him and Pewee , and they did n't care to play with Jack 's ball in a game of his starting . Once the other boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to feel themselves free . As for Pewee and his friends , they climbed up on a fence , and sat like three crows , watching the play of the others . After a while they got down in disgust , and went off , not knowing just what to do . When once they were out of sight , Jack winked at Bob , who said : " I say , boys , we can play hat-ball at recess when there is n't time for bull-pen . Let 's have a game of bull-pen now , before school takes up . " It was done in a minute . Bob Holliday and Tom Taylor " chose up sides , " the bases were all ready , and by the time Pewee and his aides-de-camp had walked disconsolately to the pond and back , the boys were engaged in a good game of bull-pen . Perhaps I ought to say something about the principles of a game so little known over the country at large . I have never seen it played anywhere but in a narrow bit of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merrier game played with a ball . The ball must not be too hard . There should be four or more corners . The space inside is called the pen , and the party winning the last game always has the corners . The ball is tossed from one corner to another , and when it has gone around once , any boy on a corner may , immediately after catching the ball thrown to him from any of the four corners , throw it at any one in the pen . He must throw while " the ball is hot , "  --  that is , instantly on catching it . If he fails to hit anybody on the other side , he goes out . If he hits , his side leave the corners and run as they please , for the boy who has been hit may throw from where the ball fell , or from any corner , at any one of the side holding the corners . If one of them is hit , he has the same privilege ; but now the men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " out , " and the play is resumed from the corners until all of one side is out . When but two are left on the corners the ball is smuggled ,  --  that is , one hides the ball in his bosom , and the other pretends that he has it also . The boys in the ring do not know which has it , and the two " run the corners , " throwing from any corner . If but one is left on the corners , he is allowed , also , to run from corner to corner . It happened that Jack 's side lost on the toss-up for corners , and he got into the ring , where his play showed better than it would have done on the corners . As Jack was the greenhorn and the last chosen on his side , the players on the corners expected to make light work of him ; but he was an adroit dodger , and he put out three of the boys on the corners by his unexpected way of evading a ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expertness in dodging is worth quite as much as skill in throwing . Pewee was a famous hand with a ball , Riley could dodge well , Ben Berry had a happy knack of dropping flat upon the ground and letting a ball pass over him , Bob Holliday could run well in a counter charge ; but nothing could be more effective than Jack Dudley 's quiet way of stepping forward or backward , bending his lithe body or spreading his legs to let the ball pass , according to the course which it took from the player 's hand . King Pewee and company came back in time to see Jack dodge three balls thrown point-blank at him from a distance of fifteen feet . It was like witchcraft  --  he seemed to be charmed . Every dodge was greeted with a shout , and when once he luckily caught the ball thrown at him , and thus put out the thrower , there was no end of admiration of his playing . It was now evident to all that Jack could no longer be excluded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was already the best player on the ground . At recess that afternoon Pewee set his hat down in the hat-ball row , and as Jack did not object , Riley and Ben Berry did the same . The next day Pewee chose Jack first in bull-pen , and the game was well played . CHAPTER VIII THE DEFENDER If Jack had not about this time undertaken the defence of the little boy in the Fourth Reader , whose name was large enough to cover the principal points in the history of the New World , he might have had peace , for Jack was no longer one of the newest scholars , his courage was respected by Pewee , and he kept poor Riley in continual fear of his ridicule  --  making him smart every day . But , just when he might have had a little peace and happiness , he became the defender of Christopher Columbus George Washington Marquis de la Fayette Risdale  --  little " Andsoforth , " as Riley and the other boys had nicknamed him . The strange , pinched little body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his infantile simplicity had all conspired to win the affection of Jack , so that he would have protected him even without the solicitation of Susan Lanham . But since Susan had been Jack 's own first and fast friend , he felt in honor bound to run all risks in the care of her strange little cousin . I think that Columbus 's child-like ways might have protected him even from Riley and his set , if it had not been that he was related to Susan Lanham , and under her protection . It was the only chance for Riley to revenge himself on Susan . She was more than a match for him in wit , and she was not a proper subject for Pewee 's fists . So with that heartlessness which belongs to the school-boy bully , he resolved to torment the helpless fellow in revenge for Susan 's sarcasms . One morning , smarting under some recent taunt of Susan 's , Riley caught little Columbus almost alone in the school-room . Here was a boy who certainly would not be likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , his pale face , his contracted chest , all gave the coward a perfect assurance of safety . So , with a rude pretence at play , laughing all the time , he caught the lad by the throat , and in spite of his weird dignity and pleading gentleness , shoved him back against the wall behind the master 's empty chair . Holding him here a minute in suspense , he began slapping him , first on this side of the face and then on that . The pale cheeks burned red with pain and fright , but Columbus did not cry out , though the constantly increasing sharpness of the blows , and the sense of weakness , degradation , and terror , stung him severely . Riley thought it funny . Like a cat playing with a condemned mouse , the cruel fellow actually enjoyed finding one person weak enough to be afraid of him . Columbus twisted about in a vain endeavor to escape from Riley 's clutches , getting only a sharper cuff for his pains . Ben Berry , arriving presently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls , coming in , looked on the scene of torture in helpless pity . And ever , as more and more of the scholars gathered , Columbus felt more and more mortified ; the tears were in his great sad eyes , but he made no sound of crying or complaint . Jack Dudley came in at last , and marched straight up to Riley , who let go his hold and backed off . " You mean , cowardly , pitiful villain ! " broke out Jack , advancing on him . " I did n't do anything to you , " whined Riley , backing into a corner . " No , but I mean to do something to you . If there 's an inch of man in you , come right on and fight with me . You dare n't do it . " " I do n't want any quarrel with you . " " No , you quarrel with babies . " Here all the boys and girls jeered . " You 're too hard on a fellow , Jack , " whined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to back down the school-room , while Jack kept slowly following him . " You 're a great deal bigger than I am , " said Jack . " Why do n't you try to corner me ? Oh , I could just beat the breath out of you , you great , big , good-for-nothing  --   --  " Here Riley pulled the west door open , and Jack , at the same moment , struck him . Riley half dropped , half fell , through the door-way , scared so badly that he went sprawling on the ground . The boys shouted " coward " and " baby " after him as he sneaked off , but Jack went back to comfort Columbus and to get control of his temper . For it is not wise , as Jack soon reflected , even in a good cause to lose your self-control . " It was good of you to interfere , " said Susan , when she had come in and learned all about it . " I should have been a brute if I had n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it does n't take any courage to back Riley out of a school-house . One could get more fight out of a yearling calf . I suppose I 've got to take a beating from Pewee , though . " " Go and see him about it , before Riley talks to him , " suggested Susan . And Jack saw the prudence of this course . As he left the school-house at a rapid pace , Ben Berry told Riley , who was skulking behind a fence , that Jack was afraid of Pewee . " Pewee , " said Jack , when he met him starting to school , after having done his " chores , " including the milking of his cow ,  --  " Pewee , I want to say something to you . " Jack 's tone and manner flattered Pewee . One thing that keeps a rowdy a rowdy is the thought that better people despise him . Pewee felt in his heart that Jack had a contempt for him , and this it was that made him hate Jack in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly way , he felt himself lifted up into a dignity hitherto unknown to him . " What is it ? " " You are a kind of king among the boys , " said Jack . Pewee grew an inch taller . " They are all afraid of you . Now , why do n't you make us fellows behave ? You ought to protect the little boys from fellows that impose on them . Then you 'd be a king worth the having . All the boys and girls would like you . " " I s'pose may be that 's so , " said the king . " There 's poor little Columbus Risdale  --   --  " " I do n't like him , " said Pewee . " You mean you do n't like Susan . She is a little sharp with her tongue . But you would n't fight with a baby  --  it is n't like you . " " No , sir-ee , " said Pewee . " You 'd rather take a big boy than a little one . Now , you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do that , " said Pewee . " Riley 's about a million times bigger than Lum . " " I went to the school-house this morning , " continued Jack , " and I found Riley choking and beating him . And I thought I 'd just speak to you , and see if you ca n't make him stop it . " " I 'll do that , " said Pewee , walking along with great dignity . When Ben Berry and Riley saw Pewee coming in company with Jack , they were amazed and hung their heads , afraid to say anything even to each other . Jack and Pewee walked straight up to the fence-corner in which they stood . " I thought I 'd see what King Pewee would say about your fighting with babies , Riley , " said Jack . " I want you fellows to understand , " said Pewee , " that I 'm not going to have that little Lum Risdale hurt . If you want to fight , why do n't you fight somebody your own size ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew his head up , " and I do n't stand by any boy that does . " Poor Riley felt the last support drop from under him . Pewee had deserted him , and he was now an orphan , unprotected in an unfriendly world ! Jack knew that the truce with so vain a fellow as Pewee could not last long , but it served its purpose for the time . And when , after school , Susan Lanham took pains to go and thank Pewee for standing up for Columbus , Pewee felt himself every inch a king , and for the time he was  --  if not a " reformed prize-fighter , " such as one hears of sometimes , at least an improved boy . The trouble with vain people like Pewee is , that they have no stability . They bend the way the wind blows , and for the most part the wind blows from the wrong quarter . CHAPTER IX PIGEON POT-PIE Happy boys and girls that go to school nowadays ! You have to study harder than the generations before you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the good old games that were not half so scientific as base-ball , lawn tennis , or lacrosse , but that had ten times more fun and frolic in them ; but all this is made up to you by the fact that you escape the tyrannical old master . Whatever the faults the teachers of this day may have , they do not generally lacerate the backs of their pupils , as did some of their fore-runners . At the time of which I write , thirty years ago , a better race of school-masters was crowding out the old , but many of the latter class , with their terrible switches and cruel beatings , kept their ground until they died off one by one , and relieved the world of their odious ways . Mr. Ball would n't die to please anybody . He was a bachelor , and had no liking for children , but taught school five or six months in winter to avoid having to work on a farm in the summer . He had taught in Greenbank every winter for a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affection , had been obliged to teach those who disliked him . This atmosphere of mutual dislike will sour the sweetest temper , and Mr. Ball 's temper had not been strained honey to begin with . Year by year he grew more and more severe  --  he whipped for poor lessons , he whipped for speaking in school , he took down his switch for not speaking loud enough in class , he whipped for coming late to school , he whipped because a scholar made a noise with his feet , and he whipped because he himself had eaten something unwholesome for his breakfast . The brutality of a master produces like qualities in scholars . The boys drew caricatures on the blackboard , put living cats or dead ones into Mr. Ball 's desk , and tried to drive him wild by their many devices . He would walk up and down the school-room seeking a victim , and he had as much pleasure in beating a girl or a little boy as in punishing an overgrown fellow . And yet I can not say that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susan Lanham was not punished , because her father , Dr. Lanham , was a very influential man in the town ; and the faults of Henry Weathervane and his sister were always overlooked after their father became a school trustee . Many efforts had been made to put a new master into the school . But Mr. Ball 's brother-in-law was one of the principal merchants in the place , and the old man had had the school so long that it seemed like robbery to deprive him of it . It had come , in some sort , to belong to him . People hated to see him moved . He would die some day , they said , and nobody could deny that , though it often seemed to the boys and girls that he would never die ; he was more likely to dry up and blow away . And it was a long time to wait for that . And yet I think Greenbank might have had to wait for something like that if there had n't come a great flight of pigeons just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that he should try to get Mr. Ball removed and a new teacher appointed , Dr. Lanham smiled and said " he hated to move against the old man ; he 's been there so long , you know , and he probably would n't live long , anyhow . Something ought to be done , perhaps , but he could n't meddle with him . " For older people forgot the beatings they had endured , and remembered the old man only as one of the venerable landmarks of their childhood . And so , by favor of Henry Weathervane 's father , whose children he did not punish , and by favor of other people 's neglect and forgetfulness , the Greenbank children might have had to face and fear the old ogre down to this day , or until he dried up and blew away , if it had n't been , as I said , that there came a great flight of pigeons . A flight of pigeons is not uncommon in the Ohio River country . Audubon , the great naturalist , saw them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in the settlements on the sea-board , and sometimes the starving colonists were able to knock down pigeons with sticks . The mathematician is not yet born who can count the number of pigeons in one of these sky-darkening flocks , which are often many miles in length , and which follow one another for a whole day . The birds , for the most part , fly at a considerable height from the earth , but when they are crossing a wide valley , like that of the Ohio River , they drop down to a lower level , and so reach the hills quite close to the ground , and within easy gunshot . When the pigeon flight comes on Saturday , it is very convenient for those boys that have guns . If these pigeons had only come on Saturday instead of on Monday , Mr. Ball might have taught the Greenbank school until to-day ,  --  that is to say , if he had n't died or quite dried up and blown off meanwhile . For when Riley and Ben Berry saw this flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geography lesson was a hard one , and so they played " hooky , " and , taking their guns with them , hid in the bushes at the top of the hill . Then , as the birds struck the hill , and beat their way up over the brow of it , the boys , lying in ambush , had only to fire into the flock without taking aim , and the birds would drop all around them . The discharge of the guns made Bob Holliday so hungry for pigeon pot-pie , that he , too , ran away from school , at recess , and took his place among the pigeon-slayers in the paw-paw patch on the hill top . Tuesday morning , Mr. Ball came in with darkened brows , and three extra switches . Riley , Berry , and Holliday were called up as soon as school began . They had pigeon pot-pie for dinner , but they also had sore backs for three days , and Bob laughingly said that he knew just how a pigeon felt when it was basted . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun shone warm at noon , the fire was allowed to go down in the stove . All were at play in the sunshine , excepting Columbus Risdale , who sat solitary , like a disconsolate screech-owl , in one corner of the room . Riley and Ben Berry , still smarting from yesterday , entered , and without observing Lummy 's presence , proceeded to put some gunpowder in the stove , taking pains to surround it with cool ashes , so that it should not explode until the stirring of the fire , as the chill of the afternoon should come on . When they had finished this dangerous transaction , they discovered the presence of Columbus in his corner , looking at them with large-eyed wonder and alarm . " If you ever tell a living soul about that , we 'll kill you , " said Ben Berry . Riley also threatened the scared little rabbit , and both felt safe from detection . An hour after school had resumed its session . Columbus , who had sat shivering with terror all the time , wrote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the stove . Said they would kill me if I told on them . " This he passed to Jack , who sat next to him . Jack rubbed it out as soon as he had read it , and wrote : " Do n't tell anybody . " Jack could not guess what they had put in . It might be coffee-nuts , which would explode harmlessly ; it might be something that would give a bad smell in burning , such as chicken-feathers . If he had thought that it was gunpowder , he would have plucked up courage enough to give the master some warning , though he might have got only a whipping for his pains . While Jack was debating what he should do , the master called the Fourth-Reader class . At the close of the lesson he noticed that Columbus was shivering , though indeed it was more from terror than from cold . " Go to the stove and stir up the fire , and get warm , " he said , sternly . " I 'd  --  I 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea . " Umph ! " said Mr. Ball , looking hard at the lad , with half a mind to make him go . Then he changed his purpose and went to the stove himself , raked forward the coals , and made up the fire . Just as he was shutting the stove-door , the explosion came  --  the ashes flew out all over the master , the stove was thrown down from the bricks on which its four legs rested , the long pipe fell in many pieces on the floor , and the children set up a general howl in all parts of the room . As soon as Mr. Ball had shaken off the ashes from his coat , he said : " Be quiet  --  there 's no more danger . Columbus Risdale , come here . " " He did not do it , " spoke up Susan Lanham . " Be quiet , Susan . You know all about this , " continued the master to poor little Columbus , who was so frightened as hardly to be able to stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a great beech switch . " Now , I shall whip you until you tell me who did it . You were afraid to go to the stove . You knew there was powder there . Who put it there ? That 's the question . Answer , quick , or I shall make you . " The little skin-and-bones trembled between two terrors , and Jack , seeing his perplexity , got up and stood by him . " He did n't do it , Mr. Ball . I know who did it . If Columbus should tell you , he would be beaten for telling . The boy who did it is just mean enough to let Lummy get the whipping . Please let him off . " " You know , do you ? I shall whip you both . You knew there was gunpowder in the fire , and you gave no warning . I shall whip you both  --  the severest whipping you ever had , too . " And the master put up the switch he had taken down , as not effective enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known it was gunpowder , " said Jack , beginning to tremble , " you would have been warned . But we did n't . We only knew that something had been put in . " " If you 'll tell all about it , I 'll let you off easier ; if you do n't , I shall give you all the whipping I know how to give . " And by way of giving impressiveness to his threat he took a turn about the room , while there was an awful stillness among the terrified scholars . I do not know what was in Bob Holliday 's head , but about this time he managed to open the western door while the master 's back was turned . Bob 's desk was near the door . Poor little Columbus was ready to die , and Jack was afraid that , if the master should beat him as he threatened to do , the child would die outright . Luckily , at the second cruel blow , the master broke his switch and turned to get another . Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run home as fast as you can go . " The little fellow needed no second bidding . He tottered on his trembling legs to the door , and was out before Mr. Ball had detected the motion . When the master saw his prey disappearing out of the door , he ran after him , but it happened curiously enough , in the excitement , that Bob Holliday , who sat behind the door , rose up , as if to look out , and stumbled against the door , thus pushing it shut , so that by the time Mr. Ball got his stiff legs outside the door , the frightened child was under such headway that , fearing to have the whole school in rebellion , the teacher gave over the pursuit , and came back prepared to wreak his vengeance on Jack . While Mr. Ball was outside the door , Bob Holliday called to Jack , in a loud whisper , that he had better run , too , or the old master would " skin him alive . " But Jack had been trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose him his winter 's schooling , on which he had set great store . He made up his mind to face the punishment as best he could , fleeing only as a last resort if the beating should be unendurable . " Now , " said the master to Jack , " will you tell me who put that gunpowder in the stove ? If you do n't , I 'll take it out of your skin . " Jack could not bear to tell , especially under a threat . I think that boys are not wholly right in their notion that it is dishonorable to inform on a school-mate , especially in the case of so bad an offence as that of which Will and Ben were guilty . But , on the other hand , the last thing a master ought to seek is to turn boys into habitual spies and informers on one another . In the present instance , Jack ought , perhaps , to have told , for the offence was criminal ; but it is hard for a high-spirited lad to yield to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphing from behind the master , by spelling with her fingers : " Tell or run . " But he could not make up his mind to do either , though Bob Holliday had again mysteriously opened the western door . The master summoned all his strength and struck him half a dozen blows , that made poor Jack writhe . Then he walked up and down the room awhile , to give the victim time to consider whether he would tell or not . " Run , " spelled out Susan on her fingers . " The school-house is on fire ! " called out Bob Holliday . Some of the coals that had spilled from the capsized stove were burning the floor  --  not dangerously , but Bob wished to make a diversion . He rushed for a pail of water in the corner , and all the rest , aching with suppressed excitement , crowded around the fallen stove , so that it was hard for the master to tell whether there was any fire or not . Bob whispered to Jack to " cut sticks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold , boys , and let 's put up the stove , " said Bob , taking the matter quite out of the master 's hands . Of course , the stove-pipe would not fit without a great deal of trouble . Did ever stove-pipe go together without trouble ? Somehow , all the joints that Bob joined together flew asunder over and over again , though he seemed to work most zealously to get the stove set up . After half an hour of this confusion , the pipe was fixed , and the master , having had time , like the stove , to cool off , and seeing Jack bent over his book , concluded to let the matter drop . But there are some matters that , once taken up , are hard to drop . CHAPTER X JACK AND HIS MOTHER Jack went home that night very sore on his back and in his feelings . He felt humiliated to be beaten like a dog , and even a dog feels degraded in being beaten . He told his mother about it  --  the tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a goodness that did not talk much about goodness . She always took it for granted that her boy would not do anything mean , and thus made a healthy atmosphere for a brave boy to grow in . Jack told her of his whipping , with some heat , while he sat at supper . She did not say much then , but after Jack 's evening chores were all finished , she sat down by the candle where he was trying to get out some sums , and questioned him carefully . " Why did n't you tell who did it ? " she asked . " Because it makes a boy mean to tell , and all the boys would have thought me a sneak . " " It is a little hard to face a general opinion like that , " she said . " But , " said Jack , " if I had told , the master would have whipped Columbus all the same , and the boys would probably have pounded him , too . I ought to have told beforehand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was only some coffee-nuts that they had put in . The mean fellows , to let Columbus take a whipping for them ! But the way Mr. Ball beats us is enough to make a boy mean and cowardly . " After a long silence , the mother said : " I think we shall have to give it up , Jack . " " What , mother ? " " The schooling for this winter . I do n't want you to go where boys are beaten in that way . In the morning , go and get your books and see what you can do at home . " Then , after a long pause , in which neither liked to speak , Mrs. Dudley said : " I want you to be an educated man . You learn quickly ; you have a taste for books , and you will be happier if you get knowledge . If I could collect the money that Gray owes your father 's estate , or even a part of it , I should be able to keep you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no hope for that . " " But Gray is a rich man , is n't he ? " " Yes , he has a good deal of property , but not in his own name . He persuaded your father , who was a kind-hearted and easy-natured man , to release a mortgage , promising to give him some other security the next week . But , meantime , he put his property in such a shape as to cheat all his creditors . I do n't think we shall ever get anything . " " I am going to be an educated man , anyhow . " " But you will have to go to work at something next fall , " said the mother . " That will make it harder , but I mean to study a little every day . I wish I could get a chance to spend next winter in school . " " We 'll see what can be done . " And long after Jack went to bed that night the mother sat still by the candle with her sewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to get on with his studies . Jack woke up after eleven o'clock , and saw her light still burning in the sitting-room . " I say , mother , " he called out , " do n't you sit there worrying about me . We shall come through this all right . " Some of Jack 's hopefulness got into the mother 's heart , and she took her light and went to bed . Weary , and sore , and disappointed , Jack did not easily get to sleep himself after his cheerful speech to his mother . He lay awake long , making boy 's plans for his future . He would go and collect money by some hook or crook from the rascally Gray ; he would make a great invention ; he would discover a gold mine ; he would find some rich cousin who would send him through college ; he would  --   --  , but just then he grew more wakeful and realized that all his plans had no foundation of probability . CHAPTER XI COLUMBUS AND HIS FRIENDS When he waked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Columbus Risdale go past the door after his cow the evening before , and he was afraid that he might be ill . Why had he not thought to go down and drive up the cow himself ? It was yet early , and he arose and went down to the little rusty , brown , unpainted house in which the Risdales , who were poor people , had their home . Just as he pushed open the gate , Bob Holliday came out of the door , looking tired and sleepy . " Hello , Bob ! " said Jack . " How 's Columbus ? Is he sick ? " " Awful sick , " said Bob . " Clean out of his head all night . " " Have you been here all night ? " " Yes , I heerd he was sick last night , and I come over and sot up with him . " " You good , big-hearted Bob ! " said Jack . " You 're the best fellow in the world , I believe . " " What a quare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , choking up . " Air you goin ' to school to-day ? " " No . Mother 'd rather have me not go any more . " " I 'm not going any more . I hate old Ball . Neither 's Susan Lanham going . She 's in there , " and Bob made a motion toward the house with his thumb , and passed out of the gate , while Jack knocked at the door . He was admitted by Susan . " Oh , Jack ! I 'm so glad to see you , " she whispered . " Columbus has asked for you a good many times during the night . You 've stood by him splendidly . " Jack blushed , but asked how Lummy was now . " Out of his head most of the time . Bob Holliday stayed with him all night . What a good fellow Bob Holliday is ! " " I almost hugged him , just now , " said Jack , and Susan could n't help smiling at this frank confession . Jack passed into the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb his friend , and paused by the door . Mrs. Risdale sat by the bedside of Columbus , who was sleeping uneasily , his curious big head and long , thin hair making a strange picture against the pillow . His face looked more meagre and his eyes more sunken than ever before , but there was a feverish flush on his wan cheeks , and the slender hands moved uneasily on the outside of the blue coverlet , the puny arms were bare to the elbows . Mrs. Risdale beckoned Jack to come forward , and he came and stood at the bed-foot . Then Columbus opened his large eyes and fixed them on Jack for a few seconds . " Come , Jack , dear old fellow , " he whispered . Jack came and bent over him with tearful eyes , and the poor little reed-like arms were twined about his neck . " Jack , " he sobbed , " the master 's right over there in the corner all the time , straightening out his long switches . He says he 's going to whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you , Jack , you good old fellow ? " " No , he sha n't touch you . " " Let 's run away , Jack , " he said , presently . And so the poor little fellow went on , his great , disordered brain producing feverish images of terror from which he continually besought " dear good old Jack " to deliver him . When at last he dropped again into a troubled sleep , Jack slipped away and drove up the Risdale cow , and then went back to his breakfast . He was a boy whose anger kindled slowly ; but the more he thought about it , the more angry he became at the master who had given Columbus such a fright as to throw him into a brain fever , and at the " mean , sneaking contemptible villains , " as he hotly called them , who would n't come forward and confess their trick , rather than to have the poor little lad punished . " I suppose we ought to make some allowances , " his mother said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . You 're always making allowances . " After breakfast and chores , Jack thought to go again to see his little friend . On issuing from the gate , he saw Will Riley and Ben Berry waiting for him at the corner . Whether they meant to attack him or not he could not tell , but he felt too angry to care . " I say , Jack , " said Riley , " how did you know who put the powder in the stove ? Did Columbus tell you ? " " Mind your own business , " said Jack , in a tone not so polite as it might be . " The less you say about gunpowder , hereafter , the better for you both . Why did n't you walk up and tell , and save that little fellow a beating ? " " Look here , Jack , " said Berry , " do n't you tell what you know about it . There 's going to be a row . They say that Doctor Lanham 's taken Susan , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrashed Lummy , and they say Bob Holliday 's quit , and that you 're going to quit , and Doctor Lanham 's gone to work this morning to get the master put out at the end of the term . Mr. Ball did n't know that Columbus was kin to the Lanhams , or he 'd have let him alone , like he does the Lanhams and the Weathervanes . There is going to be a big row , and everybody 'll want to know who put the powder in the stove . We want you to be quiet about it . " " You do ? " said Jack , with a sneer . " You do ? " " Yes , we do , " said Riley , coaxingly . " You do ? You come to me and ask me to keep it secret , after letting me and that poor little baby take your whipping ! You want me to hide what you did , when that poor little Columbus lies over there sick abed and like to die , all because you sneaking scoundrels let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he sick ? " said Riley , in terror . " Going to die , I expect , " said Jack , bitterly . " Well , " said Ben Berry , " you be careful what you say about us , or we 'll get Pewee to get even with you . " " Oh , that 's your game ! You think you can scare me , do you ? " Jack grew more and more angry . Seeing a group of school-boys on the other side of the street , he called them over . " Look here , boys , " said Jack , " I took a whipping yesterday to keep from telling on these fellows , and now they have the face to ask me not to tell that they put the powder in the stove , and they promise me a beating from Pewee if I do . These are the two boys that let a poor sickly baby take the whipping they ought to have had . They have just as good as killed him , I suppose , and now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping still about it . I did n't back down from the master , and I wo n't from Pewee . Oh , no ! I wo n't tell anybody . But if any of you boys should happen to guess that Will Riley and Ben Berry were the cowards who did that mean trick , I am not going to say they were n't . It would n't be of any use to deny it . There are only two boys in school mean enough to play such a contemptible trick as that . " Riley and Berry stood sheepishly silent , but just here Pewee came in sight , and seeing the squad of boys gathered around Jack , strode over quickly and pushed his sturdy form into the midst . " Pewee , " said Riley , " I think you ought to pound Jack . He says you ca n't back him down . " " I did n't , " said Jack . " I said you could n't scare me out of telling who tried to blow up the school-house stove , and let other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pewee Rose . If Pewee wants to put himself in as mean a crowd as yours , and be your puppy-dog to fight for you , let him come on . He 's a fool if he does , that 's all I have to say . The whole town will want to ship you two fellows off before night , and Pewee is n't going to fight your battles . What do you think , Pewee , of fellows that put powder in a stove where they might blow up a lot of little children ? What do you think of two fellows that want me to keep quiet after they let little Lum Risdale take a whipping for them , and that talk about setting you on to me if I tell ? " Thus brought face to face with both parties , King Pewee only looked foolish and said nothing . Jack had worked himself into such a passion that he could not go to Risdale 's , but returned to his own home , declaring that he was going to tell everybody in town . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-controlled face of his mother , he began to feel cooler . " Let us remember that some allowances are to be made for such boys , " was all that she said . " That 's what you always say , Mother , " said Jack , impatiently . " I believe you 'd make allowances for the Old Boy himself . " " That would depend on his bringing up , " smiled Mrs. Dudley . " Some people have bad streaks naturally , and some have been cowed and brutalized by ill-treatment , and some have been spoiled by indulgence . " Jack felt more calm after a while . He went back to the bedside of Columbus , but he could n't bring himself to make allowances . CHAPTER XII GREENBANK WAKES UP If the pigeons had not crossed the valley on Monday , nobody would have played truant , and if nobody had played truant on Monday , there would not have been occasion to whip three boys on Tuesday morning , and if Ben Berry and Riley had escaped a beating on Tuesday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove on Wednesday at noon , and if they had omitted that bad joke , Columbus would not have got into trouble and run away from school , and if he had escaped the fright and the flight , he might not have had the fever , and the town would not have been waked up , and other things would not have happened . So then , you see , this world of ours is just like the House that Jack Built : one thing is tied to another and another to that , and that to this , and this to something , and something to something else , and so on to the very end of all things . So it was that the village was thrown into a great excitement as the result of a flock of innocent pigeons going over the heads of some lazy boys . In the first place , Susan Lanham talked about things . She talked to her aunts , and she talked to her uncles , and , above all , she talked to her father . Now Susan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tongue , as all the world knew , and when she set out to tell people what a brute the old master was , how he had beaten two innocent boys , how bravely Jack had carried himself , how frightened little Columbus was , and how sick it had made him , and how mean the boys were to put the powder there , and then to let the others take the whipping ,  --  I say , when Susan set out to tell all these things , in her eloquent way , to everybody she knew , you might expect a waking up in the sleepy old town . Some of the people took Susan 's side and removed their children from the school , lest they , too , should get a whipping and run home and have brain fever . But many stood up for the old master , mostly because they were people of the sort that never can bear to see anything changed . " The boys ought to have told who put the powder in the stove , " they said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master know that Jack and Columbus did not do it themselves ? " said others . " Maybe they did ! " " Do n't tell me ! " cried old Mrs. Horne . " Do n't tell me ! Boys ca n't be managed without whipping , and plenty of it . ' Bring up a child and away he goes , ' as the Bible says . When you hire a master , you want a master , says I. " " What a tongue that Sue Lanham has got ! " said Mr. Higbie , Mr. Ball 's brother-in-law . The excitement spread over the whole village . Doctor Lanham talked about it , and the ministers , and the lawyers , and the loafers in the stores , and the people who came to the post-office for their letters . Of course , it broke out furiously in the " Maternal Association , " a meeting of mothers held at the house of one of the ministers . " Mr. Ball can do every sum in the arithmetic , " urged Mrs. Weathervane . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mother Brownson . " Yes , " said Mrs. Dudley , " I do n't doubt it . Jack 's back is covered with figures of Mr. Ball 's making . For my part , I should rather have a master that did his figuring on a slate . " Susan Lanham got hold of this retort , and took pains that it should be known all over the village . When Greenbank once gets waked up on any question , it never goes to sleep until that particular question is settled . But it does n't wake up more than once or twice in twenty years . Most of the time it is only talking in its sleep . Now that Greenbank had its eyes open for a little time , it was surprised to see that while the cities along the river had all adopted graded schools ,  --  de-graded schools , as they were called by the people opposed to them ,  --  and while even the little villages in the hill country had younger and more enlightened teachers , the county-town of Greenbank had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Fillmore , the same hard old stick of a master that had beaten the boys in the log school-house in the days of John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson . But , now it was awake , Greenbank kept its eyes open on the school question . The boys wrote on the fences , in chalk : DOWN WITH OLD BAWL ! and thought the bad spelling of the name a good joke , while men and women began to talk about getting a new master . Will Riley and Ben Berry had the hardest time . For the most part they stayed at home during the excitement , only slinking out in the evening . The boys nicknamed them " Gunpowder cowards , " and wrote the words on the fences . Even the loafers about the street asked them whether Old Ball had given them that whipping yet , and how they liked " powder and Ball . " CHAPTER XIII PROFESSOR SUSAN Mr. Ball did not let go easily . He had been engaged for the term , and he declared that he would go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nothing but empty benches . In truth , he and his partisans hoped that the storm would blow over and the old man be allowed to go on teaching and thrashing as heretofore . He had a great advantage in that he had been trained in all the common branches better than most masters , and was regarded as a miracle of skill in arithmetical calculations . He even knew how to survey land . Jack was much disappointed to miss his winter 's schooling , and there was no probability that he would be able to attend school again . He went on as best he could at home , but he stuck fast on some difficult problems in the middle of the arithmetic . Columbus had by this time begun to recover his slender health , and he was even able to walk over to Jack 's house occasionally . Finding Jack in despair over some of his " sums , " he said : " Why do n't you ask Susan Lanham to show you ? I believe she would ; and she has been clean through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the master himself . " " I do n't like to , " said Jack . " She would n't want to take the trouble . " But the next morning Christopher Columbus managed to creep over to the Lanhams : " Cousin Sukey , " he said , coaxingly , " I wish you 'd do something for me . I want to ask a favor of you . " Illustration : " COUSIN SUKEY , " SAID LITTLE COLUMBUS , " I WANT TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU . " " What is it , Columbus ? " said Sue . " Anything you ask shall be given , to the half of my kingdom ! " and she struck an attitude , as Isabella of Castile , addressing the great Columbus , with the dust-brush for a sceptre , and the towel , which she had pinned about her head , for a crown . " You are so funny , " he said , with a faint smile . " But I wish you 'd be sober a minute . " " Have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want ? " " Jack  --   --  " " Oh , yes , it 's always Jack with you . But that 's right  --  Jack deserves it . " " Jack ca n't do his sums , and he wo n't ask you to help him . " " And so he got you to ask ? " " No , he did n't . He would n't let me , if he knew . He thinks a young lady like you would n't want to take the trouble to help him . " " Do you tell that stupid Jack , that if he does n't want to offend me so that I 'll never , never forgive him , he is to bring his slate and pencil over here after supper this evening . And you 'll come , too , with your geography . Yours truly , Susan Lanham , Professor of Mathematics and Natural Science in the Greenbank Independent and Miscellaneous Academy . Do you hear ? " " All right . " And Columbus , smiling faintly , went off to tell Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own brother and two sisters , two pupils who learned more arithmetic than they would have gotten in the same time from Mr. Ball , though she did keep them laughing at her drollery . The next evening , little Joanna Merwin joined the party , and Professor Susan felt quite proud of her " academy , " as she called it . Bob Holliday caught the infection , and went to studying at home . As he was not so far advanced as Jack , he contented himself with asking Jack 's help when he was in trouble . At length , he had a difficulty that Jack could not solve . " Why do n't you take that to the professor ? " asked Jack . " I 'll ask her to show you . " " I durs n't , " said Bob , with a frightened look . " Nonsense ! " said Jack . That evening , when the lessons were ended , Jack said : " Professor Susan , there was a story in the old First Reader we had in the first school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lame foot . A doctor cured his foot , and some time after , the patient brought another lame dog to the doctor , and showed by signs that he wanted this other dog cured , too . " " That 's rather a good dog-story , " said Susan . " But what made you think of it ? " " Because I 'm that first dog . " " You are ? " " Yes . You 've helped me , but there 's Bob Holliday . I 've been helping him , but he 's got to a place where I do n't quite understand the thing myself . Now Bob would n't dare ask you to help him  --   --  " " Bring him along . How the Greenbank Academy grows ! " laughed Susan , turning to her father . Bob was afraid of Susan at first  --  his large fingers trembled so much that he had trouble to use his slate-pencil . But by the third evening his shyness had worn off , so that he got on well . One evening , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning he came to Jack 's house with his face scratched and his eye bruised . " What 's the matter ? " asked Jack . " Well , you see , yesterday I was at the school-house at noon , and Pewee , egged on by Riley , said something he ought n't to , about Susan , and I could n't stand there and hear that girl made fun of , and so I up and downed him , and made him take it back . I ca n't go till my face looks better , you know , for I would n't want her to know anything about it . " But the professor heard all about it from Joanna , who had it from one of the school-boys . Susan sent Columbus to tell Bob that she knew all about it , and that he must come back to school . " So you 've been fighting , have you ? " she said , severely , when Bob appeared . The poor fellow was glad she took that tone  --  if she had thanked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Well , do n't you do it any more . It 's very wrong to fight . It makes boys brutal . A girl with ability enough to teach the Greenbank Academy can take care of herself , and she does n't want her scholars to fight . " " All right , " said Bob . " But , " he muttered , " I 'll thrash him all the same , and more than ever , if he ever says anything like that again . " CHAPTER XIV CROWING AFTER VICTORY Greenbank was awake , and the old master had to go . Mr. Weathervane stood up for him as long as he thought that the excitement was temporary . But when he found that Greenbank really was awake , and not just talking in its sleep , as it did for the most part , he changed sides ,  --  not all at once , but by degrees . At first he softened down a little , " hemmed and hawed , " as folks say . He said he did not know but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The next day he took another step , and said that the old master meant well , but he was often too hasty in his temper . The next week he let himself down another peg in saying that " maybe " the old man meant well , but he was altogether too hot in his temper for a school-master . A little while later , he found out that Mr. Ball 's way of teaching was quite out of date . Before a month had elapsed , he was sure that the old curmudgeon ought to be put out , and thus at last Mr. Weathervane found himself where he liked to be , in the popular party . And so the old master came to his last day in the brick school-house . Whatever feelings he may have had in leaving behind him the scenes of his twenty-five years of labor , he said nothing . He only compressed his lips a little more tightly , scowled as severely as ever , removed his books and pens from his desk , gave a last look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the door of the school-house , carried it to Mr. Weathervane , received his pay , and walked slowly home to the house of his brother-in-law , Mr. Higbie . The boys had resolved to have a demonstration . All their pent-up wrath against the master now found vent , since there was no longer any danger that the old man would have a chance to retaliate . They would serenade him . Bob Holliday was full of it . Harry Weathervane was very active . He was going to pound on his mother 's bread-pan . Every sort of instrument for making a noise was brought into requisition . Dinner-bells , tin-pails , conch-shell dinner-horns , tin-horns , and even the village bass-drum , were to be used . Would Jack go ? Bob came over to inquire . All the boys were going to celebrate the downfall of a harsh master . He deserved it for beating Columbus . So Jack resolved to go . But after the boys had departed , Jack began to doubt whether he ought to go or not . It did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the conflict for the old man 's removal , that he had grown to be a bitter partisan , and the recollection of all he had suffered , and of all Columbus had endured during his sickness , reconciled Jack to the appearance of crowing over a fallen foe , which this burlesque serenade would have . Nevertheless , his conscience was not clear on the point , and he concluded to submit the matter to his mother , when she should come home to supper . Unfortunately for Jack , his mother stayed away to tea , sending Jack word that he would have to get his own supper , and that she would come home early in the evening . Jack ate his bowl of bread and milk in solitude , trying to make himself believe that his mother would approve of his taking part in the " shiveree " of the old master . But when he had finished his supper , he concluded that if his mother did not come home in time for him to consult her , he would remain at home . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he longed to be out with the boys . After a while Bob Holliday and Harry Weathervane came to the door and importuned Jack to come with them . It was lonesome at home ; it would be good fun to celebrate the downfall of the old master 's cruel rule , so , taking down an old dinner-bell , Jack went off to join the rest . He was a little disgusted when he found Riley , Pewee , and Ben Berry in the company , but once in the crowd , there was little chance to back out with credit . The boys crept through the back alleys until they came in front of Mr. Higbie 's house , at half past eight o'clock . There was but one light visible , and that was in Mr. Ball 's room . Jack dropped behind , a little faint of heart about the expedition . He felt sure in himself that his mother would shake her head if she knew of it . At length , at a signal from Bob , the tin pans , big and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conch-shell and tin , and the big bass-drum , set up a hideous clattering , banging , booming , roaring , and racketing . Jack rang his dinner-bell rather faintly , and stood back behind all the rest " Jack 's afraid , " said Pewee . " Why do n't you come up to the front , like a man ? " Jack could not stand a taunt like this , but came forward into the cluster of half-frightened peace-breakers . Just then , the door of Mr. Higbie 's house was opened , and some one came out . " It 's Mr. Higbie , " said Ben Berry . " He 's going to shoot . " " It 's Bugbee , the watchman , going to arrest us , " said Pewee . " It 's Mr. Ball himself , " said Riley , " and he 'll whip us all . " And he fled , followed pell-mell by the whole crowd , excepting Jack , who had a constitutional aversion to running away . He only slunk up close to the fence and so stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The voice was not that of Mr. Higbie , nor that of the old master , nor of the watchman , Bugbee . With some difficulty , Jack recognized the figure of Doctor Lanham . " Oh , it 's Jack Dudley , is it ? " said the doctor , after examining him in the feeble moonlight . " Yes , " said Jack , sheepishly . " You 're the one that got that whipping from the old master . I do n't wonder you came out to-night . " " I do , " said Jack , " and I would rather now that I had taken another such whipping than to find myself here . " " Well , well , " said the doctor , " boys will be boys . " " And fools will be fools , I suppose , " said Jack . " Mr. Ball is very ill , " continued the doctor . " Find the others and tell them they must n't come here again to-night , or they 'll kill him . I would n't have had this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the strain he has been under . He has deserved it all , but I think you might let him have a little peace now . " " So do I , " said Jack , more ashamed of himself than ever . The doctor went back into the house , and Jack Dudley and his dinner-bell started off down the street in search of Harry Weathervane and his tin pan , and Bob Holliday and his skillet-lids , and Ben Berry and the bass-drum . " Hello , Jack ! " called out Bob from an alley . " You stood your ground the best of all , did n't you ? " " I wish I 'd stood my ground in the first place against you and Harry , and stayed at home . " " Why , what 's the matter ? Who was it ? " By this time the other boys were creeping out of their hiding-places and gathering about Jack . " Well , it was the doctor , " said Jack . " Mr. Ball 's very sick and we 've ' most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack of cowards to go tooting at a poor old man when he 's already down , and we ought to be kicked , every one of us . That 's the way I feel about it , " and Jack set out for home , not waiting for any leave-taking with the rest , who , for their part , slunk away in various directions , anxious to get their instruments of noise and torment hidden away out of sight . Jack stuck the dinner-bell under the hay in the stable-loft , whence he could smuggle it into the house before his mother should get down-stairs in the morning . Then he went into the house . " Where have you been ? " asked Mrs. Dudley . " I came home early so that you need n't be lonesome . " " Bob Holliday and Harry Weathervane came for me , and I found it so lonesome here that I went out with them . " " Have you got your lessons ? " " No , ma'am , " said Jack , sheepishly . He was evidently not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went off to bed early , and lay awake a good part of the night . The next morning he brought the old dinner-bell and set it down in the very middle of the breakfast-table . Then he told his mother all about it . And she agreed with him that he had done a very mean thing . CHAPTER XV AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT Three times a week the scholars of the " Greenbank Academy " met at the house of Dr. Lanham to receive instruction from Professor Susan , for the school trustees could not agree on a new teacher . Some of the people wanted one thing , and some another ; a lady teacher was advocated and opposed ; a young man , an old man , a new-fashioned man , an old-fashioned man , and no teacher at all for the rest of the present year , so as to save money , were projects that found advocates . The division of opinion was so great that the plan of no school at all was carried because no other could be . So Susan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite a little society , and then it came to an end . One evening , when the lessons were finished , Professor Susan said : " I am sorry to tell you that this is the last lesson I can give . " And then they all said " Aw-w-w-w-w ! " in a melancholy way . " I am going away to school myself , " Susan went on . " My father thinks I ought to go to Mr. Niles 's school at Port William . " " I should n't think you 'd need to go any more , " said Joanna Merwin . " I thought you knew everything . " " Oh , bless me ! " cried Susan . In former days the people of the interior  --  the Mississippi Valley  --  which used then to be called " the West , " were very desirous of education for their children . But good teachers were scarce . Ignorant and pretentious men , incompetent wanderers from New England , who had grown tired of clock-peddling , or tin-peddling , and whose whole stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get places as teachers because teachers were scarce and there were no tests of fitness . Now and then a retired Presbyterian minister from Scotland or Pennsylvania , or a college graduate from New England , would open a school in some country town . Then people who could afford it would send their children from long distances to board near the school , and learn English grammar , arithmetic , and , in some cases , a little Latin , or , perhaps , to fit themselves for entrance to some of the sturdy little country colleges already growing up in that region . At Port William , in Kentucky , there was at this time an old minister , Mr. Niles , who really knew what he professed to teach , and it was to his school that Dr. Lanham was now about to send Susan ; Harvey Collins and Henry Weathervane had already entered the school . But for poor boys like Jack , and Bob Holliday , and Columbus , who had no money with which to pay board , there seemed no chance . The evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long and anxious discussion between Jack Dudley and his mother . " You see , Mother , if I could get even two months in Mr. Niles 's school , I could learn some Latin , and if I once get my fingers into Latin , it is like picking bricks out of a pavement ; if I once get a start , I can dig it out myself . I am going to try to find some way to attend that school . " But the mother only shook her head . " Could n't we move to Port William ? " said Jack . " How could we ? Here we have a house of our own , which could n't easily be rented . There we should have to pay rent , and where is the money to come from ? " " Ca n't we collect something from Gray ? " Again Mrs. Dudley shook her head . But Jack resolved to try the hardhearted debtor , himself . It was now four years since Jack 's father had been persuaded to release a mortgage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised to give other security , but his promise had proved worthless . Since that time he had made lucky speculations and was now a man rather well off , but he kept all his property in his wife 's name , as scoundrels and fraudulent debtors usually do . All that Jack and his mother had to show for the one thousand dollars with four years ' interest due them , was a judgment against Francis Gray , with the sheriff 's return of " no effects " on the back of the writ of execution against the property " of the aforesaid Francis Gray . " For how could you get money out of a man who was nothing in law but an agent for his wife ? But Jack believed in his powers of persuasion , and in the softness of the human heart . He had never had to do with a man in whom the greed for money had turned the heart to granite . Two or three days later Jack heard that Francis Gray , who lived in Louisville , had come to Greenbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Jack went in pursuit of the slippery debtor . He had left town , however , to see his fine farm , three miles away , a farm which belonged in law to Mrs. Gray , but which belonged of right to Francis Gray 's creditors . Jack found Mr. Gray well-dressed and of plausible manners . It was hard to speak to so fine a gentleman on the subject of money . For a minute , Jack felt like backing out . But then he contrasted his mother 's pinched circumstances with Francis Gray 's abundance , and a little wholesome anger came to his assistance . He remembered , too , that his cherished projects for getting an education were involved , and he mustered courage to speak . " Mr. Gray , my name is John Dudley . " Jack thought that there was a sign of annoyance on Gray 's face at this announcement . " You borrowed a thousand dollars of my father once , I believe . " " Yes , that is true . Your father was a good friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sell a piece of property when you were in trouble . " " Yes , your father was a good friend to me . I acknowledge that . I wish I had money enough to pay that debt . It shall be the very first debt paid when I get on my feet again , and I expect to get on my feet , as sure as I live . " " But , you see , Mr. Gray , while my mother is pinched for money , you have plenty . " " It 's all Mrs. Gray 's money . She has plenty . I have n't anything . " " But I want to go to school to Port William . My mother is too poor to help me . If you could let me have twenty-five dollars  --   --  " " But , you see , I ca n't . I have n't got twenty-five dollars to my name , that I can control . But by next New Year 's I mean to pay your mother the whole thousand that I owe her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often Gray had broken such promises , he said : " Do n't you think it a little hard that you and Mrs. Gray are well off , while my mother is so poor , all because you wo n't keep your word given to my father ? " " But , you see , I have n't any money , excepting what Mrs. Gray lets me have , " said Mr. Gray . " She seems to let you have what you want . Do n't you think , if you coaxed her , she would lend you twenty-five dollars till New Year 's , to help me go to school one more term ? " Francis Gray was a little stunned by this way of asking it . For a moment , looking at the entreating face of the boy , he began to feel a disposition to relent a little . This was new and strange for him . To pay twenty-five dollars that he was not obliged by any self-interest to pay , would have been an act contrary to all his habits and to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he fingered his papers a minute in an undecided way , and then he said that he could n't do it . If he began to pay creditors in that way " it would derange his business . " " But , " urged Jack , " think how much my father deranged his business to oblige you , and now you rob me of my own money , and of my chance to get an education . " Mr. Gray was a little ruffled , but he got up and went out of the room . When Jack looked out of the window a minute later , Gray was riding away down the road without so much as bidding the troublesome Jack good-morning . There was nothing for Jack to do but to return to town and make the best of it . But all the way back , the tired and discouraged boy felt that his last chance of becoming an educated man had vanished . He told his mother about his attempt on Mr. Gray 's feelings and of his failure . They discussed the matter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the education he wanted . " I mean to die a-trying , " said Jack , doggedly , as he went off to bed . CHAPTER XVI AN EXPLORING EXPEDITION The next day but one , there came a letter to Mrs. Dudley that increased her perplexity . " Your Aunt Hannah is sick , " she said to Jack , " and I must go to take care of her . I do n't know what to do with you . " " I 'll go to Port William to school , " said Jack . " See if I do n't . " " How ? " asked his mother . " We do n't know a soul on that side of the river . You could n't make any arrangement . " " Maybe I can , " said Jack . " Bob Holliday used to live on the Indiana side , opposite Port William . I mean to talk with him . " Bob was setting onions in one of the onion-patches which abounded about Greenbank , and which were , from March to July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack thought best to wait until the day 's work was finished . Then he sat , where Greenbank boys were fond of sitting , on the sloping top-board of a broad fence , and told his friend Bob of his eager desire to go to Port William . " I 'd like to go , too , " said Bob . " This is the last year 's schooling I 'm to have . " " Do n't you know any house , or any place , where we could keep ' bach ' together ? " " W'y , yes , " said Bob ; " if you did n't mind rowing across the river every day , I 've got a skiff , and there 's the old hewed-log house on the Indianny side where we used to live . A body might stay as long as he pleased in that house , I guess . Judge Kane owns it , and he 's one of the best-hearted men in the country . " " It 's eight miles down there , " said Jack . " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's put out to-morry morning early . Let 's go in the skiff ; we can row and cordelle it up the river again , though it is a job . " Bright and early , the boys started down the river , rowing easily with the strong , steady current of the Ohio , holding their way to Judge Kane 's , whose house was over against Port William . This Judge Kane was an intelligent and wealthy farmer , liked by everybody . He was not a lawyer , but had once held the office of " associate judge , " and hence the title , which suited his grave demeanor . He looked at the two boys out of his small , gray , kindly eyes , hardly ever speaking a word . He did not immediately answer when they asked permission to occupy the old , unused log-house , but got them to talk about their plans , and watched them closely . Then he took them out to see his bees . He showed them his ingenious hives and a bee-house which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , for over these lines the wingless grub of the moth could not crawl . Then he showed them a glass hive , in which all the processes of the bees ' housekeeping could be observed . After that , he took the boys to the old log-house , and pointed out some holes in the roof that would have to be fixed . And even then he did not give them any answer to their request , but told them to stay to dinner and he would see about it , all of which was rather hard on boyish impatience . They had a good dinner of fried chicken and biscuits and honey , served in the neatest manner by the motherly Mrs. Kane . Then the Judge suggested that they ought to see Mr. Niles about taking them into the school . So his skiff was launched , and he rowed with them across the river , which is here about a mile wide , to Port William . Here he introduced them to Mr. Niles , an elderly man , a little bent and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , but with true kindness in his manner . The boys had much pleasure at recess time in greeting their old school-mates , Harvey Collins , Henry Weathervane , and , above all , Susan Lanham , whom they called Professor . These three took a sincere interest in the plans of Bob and Jack , and Susan spoke a good word for them to Mr. Niles , who , on his part , offered to give Jack Latin without charging him anything more than the rates for scholars in the English branches . Then they rowed back to Judge Kane 's landing , where he told them they could have the house without rent , and that they could get slabs and other waste at his little sawmill to fix up the cracks . Then he made kindly suggestions as to the furniture they should bring  --  mentioning a lantern , an ax , and various other articles necessary for a camp life . They bade him good-bye at last , and started home , now rowing against the current and now cordelling along the river shore , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the skiff and steers , while the other walks on the shore , drawing the boat by a rope over the shoulders . The work of rowing and cordelling was hard , but they carried light and hopeful hearts . Jack was sure now that he should overcome all obstacles and get a good education . As for Bob , he had no hope higher than that of worrying through vulgar fractions before settling down to hard work . CHAPTER XVII HOUSEKEEPING EXPERIENCES Mrs. Dudley having gone to Cincinnati the next day to attend her sister , who was ill , Jack was left to make his arrangements for housekeeping with Bob . Each of the boys took two cups , two saucers , two plates , and two knives and forks . Things were likely to get lost or broken , and therefore they provided duplicates . Besides , they might have company to dinner some day , and , moreover , they would need the extra dishes to " hold things , " as Jack expressed it . They took no tumblers , but each was provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jack put in an ax . They did not take much food ; they could buy that of farmers or in Port William . They got a " gang , " or , as they called it , a " trot-line , " to lay down in the river for catfish , perch , and shovel-nose sturgeon , for there was no game-law then . Bob provided an iron pot to cook the fish in , and Jack a frying-pan and tea-kettle . Their bedding consisted of an empty tick , to be filled with straw in Judge Kane 's barn , some equally empty pillow-ticks , and a pair of brown sheets and two blankets . But , with one thing and another , the skiff was well loaded . A good many boys stood on the bank as they embarked , and among them was Columbus , who had a feeling that his best friends were about to desert him , and who would gladly have been one of the party if he could have afforded the expense . In the little crowd which watched the embarkation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made several good suggestions about their method of loading the boat . " But where 's your stove ? " he asked . " Stove ? " said Bob . " We ca n't take a stove in this thing . There 's a big old fire-place in the house that 'll do to cook by . " " But hot weather 's comin ' soon , " said old Hank , " and then you 'll want to cook out in the air , I reckon . Besides , it takes a power of wood for a fire-place . If one of you will come along with me to the tin-shop , I 'll have a stove made for you , of the best paytent-right sort , that 'll go into a skiff , and that wo n't weigh more'n three or four pounds and wo n't cost but about two bits . " Jack readily agreed to buy as good a thing as a stove for twenty-five cents , and so he went with Hank Rathbone to the tin-shop , stopping to get some iron on the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and sharpened at each end . Then the ends were turned down so as to make on each rod two pointed legs of eighteen inches in length , and thus leave two feet of the rod for a horizontal piece . " Now , " said the old hunter , " you drive about six inches of each leg into the ground , and stand them about a foot apart . Now for a top . " Illustration : OLD HANK 'S PLAN FOR A STOVE For this he had a piece of sheet-iron cut out two feet long and fourteen inches wide , with a round kettle-hole near one end . The edges of the long sides of the sheet-iron were bent down to fit over the rods . " Lay that over your rods , " said Hank , " and you 've got a stove two foot long , one foot high , and more than one foot wide , and you can build your fire of chips , instid of logs . You can put your tea-kittle , pot , pipkin , griddle , skillet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man eyed it admiringly . " It 's good for bilin ' , fryin ' , or brilin ' , and all fer two bits . They ai n't many young couples gits set up as cheap as that ! " An hour and a half of rowing downstream brought the boys to the old cabin . The life there involved more hard work than they had expected . Notwithstanding Jack 's experience in helping his mother , the baking of corn-bread , and the frying of bacon or fish were difficult tasks , and both the boys had red faces when supper was on the table . But , as time wore on , they became skilful , and though the work was hard , it was done patiently and pretty well . Between cooking , and cleaning , and fixing , and getting wood , and rowing to school and back , there was not a great deal of time left for study out of school , but Jack made a beginning in Latin , and Bob perspired quite as freely over the addition of fractions as over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the fish off their trot-line in the morning , when there were any on it . Once or twice they allowed themselves to visit an Indian mound or burial-place on the summit of a neighboring hill , where idle boys and other loungers had dug up many bones and thrown them down the declivity . Jack , who had thoughts of being a doctor , made an effort to gather a complete Indian skeleton , but the dry bones had become too much mixed up . He could not get any three bones to fit together , and his man , as he tried to put him together , was the most miscellaneous creature imaginable ,  --  neither man , woman , nor child . Bob was a little afraid to have these human ruins stored under the house , lest he might some night see a ghost with war-paint and tomahawk ; but Jack , as became a boy of scientific tastes , pooh-poohed all superstitions or sentimental considerations in the matter . He told Bob that , if he should ever see the ghost which that framework belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawnee tribe , for there were nearly as many individuals represented as there were bones in the skeleton . The one thing that troubled Jack was that he could n't get rid of the image of Columbus as they had seen him when they left Greenbank , standing sorrowfully on the river bank . The boys often debated between themselves how they could manage to have him one of their party , but they were both too poor to pay the small tuition fees , though his board would not cost much . They could not see any way of getting over the difficulty , but they talked with Susan about it , and Susan took hold of the matter in her fashion by writing to her father on the subject . The result of her energetic effort was that one afternoon , as they came out of school , when the little packet-steamer was landing at the wharf , who should come ashore but Christopher Columbus , in his best but thread-bare clothes , tugging away at an old-fashioned carpet-bag , which was too much for him to carry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad himself off his feet in his joyful welcome , while Jack , finding nothing else to do , stood still and hurrahed . They soon had the dear little spindle-shanks and his great carpet-bag stowed away in the skiff . As they rowed to the north bank of the river , Columbus explained how Dr. Lanham had undertaken to pay his expenses , if the boys would take him into partnership , but he said he was ' most afraid to come , because he could n't chop wood , and he was n't good for much in doing the work . " Never mind , honey , " said Bob . " Jack and I do n't care whether you work or not . You are worth your keep , any time . " " Yes , " said Jack , " we even tried hard yesterday to catch a young owl to make a pet of , but we could n't get it . You see , we 're so lonesome . " " I suppose I 'll do for a pet owl , wo n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile on his meagre face . And as he sat there in the boat , with his big head and large eyes , the name seemed so appropriate that Bob and Jack both laughed outright . But the Pet Owl made himself useful in some ways . I am sorry to say that the housekeeping of Bob and Jack had not always been of the tidiest kind . They were boys , and they were in a hurry . But Columbus had the tastes of a girl about a house . He did not do any cooking or chopping to speak of , but he fixed up . He kept the house neat , cleaned the candlestick every morning , and washed the windows now and then , and as spring advanced he brought in handfuls of wild flowers . The boys declared that they had never felt at home in the old house until the Pet Owl came to be its mistress . He would n't let anything be left around out of place , but all the pots , pans , dishes , coats , hats , books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender furniture , were put in order before school time , so that when they got back in the afternoon the place was inviting and home-like . When Judge Kane and his wife stopped during their Sunday-afternoon stroll , to see how the lads got on , Mrs. Kane praised their housekeeping . " That is all the doings of the Pet Owl , " said Bob . " Pet Owl ? Have you one ? " asked Mrs. Kane . The boys laughed , and Bob explained that Columbus was the pet . That evening , the boys had a box of white honey for supper , sent over by Mrs. Kane , and the next Saturday afternoon Jack and Bob helped Judge Kane finish planting his corn-field . One unlucky day , Columbus discovered Jack 's box of Indian bones under the house , and he turned pale and had a fit of shivering for a long time afterward . It was necessary to move the box into an old stable to quiet his shuddering horror . The next Sunday afternoon , the Pet Owl came in with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter now , Lummy ? " said Jack . " Have you seen any more Indians ? " " Pewee and his crowd have gone up to the Indian Mound , " said Columbus . " Well , let ' em go , " said Bob . " I suppose they know the way , do n't they ? I should like to see them . I 've been so long away from Greenbank that even a yellow dog from there would be welcome . " CHAPTER XVIII GHOSTS Jack and Bob had to amuse Columbus with stories , to divert his mind from the notion that Pewee and his party meant them some harm . The Indian burying-ground was not an uncommon place of resort on Sundays for loafers and idlers , and now and then parties came from as far as Greenbank , to have the pleasure of a ride and the amusement of digging up Indian relics from the cemetery on the hill . This hill-top commanded a view of the Ohio River for many miles in both directions , and of the Kentucky River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know whether the people who can find amusement in digging up bones and throwing them down-hill enjoy scenery or not , but I have heard it urged that even some dumb animals , as horses , enjoy a landscape ; and I once knew a large dog , in Switzerland , who would sit enchanted for a long time on the brink of a mountain cliff , gazing off at the lake below . It is only fair to suppose , therefore , that even these idle diggers in Indian mounds had some pleasure in looking from a hill-top ; at any rate , they were fond of frequenting this one . Pewee , and Riley , and Ben Berry , and two or three others of the same feather , had come down on this Sunday to see the Indian Mound and to find any other sport that might lie in their reach . When they had dug up and thrown away down the steep hill-side enough bones to satisfy their jackal proclivities , they began to cast about them for some more exciting diversion . As there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of the year , they decided to have an egg-supper , and then to wait for the moon to rise after midnight before starting to row and cordelle their two boats up the river again to Greenbank . The fun of an egg-supper to Pewee 's party consisted not so much in the eggs as in the manner of getting them . Every nest in Judge Kane 's chicken-house was rummaged that night , and Mrs. Kane found next day that all the nest-eggs were gone , and that one of her young hens was missing also . About dark , little Allen Mackay , a round-bodied , plump-faced , jolly fellow who lived near the place where the skiffs were landed , and who had spent the afternoon at the Indian Mound , came to the door of the old log-house . " I wanted to say that you fellows have always done the right thing by me . You 've set me acrost oncet or twicet , and you 've always been ' clever ' to me , and I do n't want to see no harm done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some chaps from Greenbank down here , and they 're in for a frolic , and somebody 's hen-roost 'll suffer , I guess ; and they do n't like you boys , and they talked about routing you out to-night . " " Thank you , " said Jack . " Let ' em rout , " said Bob . But the poor little Pet Owl was all in a cold shudder again . About eleven o'clock , King Pewee 's party had picked the last bone of Mrs. Kane 's chicken . It was yet an hour and a half before the moon would be up , and there was time for some fun . Two boys from the neighborhood , who had joined the party , agreed to furnish dough-faces for them all . Nothing more ghastly than masks of dough can well be imagined , and when the boys all put them on , and had turned their coats wrong-side out , they were almost afraid of one another . " Now , " said Riley , " Pewee will knock at the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all rush in and howl like Indians . " " How do Indians howl ? " asked Ben Berry . " Oh , any way  --  like a dog or a wolf , you know . And then they 'll be scared to death , and we 'll just pitch their beds , and dishes , and everything else out of the door , and show them how to clean house . " Riley did n't know that Allen Mackay and Jack Dudley , hidden in the bushes , heard this speech , nor that Jack , as soon as he had heard the plan , crept away to tell Bob at the house what the enemy proposed to do . As the crowd neared the log-house , Riley prudently fell to the rear , and pushed Pewee to the front . There was just the faintest whitening of the sky from the coming moon , but the large apple-trees in front of the log-house made it very dark , and the dough-face crowd were obliged almost to feel their way as they came into the shadow of these trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and the whole party was tittering at the prospect of turning Bob , Jack , and Columbus out of bed and out of doors , they all stopped short and held their breaths . " Good gracious ! Julius Caesar ! sakes alive ! " whispered Riley . " What  --  wh  --  what is that ? " Nobody ran . All stood as though frozen in their places . For out from behind the corner of the house came slowly a skeleton head . It was ablaze inside , and the light shone out of all the openings . The thing had no feet , no hands , and no body . It actually floated through the air , and now and then joggled and danced a little . It rose and fell , but still came nearer and nearer to the attacking party of dough-faces , who for their part could not guess that Bob Holliday had put a lighted candle into an Indian 's skull , and then tied this ghost 's lantern to a wire attached to the end of a fishing-rod , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew close together , and Riley whispered hoarsely : " The house is ha'nted . " Just then the hideous and fiery death's-head made a circuit , and swung , grinning , into Riley 's face , who could stand no more , but broke into a full run toward the river . At the same instant Jack tooted a dinner-horn , Judge Kane 's big dog ran barking out of the log-house , and the enemy were routed like the Midianites before Gideon . Their consternation was greatly increased at finding their boats gone , for Allen Mackay had towed them into a little creek out of sight , and hidden the oars in an elder thicket . Riley and one of the others were so much afraid of the ghosts that " ha'nted " the old house , that they set out straightway for Greenbank , on foot . Pewee and the others searched everywhere for the boats , and at last sat down and waited for daylight . Just as day was breaking , Bob Holliday came down to the river with a towel , as though for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came upon Pewee and his party , all tired out , sitting on the bank in hope that day might throw some light on the fate of their boats . " Hello , Pewee ! You here ? What 's the matter ? " said Bob , with feigned surprise . " Some thief took our skiffs . We 've been looking for them all night , and ca n't find them . " " That 's curious , " said Bob , sitting down and leaning his head on his hand . " Where did you get supper last night ? " " Oh ! we brought some with us . " " Look here , Pewee , I 'll bet I can find your boats . " " How ? " " You give me money enough among you to pay for the eggs and the chicken you had for supper , and I 'll find out who hid your boats and where the oars are , and it 'll all be square . " Pewee was now sure that the boat had been taken as indemnity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party contribute something until he had collected what Bob thought sufficient to pay for the stolen things , and Bob took it and went up and found Judge Kane , who had just risen , and left the money with him . Then he made a circuit to Allen Mackay 's , waked him up , and got the oars , which they put into the boats ; and pushing these out of their hiding-place , they rowed them into the river , delivering them to Pewee and company , who took them gratefully . Jack and Columbus had now made their appearance , and as Pewee got into his boat , he thought to repay Bob 's kindness with a little advice . " I say , if I was you fellers , you know , I would n't stay in that old cabin a single night . " " Why ? " asked Jack . " Because , " said Pewee , " I 've heerd tell that it is ha'nted . " " Ghosts are n't anything when you get used to them , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't you ? " said Pewee , who was now rowing against the current . " No , " said Bob , " nor dough-faces , neither . " CHAPTER XIX THE RETURN HOME As Mr. Niles 's school-term drew to a close , the two boys began to think of their future . " I expect to work with my hands , Jack , " said Bob ; " I have n't got a head for books , as you have . But I 'd like to know a leetle more before I settle down . I wish I could make enough at something to be able to go to school next winter . " " If I only had your strength and size , Bob , I 'd go to work for somebody as a farmer . But I have more than myself to look after . I must help mother after this term is out . I must get something to do , and then learning will be slow business . They talk about Ben Franklin studying at night and all that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the constitution of a Franklin . Still , I 'm going to have an education , by hook or crook . " At this point in the conversation , Judge Kane came in . As usual , he said little , but he got the boys to talk about their own affairs . " When do you go home ? " he asked . " Next Friday evening , when school is out , " said Jack . " And what are you going to do ? " he asked of Bob . " Get some work this summer , and then try to get another winter of schooling next year , " was the answer . " What kind of work ? " " Oh , I can farm better than I can do anything else , " said Bob . " And I like it , too . " And then Judge Kane drew from Jack a full account of his affairs , and particularly of the debt due from Gray , and of his interview with Gray . " If you could get a few hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , living as she does in her own house , you could go to school next winter . " " Yes , and then I could get on after that , somehow , by myself , I suppose , " said Jack . " But the few hundred dollars is as much out of my reach as a million would be , and my father used to say that it was a bad thing to get into the way of figuring on things that we could never reach . " The Judge sat still , and looked at Jack out of his half-closed gray eyes for a minute in silence . " Come up to the house with me , " he said , rising . Jack followed him to the house , where the Judge opened his desk and took out a red-backed memorandum-book , and dictated while Jack copied in his own handwriting the description of a piece of land on a slip of paper . " If you go over to school , to-morrow , an hour earlier than usual , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your memorandum , and find out in whose name that land stands . It is timber-land five miles back , and worth five hundred dollars . When you get the name of the owner , you will know what to do ; if not , you can ask me , but you 'd better not mention my name to anybody in this matter . " Jack thanked Mr. Kane , but left him feeling puzzled . In fact , the farmer-judge seemed to like to puzzle people , or at least he never told anything more than was necessary . The next morning , the boys were off early to Port William . Jack wondered if the land might belong to his father , but then he was sure his father never had any land in Kentucky . Or , was it the property of some dead uncle or cousin , and was he to find a fortune , like the hero of a cheap story ? But when the county clerk , whose office it is to register deeds in that county , took the little piece of paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mortgage-books , and turned the pages awhile , and then wrote " Francis Gray , owner , no incumbrance , " on the same slip with the description , Jack had the key to Mr. Kane 's puzzle . It was now Thursday forenoon , and Jack was eager on all accounts to get home , especially to see the lawyer in charge of his father 's claim against Mr. Gray . So the next day at noon , as there was nothing left but the closing exercises , the three boys were excused , and bade good-bye to their teacher and school-mates , and rowed back to their own side of the river . They soon had the skiff loaded , for all three were eager to see the folks at Greenbank . Jack 's mother had been at home more than a week , and he was the most impatient of the three . But they could not leave without a good-bye to Judge Kane and his wife , to which good-bye they added a profusion of bashful boyish thanks for kindness received . The Judge walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the land . " Do n't say anything about it to me , nor to anybody else but your lawyer , " said Mr. Kane ; " and do not mention my name . You may say to your lawyer that the land has just changed hands , and the matter must be attended to soon . It wo n't stand exposed in that way long . " When the boys were in the boat ready to start , Mr. Kane said to Bob : " You would n't mind working for me this summer at the regular price ? " " I 'd like to , " said Bob . " How soon can you come ? " " Next Wednesday evening . " " I 'll expect you , " said the Judge , and he turned away up the bank , with a slight nod and a curt " Good-bye , " while Bob said : " What a curious man he is ! " " Yes , and as good as he 's curious , " added Jack . It was a warm day for rowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the shelter of a point where the current was not too strong the two rowed and made fair headway , sometimes encountering an eddy which gave them a lift . But whenever the current set strongly toward their side of the river , and whenever they found it necessary to round a point , one of them would leap out on the pebbly beach and , throwing the boat-rope over his shoulder , set his strength against the stream . The rope , or cordelle ,  --  a word that has come down from the first French travellers and traders in the great valley ,  --  was tied to the row-locks . It was necessary for one to steer in the stern while the other played tow-horse , so that each had his turn at rest and at work . After three hours ' toil the wharf-boat of the village was in sight , and all sorts of familiar objects gladdened their hearts . They reached the landing , and then , laden with things , they hurriedly cut across the commons to their homes . As soon as Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that she thought she might afford him one more quarter of school . " No , " said Jack , " you 've pinched yourself long enough for me ; now it 's time I should go to work . If you try to squeeze out another quarter of school for me you 'll have to suffer for it . Besides , I do n't see how you can do it , unless Gray comes down , and I think I have now in my pocket something that will make him come down . " And Jack 's face brightened at the thought of the slip of paper in the pocket of his roundabout . Without observing the last remark , nor the evident elation of Jack 's feelings , Mrs. Dudley proceeded to tell him that she had been offered a hundred and twenty dollars for her claim against Gray . " Who offered it ? " asked Jack . " Mr. Tinkham , Gray 's agent . Maybe Gray is buying up his own debts , feeling tired of holding property in somebody else 's name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The rascal ! I would n't take it , " broke out Jack , impetuously . " That 's just the way I feel , Jack . I 'd rather wait forever , if it was n't for your education . I ca n't afford to have you lose that . I 'm to give an answer this evening . " " We wo n't do it , " said Jack . " I 've got a memorandum here , " and he took the slip of paper from his pocket and unfolded it , " that 'll bring more money out of him than that . I 'm going to see Mr. Beal at once . " Mrs. Dudley looked at the paper without understanding just what it was , and , without giving her any further explanation , but only a warning to secrecy , Jack made off to the lawyer 's office . " Where did you get this ? " asked Mr. Beal . " I promised not to mention his name  --  I mean the name of the one who gave me that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clerk wrote the words : ' Francis Gray , owner , no incumbrance . ' " " I wish I had had it sooner , " said the lawyer . " It will be best to have our judgment recorded in that county to-morrow , " he continued . " Could you go down to Port William ? " " Yes , sir , " said Jack , a little reluctant to go back . " I could if I must . " " I do n't think the mail will do , " added Mr. Beal . " This thing came just in time . We should have sold the claim to-night . This land ought to fetch five hundred dollars . " Mr. Tinkham , agent for Francis Gray , was much disappointed that night when Mrs. Dudley refused to sell her claim against Gray . " You 'll never get anything any other way , " he said . " Perhaps not , but we 've concluded to wait , " said Mrs. Dudley . " We ca n't do much worse if we get nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tinkham said : " I 'll do a little better by you , Mrs. Dudley . I 'll give you a hundred and fifty . That 's the very best I can do . " " I will not sell the claim at present , " said Mrs. Dudley . " It is of no use to offer . " It would have been better if Mrs. Dudley had not spoken so positively . Mr. Tinkham was set a-thinking . Why would n't the widow sell ? Why had she changed her mind since yesterday ? Why did Mr. Beal , the lawyer , not appear at the consultation ? All these questions the shrewd little Tinkham asked himself , and all these questions he asked of Francis Gray that evening . CHAPTER XX A FOOT-RACE FOR MONEY " They 've got wind of something , " said Mr. Tinkham to Mr. Gray , " or else they are waiting for you to resume payment ,  --  or else the widow 's got money from somewhere for her present necessities . " " I do n't know what hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gray , with a laugh . " I 've tangled everything up , so that Beal ca n't find a thing to levy on . I have but one piece of property exposed , and that 's not in this State . " " Where is it ? " asked Tinkham . " It 's in Kentucky , five miles back of Port William . I took it last week in a trade , and I have n't yet made up my mind what to do with it . " " That 's the very thing , " said Tinkham , with his little face drawn to a point ,  --  " the very thing . Mrs. Dudley 's son came home from Port William yesterday , where he has been at school . They 've heard of that land , I 'm afraid ; for Mrs. Dudley is very positive that she will not sell the claim at any price . " " I 'll make a mortgage to my brother on that land , and send it off from the mail-boat as I go down to-morrow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Tinkham . " Beal will have his judgment recorded as soon as the packet gets there . You 'd better go by the packet , get off , and see the mortgage recorded yourself , and then take the mail-boat . " To this Gray agreed , and the next day , when Jack went on board the packet " Swiftsure , " he found Mr. Francis Gray going aboard also . Mr. Beal had warned Jack that he must not let anybody from the packet get to the clerk 's office ahead of him ,  --  that the first paper deposited for record would take the land . Jack wondered why Mr. Francis Gray was aboard the packet , which went no farther than Madison , while Mr. Gray 's home was in Louisville . He soon guessed , however , that Gray meant to land at Port William , and so to head him off . Jack looked at Mr. Gray 's form , made plump by good feeding , and felt safe . He could n't be very dangerous in a foot-race . Jack reflected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a straight-away run when he was fox . He would certainly leave the somewhat puffy Mr. Francis Gray behind . But in the hour 's run down the river , including two landings at Minuit 's and Craig 's , Jack had time to remember that Francis Gray was a cunning man and might head him off by some trick or other . A vague fear took possession of him , and he resolved to be first off the boat before any pretext could be invented to stop him . Meantime , Francis Gray had looked at Jack 's lithe legs with apprehension . " I can never beat that boy , " he had reflected . " My running days are over . " Finding among the deck passengers a young fellow who looked as though he needed money , Gray approached him with this question : " Do you belong in Port William , young man ? " " I do n't belong nowhere else , I reckon , " answered the seedy fellow , with shuffling impudence . " Do you know where the county clerk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the market-house . I can show you the way to the jail , too , if you want to know ; but I s'pose you 've been there many a time , " laughed the " wharf rat . " Gray was irritated at this rudeness , but he swallowed his anger . " Would you like to make five dollars ? " " Now you 're talkin ' interestin ' . Why did n't you begin at that eend of the subjick ? I 'd like to make five dollars as well as the next feller , provided it is n't to be made by too much awful hard work . " " Can you run well ? " " If they 's money at t' other eend of the race I can run like sixty fer a spell . ' Tai n't my common gait , howsumever . " " If you 'll take this paper , " said Gray , " and get it to the county clerk 's office before anybody else gets there from this boat , I 'll give you five dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the paper , drawing a long breath , and looking as though he had discovered a gold mine . " Honor bright , " answered Gray . " You must jump off first of all , for there 's a boy aboard that will beat you if he can . No pay if you do n't win . " " Which is the one that 'll run ag'in ' me ? " asked the long-legged fellow . Gray described Jack , and told the young man to go out forward and he would see him . Gray was not willing to be seen with the " wharf-rat , " lest suspicions should be awakened in Jack Dudley 's mind . But after the shabby young man had gone forward and looked at Jack , he came back with a doubtful air . " That 's Hoosier Jack , as we used to call him , " said the shabby young man . " He an ' two more used to row a boat acrost the river every day to go to ole Niles 's school . He 's a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the whole school out on prisoners ' base , and that he could leave ' em all behind on fox . " " You think you ca n't do it , then ? " asked Gray . " Gim me a little start and I reckon I 'll fetch it . It 's up-hill part of the way and he may lose his wind , for it 's a good half-mile . You must make a row with him at the gang-plank , er do somethin ' to kinder hold him back . The wind 's down stream to-day and the boat 's shore to swing in a little aft . I 'll jump for it and you keep him back . " To this Gray assented . As the shabby young fellow had predicted , the boat did swing around in the wind , and have some trouble in bringing her bow to the wharf-boat . The captain stood on the hurricane-deck calling to the pilot to " back her , " " stop her , " " go ahead on her , " " go ahead on yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , just as the captain was backing the starboard wheel and going ahead on his larboard , so as to bring the boat around right , Mr. Gray turned on Jack . " What are you treading on my toes for , you impudent young rascal ? " he broke out . Jack colored and was about to reply sharply , when he caught sight of the shabby young fellow , who just then leaped from the gunwale of the boat amidships and barely reached the wharf . Jack guessed why Gray had tried to irritate him ,  --  he saw that the well-known " wharf-rat " was to be his competitor . But what could he do ? The wind held the bow of the boat out , the gang-plank which had been pushed out ready to reach the wharf-boat was still firmly grasped by the deck-hands , and the farther end of it was six feet from the wharf , and much above it . It would be some minutes before any one could leave the boat in the regular way . There was only one chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He ran out upon the plank amidst the harsh cries of the deck-hands , who tried to stop him , and the oaths of the mate , who thundered at him , with the stern order of the captain from the upper deck , who called out to him to go back . But , luckily , the steady pulling ahead of the larboard engine , and the backing of the starboard , began just then to bring the boat around , the plank sank down a little under Jack 's weight , and Jack made the leap to the wharf , hearing the confused cries , orders , oaths , and shouts from behind him , as he pushed through the crowd . " Stop that thief ! " cried Francis Gray to the people on the wharf-boat , but in vain . Jack glided swiftly through the people , and got on shore before anybody could check him . He charged up the hill after the shabby young fellow , who had a decided lead , while some of the men on the wharf-boat pursued them both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race Port William had never seen . Windows flew up and heads went out . Small boys joined the pursuing crowd , and dogs barked indiscriminately and uncertainly at the heels of everybody . There were cries of " Hurrah for long Ben ! " and " Hurrah for Hoosier Jack ! " Some of Jack 's old school-mates essayed to stop him to find out what it was all about , but he would not relax a muscle , and he had no time to answer any questions . He saw the faces of the people dimly ; he heard the crowd crying after him , " Stop , thief ! " he caught a glimpse of his old teacher , Mr. Niles , regarding him with curiosity as he darted by ; he saw an anxious look in Judge Kane 's face as he passed him on a street corner . But Jack held his eyes on Long Ben , whom he pursued as a dog does a fox . He had steadily gained on the fellow , but Ben had too much the start , and , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jack to overtake him . One thinks quickly in such moments . Jack remembered that there were two ways of reaching the county clerk 's office . To keep the street around the block was the natural way ,  --  to take an alley through the square was neither longer nor shorter . But by running down the alley he would deprive Long Ben of the spur of seeing his pursuer , and he might even make him think that Jack had given out . Jack had played this trick when playing hound and fox , and at any rate he would by this turn shake off the crowd . So into the alley he darted , and the bewildered pursuers kept on crying " Stop , thief ! " after Long Ben , whose reputation was none of the best . Somebody ahead tried to catch the shabby young fellow , and this forced Ben to make a slight curve , which gave Jack the advantage , so that just as Ben neared the office , Jack rounded a corner out of an alley , and entered ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposited the judgment . " For record , " he gasped . The next instant the shabby young fellow pushed forward the mortgage . " Mine first ! " cried Long Ben . " I 'll take yours when I get this entered , " said the clerk quietly , as became a public officer . " I got here first , " said Long Ben . But the clerk looked at the clock and entered the date on the back of Jack 's paper , putting " one o'clock and eighteen minutes " after the date . Then he wrote " one o'clock and nineteen minutes " on the paper which Long Ben handed him . The office was soon crowded with people discussing the result of the race , and a part of them were even now in favor of seizing one or the other of the runners for a theft , which some said had been committed on the packet , and others declared was committed on the wharf-boat . Francis Gray came in , and could not conceal his chagrin . " I meant to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , severely , " but now you 'll never get a cent out of me . " " I 'd rather have the law on men like you , than have a thousand of your sort of fair promises , " said Jack . " I 've a mind to strike you , " said Gray . " The Kentucky law is hard on a man who strikes a minor , " said Judge Kane , who had entered at that moment . Mr. Niles came in to learn what was the matter , and Judge Kane , after listening quietly to the talk of the people , until the excitement subsided , took Jack over to his house , whence the boy trudged home in the late afternoon full of hopefulness . Gray 's land realized as much as Mr. Beal expected , and Jack studied hard all summer , so as to get as far ahead as possible by the time school should begin in the autumn . CHAPTER XXI THE NEW TEACHER The new teacher who was employed to take the Greenbank school in the autumn was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by the grim-faced Mr. Ball , young Williams looked very mild by contrast . He was evidently a gentle-spirited man as compared with the old master , and King Pewee and his crowd were gratified in noting this fact . They could have their own way with such a master as that ! When he called the school to order , there remained a bustle of curiosity and mutual recognition among the children . Riley and Pewee kept up a little noise by way of defiance . They had heard that the new master did not intend to whip . Now he stood quietly behind his desk , and waited a few moments in silence for the whispering group to be still . Then he slowly raised and levelled his finger at Riley and Pewee , but still said nothing . There was something so firm and quiet about his motion  --  something that said , " I will wait all day , but you must be still "  --  that the boys could not resist it . By the time they were quiet , two of the girls had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aimed at them . The silent man made the pupils understand that he was not to be trifled with . When at length there was quiet , he made every one lay down book or slate and face around toward him . Then with his pointing finger , or with a little slap of his hands together , or with a word or two at most , he got the school still again . " I hope we shall be friends , " he said , in a voice full of kindliness . " All I want is to  --   --  " But at this point Riley picked up his slate and book , and turned away . The master snapped his fingers , but Riley affected not to hear him . " That young man will put down his slate . " The master spoke in a low tone , as one who expected to be obeyed , and the slate was reluctantly put upon the desk . " When I am talking to you , I want you to hear , " he went on , very quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things I have to teach you is good manners . You , " pointing to Riley , " are old enough to know better than to take your slate when your teacher is speaking , but perhaps you have never been taught what are good manners . I 'll excuse you this time . Now , you all see those switches hanging here behind me . I did not put them there . I do not say that I shall not use them . Some boys have to be whipped , I suppose ,  --  like mules ,  --  and when I have tried , I may find that I can not get on without the switches , but I hope not to have to use them . " Here Riley , encouraged by the master 's mildness and irritated by the rebuke he had received , began to make figures on his slate . " Bring me that slate , " said the teacher . Riley was happy that he had succeeded in starting a row . He took his slate and his arithmetic , and shuffled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do you take up your work when I tell you not to ? " asked the new teacher . " Because I did n't want to waste all my morning . I wanted to do my sums . " " You are a remarkably industrious youth , I take it . " The young master looked Riley over , as he said this , from head to foot . The whole school smiled , for there was no lazier boy than this same Riley . " I suppose , " the teacher continued , " that you are the best scholar in school  --  the bright and shining light of Greenbank . " Here there was a general titter at Riley . " I can not have you sit away down at the other end of the school-room and hide your excellent example from the rest . Stand right up here by me and cipher , that all the school may see how industrious you are . " Riley grew very red in the face and pretended to " cipher , " holding his book in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have but just one rule for this school , and I will write it on the blackboard that all may see it . " He took chalk and wrote : DO RIGHT . " That is all . Let us go to our lessons . " For the first two hours that Riley stood on the floor he pretended to enjoy it . But when recess came and went and Mr. Williams did not send him to his seat , he began to shift from one foot to the other and from his heels to his toes , and to change his slate from the right hand to the left . His class was called , and after recitation he was sent back to his place . He stood it as best he could until the noon recess , but when , at the beginning of the afternoon session , Mr. Williams again called his " excellent scholar " and set him up , Riley broke down and said : " I think you might let me go now . " " Are you tired ? " asked the cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Riley hung his head , while the rest smiled . " And are you ready to do what the good order of the school requires ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well ; you can go . " The chopfallen Riley went back to his seat , convinced that it would not do to rebel against the new teacher , even if he did not use the beech switches . But Mr. Williams was also quick to detect the willing scholar . He gave Jack extra help on his Latin after school was out , and Jack grew very proud of the teacher 's affection for him . CHAPTER XXII CHASING THE FOX All the boys in the river towns thirty years ago  --  and therefore the boys in Greenbank , also  --  took a great interest in the steam-boats which plied up and down the Ohio . Each had his favorite boat , and boasted of her speed and excellence . Every one of them envied those happy fellows whose lot it was to " run on the river " as cabin-boys . Boats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines , their speed , their officers , their mishaps , and all the incidents of their history . So it was that from the love of steam-boats , which burned so brightly in the bosom of the boy who lived on the banks of that great and lovely river , there grew up the peculiar game of " boats ' names . " I think the game was started at Louisville or New Albany , where the falls interrupt navigation , and where many boats of the upper and lower rivers are assembled . One day , as the warm air of Indian summer in this mild climate made itself felt , the boys assembled , on the evergreen " bluegrass , " after the snack at the noon recess , to play boats ' names . Through Jack 's influence , Columbus , who did not like to play with the A B C boys , was allowed to take the handkerchief and give out the first name . All the rest stood up in a row like a spelling-class , while little Columbus , standing in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when the name should be guessed . The arm which held the handkerchief was so puny that the boys laughed to see the feeble lad stand there in a threatening attitude . " I say , Lum , do n't hit too hard , now ; my back is tender , " said Bob Holliday . " Give us an easy one to guess , " said Riley , coaxingly . Columbus , having come from the back country , did not know the names of half a dozen boats , and what he knew about were those which touched daily at the wharf of Greenbank . " F  --   --  n , " he said . " Fashion , " cried all the boys at once , breaking into unrestrained mirth at the simplicity that gave them the name of Captain Glenn 's little Cincinnati and Port William packet , which landed daily at the village wharf . Columbus now made a dash at the boys , who were obliged to run to the school-house and back whenever a name was guessed , suffering a beating all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name , though , indeed , the punishment Lum was able to give was very slight . It was doubtful who had guessed first , since the whole party had cried " Fashion " almost together , but it was settled at last in favor of Harry Weathervane , who was sure to give out hard names , since he had been to Cincinnati recently , and had gone along the levee reading the names of those boats that did business above that city , and so were quite unknown , unless by report , to the boys of Greenbank . " A  --   --  A  --   --  s , " were the three letters which Harry gave , and Ben Berry guessed " Archibald Ananias , " and Tom Holcroft said it was " Amanda Amos , " and at last all gave it up ; whereupon Harry told them it was " Alvin Adams , " and proceeded to give out another . " C  --   --  A  --   --  P  --   --  x , " he said next time . " Caps , " said Riley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holliday suggested " Hats and Caps , " and Jack wanted to have it " Boots and Shoes . " But Johnny Meline remembered that he had read of such a name for a ship in his Sunday-school lesson of the previous Sunday , and he guessed that a steam-boat might bear that same . " I know , " said Johnny , " it 's Castor  --   --  " " Oil , " suggested Jack . " No  --  Castor and P , x ,  --  Pollux  --  Castor and Pollux  --  it 's a Bible name . " " You 're not giving us the name of Noah 's ark , are you ? " asked Bob . " I say , boys , that is n't fair a bit , " growled Pewee , in all earnestness . " I do n't hardly believe that Bible ship 's a-going now . " Things were mixed in Pewee 's mind , but he had a vague notion that Bible times were as much as fifty years ago . While he stood doubting , Harry began to whip him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati , last week . She runs to Maysville and Parkersburg , you goose . " After many names had been guessed , and each guesser had taken his turn , Ben Berry had to give out . He had just heard the name of a " lower country " boat , and was sure that it would not be guessed . " C  --   --  p  --   --  r , " he said . " Oh , I know , " said Jack , who had been studying the steam-boat column of an old Louisville paper that very morning , " it 's the  --  the  --  " and he put his hands over his ears , closed his eyes , and danced around , trying to remember , while all the rest stood and laughed at his antics . " Now I 've got it ,  --  the ' Cornplanter ' ! " And Ben Berry whipped the boys across the road and back , after which Jack took the handkerchief . " Oh , say , boys , this is a poor game ; let 's play fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief , let him be the first fox . " So Jack took a hundred yards ' start , and all the boys set out after him . The fox led the hounds across the commons , over the bars , past the " brick pond , " as it was called , up the lane into Moro 's pasture , along the hill-side to the west across Dater 's fence into Betts 's pasture ; thence over into the large woods pasture of the Glade farm . In every successive field some of the hounds had run off to the flank , and by this means every attempt of Jack 's to turn toward the river , and thus fetch a circuit for home , had been foiled . They had cut him off from turning through Moro 's orchard or Betts 's vineyard , and so there was nothing for the fleet-footed fox but to keep steadily to the west and give his pursuers no chance to make a cut-off on him . But every now and then he made a feint of turning , which threw the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture , Jack found himself out of breath , having run steadily for a rough mile and a half , part of it up-hill . He was yet forty yards ahead of Bob Holliday and Riley , who led the hounds . Dashing into a narrow path through the underbrush , Jack ran into a little clump of bushes and hid behind a large black-walnut log . Riley and Holliday came within six feet of him , some of the others passed to the south of him and some to the north , but all failed to discover his lurking-place . Soon Jack could hear them beating about the bushes beyond him . This was his time . Having recovered his wind , he crept out southward until he came to the foot of the hill , and entered Glade 's lane , heading straight for the river across the wide plain . Pewee , who had perched himself on a fence to rest , caught sight of Jack first , and soon the whole pack were in full cry after him , down the long , narrow , elder-bordered lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbed over the high stake-and-rider fence into Betts 's corn-field , and cut off a diagonal to prevent Jack 's getting back toward the school-house . Seeing this movement , Jack , who already had made an extraordinary run , crossed the fence himself , and tried to make a cut-off in spite of them ; but Riley already had got in ahead of him , and Jack , seeing the boys close behind and before him , turned north again toward the hill , got back into the lane , which was now deserted , and climbed into Glade 's meadow on the west side of the lane . He now had a chance to fetch a sweep around toward the river again , though the whole troop of boys were between him and the school-house . Fairly headed off on the east , he made a straight run south for the river shore , striking into a deep gully , from which he came out panting upon the beach , where he had just time to hide himself in a hollow sycamore , hoping that the boys would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run up the river shore for the school-house . But one can not play the same trick twice . Some of the boys stationed themselves so as to intercept Jack 's retreat toward the school-house , while the rest searched for him , beating up and down the gully , and up and down the beach , until they neared the hollow sycamore . Jack made a sharp dash to get through them , but was headed off and caught by Pewee . Just as Jack was caught , and Pewee was about to start homeward as fox , the boys caught sight of two steam-boats racing down the river . The whole party was soon perched on a fallen sycamore , watching first the " Swiftsure " and then the " Ben Franklin , " while the black smoke poured from their chimneys . So fascinated were they with this exciting contest that they stayed half an hour waiting to see which should beat . At length , as the boats passed out of sight , with the " Swiftsure " leading her competitor , it suddenly occurred to Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys looked aghast at one another a moment on hearing him mention this ; then they glanced at the sun , already declining in the sky , and set out for school , trotting swiftly in spite of their fatigue . What would the master say ? Pewee said he did n't care ,  --  it was n't Old Ball , and they would n't get a whipping , anyway . But Jack thought that it was too bad to lose the confidence of Mr. Williams . CHAPTER XXIII CALLED TO ACCOUNT Successful hounds , having caught their fox , ought to have come home in triumph ; but , instead of that , they came home like dogs that had been killing sheep , their heads hanging down in a guilty and self-betraying way . Jack walked into the school-house first . It was an hour and a half past the time for the beginning of school . He tried to look unconcerned as he went to his seat . There stood the teacher , with his face very calm but very pale , and Jack felt his heart sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the awe-stricken girls on the opposite benches , and the little A B C boys , watched the guilty sinners take their places , prepared to meet their fate . Riley came in with a half-insolent smile on his face , as if to say : " I do n't care . " Pewee was sullen and bull-doggish . Ben Berry looked the sneaking fellow he was , and Harry Weathervane tried to remember that his father was a school-trustee . Bob Holliday could n't help laughing in a foolish way . Columbus had fallen out of the race before he got to the " brick-pond , " and so had returned in time to be punctual when school resumed its session . During all the time that the boys , heated with their exercise and blushing with shame , were filing in , Mr. Williams stood with set face and regarded them . He was very much excited , and so I suppose did not dare to reprove them just then . He called the classes and heard them in rapid succession , until it was time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils . On this day , instead of calling the spelling-class , he said , evidently with great effort to control himself : " The girls will keep their seats . The boys will take their places in the spelling-class . " Riley 's lower jaw fell  --  he was sure that the master meant to flog them all . He was glad he was not at the head of the class . Ben Berry could hardly drag his feet to his place , and poor Jack was filled with confusion . When the boys were all in place , the master walked up and down the line and scrutinized them , while Riley cast furtive glances at the dusty old beech switches on the wall , wondering which one the master would use , and Pewee was trying to guess whether Mr. Williams 's arm was strong , and whether he " would make a fellow take off his coat " or not . " Columbus , " said the teacher , " you can take your seat . " Riley shook in his shoes , thinking that this certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , by which to try to lighten his punishment . But the master did not take down his switches . He only talked . But such a talk ! He told the boys how worthless a man was who could not be trusted , and how he had hoped for a school full of boys that could be relied on . He thought there were some boys , at least  --  and this remark struck Jack to the heart  --  that there were some boys in the school who would rather be treated as gentlemen than beaten with ox-goads . But he was now disappointed . All of them seemed equally willing to take advantage of his desire to avoid whipping them ; and all of them had shown themselves unfit to be trusted . Here he paused long enough to let the full weight of his censure enter their minds . Then he began on a new tack . He had hoped that he might have their friendship . He had thought that they cared a little for his good opinion . But now they had betrayed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would succeed in conducting his school without whipping . A good many would be glad to see him fail . Today they would be saying all over Greenbank that the new teacher could n't manage his school . Then he told the boys that while they were sitting on the trunk of the fallen sycamore looking at the steam-boat race , one of the trustees , Mr. Weathervane , had driven past and had seen them there . He had stopped to complain to the master . " Now , " said the master , " I have found how little you care for me . " This was very sharp talk , and it made the boys angry . Particularly did Jack resent any intimation that he was not to be trusted . But the new master was excited and naturally spoke severely . Nor did he give the boys a chance to explain at that time . " You have been out of school , " he said , " one hour and thirty-one minutes . That is about equal to six fifteen-minute recesses  --  to the morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you in at those six recesses to make up the time , and in addition , as a punishment , I shall keep you in school half an hour after the usual time of dismission , for three days . " Here Jack made a motion to speak . " No , " said the master , " I will not hear a word , now . Go home and think it over . To-morrow I mean to ask each one of you to explain his conduct . " With this , he dismissed the school , and the boys went out as angry as a hive of bees that have been disturbed . Each one made his speech . Jack thought it " mean that the master should say they were not fit to be trusted . He would n't have stayed out if he 'd known it was school-time . " Bob Holliday said " the young master was a blisterer , " and then he laughed good-naturedly . Harry Weathervane was angry , and so were all the rest . At length it was agreed that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was better that somebody should write something that should give Mr. Williams a piece of their mind , and show him how hard he was on boys that did n't mean any harm , but only forgot themselves . And Jack was selected to do the writing . Jack made up his mind that the paper he would write should be " a scorcher . " CHAPTER XXIV AN APOLOGY Of course , there was a great deal of talk in the village . The I-told-you-so people were quite delighted . Old Mother Horn " always knew that boys could n't be managed without switching . Did n't the Bible or somebody say : ' Just as the twig is bent the boy 's inclined ? ' And if you do n't bend your twig , what 'll become of your boy ? " The loafers and loungers and gad-abouts and gossips talked a great deal about the failure of the new plan . They were sure that Mr. Ball would be back in that school-house before the term was out , unless Williams should whip a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive him out . Jack told his mother , with a grieved face , how harsh the new master had been , and how he had even said they were not fit to be trusted . " That 's a very harsh word , " said Mrs. Dudley , " but let us make some allowances . Mr. Williams is on trial before the town , and he finds himself nearly ruined by the thoughtlessness of the boys . He had to wait an hour and a half , with half of the school gone . Think how much he must have suffered in that time . And then , to have to take a rebuke from Mr. Weathervane besides , must have stung him to the quick . " " Yes , that 's so , " said Jack , " but then he had no business to take it for granted that we did it on purpose . " And Jack went about his chores , trying to think of some way of writing to the master an address which should be severe , but not too severe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay awake in the night thinking about it , and , at last , when he had cooled off , he came to the conclusion that , as the boys had been the first offenders , they should take the first step toward a reconciliation . But whether he could persuade the angry boys to see it in that light , he did not know . When morning came , he wrote a very short paper , somewhat in this fashion : Mr. Williams : Dear Sir : We are very sorry for what we did yesterday , and for the trouble we have given you . We are willing to take the punishment , for we think we deserve it ; but we hope you will not think that we did it on purpose , for we did not , and we do n't like to have you think so . Respectfully submitted . Jack carried this in the first place to his faithful friend , Bob Holliday , who read it . " Oh , you 've come down , have you ? " said Bob . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did give him a great deal of trouble , and if it had been Mr. Ball , he would have whipped us half to death . " " We should n't have forgot and gone away at that time if Old Ball had been the master , " said Bob . " That 's just it , " said Jack ; " that 's the very reason why we ought to apologize . " " All right , " said Bob , " I 'll sign her , " and he wrote " Robert M. Holliday " in big letters at the top of the column intended for the names . Jack put his name under Bob 's . But when they got to the school-house it was not so easy to persuade the rest . At length , however , Johnny Meline signed it , and then Harry Weathervane , and then the rest , one after another , with some grumbling , wrote their names . All subscribed to it excepting Pewee and Ben Berry and Riley . They declared they never would sign it . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school like convicts . They did n't deserve it . " Jack is a soft-headed fool , " Riley said , " to draw up such a thing as that . I 'm not afraid of the master . I 'm not going to knuckle down to him , either . " Of course , Pewee , as a faithful echo , said just what Riley said , and Ben Berry said what Riley and Pewee said ; so that the three were quite unanimous . " Well , " said Jack , " then we 'll have to hand in our petition without the signatures of the triplets . " " Do n't you call me a triplet , " said Pewee ; " I 've got as much sense as any of you . You 're a soft-headed triplet yourself ! " Even Riley had to join in the laugh that followed this blundering sally of Pewee . When the master came in , he seemed very much troubled . He had heard what had been said about the affair in the town . The address which Jack had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and read it , and immediately a look of pleasure and relief took the place of the worried look he had brought to school with him . " Boys , " he said , " I have received your petition , and I shall answer it by and by . " The hour for recess came and passed . The girls and the very little boys were allowed their recess , but nothing was said to the larger boys about their going out . Pewee and Riley were defiant . At length , when the school was about to break up for noon , the master put his pen , ink , and other little articles in the desk , and the school grew hushed with expectancy . " This apology , " said Mr. Williams , " which I see is in John Dudley 's handwriting , and which bears the signature of all but three of those who were guilty of the offence yesterday , is a very manly apology , and quite increases my respect for those who have signed it . I have suffered much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it does , the manliness of my boys , has given me more pleasure than the offence gave me pain . I ought to make an apology to you . I blamed you too severely yesterday in accusing you of running away intentionally . I take all that back . " Here he paused a moment , and looked over the petition carefully . " William Riley , I do n't see your name here . Why is that ? " " Because I did n't put it there . " Pewee and Ben Berry both laughed at this wit . " Why did n't you put it there ? " " Because I did n't want to . " " Have you any explanation to give of your conduct yesterday ? " " No , sir ; only that I think it 's mean to keep us in because we forgot ourselves . " " Peter Rose , have you anything to say ? " " Just the same as Will Riley said . " " And you , Benjamin ? " " Oh , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fox , and I ran after him , and if he had n't run all over creation and part of Columbia , I should n't have been late . It is n't any fault of mine . I think Jack ought to do the staying in . " " You are about as old a boy as Jack , " said the master . " I suppose Jack might say that if you and the others had n't chased him , he would n't have run ' all over creation , ' as you put it . You and the rest were all guilty of a piece of gross thoughtlessness . All excepting you three have apologized in the most manly way . I therefore remove the punishment from all the others entirely hereafter , deeming that the loss of this morning 's recess is punishment enough for boys who can be so manly in their acknowledgments . Peter Rose , William Riley , and Benjamin Berry will remain in school at both recesses and for a half-hour after school every day for three days  --  not only for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment or apology . " Going home that evening , half an hour after all the others had been dismissed , the triplets put all their griefs together , and resolved to be avenged on Mr. Williams at the first convenient opportunity . CHAPTER XXV KING 'S BASE AND A SPELLING-LESSON As the three who usually gave the most trouble on the playground , as well as in school , were now in detention at every recess , the boys enjoyed greatly their play during these three days . It was at this time that they began to play that favorite game of Greenbank , which seems to be unknown almost everywhere else . It is called " king 's base , " and is full of all manner of complex happenings , sudden surprises , and amusing results . Each of the boys selected a base or goal . A row of sidewalk trees were favorite bases . There were just as many bases as boys . Some boy would venture out from his base . Then another would pursue him ; a third would chase the two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base latest having the right to catch . Just as Johnny Meline was about to lay hold on Jack , Sam Crashaw , having just left his base , gave chase to Johnny , and just as Sam thought he had a good chance to catch Johnny , up came Jack , fresh from having touched his base , and nabbed Sam . When one has caught another , he has a right to return to his base with his prisoner , unmolested . The prisoner now becomes an active champion of the new base , and so the game goes on until all the bases are broken up but one . Very often the last boy on a base succeeds in breaking up a strong one , and , indeed , there is no end to the curious results attained in the play . Jack had never got on in his studies as at this time . Mr. Williams took every opportunity to show his liking for his young friend , and Jack 's quickened ambition soon put him at the head of his classes . It was a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great spelling-class on Friday evenings should go to the foot on Monday , and so work his way up again . There was a great strife between Sarah Weathervane and Jack to see which should go to the foot the oftenest during the term , and so win a little prize that Mr. Williams had offered to the best speller in the school . As neither of them ever missed a word in the lesson , they held the head each alternate Friday evening . In this way the contest bade fair to be a tie . But Sarah meant to win the prize by fair means or foul . One Friday morning before school-time , the boys and girls were talking about the relative merits of the two spellers , Joanna maintaining that Sarah was the better , and others that Jack could spell better than Sarah . " Oh ! " said Sarah Weathervane , " Jack is the best speller in school . I study till my head aches to get my lesson , but it is all the same to Jack whether he studies or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends nearly all his time on arithmetic and Latin . " This speech pleased Jack very much . He had stood at the head of the class all the week , and spelling did seem to him the easiest thing in the world . That afternoon he hardly looked at his lesson . It was so nice to think he could beat Sarah Weathervane with his left hand , so to speak . When the great spelling-class was called , he spelled the words given to him , as usual , and Sarah saw no chance to get the coveted opportunity to stand at the head , go down , and spell her way up again . But the very last word given to Jack was sacrilege , and , not having studied the lesson , he spelled it with e in the second syllable and i in the last . Sarah gave the letters correctly , and when Jack saw the smile of triumph on her face , he guessed why she had flattered him that morning . Hereafter he would not depend on his natural genius for spelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER XXVI UNCLAIMED TOP-STRINGS With a sinking heart , Jack often called to mind that this was his last term at school . The little money that his father had left was not enough to warrant his continuing ; he must now do something for his own support . He resolved , therefore , to make the most of his time under Mr. Williams . When Pewee , Riley , and Ben Berry got through with their punishment , they sought some way of revenging themselves on the master for punishing them , and on Jack for doing better than they had done , and thus escaping punishment . It was a sore thing with them that Jack had led all the school his way , so that , instead of the whole herd following King Pewee and Prime Minister Riley into rebellion , they now " knuckled down to the master , " as Riley called it , under the lead of Jack , and they even dared to laugh slyly at the inseparable " triplets . " The first aim of Pewee and company was to get the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would fix Mr. Williams some time , and gave out to the other boys that they knew where the master spent his evenings , and they knew how to fix him . When Jack heard of this , he understood it . The teacher had a habit of spending an evening , now and then , at Dr. Lanham 's , and the boys no doubt intended to play a prank on him in going or coming . There being now no moonlight , the village streets were very dark , and there was every opportunity for a trick . Riley 's father 's house stood next on the street to Dr. Lanham 's ; the lots were divided by an alley . This gave the triplets a good chance to carry out their designs . But Bob Holliday and Jack , good friends to the teacher , thought that it would be fun to watch the conspirators and defeat them . So , when they saw Mr. Williams going to Dr. Lanham 's , they stationed themselves in the dark alley on the side of the street opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit of leaving Dr. Lanham 's at exactly nine o'clock , and so , just before nine , the three came out of Riley 's yard , and proceeded in the darkness to the fence of Lanham 's dooryard . Getting the trunk of one of the large shade-trees between him and the plotters , Jack crept up close enough to guess what they were doing and to overhear their conversation . Then he came back to Bob . " They are tying a string across the sidewalk on Lanham 's side of the alley , I believe , " whispered Jack , " so as to throw Mr. Williams head foremost into that mud-hole at the mouth of the alley . " By this time , the three boys had finished their arrangements and retreated through the gate into the porch of the Riley house , whence they might keep a lookout for the catastrophe . " I 'm going to cut that string where it goes around the tree , " said Bob , and he crouched low on the ground , got the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street . " I 'll capture the string , " said Jack , walking off to the next cross-street , then running around the block until he came to the back gate of Lanham 's yard , which he entered , running up the walk to the back door . His knock was answered by Mrs. Lanham . " Why , Jack , what 's the matter ? " she asked , seeing him at the kitchen door , breathless . " I want to see Susan , please , " he said , " and tell Mr. Williams not to go yet a minute . " " Here 's a mystery , " said Mrs. Lanham , returning to the sitting-room , where the teacher was just rising to say good-night . " Here 's Jack Dudley , at the back door , out of breath , asking for Susan , and wishing Mr. Williams not to leave the house yet . " Susan ran to the back door . " Susan , " said Jack , " the triplets have tied a string from the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Riley 's porch to see Mr. Williams fall into the mud-hole . Bob is cutting the string at the tree , and I want you to go down along the fence and untie it and bring it in . They will not suspect you if they see you . " " I do n't care if they do , " said Susan , and she glided out to the cross-fence which ran along the alley , followed it to the front and untied the string , fetching it back with her . When she got back to the kitchen door she heard Jack closing the alley gate . He had run off to join Bob , leaving the string in Susan 's hands . Dr. Lanham and the master had a good laugh over the captured string , which was made of Pewee 's and Riley 's top-strings , tied together . The triplets did not see Susan go to the fence . They were too intent on what was to happen to Mr. Williams . When , at length , he came along safely through the darkness , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the middle , " growled Pewee at Riley . " Yes , I did , " said Riley . " He must have stepped over . " " Step over a string a foot high , when he did n't know it was there ? " said Pewee . " Let 's go and get the string , " said Ben Berry . So out of the gate they sallied , and quickly reached the place where the string ought to have been . " I ca n't find this end , " whispered Pewee by the fence . " The string 's gone ! " broke out Riley , after feeling up and down the tree for some half a minute . What could have become of it ? They had been so near the sidewalk all the time that no one could have passed without their seeing him . The next day , at noon-time , when Susan Lanham brought out her lunch , it was tied with Pewee 's new top-string ,  --  the best one in the school . " That 's a very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Pewee 's top-string , " cried Harry Weathervane . " Is it yours , Pewee ? " said Susan , in her sweetest tones . " No , " said the king , with his head down ; " mine 's at home . " " I found this one , last night , " said Susan . And all the school knew that she was tormenting Pewee , although they could not guess how she had got his top-string . After a while , she made a dive into her pocket , and brought out another string . " Oh , " cried Johnny Meline , " where did you get that ? " " I found it . " " That 's Will Riley 's top-string , " said Johnny . " It was mine . He cheated me out of it by trading an old top that would n't spin . " " That 's the way you get your top-strings , is it , Will ? Is this yours ? " asked the tormenting Susan . " No , it is n't . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-strings across the sidewalk at night . You 're a gentleman , you are ! Come , Johnny , this string does n't belong to anybody ; I 'll trade with you for that old top that Will gave you for a good string . I want something to remember honest Will Riley by . " Johnny gladly pocketed the string , and Susan carried off the shabby top , to the great amusement of the school , who now began to understand how she had come by the two top-strings . CHAPTER XXVII THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL , AND THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE STORY It was the last day of the spring term of school . With Jack this meant the end of his opportunity for going to school . What he should learn hereafter he must learn by himself . The money was nearly out , and he must go to work . The last day of school meant also the expiration of the master 's authority . Whatever evil was done after school-hours on the last day was none of his business . All who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could revenge themselves without being called to account by the master the next day . The last day of school had no to-morrow to be afraid of . Hence , Pewee and his friends proposed to square accounts on the last day of school with Jack Dudley , whom they hated for being the best scholar , and for having outwitted them more than once . It was on the first day of June that the school ended , and Mr. Williams bade his pupils good-bye . The warm sun had by this time brought the waters of the Ohio to a temperature that made bathing pleasant , and when the school closed , all the boys , delighted with liberty , rushed to the river for a good swim together . In that genial climate one can remain in the water for hours at a time , and boys become swimmers at an early age . Just below the village a raft was moored , and from this the youthful swimmers were soon diving into the deep water like frogs . Every boy who could perform any feat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and then dive from one side of the raft to another , one could float , and another swim on his back , while a third was learning to tread water . Some were fond of diving toes downward , others took headers . " The little fellows " who could not swim kept on the inside of the great raft and paddled about with the aid of slabs used for floats . Jack , who had lived for years on the banks of the Wildcat , could swim and dive like a musquash . Mr. Williams , the teacher , felt lonesome at saying good-bye to his school ; and to keep the boys company as long as possible , he strolled down to the bank and sat on the grass watching the bathers below him , plunging and paddling in all the spontaneous happiness of young life . Riley and Pewee  --  conspirators to the last  --  had their plans arranged . When Jack should get his clothes on , they intended to pitch him off the raft for a good wetting , and thus gratify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing joke about dough-faces and ghosts which the town had at their expense . Ben Berry , who was their confidant , thought this a capital plan . When at length Jack had enjoyed the water enough , he came out and was about to begin dressing . Pewee and Riley were close at hand , already dressed , and prepared to give Jack a farewell ducking . But just at that moment there came from the other end of the raft , and from the spectators on the bank , a wild , confused cry , and all turned to hearken . Harry Weathervane 's younger brother , whose name was Andrew Jackson , and who could not swim , in dressing , had stepped too far backward and gone off the raft . He uttered a despairing and terrified scream , struck out wildly and blindly , and went down . All up and down the raft and up and down the bank there went up a cry : " Andy is drowning ! " while everybody looked for somebody else to save him . The school-master was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly slipped off his boots , but then he stopped , for Jack had already started on a splendid run down that long raft . The confused and terrified boys made a path for him quickly , as he came on at more than the tremendous speed he had always shown in games . He did not stop to leap , but ran full tilt off the raft , falling upon the drowning boy and carrying him completely under water with him . Nobody breathed during the two seconds that Jack , under water , struggled to get a good hold on Andy and to keep Andy from disabling him by his blind grappling of Jack 's limbs . When at length Jack 's head came above water , there was an audible sigh of relief from all the on-lookers . But the danger was not over . " Let go of my arms , Andy ! " cried Jack . " You 'll drown us both if you hold on that way . If you do n't let go I 'll strike you . " Jack knew that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him , where he persisted in clutching his deliverer . But poor frightened Andy let go of Jack 's arms at last . Jack was already exhausted with swimming , and he had great difficulty in dragging the little fellow to the raft , where Will Riley and Pewee Rose pulled him out of the water . But now , while all were giving attention to the rescued Andy , there occurred with Jack one of those events which people call a cramp . I do not know what to call it , but it is not a cramp . It is a kind of collapse  --  a sudden exhaustion that may come to the best of swimmers . The heart insists on resting , the consciousness grows dim , the will-power flags , and the strong swimmer sinks . Nobody was regarding Jack , who first found himself unable to make even an effort to climb on the raft ; then his hold on its edge relaxed , and he slowly sank out of sight . Pewee saw his sinking condition first , and cried out , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , but running up and down the raft in a vain search for a rope or a pole . The school-master , having seen that Andy was brought out little worse for his fright and the water he had swallowed , was about to put on his boots when this new alarm attracted his attention to Jack Dudley . Instantly he threw off his coat and was bounding down the steep bank , along the plank to the raft , and then along the raft to where Jack had sunk entirely out of sight . Mr. Williams leaped head first into the water and made what the boys afterward called a splendid dive . Once under water he opened his eyes and looked about for Jack . At last he came up , drawing after him the unconscious and apparently lifeless form of Jack , who was taken from the water by the boys . The teacher despatched two boys to bring Dr. Lanham , while he set himself to restore consciousness by producing artificial breathing . It was some time after Dr. Lanham 's arrival that Jack fully regained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong arms of Bob Holliday , Will Riley , and Pewee , in turn . Illustration : BOB HOLLIDAY CARRIES HOME HIS FRIEND . And here I must do the last two boys the justice to say that they called to inquire after Jack every day during the illness that followed , and the old animosity to Jack was never afterward revived by Pewee and his friends . On the evening after this accident and these rescues , Dr. Lanham said to Mrs. Lanham and Susan and Mr. Williams , who happened to be there again , that a boy was wanted in the new drug-store in the village , to learn the business , and to sleep in the back room , so as to attend night-calls . Dr. Lanham did not know why this Jack Dudley would n't be just the boy . Susan , for her part , was very sure he would be ; and Mr. Williams agreed with Susan , as , indeed , he generally did . Dr. Lanham thought that Jack might be allowed to attend school in the daytime in the winter season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he seemed to have , there was no reason why he should n't come to something some day . " Come to something ! " said Susan . " Come to something ! Why , he 'll make one of the best doctors in the country yet . " And again Mr. Williams entirely agreed with Susan , Jack Dudley was sure to go up to the head of the class . Jack got the place , and I doubt not fulfilled the hope of his friends . I know this , at least , that when a year or so later his good friend and teacher , Mr. Williams , was married to his good and stanch friend , Susan Lanham , Jack 's was one of the happiest faces at the wedding .
