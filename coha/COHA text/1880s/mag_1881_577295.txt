A FLORENTINE FAMILY IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY . DETAILS of personal traits and domestic life have an inexpressible charm for all readers of average human sympathies . We turn with more relief than we are willing to confess from the brilliant generalizations of the historian to the pages of the humble chronicler or diarist ; and what the French modestly call " m*inoires pour servir " are indeed often of more real use as well as entertainment to posterity than the works by which in their own time they were overshadowed . In all that has been written of the // public and social life of the Italians , we find few details of their family habits . One reason of this is , of course , that the social life of the Latin races does not centre in the kome , as does that of those nations whom necessities of climate - quite as much , perhaps , as nobler reasons - have driven to domesticity . The Italian does not bring the stranger , to whom he wishes to be courteous , home with him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at the eaf6 , or strolls with him in the park . If he does introduce him , as a rare favor , within his domestic precincts , it is only after due preparation , and in such a manner that the spontaneousness of hospitality has had time to congeal into the solemnity of a public occasion . He does , indeed , invite the chance visitor at the hour of a repast , to " favor him " by reInaining to partake of it ; but he does so when the visitor is already at the door , and would be as much surprised at his assent as would the Spaniard by the acceptance of the possessions which he lays at your feet . We of the North smile at these gracious insincerities ; but the Southerner wonders no less at the blunt , unsmiling positiveness which he calls rudeness ; at the want of general sympathy which shuts up all our demon*trativeness within closed doors ; at the solemn faces with which we go about both our work and our recreation . Those who are curious to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the life of the female members of the household , will find much of interest in the Letters of Alessandra Macinghi , the widow of Matteo Strozzi , to her exiled sons , and it is to them that I am principally indebted for the materials used in the following sketch . These Letters were compiled and published by Cesare Guasti in 1877 , but , so far as 1 know , they have never been translated . The writer was the mother of that Filippo Strozzi who founded the grand old palace , in the Via 673 Tornabuoni , which is the admiration of every visitor to Florence . His bust , by Benedetto da Majano , adorns one of its dim , vast salons ; but I have sought there in vain for any memorial of the mother to whom he owed so much , and for whom he always manifested a tender affection . She died long before he had thought of building a house for his posterity ; and her best record is in these simple letters to her sons . At the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow . Her husband , who was a man of much culture and studious habits , had mixed somewhat extensively in politics , and shown more good faith than astuteness during the exile of Cosimo de ' Medici . When the latter was recalled , Matteo Strozzi , with many others of the principal families in Florence , suffered the penalty of exile . He went to Pesaro , and died there in less than a year . It was a time of tribulation in many a Florentine household , from which the husband and father was torn away , while the wife was obliged to remain to guard her children 's inheritance . Most touching is the picture which the biographer of Alessandra de ' Bardi gives of her husband 's going forth into exile , to which his father and hers had previously been condemned . " I am left , " cries out the desolate wife , " without a helper ; and I must go to and fro wearily , beseeching this one and that one of the authorities for the preservation of our goods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ da Bisticci can not pluise Alessandra de ' Bardi enough for her courage , prudence , and fortitude in the most trying circumstances ; and though Alessandra Strozzi had no biographer , the simple story of her life as shown in this correspondence gives evidence of what she endured and accomplished . She was only twentynine at the time of her husband 's death , and had borne him seven children . Alessandra had accompanied her husband A Florentine Family in the Fifteenth Century . // to Pesaro , being more fortunate than many of her friends in that she was able to do so ; but the comparative happiness which the exiled family might have thus enjoyed was of short duration . In the course of a few months her husband and three of her children died , - as it would appear , all of a pestilential disease then raging ; and the afflicted widow hastened to return with her surviving children to Florence , where she soon gave birth to a son , who was , she says , the " very image " of her lost husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining son , Filippo , had been sent , while quite young , to serve an apprenticeship in mercantile affairs with an old friend of his father 's at Palermo ; whence he went to a cousin of his father 's at Naples , who was doing a prosperous business , and who showed much interest in the welfare of the orphaned family . Lorenzo , the second son , was at Avignon ; and Alessandra 's letters are addressed to these absent children . The first one , dated August 4 , 1447 , brings the family before us at an interesting moment . The eldest daughter , Caterina , is about to be married to " a good and virtuous youth , twenty-five years old , a silk merchant , " and of honorable position . The mother congratulates herself that she is well disposed of , for " she is sixteen years of age , and it is high time she was married " ! Though by giving a larger dowry a more noble husband might have been procured , still , in the circumstances , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousand forms which were at her disposition , than to wait till she could accumulate four or five hundred more . Nor had she reason to regret her choice . Marco Parenti proved to be a loving husband and a man of consideration in the community . He arrived at the dignity of podesta , or mayor , of Colle , in the district of Florence , and his letters show him to have been a wise and kindly man . Caterina was , in her mother 's opinion , " the prettiest girl in Florence ; " nevertheless , she had a girl 's desire to enhance her attractions ; and her mother begs , in her name , that if Filippo can send her a certain kind of soap , or a wash , " or any other beautifier , " he will do it . She enlarges on the gifts of the bridegroom , who was indeed most liberal . He was a methodical man , and to this trait we owe a list of his gifts , which he noted down in a new memorandum book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of God , and his virgin mother , holy Mary ; and of St. Michael , angel and archangel ; and St. John the Baptist , and St. John the Evangelist , and St. Paul , and St. Peter , and St. Mark , and St. Mary Magdalen , and St. Catherine , and all the apostles and evangelists and saints of God : and may the beginning and continuation and end of this book be to their glory ; and of their mercy may they give me grace that what I shall write in it may be for good to my soul , and body , and estate . " Among the gifts we may notice only a few , as indicative of the fashions of the period : A dress of white damask , trimmed with marten fur ; a dress of light blue stuff , with sleeves of Alexandrian velvet ; seventeen embroidered chemises ; ten towels ; thirty handkerchiefs ; one baccio of white damask ; a prayer-book ; two strings of large coral ; six silk , caps ; three needle cases ; two ivory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose ; a dress of crimson satin and velvet brocade , trimmed with white fur ; an overdress of the same , with trimmings of gold and pearls ; a garland of peacock tails , mounted in silver , with pearls , gilt leaves , and enameled flowers ; a girdle of crimson shot with gold , with clasps of silver gilt ; a gold shoulder ornament , with two sapphires and three pearls ; a collar of pearls . Such gifts must have satisfied even the beautiful and beauty-loving Cate // rina . And doubtless the trousseau was proportionately elegant . Its value was counted as a part of the dowry , and it bad been preparing under the diligent care of the mother ever since the bride was an infant . An Italian woman 's marriage portion of household linen , as well as of under-clothing , is usually sufficient to last her for life . Luxury in dress , which had been severely repressed by sumptuary laws in 1330 , was on the increase at this time , thougb it did not reach its highest point until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentine women at this period was a robe of silk or woolen stuff extending to the ground , and trimmed with fringe ; the waist long , and the sleeves usually of the same material as the dress . The hair was worn in curls , and over it a veil of white silk reaching to the shoulders ; the " baccio of white damask , " in the above list , being for this purpose . The garland , or diadem , was of course for state occasions . Marco Parenti and Caterina , as was the custom , had been formally betrothed in church , a few months before the time fixed for the marriage . When the arrangements for the latter were completed , the " giving of the ring , " as the marriage ceremony was called , took place , also in church , and on the following day the bride was conducted by her friends to the house of the bridegroom , where the wedding feast was eaten , which in Marco 's case was splendid and abundant . During this repast there was music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the mother 's rejoicing at her daughter 's settlement in life was shadowed by the fear of an approaching separation from her youngest son , Matteo , who was peculiarly dear to her . Filippo and his employer had been urging her to send him to them at Naples , and she seems to have felt that it was an opening for him not to be neglected ; hut , she writes , " I can not send him just yet ; though he is young , he is great company for me , and I do not know how to spare him . He has learned to read , and begins to write , and I shall put him to learning accounts this winter ; then we will see what is to be done with him , and may God give him the wisdom he needs . " Fiippo , as the head of the family , was already beginning to be ambitious for its advantage , and to have much influenc with his mother . She yielded at last z bis wishes , and prepared to send Matteo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enumerates with a mother 's fondness its items . He has a mantle of the Naples fashion , a robe and a waistcoat of violet color , fine slippers , shirts , silver-handled knives , etc . But when he is all ready to set out she is deterred by her fears and the advice of friends . " I am continually told that I ought not to let him go now in this heat , and with the pestilence which is prevailing everywhere ... . I am sure he would not get to Naples without being ill , for I know his constitution ; and if anything should happen to him you would be disappointed , and I should never be happy again . " But the next winter she had no longer an excuse for keeping him , and with much sorrow she let him depart . Such good accounts of him come to her from his employers that she is half consoled ; but her maternal heart still yearns over him , and she begs Fiippo , if he needs correction , " on no account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Was there a presentiment in Alessandra 's mind that the precocious and beloved boy would soon be taken from life ? If so , she seems to have forgotten it in his successes , and she playfully chides him for his forgetfulness to write her when he was already lying upon his death-bed . In July , 1459 , he was seized with a fever which was epidemic in Naples , and died after a few weeks ' illness . A letter of Marco Parenti to Filippo shows us the heart-stricken mother in the midst of // friends and relations who have gradually broken to her the sad news . There are " Francesco and Battista degli Strozzi , and Madonna Caterina , and Madonna Nannina de ' iNeri , and other women , who have told her the sorrowful tidings in the gentlest way they could . " When the first bitterness of her grief was passed , Alessandra writes a most touching let-. ter to Filippo . " We are reduced to a small number , " she says , " but I pacify myself , considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his grace and mercy , he preserves to me you my remaining sons , I will not complain . All my anxiety is that you should profit by this affliction . I know well that it has grieved you , but do not let it make you ill ; for we have nothing to reproach ourselves with in regard to the care taken of Matteo , and it was the will of God that he should escape from the troubles of this sorrowful world . " Then , again , her grief overcomes her , and she cries out , " I would that I had not asked anybody 's counsel , but had done what I was inclined to do ! For then I might have been in time to see and touch my sweet son while he was yet alive ; and it would have been a comfort to me , and to you , and to him . I will believe that all was for the best . " She gives him advice how to take care of his health , and begs him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! we must leave them all . Do you think I want to hear that you are laying up wealth , and wearing yourself out for it , by so much toil and anxiety ? " We have anticipated , in following to its end the story of Matteo 's short life . In 1451 Madonna Alessandra married her younger daughter , Alessandra , to Giovanni Bonsi ; but this time , though the dowry was equal in value to Caterina 's , there is nothing said about the wedding or the gifts . Bonsi was twenty years older than his bride , and in family and fortune inferior to the husband of Caterina , but the mother calls him " a virtuous and good man . " In the only letter of his which is given , he begs his brother-in-law not to address him in the third person , because he does not merit that mark of respect , but especially because it would make his wife think that Filippo considered him too old for her . Lorenzo , the second son of Madonna Alessandra , was the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prudence of Filippo nor the sweet disposition of Matteo , and was a spendthrift and a gambler . In 1452 he is in his uncle 's bank in Binges , and his mother is very much distressed at the accounts she receives of him , and writes to him with what is , for her , unusual severity . He was at this time twenty years old , and had been away from home seven years . " From what I hear about you , " says Madonna Alessandra , " I gather that you are more ready to throw away money than to save it , which is the contrary of what ought to be . And I see that you are bringing harm and shame both upon yourself and upon us ; that your habits are not good , and that you do not heed reproof , which is a bad sign , and makes me repent of all my confidence in you . I do not know how you can persist in your willful ways , knowing , first , that they displease God , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear of your failures in duty , and the injury and shame which come of it I leave you to consider ; and you also give great offense to your uncle Jacob . If you had but just begun there would be some hope , but now for years you have been going on in ways that are not good , and you have been borne with for my sake . But I think , if you do not change your behavior , my entreaties for you will no longer avail . Let this warning suffice . Be wise , for it is your duty and for your advantage .... Remember , and do not cast my reproofa behind your back , for they are given with love and tears , and // 677 I pray God that he may incline you to do what I desire . " Whether or not these admonitions had effect , we have no means of knowing , for there is an interval of five years between this and the next letter which has been preserved . We find that in 1458 Lorenzo had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was able he came to Florence for a brief visit . A few months after his return to Bruges , a law was passed which condemned the sons of exiles to twenty-five years ' banishment from Florence , forbidding them to approach within fifty miles of its territory , or to write letters on other than private affairs . This was a terrible blow to Madonna Alessandra , whose life was bound up in her sons ; and also to Filippo , whose thoughts and hopes constantly reverted to the home of his fathers . He begs his mother to come and live with her sons ( there being a plan to put Lorenzo under Filippo 's care ) , " which would be a great comfort to all . " She was strongly tempted to consent ; but after reflection , the consideration that she could further their advantage by remaining at Florence to care for their affairs , and the hope , which never left her , that sooner or later they would be permitted to return thither , decided her not to " change her country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . " Many things are brought about by time , " was her favorite maxim , proved by the changes she had already witnessed . Whether she was a partisan of the Medici or not , she does not openly say ; indeed , when all letters were likely to be inspected , it was not prudent to write of one 's political preferences , and for much of the correspondence , even about private affairs , she felt obliged to have recourse to cipher . Probably , as Professor Guasti observes , she would have preferred that government which would give her back her sons . She was farseeing enough to perceive that the Medici were likely to increase in power , and one of the few allusions to this is in these words to Lorenzo : " Remember that the adherents of the Medici have uniformly prospered , and the contrary has happened to those of the Pazzi , who have always been undone . Be advised . " Her sons acquiesced in the wisdom of her decision , and kept up , by rare meetings outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , as much intercourse as was possible in those days , when the procaccia , or carrier , took two weeks for the journey from Florence to Naples . Lorenzo , under the watchful care of his elder brother , seems to have laid aside his youthful follies and vices ; at any rate , there are no more reproofs or regrets expressed in regard to him in his mother 's letters . Her great anxiety is to see Filippo well married , and she charges herself with finding a wife for him . As early as 1450 she had written to him about it : " If God prolongs my life a few years , and your sister Alessandra is out of the way , I will furnish the house with linen , so that you will be well supplied ; for , in truth , while there are daughters in the house , one can do nothing but for them ; but when she is out of it , I shall be free to work for you , my sons . When I shall have got the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make up your mind to come home ; for it is now so that you would not be ashamed of it , and could honorably entertain a friend who might happen to come to you ; but in two or three years it will be much better furnished . And I do want to give you a wife ; for you are now of an age to know how to govern a family , and it will be a consolation to me ; I have no other from whom to hope for it but you children : therefore , may God of his mercy grant me the favor I long for . " Filippo does not enter enthusiastically into his mother 's matrimonial plans for him . He makes an excuse of his // being an exile , and again of being well enough off as he is ; his mother returns to the subject again and again , sometimes with raillery , and sometimes with pleading . Her friends have suggested several damsels , but the exacting mother is not entirely satisfied with them . She thinks she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we should take the first thing that comes to hand . " In time Filippo gives his consent to her search , though still without any wish to hasten the matter , and he appears to have been quite willing to leave the choice of a wife altogether to Madonna Alessandra . She is much inclined to the daughter of Messer Francesco Tanagli , as " it would be a good alliance , and of all that have been offered she seems to have the best qualities . " " The one from Yernio pleased me , but she is awkward and countrified , they say . " " I have heard that a daughter of the Alberti is very beautiful ; and I will try to see her during these festival days , and find out whether her father would give her to us . " " We will have a number of them on hand , so that when the time comes we can pick out the best one . May God show us the right one . " " I write to let you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duomol for the early mass , as I have gone several mornings , to try and get a look at Adimari 's daughter , who is in the habit of attending that mass , by chance I found Tanagli 's daughter , there . iNot knowing who she was , I placed myself near her , and considered her well . She seemed to me to be beautiful and well made ; as large as Caterina , or larger ; of good complexion , - none of these pale ones , but as if she was in health . Her face is rather long , and her features are not particularly delicate , but not at all ordinary ; and by her walk and her whole appearance one could see that she is not by any means dull addormentata . In fact , it seemed to me that if her other qualities are satisfactory she would not be a bad bargain , but an honorable one . I followed her out of church , and learned that she was a Tanagli . As to the Adiman girl , I never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has not been out as usual ; and while I was looking for her , behold , this one came along , who does not generally go to mass at this hour . I believe God brought her before me in order that I should look at her , since I had no expectation of seeing her there . " Afterwards , however , when she does get a look at the daughter of Messer Adiman , this indication of Providence seems to have been forgotten , as it was she who ultimately became Filippo 's bride . Still another young and lovely creature attracts attention , as she is saying her prayers ; but becoming aware of Madonna Alessandra 's scrutiny , and probably divining the reason of it , as soon as the service is over she " rushes out of church like the wind . " One may see the same scenes enacted in the same place to-day ; nor , in the families who preserve the old aristocratic traditions , do the young people have much more voice in their own marriage arrangements than they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable to both families , and the bride 's dowry is satisfactory , the thing is settled by the elders , and rarely opposed by the youth or the maiden . If they fall in love with each other , so much the better ; if not , unless there is open repugnance *n the part of one or the other , it is not of great consequence . This is not parental tyranny , but custom ; and nowhere is custom more honored than in Italy . The girl of sixteen comes home from her convent school , and is presented to her future husband ; dazzled by the new world opening before her , - the social life , the gifts , the trousseau , - she is a married woman before she has had time to accustom herself to the change from her former monotonous childhood . When her heart awakes , she is already in bonds . But better is even // an unhappy marriage , in this traditional acceptation , than single life for a woman ; and indeed the conventionalities which forbid the unmarried woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out alone , or to lead an independent existence in any way , make her case very different from that of her sisters in England and America , and drive her not unfrequently to a conventual life as preferable to that which she would lead at home . It seems to have been in the times of which we are speaking as in those which Machiavelli depicts in his Belphegor , - " there were many noble citizens who had plenty of daughters and but little money , " - and Madonna Alessandra complains that " those who have other recommendations are not beautiful . " " As for me , " she says , " I do n't want to have these frights in my sight , for it is little pleasure one gets from having them in the house ! " With all her wisdom , she had a keen appreciation of externals ; and she was anxious that Filippo , on his part , should do all possible honor to his future bride . She wants his corbeille to be worthy of his name and his means ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of dress and ornaments . " If the affair turns out well , as I trust it will , it will be necessary for us to do things proportionably well , for I should be proud to see your bride beautiful and beautifully adorned . And I would not have her poorer than others as to jewels . Jewels are things which you can afford to give her , and I know that you can be well supplied with them at Naples , so that you need not be parsimonious about them . If clothes are not trimmed with pearls , they must have some other trimming which costs just as much , and is money thrown away . So if you spend money for what is useful , I shall encourage you . " Still Filippo delays to show any active interest in the matter , and at last his mother gets quite out of patience with him . " It seems to me you are very much afraid to take a wife , and I must say that you show little steadfastness of purpose ; for since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come into your mind . " " You will see that the thing is not so bad as it looks . You ask if I do not think you might wait a year or two longer . I tell you , frankly , no . " It is much to be regretted that from 1465 to 1468 we have no letters , for these must have been three of the most important and joyful years of Madonna Alessandra 's life . In them her two chief desires were fulfilled , the return of her sons from exile , and the marriage of Filippo . The sentence of banishment was annulled after the downfall of Luca Pitti and his party . Filippo came to Florence in 1466 , and almost immediately married the beautiful and good Fiammetta degli Adimari . She was of one of the best families in Florence , and brought her husband a large dowry . In the first letter that is extant after this interval , Filippo has returned to Naples for a time , and Fiammetta is with her mother-in-law . She has already two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , by their presence . " You say , " she writes to her son , " that you need not recommend Fiammetta to my care , and you say truly ; for I do for her even more than I would for an own child . And I also take care of little Alfonso as much as I can . But he is a terrible child ; he is always falling into rages ; and he is very thin , but nevertheless strong . Lucrezia the infant is a fine child , and resembles Fiammetta : she is fair , like her , and similarly made , and is bigger than Alfonso was . at her age . May God give her a long life . " " When Madonna Antonia comes* back , we will try to have her stay with us , and pay her all the honors we can . * for Fiammetta will then be up ago*in* . It would be no trouble to me to do* anything , if I were stronger ; but I aim no longer as I was last winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease of life . I was ill all Holy Week and over Easter ; then I took medicine , but it did not do me much good . I am old , and when I think I shall be better I grow worse ; and so it will go on to the end . If I have not written you as often as I wished , it has been because , first , I have not felt well , and then I have had a great deal to do . Fiammetta 's baby was born , people were always running in and out , and everything came upon me . If I had no other hindrance than Alfonso , that would be enough ; but it is a pleasant one . He is always running after me , . like the chicken after the hen . " The mother is growing old , but she still keeps the guidance of family affairs in her hands , even with her married children , after the Italian fashion unto this day . Fiammetta is invited to the marriage of Lorenzo de ' Medici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being still feeble , and having , like her modern sisters upon similar occasions , " nothing to wear . " Madonna Alessandra thinks she is right , " for if she went it would cost some hundreds of florins . They are going to wear dresses of brocade , and she would be obliged to have the same ; besides , she is ill supplied with jewels . " " She asks me to tell you that she wants a new serge dress before the feast of San Giovanni , and begs you will get it of Lorenzo for her , for she is really in need of it . " The seventy-second and last letter of Madonna Alessandra is dated the 14th of April , 1470 . It is chiefly occupied with business details , which show that she was as actively employed as ever . She has bought a supply of grain , for which she has had to give a high price ; " it always happens that we have to buy when things are dear . " She has had improvements made in the stables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what day he may be expected , so that she can put everything in order . There is some public news , too , that is rather exciting : the Podesta has hanged fourteen men concerned in a tumult at Pmto ; and there has been a great earthquake . " Between one dreadful thing and another , I am half beside myself . I think the world is coming to an end ; so that it is well to have our minds prepared for it , and to be ready . " The writer died eleven months later . In her last days she had the comfort of seeing her son Lorenzo married , but he continued to live at Naples . On the 11th of March , 1471 , Filippo makes this entry in his diary : " This morning , between ten and eleven o*clock , Madonna Alessandra passed peacefully away from this life , with all the sacraments . " She was buried honorably in the church of Santa Maria Novella , and due masses were said for the repose of her soul . All her clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the poor . Eighteen years later Filippo Strozzi laid the foundations of the palace in the Yia Tornabuoni . Of his father 's family , only his sister Alessandra was living to witness the height of prosperity which he had reached . Lorenzo had died in 1479 , and Caterina , the wife of Marco Parenti , of whose bridal we have heard so much , passed away in 1481 , deeply lamented by her husband , who had found his life with her " most joyful and happy . " The beautiful Fiammetta , too , was gone . She lived only till 1476 , and Filippo had married Selvaggia Gianfigliazzi , by whom he already had two sons . Filippo 's son Lorenzo , in his biography of his father , gives the following account of the preparations for building the palace , which well accord with the prudent and shrewd disposition of the builder : " Filippo , therefore , having a large family , and being more eager for fame than for riches , not *knowing any surer way to leave a memorial of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a little knowledge of it , conceived the idea of building a // habitation which should do honor to himself and all of his name in Italy and abroad . But this was attended with no little difficulty , it being possible that he who had the supreme power Lorenzo de ' Medici might imagine that such splendor was likely to obscure his own ; and Filippo feared thus to awaken envy . Therefore he began to give out that , having a numerous offspring and so small a house , it was necessary that he who had brought children into the world should also provide a place for them to dwell ; and that this could be done by him much better than by them after his death . Thus in a quiet way he consulted masons and architects , and sometimes would seem about to begin to build ; and then , again , he would appear irresolute , and loath to spend in a short time what it had taken him so many years of toil to accumulate , - cunningly dissimulating only in order to attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted was a citizen 's house , commodious and convenient , but not ostentatious . But the masons and architects , as their manner is , exceeded all his plans , which really was agreeable to Filippo , however much be might pretend the contrary , saying that they forced him to what he would not and could not afford . Besides this , he who ruled over Florence was desirous that the city should be beautified in every possible way , . . . and began to interest himself in Filippo 's project , asking to see the designs ; and when he had examined them , besides many other expensive additions , he suggested a facade of unhewn stones . Filippo , in proportion as he was encouraged , appeared to draw back , declaring that he could not have such a facade , it being too expensive for the house of a plain dtizen ; that he was building for use , and not for show ; that he intended to use the ground-floor for shops , which would bring in a good rent to his children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconven ience , and the trouble it would cause the occupants of the house . Filippo still feigned to object , often complaining to his friends that he had begun an undertaking of which God only could tell whether the result would be satisfactory , and that , rather than to find himself so involved , he wished he had never thought of building . " Having thus am peased the vanity and neutralized the envy of Lorenzo , he went on vigorously with his preparations , and records that " on the 16th of August , 1489 , as the sun rose over the mountains , " he laid the first stone of his house , " in the name of God , and as a good foundation for me and my descendants . " He also had masses sung at several churches and convents which had been endowed by him , and he gave alms and gifts , and invited the architect and master builder , with some of his friends , to dine with him that day . We get a curious picture of those times as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life of Filippo . Besides his prayers to God , Filippo had been careful to consult a distinguished astrologer , to make sure that the influences of the stars were favorable . On the 16th of August , Cor Leonis , " a most fortunate star , " was in the ascendant , and the sun was in the Lion , " which signifies that the posterity of the founder shall continue to dwell in that house unto the end of their line . " His posterity still dwell there , but he himself lived to see the massive walls rise but a little above their foundations . Only two courses of the ponderous blocks of stone had been laid when , in 1491 , he was carried to sleep with his fathers in Santa Maria Novella . We can not follow the fortunes of the family further . At this point their history is taken up by T. A.
