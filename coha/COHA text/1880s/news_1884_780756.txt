txt At the last meeting of the Town Council of Dungarvan , County Waterford , the clerk of the board subffiitted a letter signed " Joseph Rogers , Special Commissioner of the World 's Fair and Cotton Centennial Exhibition , New-Orleans , La. , United States of America , " and dated from the Gresham Hotel , Dublin . In the letter , which was officially read , Mr. Rogers stated that he had been deputed by the Government of the United States to obtain good photographs or oil paintings of all European celebrities for the art department of the exhibition . He recognized the fact that such a collection would be very incomplete without a picture of so eminent a body as the Dungarvan Town Council , and he therefore begged to know if they would do him the honor of being photographed in a group , at his expense . Most of the members promptly and cordially agreed to become pictorially famous through the means offered by Mr. Rogers , but one skeptic suggested a doubt as to the existence of that gentleman . The skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech full of Irish vigor and eloquence . Mr. Scanlan said it made him indignant to sit and listen to the vilification of a gentleman who expressed such high appreciation of the worth of their body and so courteously offered to extend their fame . Mr. Scanlan said he knew that Dungarvan had made a great stir in the world , and it was not surprising that tho reputation of the Dungarvan Corporation had reached NewOrleans . The Americans , he said , had always a keen eye to business . and there was no doubt that they would make a good thing out of it by the sale of hundreds of copies of the picture of the Dungarvan Councilors . After some further debate the letter was reterred to a committee . The police subsequently found out that Mr. Rogers was a myth , and that the letter was a hoax.
