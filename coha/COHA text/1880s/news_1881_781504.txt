txt The foreign trade of the United States for the year ending June 30 , 1881 ? what is ordinarily called the " fiscal year " 1881 ? reached the total of $1,544,912,692 . Roughly speaking , this enormous mass of transactions was divided into two-fifths imports and three-fifths exports , the more exact proportions being 41 per cent . of the former and 59 per cent . of the latter . The total imports were $643,000,000 , in round numbers , and the exports $902,000,000 . The latter exceeded the former by $260,000 , - 000 , which may fairly be regarded as an indication  --  though by no means as an accurate statement  --  of the " balance of trade " in our favor . The specie movement corresponded to this balance , though very remotely , the imports of specie over the exports being something over ninety-one millions , ( $91,168,650 . ) A comparison of these figures with those of a year previous is encouraging . For the year ending June 30 , 1880 , the excess of exports over imports was only $168,000.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers on both sides of the ocean , the imports have fallen off some $25,000,000 , while there has . been a far greater increase in exports  --  some $67,000,000 ? and the excess of exports over imports is , as we have said , $260,000,000 . Obviously , there is no immediate prospect of a drain on the American specie stock to pay for purchases abroad . On the contrary , with the very considerable amount of American securities constantly going abroad , the tendency is toward the flow of specie in this direction . That it will attain the proportions which it reached during the last fiscal year , or even those of the one immediately preceding , is not likely . But , whatever may be the relative condition of American and foreign crops , there is no fear of specie flowing outward for the present . A fuller and more specific knowledge of the facts of our foreign trade is necessary to anything more than this general outline of its features . It is nlain that it is growing rapidly , but in what particular directions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now be accurately determined . Some light , however , thrown upon these questions by the detailed reports of the Statistics Bureau for the first eleven months of the year . During that period oar importations of coffee fell off $4,000,000 , ( tea remaining nearly the same as last year ; ) of linens , about $6,000 , - 000 ; of raw wool , nearly $15,000,000 ; of iron and steel and their manufactures , $3,500,000 . Our imports of cotton goods during that time increased slightly , while those of silk were stationary . In our exports there was an advance of some $42,000,000 in raw cotton ; one of $27,000,000 in provisions , and a slight one of $2,000,000 in tobacco . Of breadstuffs , the exports diminished some $10,000,000 , though it is estimated that they have still reached the very large total of $265,500,000 . From these indications , which are still imperfect , it will be seen that the principal decline in imports has been in raw , wools , a fact in itself not favorable so far as it might arise from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the imports of woolen goods , and as . the demand for such goods has certainly increased with the general prosperity of the country and the advance in wages , the place of the foreign wool must have been taken by the domestic product . Apart from this decrease in wool imports , we have bought abroad very nearly the same value as the previous year . In our exports the chief elements are still breadstuffs , provisions , and raw cotton , and these , with illuminating oil , constitute four-fifths of our exports , and , together , about equal our imports . This fact is more striking than cheerful , since the demand for these classes of staple articles may easily vary , and does vary , . from time to time , within very- wide limits , and such variations leave us somewhat in the position of a farmer who trusts to one or two crops only . That our foreign export trade is not more widely distributed , both geographically and in the kinds of goods exported , is due primarily , and almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade with one hand and domestic manufactures with the other . Where people can not sell they will not buy if they can help it , and where the raw materials of general manufactures are crudely and heavily taxed for a few favored industries , the power of competing in foreign markets is very much curtailed , if it be not practically destroyed .
