txt General Master Workman Powderly , of the Knights of Labor , to-day addressed the following circular to members of this order : Noble Order of the Knights of Labor of America ? To the Order Wherever Found . Greetny You have all read of the great strike on the Gould lines of railway in the Southwest ; its history is being written day by day . It makes but little difference now whether the men of the Southwest acted wisely or not . Let us pass that part of the affair over , for it . too , hits missed into history . The General Executive Hoard of the order attempted to settle the trouble and restore harmony ; agreements were made with them by Jay Gould , Esq. , but when the board reached St. Louis Mr. lioxie would not treat with them ; not that alone , but he positively refused to employ Knights of Labor . whether they had been active in the strike or not . It now becomes the part of every man and woman in the order to take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the full extent of their means . They have been idle for nearly two months . They have had a most trying ordeal to go through , and are iu need of funds . It requires no eloquence or rhetoric to plead the cause of these suffering people . They require aid , and it becomes our duty to extendthat ale as quickly as possible for us to do so . Fend every dollar you can spare to the General Secretary-Treasurer , who will at once forward it to the men at St. Louis for distribution . Remember . the men out there do not ask for charity ; they do not ask at all . It is your Executive Board that makes the appeal in their behalf . Ile who gives quickly gives doubly . Act at once . Another appeal may be sent to you , and we ask of you to prepare for It now . We must be judged by our actions in this matter . Do not pass resolutions condemning capital , for we are not fighting capital . Do not antagonize the contest we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man who has suffered through monopoly . This battle against the man who represents monopoly must be fought out manfully . Watch his actions everywhere ; keep an eye on the doings of Congress ; urge the committee that has been appointed to do its duty fearlessly , strengthen their hands . give them every aid . In conclusion , let us again ask that you send at once every dollar you can at present raise to uphold the men who are now out along the lines of the : - outhwest system ot . Gould railways . Do not delay , and , at the same time , make ready to bring the whole power of the order to bear upon the man who wrecks railroads , homes , fortunes , and lives in his greed for gold . Let us determine to have it go into history that the men of 1888 struck as grand a blow for liberty as the men of 177e . The men of ITie broke the power of monarchy and dethroned the King . The power which they wrested from the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by one man who , through the corrupt use of money , has brought manufacturer and wortman to ruin . The power of the King has passed away . The power of wealth is passing away , and it must now be determined whether man shall rule or whether Illegitimate wealth shall rule .
