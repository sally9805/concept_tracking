txt To the advocates of bimetallism India is a sort of fairyland . From it they draw whatever they wish in favor of their queer schemes and against the truth , which the entire financial history of the world teaches . that there never has been , is not now , and until human nature changes never can be such a thing as a double standard of value . When the absurd and dangerous system at present in force in the United States was originally under discussion we were informed that there could be no possible harm in adopting it , because India would absorb all the surplus silver product , and would prevent any serious fall . That was not exactly a bimetallist argument , since if it proved anything it proved that we could very well afford to leave silver alone . But it was gravely put forward in Congress as a reason why we should coin an arbitrary amount indefinitely . Now , however , we are told that the power of India to absorb silver is reaching its limit , that the glut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past year . and that it is so heavy a tax upon that country that England will before long be begging us to join her in the free coinage of gold . and silver on an agreed basis . This argument is fallacious . We should fret ourselves in a worse dilemma than we are now in if we should depend upon it . There are few things at all possible that are more unlikely to happen than that England should undertake to coin legal tender silver in unlimited quantities at a fixed ratio with gold . And there is nothing in the condition of things in India that would or should induce her to do so , because , whatever evils or inconveniences India may suffer from , such a policy would not remedy them . It would , on the contrary , be very apt to aggravate them . What has given rise to the mistaken notion that Indian finances can be improved by bimetallism is the recent communications of the Government of India through Sir A. COLVDT . These all turn on . the heavy discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . have to be cashed , and that is prima facie a loss to India . But it is not so freely stated by the silver men that this view of the case has been combated with great vigor by the Lords of the Treasury to whom it was referred by the Secretary of State under the late Government . It is true  --  that the drafts of the Indian Government , being payable in silver , are at a , discount in London , but it is also true that the smaller amount of gold thus obtained goes as far in the payment of expenditures in India as the amount of silver for which the bills are drawn would go . So far as the burden upon India is concerned it is as broad as it is long . The actual burden is in. the taxation , which is not increased by the state of exchange . And here is the real trouble with India . The country is for the present overtaxed . A policy has been adopted regarding it which in the long run may , and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway building on a large scale . In the fixture  --  perhaps in a future not very remote the benefit of aura and rapid communication will far outweigh the disadvantages of heavy taxation , which for the present are very great . In the meantime not only is taxation very heavy on this account , but it is increased by the amount charged to India under the account of the cost of preparations for war in Afghanistan , and . even on account of the actual struggle in Egypt , charges the profit from which is wholly moral and very largely contingent . If by a stroke of the lien the English Government could establish a fixed ratio for gold and silver , which would not vary for a generation , the difficulties under -. which India suffers on account of taxation would not be lessened . Undoubtedly the country suffers also , and . heavily , from having an inferior and fluctuating currency . Those evils could be very much relieved . if . a stable relation could . be established between its currency and gold , which is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws over which Governments have no control , the universal standard of value . But , unfortunately , it is not in the power of England , or of any other Government , to establish such a relation , or even to aid . materially in doing so . The evils of a , variable currency are one thing ; the theory that bimetallism would remedy them is quite another , and is a pure assumption .
