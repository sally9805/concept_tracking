IN the parable of the Unjust Judge , his injustice consisted in putting off an action , not in making a wrong decision . It was harder for the suitor to be kept in uncertainty than to know positively that one could have no redress . In later times the law 's delay was one of the evils against which relief was promised in 3iliagna Charta . Nulli * * * differemus rectum vet justitiam . And it was one of the troubles that Shakespeare names as almost an excuse for suicide ; a quietus with a bare bodkin . The evil continues at the present day . In most things we move more rapidly than former generations did . We travel faster ; we send messages across the ocean in a few minutes ; we transact business of large amounts in a short time ; but when we come to our litigations , we find the reproach of the law 's delay still existing . We have done very little to remedy this great wrong ; indeed , it is doubtful whether in this matter we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases at the rate of twenty-five a day .

" ) Contrast this with the proceedings at the present day , when one case may last a week or more ; or where , as in the famous case in Brooklyn , months may be consumed in one trial . Thus , too , in criminal cases . A reference to the English State trials will show that it was an innovation when a criminal trial was continued into a second day. * Now a criminal would hardly think himself to be well defended unless the trial were protracted through two or three days ; and even the charge of the Court has been known to exceed that time , as in the Orton ( or Tichborne ) trial .

It used to be thought that old modes of practice gave opportunity to lawyers for postponing the end of litigation , and the Court of Chancery had to bear the blame for much of the delay experienced by suitors . Jarudyce against Jarndyce was a representation of the law 's delay in its worst and most aggravating form . But the Court of Chancery has been abolished ; the old practice has passed away . We have enjoyed several codes intended to facilitate the rapid disposal of business , but the delay remains . It is not necessary to go into detail or into statistics . It is enough to say briefly that the Supreme Court of the United States is hopelessly in arrears . In New York the Court of Appeals is falling behind with its business . Some of the General Terms are unable to keep up with the cases that come before them , and in many of the circuits and trial terms the business is similarly behiudhand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount with any hope of a reasonably speedy decision . A year 's time would be short for its termination ; and the plaintiff may not reach the end in three , four , five , or six years . A short time since , counsel , in arguing a matter , referred to a case that had been pending eighteen years , and was just at an issue for trial . The case may be found reported as early as 1873 , * in one of its many steps , and was in fact begun in 1869 . It has graduated some of its counsel to the bench , and has seen several of the judges who have sat in it carried beyond the term of their judicial career ; and I suppose it is not yet tried . Another case pressed forward by the plaintiff , and entitled to a preference on the calendars of the courts , was begun in 1874 , and after four trials reached its happy end in 1880. t These are not unusual instances . If any one would see further detail on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports of the Court of Appeals , and where a decision is made which is final , examine the statement and the other reports of the case , and ascertain when the case was begun .

The doubting Lord Eldons are the curse of suitors , and the case of Peebles v. Plainstanes might well drive the weary plaintiff into a feeble lunacy . If a plaintiff must wait six or eight years for his rights , now encouraged by a favorable decision , and then disheartened by a reversal , until , after three or four trials and twice as many appeals , he succeeds at last , he will learn in the end that , on the whole , he would have been wiser never to have prosecuted his claim . He will ask himself sadly , what kind of justice is that which in expense costs as much as it gives , and in anxiety costs more . He will hardly feel satisfied , even if his counsel shall inform him that his case has afforded the opportunity to settle an important point of law , which previously had been uncertain . If the life of man had not been reduced in length since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend ten years in having all the niceties of his case discussed and decided by lawyers and judges . But life is short ; law is long . Are there any causes of this delay that can be remedied * It is often , perhaps generally , the wish of the defendant in an action to postpone a final decision . There must be of course certain legal machinery and certain deliberation , in order that reasonable justice may be done . And as society becomes more wealthy and business affairs more complicated , it may be that more thought and deliberation are required in the decision of controversies . But there ought not to be too much opportunity for the defendant to protract the litigation ; and if there be any way of bringing cases to a speedy decision , it should be sought . There has been an increased laxity in requiring parties to be ready when cases are called . Slight excuses are accepted more readily than they formerly were for the putting a case over to the next court . One cause for this may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of daily attendance is so large compared with the legal fees of witnesses that parties have some excuse for not bringing up // their witnesses until the day when it is certain they will be needed . In some parts of New York there is , it may be , another cause that facilitates this pntting of cases over to another term . In former times a circuit judge had a certain number of connties within which he was to hold his court . If he did not try a case at one circuit , he wonld find it waiting for him at the next . But , under the present system , circuits in the same connty are held by different judges , and if a case is put over a circuit by the judge who holds it , he is generally relieving himself from the labor of trying that case . It will come before one of his brethren at the next circuit . So that , if he has the least desire to lessen his work , he has an opportunity to do so by pntting cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York has been the practice of referring causes for trial . Partly owing to a deficiency in the judicial force , and partly to a willingness in judges to avoid labor , it has become far too common for lawyers to consent to refer causes which ought to be tried either before the court or before a jury . The evil is serious . References are very expensive , and the expense falls on the defeated party . They are always protracted ; because the convenience of two or more counsel and of the referee must be consulted , and because the referee can not exercise that power of compelling promptness which can be exercised by the court . Thus a trial , which before a court or jury might be finished in a few days , will , before a referee , last for months , by reason of short sessions and long adjonruments . It is to be hoped that , since the recent increase in the number of judges , there will be a return to the practice when nothing was referred except long accounts . This increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of promptly at all the circuits and trial terms . It is certainly the duty of the State to provide a sufficient number of judges ; so that , if they do their duty faithfully , there should be no delay in reaching a cause soon after it is ready for trial . But after the litigant has come to the trial of his cause and has a decision , he greatly deceives himself if he supposes that the litigation is ended . There are appeals and appeals before him . " Hills peep o'er hills , and Alps on Alps arise . Perhaps there is no other cause of delay as great as the extensive right of appeal given by our present system . In many // matters that belong merely to the preliminary skirmishing , as it might be called , appeals to the General Term can be taken , with the result of delaying the trial-such matters , for instance , as motions to change the place of trial . Yet these are often questions to a great extent of good discretion , in which the discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of preventing delay . This , however , is of less importance than the freedom of appeal after trial . It may be said generally that , after a trial , the defeated party has three appeals , under any of which he may obtain a new trial . First , he may apply to the court before which the case was tried . If unsuccessful , he may appeal to the General Term . If unsuccessful there , he may appeal to the Court of Appeals . In the crowded condition of the calendars this assures him a very comfortable postponement of the final result . When , however , he shall at last have had his case decided by the highest court and shall have succeeded , and shall have obtained a new trial , he will not have reached the end . He must go back to try the case again . And , armed with the decision of the highest court in his favor , he will probably succeed in his defense at the trial . That , however , is not the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more reaches the highest court , he may find that there is a distinguendo , and that that court did not mean quite what he thought they meant. * Once more then there must be a new trial . And once more he may have to climb the ladder of appeals , and get a new lesson of wisdom from its topmost round ,  --  at least a new lesson of patience . The hardship arising from appeals has been increased under modern practice . When the Court of Chancery was in existence , and an action in equity had been carried to the highest court , the decision was final ; there was no new trial . But now , whether an action be legal or equitable , if the judgment be not affirmed by the appellate court , there must , in nearly every case , be a new trial , with all the trouble and expense that this involves . It is seldom that the appellate court will , or can , make a final disposition , if it does not affirm the decision below . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancery actions , the parties had the satisfaction of knowing that there was to be only one trial , and that , when the case should * Marston v. Swett , 66 N.Y . 206 , and S. C. , 82N . Y. , 526 . Urqnhart // reach the highest court , it would be ended . But now this advantage is gone ; if there is an error in the trial the remedy is a re-trial . The appellate court will not , or can not , rectify the wrong . And the result is that many cases are tried several times before they are ended . These re-trials not only cause delay , but they afford opportunity for that dangerous drilling and preparing of the witnesses by which on a second trial a party 's evidence is made to appear better than it did on the first . Whenever any suggestion is made as to restricting appeals , a feeling is manifested that it is the right of every citizen to carry every litigation to the highest court , however small the amount involved . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state is a reasonably fair and able tribunal , before which his case may be tried . Any tribunal may err . Appellate courts err . If there were ten successive appellate courts , the tenth would reverse decisions of the ninth . The highest must be assumed to be right only because there is none higher . It can not be said that there is any absolute right at which the lltigants will arrive after a certain number of appeals . The decisions of the Court of Appeals are conclusive , because usually there is no higher court . But when occasions come in which cases may go from that court to the Supreme Court of the United States , then their decisions are sometimes reversed . In fact , there are four legal doctrines on which the decisions of those two courts are antagonistic . Thus the litigant , in having several appeals allowed him , is not insured an absolutely just decision , for on many points there is no such absolute and unquestionable rule of right . And the decisions of courts are only the opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a litigant shall have the opinion of one man only , or shall have the opinion of three more , or of seven more , is not a matter of right . It is a question of expediency in the state , endeavoring to keep uniformity in its courts , and to do justice with promptness . And therefore the state may well consider how many appeals it shall allow ; and further , whether it shall permit appeals where their expense is nearly equal to , or even greater than the amount involved . Thus , one remedy for the delay in legal proceedings is to restrict appeals . This may be done in several ways , which need not now be specified . The chief objects to be gained though appellate courts is uniformity in decisions , a matter in which the state is interested , // and greater time for deliberation than can be had in the course of a trial . And yet it is often noticed by those who have had experience that the appellate court loses much of that knowledge of the real merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the appellate court all witnesses seem alike ; not so on the trial . And further , there is often an understanding between the court and the parties at the trial , which can not be put upon paper , and which has much to do with the merits , and with a just decision . Hence , an appellate court , while it has more time for deliberation , sometimes misses the truth of the case . The remark that there is often no unquestionable rule of right may excite surprise . But many questions arise on the meaning of a statute . Clearly that is a matter on which men may differ , and it can not be settled by any rule of ethics . Often too , by the wrong-doing of one man , either the one or the other of two innocent men must suffer . Which shall suffer is not a matter of ethics . The disagreement between the Supreme Court of the United States and the Court of Appeals of New York on " town bonding " questions is of this character . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is such a rule it is impossible to say how many appeals will reach it . No one then has a right to say that wrong has been done to him because the state has allowed him only one appeal instead of ten . There must be an end somewhere . The manner in which appellate courts act on cases before them is often such as to cause unnecessary delay . The object of each action , so far as the parties are concerned , is to obtain what they believe to be their rights ; they care nothing for the settlement of legal principles . But under our system , following the English , appellate courts seem at times to care more about making precedents than about deciding the case in hand justly . This comes from the fact , so often discussed , that our law is largely " judge-made " law . Instead of being guided by the rules of codes of law , or by a sound judgment as to the merits of the case , appellate courts are constantly searching for precedents in other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in hand . When a case is argued , the question is not whether justice was done in the court below ; but it may be whether some witness said something which might be considered irrelevant - perhaps no more important to the merits than whether he stood at right angles to the jury when he testified . // When we consider that an important trial may continue a week or more , and when we think how little of the testimony the jury remember at the end of the trial , it is langhable to observe appellate courts granting new trials because they can not say that such a piece of evidence did not affect the jury . In fact , the jury are affected , not by single and special pieces of evidence , but by the general tone of the whole case , and much too by what may be called the atmosphere of the trial , which can not be felt by the appellate court . But the memory of the jury can not retain definitely all the answers that have been given to the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is answered , or whether the answer is excluded , the effect is the same . The jury know generally how the question would have been answered , and that knowledge is not excluded by the exclusion of the answer . The system by which rules of evidence are rules of law * is , I suppose , peculiar to England and to countries that have inherited English law . Very probably it has its advantages ; but it certainly has its disadvantages . One who was not familiar with it , might think it strange to hear the discussions in courts as to whether such and such evidence was admissible . He might think that if any evidence proved nothing it would be harmless ; if it proved anything , it should be admitted . For instance , he might think if a doctor were sued for malpractice , it would be of some use to show that the doctor had never sent in a bill for his services , as this circumstance might be some indication that he thought them valueless . And one might be surprised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal to the trial.t Those who are accustomed to the English system are often surprised at the freedom with which , in other systems , evidence is admitted ; as if matters , however remote , should be allowed to come in so as to throw any light , if possible , on the controversy . The English system has already been largely modified with respect to the persons who may testify . The old and unwise exclusion of all interested persons has been given up . Perhaps other changes will follow , touching the whole subject of relevant and irrelevant evidence . But meantime it would be a great improvement in the speedy administration of justice if appellate courts would lean toward a disregard , as far as possible , * Best 's Evidence , * 116. t Baird v. Gillett , 47 N. Y. , 186. // of any errors in the admission of evidence . Unfortunately , the tendency in New York has been in the opposite direction . Not merely in actions of a legal character , but even in those which we may still call equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the appellate courts seem to have overlooked the fact that the English system of evidence grew out of the trial by a jury , presided over by a judge . It is not , in its strictness , appropriate to trials by a court , and should not be extended to them . They should be left to a greater freedom , proper enough when the effect of evidence is to be weighed by a mind trained to judicial reasoning . Yet , however a cause may be tried , our appellate courts have not felt at liberty , even in actions of an equitable nature , to disregard improper evidence , if such had been admitted , and to decide the case upon the merits as shown in the evidence unquestionably proper . * This has been the cause of new trials and delay . And it has encouraged a practice sometimes called by counsel " trying a case for the exceptions " ; that is , contriving as many ingenious pitfalls as possible , by offers of evidence and by exceptions to evidence and the like , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court would fall into some of these dangers , and that thus a client with no real defense might weary out his adversary by the delay consequent on an appeal . And not merely in matters of evidence , but upon the whole merits of the case , appellate courts might well take broader views than they do ; and if they see that , on the whole , justice has been done , they might wisely disregard errors even more important than those pertaining to evidence . An appellate court , of which the members never sit in the trial of cases , and thus never have any experience in that duty , will naturally form for itself a high standard of perfection . Such a court will have a faint idea of the perplexities that may surround a trial judge , endeavoring to hold a steady course between two ingenious counsel . It will scrutinize the language of a judge 's charge , as if it were one of its own essay-like opinions . It is likely to forget that the jury did not pay precise and critical attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are besides hardly capable of making the nice distinctions that are so easy to the acute legal mind . Of course , the only object of the judge 's charge // is to guide the jury . The charge is not intended to be an exact legal essay ; and therefore , in reviewing it , the question must be whether the jury were in fact misled . This should be ascertained rather from the whole scope than from single sentences . Yet appellate courts sometimes overlook this idea , especially , if , for some cause , they wish to find , or make , a reason for reversing a judgment . Some incidental remark can be found in the charge , to which probably the jury never gave any attention , even if they understood its precise effect . Perhaps this matter may be illustrated by instances taken from that class of cases , now so common , which arise in accidents at railroad crossings . In those cases , it is not proper for a judge to submit to a jury the question whether , under all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flagman at the crossing. * Yet the judge may permit a jury to consider the absence of a flagman , or the question as to the care with which the company ran its trains.t If a jury are permitted to consider the presence or absence of a flagman as bearing on the question of the negligence of the company in running its trains , could they make the very nice distinction that they must not consider whether the company ought not to have had a flagman ? Admit the beauty and delicacy of the distinction and the logical refinement that points it out ; what does it matter practically to a jury ? Their verdict will not be different whether one phrase or the other is used . One other cause of legal delay may be briefly mentioned , with due deference to the judiciary , and that is , the writing of long opinions . " T is pleasant , sure , to see one 's self in print . A book 's a book , although there 's nothing i n't . " Long opinions take up time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of law decided , there is often much in an opinion which is not decided , and is not law . These passages are caught up and used as if they were accurate statements and authoritative . They lead some lawyers astray , and they give occasion for the frequent comment of the reporter , distinguishing a case from one decided a short time before . A story is told of a layman who was appointed to a judicial position . He inquired * llongwhieh v. Del. and Hud . Canal Co. , 92 N. Y. , 219 . I McGrath v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co. , 63 N.
