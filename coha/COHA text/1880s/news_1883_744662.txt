txt In the interviews of the Boston Traveller with prominent men in Massachusetts , touching the issues of the next campaign , there is a singular agreement of opinion that civil service reform and the tariff will have more than anything else to do with the result . As to civil service reform , there is no doubt that the gentlemen interviewed are right . That is a matter which will determine more votes of those that can not be counted in advance than any other . In what direction it will determine them remains to be seen . If the new law is fairly and thoroughly administered , and if its spirit obtains in the general policy of the Gpveninient , the votes will go to the Republicans . If the law is laxly enforced , or if its spirit is openly and con spicuously violated , these votes will go to the Democrats , as they- did last Fall , and no appeals on any other subject , economical , moral , sentimental , or what not , will stop them . Of this fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tariff , the sentiment of the country , as indicated by the opinions expressed in the Traveller , is decidedly clearing . A few months since it appeared possible that the average politician , rising to his average level , would clamor for a strong , unqualified , extreme protection policy for the Republican Party , leaving to our opponents the opportunity of taking ground for a moderate but substantial reform . But in Massachusetts , at least , this very short-sighted way of looking at the question does not prevaiL On the contrary- , the principal men there advocate a policy of conservative but real reform of the tariff , leaving our opponents to take any ground they choose , and trusting the good sense of the people to decide between the two parties on the value of their respective records . " The Republican Party , " says ex-Gov . CLAriarr , " is in favor of a general policy of protection of American industries while at the same time it favors the reduction of duties as fast as it can be safely and legitimately made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " I presume there will be a further modification of the tariff in the direction of reduction so far as it can be made without injury to vested interests and the industries of the people . " Congressman RICE , while he thinks that there should be " no radical changes , " " was disappointed in the high duties imposed by the new law on some manufactures and would be glad to see them reduced . " Mr. HENRY CABOT LODGE , Chairman of the Republican State Committee , says that " the Republican Party , while favoring a moderate protective tariff as its general policy , is yet in favor of gradual tariff reduction . " Mr. HENRY H. FAXON , the leader of the Prohibitionist wing of the Republicans , says : " I profess to be a pretty good and straight Republican , but I am beginning to believe that we ought to approach free trade as rapidly as possible . * * * I disbelieve , however , , , in the Democratic idea of a tariff for revenue only , as the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on necessities . The most of American industries are in a condition to take care of themselves . " Finally , Hon. STILLMAN B. ALLEN , described by the Traveller as " one of the veteran Republicans of the State , and one of the shrewdest observers of political events , " says : " The tariff will be the leading issue of 1884 . I believe that a further reduction of duties will have to be made . It should be made in my judgment on those articles of common and general use which are not produced in this country . " " When the question is put to the Nation next year , it will not be in the form : Is a further reform of the tariff necessary ? but in this form : Which of the two parties can be most safely intrusted to reform it prudently and without shock or injury to the business interests of the country ? " These quotations from the interviews in the Traveller fairly express the tone of opinion among the leading men of the Republican Party of Massachusetts . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter is apt to be . It does not show any marked infatuation for theories . But it recognizes the plain , hard facts , and proposes that the party shall shape its policy with reference to them . Opinion throughout the Union , according to present indications , agrees very well with that in Massachusetts . It does not incline to a radical change in the direction of free trade . It perceives the need of substantial reform and of rEradual reduc- tion . There is no doubt that the Republican policy will conform to this opinion .
