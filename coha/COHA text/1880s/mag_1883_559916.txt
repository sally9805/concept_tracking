ON the thirteenth of December , 1882 , the English press announced the re-organization of the ministry . That day was the anniversary of the Prime Minister 's first election to Parliament fifty years before . The new ministry is of historic , and even picturesque , interest . Every party and every cause which had struggled for existence and success through the forms of the British constitution is , in its final evolution , incorporated in this , the strongest ministry known to English history . In it the old Whig lion grown tame , and the Radical lamb grown bold , lie down together . The crowning of his edifice will appear to Mr. Gladstone in the acceptance of a place in his cabinet by the Earl of Derby . He would not be so cruel as to wish that the late Earl should have lived to see his son and heir , consecrated to the Toryism he led like a Rupert , bringing the social and political traditions of Liverpool nobility to swell the triumph of a Liverpool merchant 's son ; but he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived to see this hour . When , at the victorious close of the Egyptian conflict , the Prime Minister appeared at the Lord Mayor 's banquet , M. John Lemoinne said in the " D*bats " : " Who could have ever foreseen that the man named Gladstone , the glorious hero of letters , science , philosophy , and theology , the standardbearer of peace , light , and civilization , would enter the city of London crowned with laurels , in a car of victory , and followed , like the Roman consuls , by slaves and captives from Africa and Asia . " But Gladstone , entering the House of Commons at the head of his new ministry , is attended by more surprising symbols than these . The Stanley in his train is a sign that the ancient war between Whig and Tory is past , like the War of the Roses , however noisily their ghosts may fight on over their sepulchres . The great Quaker commoner sitting apart , and the // glitter of military decorations , mean that jingoism is transferring its acclamations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which occupied Egypt by force of arms ; while , on the other hand , the dusky captives of the train , attesting that " British interests " and " British honor " are safe under the rule of the middle-class Premier , appear so happy and comfortable ,  - -  Cetewayo on his throne , and Arabi posturing as " the Blest " amid palms waving in the spicy breezes of Ceylon ,  --  that the Peace Society , and the Aborigines Protection Society , and even the Egyptian Committee , are also visible with their broadbrimmed hats and white neck-ties , touching elbows with warriors in this amazing triumphal procession . These symbols and signs of greatness a little while ago surrounded Lord Beaconsfield ; but they merely made him a tableaufigure , as if at the end of one of his own gorgeous romances . His career was a brilliant romance , but it had to end in an anticlimax . But Gladstone is contemporary history . Fifteen years ago , when Robert Lowe pointed to him and said that the hour and the man had arrived , Disraeli exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is mistaken . " But Lord Beaconsfield lived to discover that it was Disraeli who was then mistaken . In the jubilee year of his parliamentary career , Mr. Gladstone must be regarded as , in some sense , the political incarnation of the English people . That the realities he represents should now invest themselves with the symbols and shows of power , is mainly interesting as an indication of the extent to which he holds the heart and mind of the nation in his hand . These splendors and emblems are offered at the feet of the man who personally cares least about them . As the oriental world invested Buddha with ' the legends and glories of their deities , whose existence he had denied , so is this plain prosaic Englishman worshiped with relics of the idols he has shattered . In saying " worshiped , " we may weigh the word and will retain it . Not long ago the writer of this happened to be conversing with a Liberal member of Parliament , and criticised some part of Gladstone 's Irish policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not listening , then drew his chair closer , and in a lowered tone said , " Between you and me , Gladstone is carrying us to the " - but , no matter where it was , the precautions taken to secure the confidential character of the opinion proved the vanity of it . During the two sessions // of 1882 it was as much as many a member 's parliamentary life was worth to vote against any measure introduced by the Government . The worship of the country for Mr. Gladsl*one could not be gathered from London . The metropolis has many virtues , but " republican simplicity " is not salient among them ; in fact , it must be admitted that a large amount of snobbery surrounds the great center of wealth and titled magnificence , and it has never been satisfied with the leaden casket in which the mace has been concealed during the Gladstone rkjime . A queen in chronic mourning was somber enough without the counterpart of a premier without wealth or state , whose chief delight seemed to be cutting trees on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through a curious combination of circumstances , the liberal salon has been a conspicuous desideratum in recent years , the relations of the ministry to " society " being chiefly represented by two American ladies , whose husbands belong to the cabinet . The contrast between Mr. Gladstone 's private residence and that of an average alderman , between the Lord Mayor in his coach and the Premier in his cab , is striking , and London prefers the gold and silver caskets . Nevertheless , even London has shown signs of surrender since the military parades began . As for the rest of the country , to return to that , its enthusiasm for this man is extraordinary . During the sessions of 1882 , the tables of Liberal members groaned under the piles of letters entreating , persuading , or still oftener commanding them to stick by Gladstone through thick and thin , and vote with him whatever he might do . When the expedition to Egypt was resolved on , no thing could be more opposed to the non-interventionist and peaceful policy which Gladstone had so zealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , with few exceptions , naiively declared that , odious as such a scheme would have been under another prime minister , they must conclude that Gladstone would not undertake it unless it was right , and must trust him though he slay them . Even when Alexandria was bombarded , under pretext of protecting a canal not threatened , a hundred miles away , and John Bright left the ministry , the veteran orator formed no cave of Adnilam . The country attributed his retirement to Quaker peculiarities , and Gladstone 's shadow remained potent enough to keep silent that voice which never before failed in eloquent denunciation of a war he deemed unjust . // There have even been some indications that Gladstone-worship exists in the United States . Several American papers have caught the English enthusiasm , and one Boston paper mentions the loss of a subscriber by having admitted into its columns a criticism on Gladstone . Finally , if anything were needed further to show the intensity of this feeling , it might be found in the corresponding intensity of hatred felt for him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heading , " A New Age of Faith , " for an article on the implicit faith of Liberals in Mr. Gladstone , and the religious phrases used above on the same subject can not be thought extravagant or merely metaphorical by any one who has lived in the political atmosphere of England during the last two years . Indeed , this ardor of enthusiasm bears indications rather of faith in Mr. Gladstone than of personal liking for him . It is even doubtful if he could yet be accurately called a popular man ,  --  he is certainly not loved by his chief supporters in Parliament ,  --  while his political strength in the country is unprecedented . The reasons for this enthusiasm for a man who , less than eight years ago , had so lost his hold on the country and his party that he resigned his office and leadership , are not remote . Mr. Gladstone was returned to power on a wave of moral and religious feeling . The menaces of the Beaconsfield government toward Russia were largely theatrical , but they became dangerous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gladstone . The Premier 's " want of humor " is proverbial in Conservative circles , and they had good cause to deplore it when he was going through the country with the vehemence and burden of a prophet . While the old Russophobia to which Lord Beaconsfield appealed was found to be antiquated , the cynical disregard of alleged " Turkish atrocities " by Tory speakers shocked the moral sense of the nation . There was also a good deal of religious feeling awakened by tidings of the massacre of Christians by Mohanunedans , and for once Lord * Jewish soul betrayed his Christian tact . Although Mr. Gladstone did not directly appeal to religious animosities , they who listened to his impassioned arraignment of Turks and Tories were never suffered to forget that Bulgarians and Russians were their fellow-Christians . To the moral and religious sentiments thus excited was added the strength of the commercial interest , the first article in whose creed is " peace at any price . " Yet , when Mr. Gladstone // again took his place as Prime Minister , in 1880 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the idolized leader of the nation that he is to-day . This is due to the internal crisis of the nation with which he has had to deal , to the fact that he was the one possible pilot of the tempest-tossed ship , and that he sleeplessly watched and worked at his perilous post , night and day , through the long storm . The latest Irish revolution has been peculiar in several respects , but of these one was especially alarming , namely , the degree to which parliamentary government in England was involved . The argument for a parliament in Dublin was so strongly enforced by the violence of its probable elements when imported to London , that for a time the business of the House was interrupted , and the legislative arm seemed threatened with paralysis . This grave danger , accompanied by murderous deeds in Ireland and menaces in London , gradually assumed such dimensions that the English people recognized that they were amid a revolution of the deep and deadly kind . As is inevitable under such circumstances , there was something like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an appearance of disloyalty . They who complained that his measures for the pacification of Ireland embodied principles inimical to the rights of property , or that his rules for " closure " in parliamentary debate threatened freedom of discussion , appeared to the people generally like the passenger on an endangered ship who should annoy the captain with his apprehensions for the fate of a spar or a wine-cask . The criticisms were based upon undeniable facts , and consequently could only be answered by outbursts of loyalty on the part of the patriotic multitude . As amid these cheers the septuagenarian statesman was seen toiling like a Hercules , bent but unbroken beneath his burden like an Atlas , framing measures which involved complete mastery of financial and legal questions , and of all details in administration ; as , night after night , he stood calm amid the uproar , patient under complaints and sneers , and forcing down opposition by a knowledge of the facts which none could equal , stated with an eloquence that none could surpass , the cheers for Gladstone made way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) found him on that eminence which military heroes have sometimes reached , but rarely statesmen , where men are regard*d as the saviours of their country . Whether the // country is really saved or not is another question ; that Mr. Gladstone is doing all he can to save it , and that he will save it in the end , and bring lasting peace and prosperity to Ireland , is the faith of the large majority of the English people . If the dreary and tragical history of the Irish trouble ever becomes a memory of the past , it will not seem wonderful that the country should tG-day regard it with somewhat the same heaviness of painful foreboding , verging upon despair , that patriotic Americans felt regarding slavery , and that they should see in Gladstone , as Unionists saw in Lincoln , the fiery pillar of a great hope leading across a weary wilderness to a land of repose and prosperity . One thing is certain : that Mr. Gladstone has wearied out opposition to his Irish policy . Whatever virtue may or may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried . The speech made at Manchester , on the evening of the " Gladstone * by Lord Derby , in which he formally gave in his adhesion to the Liberal party , indicates the determination of the landed interest in England , so far as it is not partisan , to accept the risks and sacrifices necessary to insure a fair trial of the land act . The special circumstances just mentioned sufficiently explain the accession of enthusiastic support to Mr. Gladstone in the last two years ; butt that he should be the one man in England to whom anybody would dream of confiding the country in such a crisis , is a more important and interesting subject for political study . " The way of fortune , " says Bacon , " is like the milky way in the sky , which is a meeting or knot of a number of small stars , not seen asunder , but giving light together ; so are there a number of little and scarce discerned virtues , or rather faculties and customs , that make men fortunate . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luckiest man that ever lived . " But there is no luck about it . The " virtues , faculties , and customs " of the English people have flowered in the success of this most English of living men . Their favorite faults are in him . That love of large principles , and dislike of pressing them to logical conclusions ; that suspicion of applying large inductions to practical politics , which led John Stuart Mill to the belief that it would be almost fatal to a cause in England to prove itself entirely reasonable and just , find many illustrations in the career of Mr. Gladstone . The complex character of the British Constitution , the unique mixture of ideals and survivals in its institutions , have determined // the evolution of this statesman , who pauses while writing High Church tracts to abolish the Irish Church , who denounces Strauss and makes a pilgrimage to Darwin , who uses the royal prerogative to popularize the army , and whose democracy is dressed in a chasuble . Men of equal culture and ability with Mr. Gladstone there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anomalies of their country ; they have misgivings , they take sides ; they tolerate the other side , but critically , and if they defend its practical rights , it is without heart . But none of these misgivings divide the strength of Mr. Gladstone . His proverbial lack of humor is the other side of his unconscious ingenuity in harmonizing inconsistencies , which has become an instinct . Plato says all clear ideas are true . Mr. Gladstone 's wonderful facility of clear statement enables him to make a contradiction seem simplicity itself , and in his sentence every detail appears a generalization . One of his colleagues is reported as saying : " I hate Gladstone , because he is always so confoundedly in the right . " There never was another minister who so overshadowed his colleagues , and there is reason to fear that he has been the unconscious means of arresting the development of some of them into statesmen , by his way of setting forth all his projects , large and small , as pillars of Hercules , and on moral heights where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial statements in the House have sometimes been made so solemnly that it appeared a kind of atheism to criticise them . However unpleasant all this may be to aspiring or rival politicians around him , it makes an irresistible power in the country . In an age of skepticism , here is a man that never doubts ; in an age of vacillation , here is one that does not vacillate . Whatever is in him is organic , becomes moral , rises to religious elevation , and the people are surprised and delighted at hearing it authentically proved that what they desired , but doubted , is the superlative principle of reason and right . Mr. Gladstone 's confirmed habit of being always " so confoundedly in the right " has survived all the events which have shown him to have been sometimes in the wrong . His maiden speech in Parliament was a defense of Jamaica planters , of whom his father was one , and in opposition to immediate emancipation of the slaves ; and nearly thirty years later , being Chancellor of the Exchequer , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent nation . Slavery // has been abolished by England and America without the aid of this most historical of statesmen . He began his career as a Tory ,  --  his first encounter with Disraeli being when the latter was on his way from the Liberal camp to take the vacated place ,  --  and he resigned his place in the Peel Ministry ( 1845 ) because of a bill introduced by the Government to endow a Roman Catholic college in Ireland , which bill he immediately supported . He arraigned the Government of Naples before the world ; he invited Garibaldi to be the guest of England , then showed him the door when he found that the honors paid to his guest displeased his old friend Napoleon III. , with whom he had acted as a special constable in London at the time of the Chartist demonstrations . In these last years he made the ears of England and Scotland tingle with his eloquent invective against the wrongs inflicted by Moslems on Bulgarian Christians , but all the sufferings of Jews in Russia could not extort a protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladstone 's career would make this paper too long . The last of them is his course with regard to the junior member for Northampton , so long excluded from his seat in the House , after repeated elections , because of his opinions on religious subjects . Mr. Bradlaugh , misled by Mr. Gladstone 's law-officers among others , believed he had the right to choose between taking the oath or making an affirmation on taking his seat , and chose the latter . The courts decided that the parliamentary oath was not included in the act allowing affirmation in law-courts , and Mr. Bradlaugh then offered to take the usual oath . Mr. Gladstone defended his right to do this , when it was challenged ; but the House voted that Mr. Bradlaugh should not be allowed to take the oath because of his atheism . That having been decided , a large number of Liberal members rose in their places and suggested to the Prime Minister that he should bring in a short measure which would allow affirmation . But Mr. Gladstone sat still on the treasury bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day expressed its wonder at this , and earnestly appealed to him to adopt this the only possible means of doing justice to the constituency of Northampton , he took no notice of the matter . Thus , the wrong was continued entirely by the inaction of the one man who could redress it , and who had previously declared it to be a wrong . It is not to be supposed that a minister who had helped to strike out of the oath the words " on the true // faith of a Christian , " in order that Jews might be admitted to Parliament , had any technical objection to the method by which alone the House had decided that an atheist could be admitted . In all these changes and apparent inconsistencies a notable thing has been the absence of any effort to explain them . Mr. Gladstone sitting on the treasury bench , and shaking his head without opening his lips , amid the clamors of his friends for a certain act , is typical in its way . It belongs to that species of inconsistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general principles may be laid down about religious liberty and the right of private judgment , there are unwritten reservations in them . If the statesman who once declared that the King of Naples had raised atheism into a system of government had been the means of introducing an atheist into the legislature , the non-conformist and the evangelical pulpits of the land would have fulminated to such an extent that his tenure of office would have been endangered at a critical moment . His relations with the Queen-who still hesitates to transfer the Garter of her deceased favorite , Lord Beaconsfield , to the only man who has any right to it-could hardly have been rendered more pleasant by a move which would have befriended the radical who has sharply attacked the House of Brunswick . Mr. Gladstone is much stronger now than he was then , but when he gave out his non possumns , with that silent shake of the head , he represented the exact sentiment of the country , which was neither willing to limit religious liberty nor to admit Mr. Bradlaugh . Dick Whittington is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not rise from the proletariat . Gladstone 's father was a merchant , but he was also a baronet , and his fourth son , whom the English call " the grand old man , " is by no means indifferent to the aristocratic side of his country . Personally , indeed , he has not sought titles in fact , he might easily have been a peer long ago had he been willing to give up his leadership in the Commons for it . But a title still represents a bit of the history and constitution of England to him , andhehas repeatedly shown deference to it . On one occasion , when a late duke petitioned for a divorce , Gladstone was summoned as a witness , and , in reply to a question as to whether he was an intimate friend of the duke , replied , " As intimate as the difference in our positions permits . " A smile went round the courtroom , // the Prime Minister being far above the duke in every respect , and the reply was deemed rather snobbish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it meant mainly a bow to British institutions . Another such bow was lately seen in the Sunday labor which church-goers saw bestowed on the decorations prepared for the reception of the Queen next day at the new law courts , and which workingmen contrasted with the bars mainta4ned by the Government at the doors of the British Museum and National Gallery on the same day . The commandments must accommodate themselves to British royalty , not because it is royal , but because it is British . The people do not believe in equality , and therefore their " grand old man " does not . They do believe in democracy , and so therefore does he . Mr. Gladstone is never found espousing the cause of a minority . A principle is invisible to him until it has the support of the country ; then he will discover one , even where it is invisible to all other eyes . Thus , after fifty storm-and-stress years of parliamentary life , Gladstone remains an Englishman . As the " Pinafore " chorus says : " Despite of all temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** In this case the other nations would be the new England represented by the Dissenters , the Rome of Ritualists , Norman caste , European culture , and continental skepticism . With most of these Mr. Gladstone has coquetted , or formed friendly relations , but he has never given himself to them . On the contrary , he has far more brought them over to the Right Centre , of which he is the embodiment . It could only have been a personal force that had the weight of this little English planet pulling with it , which was able to put John Bright into court dress , and even for a time into war-paint . Sir Charles Dilke , and Fawcett , coming under the same attraction , forget the radical wild oats they used to sow , and Chamberlain brings Americanized Birmingham , with its caucus , to be made into the bulwark of a new sacerdotal liberalism . Ritualism is rather irreconcilable toward the man who once accompanied its devotees to the very door of Romanism , but Dissent receives his patronage with ecstasies . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Mr. Gladstone sanctioned the principle that a state church // is the creature of a majority ; the dissenters have only to roll up a majority against the English Church , and that would have to go too . They will never be able to do it . When the Church of England is disestablished it will not be in favor of non-conformism , but more probably in favor of something which it hates more than the Church . However , the reduction of the Church in Ireland to the condition of a sect , and the secularization of its endowments , were in harmony with the non-comformist programme in the rest of the kingdom , and it strengthened Mr. Gladstone 's hold on the dissenting sentiment . Yet it must be remembered that , whatever objections the sects may have to lords spiritual , they generally have as decided a weakness for lords temporal as other Englishmen have . The ideal of the country is not in the direction of abolishing the peers , but of seeing them all falling into file under the headship of a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jubilee ministry just announced , in which Gladstone is seen with twenty titled servants in his political livery ; while , on the other hand , the aristocratic bosom swells with pride at observing that , out of the fourteen seats in the new cabinet , ten are filled by members of their order . It must be confessed , however , that Mr. Gladstone has not always held his head erect above these decorated shoulders of his government . The appointment of Lord Frederick Cavendish to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland seems hardly explicable by any other theory than that of his overweening esteem for the one nobleman of his family connection . Whether any personal feeling mingled with the Prime Minister 's practical reply to the murders in Pho*nix Park , Dublin , or whether under the blow he merely relapsed for a time into a rough plane of English pluck , in either case a great opportunity was lost . Ninety-nine hundredths of the disaffected Irish people , recoiling from that horror , held out a pleading hand to England , and the Government struck it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the hope that had risen in many minds that the blood of this young nobleman , who had gone to Ireland as a messenger of conciliation , might secure an atonement , which would be the best consolation for a great bereavement . But the moral sense of Ireland had been aroused only to be humiliated , and the obvious aim of the assassins , to prevent reconciliation , was rendered successful by the angry answer of the Government . Au impressive cartoon appeared // in Dublin , representing Mr. Gladstone handcuffing Ireland at the moment when a masked figure is stabbing her in the back This kind of resentment , however , is by no means characteristic of Mr. Gladstone . On the contrary , he has often shown himself-as in the withdrawal from the conflict with the Boers , and the restoration of Cetewayo - able to do what he considered right in the face of taunts about " yielding to pressure , " " want of courage , " and the like . There were sneers enough of that kind when he released the Irish " suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a very high order has been shown once more in the case of Arabi . A very severe pressure was brought to bear upon Mr. Gladstone to induce him to make that enthusiast , the most scholarly of Egyptians , a scapegoat for all offenses in the land of bond-holders . This pressure was labeled with the name of " British honor , * but beneath it was the French desire that England should alienate Egyptian popular sentiment , and the Tory desire that the Premier should alienate the moral sentiment of his own countrymen . The pardon of Arabi-f or his residence in Ceylon amounts to thatwas a bitter disappointment to his enemies , and greatly strengthened his position . It prepared the way for the general adoption of Lord Derby 's naive moral justification of the invasion of Egypt ,  --  namely , that the Government did n't mean it , but was compelled to change a threat into an act by the rash boldness of the Egyptians when France withdrew from the demonstration . The possession of Arabi is now an English mortgage on Egyptian good-will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , and no one will be surprised if , in the future , he shall visit London , and return to Egypt as the most useful ally of the nation which conquered him . The University of Athens has just voted a considerable sum for a statue to Mr. Gladstone . That will be the first visible memorial to an Englishman in the classic land . It will be set up in homage to his writings about Homer , and his restoration of Greek nationality . If a critical German or English specialist in Greek scholarship were asked who knows least about Homer , he would probably reply , " Gladstone . " If an ethnologist , or a continental politician , were asked who knows least about the Greeks of to-day , he would probably make a similar reply . The ancient and contemporary Greece of Mr. Gladstone is strictly conventional , his Homeric ideas antiquated , his enthu // siasm for Hellenism Byronic . But this conventionalism he lias made a political fact , and a factor of European state-craft ; so that Greece properly raises a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Gladstone 's relations to the Greece and Rome , and the Palestine also , which exist at his own doors . He does not know what it is to doubt . Lord Beaconsfield , born on St. Thomas 's Day , stood between Judaism and Christianity , between the past and the future , as if all the solstitial spirits had hovered over that day of his nativity , the shortest day of the year , which it terminated in the preChristian calendar . He said , " The impossible always comes to pass . " But Mr. Gladstone has never looked beyond what has come to pass , and never halts before a speculative future . His powers are concentrated upon the surfaces before him . Others may look beneath the facts ; he will make the most of them just as they appear . Etymologically , his name is from the Scottish " glead-stane , " meaning " hawk stone , " and it has a quaint coincidence with his beak-like nose , his far-reaching eye , and a sort of predatory expression in his general look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totem as an orator . He hovers for a little , softly poises , then swoops down on his point , or upon his antagonist , and makes the feathers fly . This force , as of a winged thunderbolt , is very admirable when one sees it pouncing upon somebody else 's opinions with which one happens to have little or no sympathy ; but it becomes formidable when it is found hovering near one 's own brood . Outside of politics , Mr. Gladstone takes the same conventional view *that he does of Homer and Greece , but with the same formidable power to make it out the right view against all competitors . Whether it be religion , church , literature , philosophy , or smaller things like Trojan reliques and clerical vestments ,  --  for he aspires to play many parts ,  --  he brings to the treatment of each question an unquestioning method , a moral earnestness , and a solemn ingenuity , which carry a weight of authority equally to things about which he does know and things about which he does not know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every progressive investigator in non-political subjects , Mr. Gladstone is a chief of the Phiistines . An advocate without wig , a clergyman without gown , and with a character that still more disarms suspicion , this most uncon*eious of casuists has consecrated more commonplaces with // the rhetoric of liberalism than any Englishman living . Emerson , speaking of eloquence , said there is an acceptable statement possible for every man of that proposition he is most unwilling to believe ; but here is an eloquence which can invest with the dignity of high philosophy that which every man is most anxious to believe . Whatever influence this superficial universality of Mr. Gladstone may exert on the higher culture of his country , there can be no doubt that it is characteristic of his profound organic relation to the people he represents . He is the President of England , and nothing English is foreign to him . He is not a factitious president ,  --  no king in frock-coat whose greatness is put on at one election and taken off at another . He is a president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his only halo is the luster of his services ; his authority is the precise weight of his character and ability . I had nearly written genius , and , taking Carlyle 's definition of genius as an infinite capacity for taking pains , one can hardly deny it to Mr. Gladstone . Although it must be denied him , and it must be admitted that his capacity is for work rather than taking pains , he is all the more the phenomenal political figure of Europe . What the natural development of constitutional monarchy must inevitably be was foreshadowed by the Laureate when he spoke of England as the " crowned republic * but it has come very near realization under the administration of a prime minister who has given jewels to the crown that shine through its somber veil like stars . A war with Russia averted , a serious difficulty with the United States settled by arbitration , the Irish Church abolished , the equal rights of married women entirely secured , the ballot , the laws revised and the courts reorganized in a grand edifice removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national education ,  --  these are eminently the achievements of an English president who , for over fifty years , had no dignity to which his ambition could aspire higher than the services he could render his country .
