IN my last article the conduct of the War was chiefly examined from the Northern side . Turning now to the South , the contrast in its management by the Confederate leaders during this part of the War is very conspicuous . Already the general scheme of the War had practically passed under General Robert Lee 's direction , though in the earlier period he acted only as adviser to the President , whilst Johnston commanded the army between Richmond and Washington in the Peninsula . There are some who think that war is a game of pure chance , in which great leaders form their plans on some unintelligible inspiration which guides them as to the right course to be pursued , that they draw nothing from the experience of earlier wars , and that none can tell why one man succeeds and another fails . Let those who think thus call to mind the words I have quoted from Stonewall Jackson , drawn absolutely and merely from his knowledge of war , as learned from the great leaders of former days . Then let them observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jackson on the minor scale applied them , and to how great an extent the triumphs of their armies were due to the skilful application of those principles . Moreover , since , as Burns tells us , the best-laid schemes " o ' mice and men gang aft agley , " let them note how , when the men failed , the principles asserted their importance . In the first place , consider the respective forces in the Shenandoah Valley and neighboring departments . Jackson had an available force at first , in the beginni.ng of March , 1862 , of about 5,000 men , strengthened at the beginning of May by Ewell 's division , which raised his army to perhaps 14,000 men . According to the careful estimate of the editors ( note page 285 ) , there were opposed to him in the Valley 44,840 men . In addition , there were in // the neighboring departments , available for the march on Richmond , a number of troops that brought up their forces to 80,000 men . As a great strategic question , the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shenandoah Valley was to keep occupied and retain there as large a number of the Federal forces as possible , so that the main Confederate army engaged in the decisive issue against McClellan should have every possible chance . In fact , it was Jackson 's role to prevent any reinforcements from being sent to McClellan , and , above all things , to create an alarm at Washington for the safety of that capital . In his first action at Kerustown , when he was acting purely on the defensive , Jackson 's object was simply to " mystify " the enemy as to his actual numbers . This he accomplished , time after time , by the choice of strong positions , where , without committing himself to a decisive action , he was still able to deal with considerable portions of the enemy 's forces . In these operations , therefore , he qualified his general principle , " to remain quiescent in presence of superior force , " by giving battle whenever attacked by fractions of the Union forces . He succeeded in his larger purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop any further troops being withdrawn from the Valley , and Banks 's corps , then on its march to the Potomac , was stopped and turned back towards Winchester . This action at Kernstown took place on March 23 , 1862 , and it was on his arrival at Fort Monroe , on April 2 , that General McClellan received a telegram withdrawing 10,000 men from his command . It is , therefore , reasonable to conclude that this weakening of the Army of the Potomac was consequent upon Jackson 's demonstration towards Winchester with a tiny army , whose vigor caused its strength to be , as usual , so greatly exaggerated . Thus he had already begun " mystifying and misleading " his enemy . It is , however , his next moves which afford the most brilliant illustrations of his military principles . His sudden disappearance and supposed flight from Port Republic , allowing despair to setUe on the minds of all of his friends in the Valley , had the result he intended ; that is , their genuine beliefs and anxieties at once reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enabled him to use the very trains he had collected for a supposed start for Richmond , to take him back in time to crush the foremost pursuers at the village of McDowell . So completely , despite the // disparity of numbers between 14,000 and 44,800 men , had he shown how " a small army may destroy a large one in detail " that , as General Schenck , who commanded against him , tells us , " the only question was , how best to extricate ourselves from this disadvantageous position in the presence of a force of the enemy largely superior in numbers . " Then came another mysterious disappearance . Again with superior numbers he struck Fort Royal , surprised it , scattered the force opposed to him , and then " never let up in the pursuit " as long as his men had strength to follow . He then passed round the rear of Banks 's intrenchments at Strasbourg and struck him in flank as he retreated , capturing 3,000 men and enormous quantities of stores , and creating the wildest alarm at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McDowell , then on the march to join McClellan , was ordered back , and told to detach 20,000 men to the Shenandoah Valley . It was impossible for Jackson to maintain himself long in the field with such greatly superior forces opposed to him . These brilliant successes , however , appear to me models of their kind , both in conception and in execution . They should be closely studied by all officers who wish to learn the art and science of war . His action at Cross Keys against Fr6mont , by which he kept him apart from Shields , contriving first to fight Fr6mont 's 10,500 men with 13,000 in a favorable position , and then to crush Shields with 3,000 men , was an operation which stamped him as a military genius of a very high order . It must be remarked that McClellan was not taken in by these operations . He saw through them , and understood their object : not so , however , those who ruled at Washington . BrillianI as these operations were , they would have missed their point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , at the end of them , to join in the attack on the right wing of McClellan 's army at Gaines 's Mill . These operations in the Shenandoah Valley not only reduced to quiescence and inactivity the greatly superior Federal forces in that region , but made Mr. Lincoln feel anxious lest the Capital should be attacked from that quarter . To cover the heavy blows he struck within the Valley , Jackson had already so often spread false rumors of an immediate transfer of his force to Richmond that now , when really about to move there , the common rumor of his intention was not believed . The manner in which he thus mystified his // *erny regarding this most important movement was a masterpiece . The one thing necessary was to disappear from all knowledge of the enemy immediately after he had delivered his last stunning blows in the Valley . For some time he left his cavalry watching the defeated enemy , whose ignorance of his whereabouts greatly increased the alarm at Washington . The effect of his ably-devised and skilfully-executed moves is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of McDowell 's forward movement to join McClellan being stopped . It will thus be seen that Jackson 's 14,000 men had actually paralyzed the 80,000 Federal troops who were available in the theatre of his operations for a march upon Richmond . Whilst Jackson 's operations in the Shenandoah Valley had kept Richmond safe from alarms on that side , they had served to keep Washington in continnal alarm . At last the mere terror he inspired became so far a substitute for his presence that he was able to get away to assist Lee in punishing the further error which Stanton 's follies had entailed upon McClellan . The extension across th' Chickahominy exposed the isolated right flank of the Federal army to the deadly blow which was about to be delivered against it . For that operation , with only the troops before Richmond , Lee had hardly sufficient strength . The transfer thither of Jackson 's corps , however , effected the concentration of all the forces of the Confederacy then between Richmond and Washington . Lee was thus enabled to strike McClellan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Jackson 's Valley operations was so great at Washington that McClellan could not expect any reinforcements . It was much easier to conceal from McClellan the direction of Jackson 's move than it would have been that of any other force then in his front . In looking at the methods in detail by which this mystification of his enemy was secured , I am specially amused by the story which is told by General Imboden of General Whiting . After General Whiting 's first interview withh Jackson , and just at the moment when secrecy was absolutely necessary to the success of Jackson 's transfer to the Chickahominy , we are told that General Whiting came away " in a towering passion , and declared that Jackson had treated him ontrageously , " and then , by way of explanation , added : " Oh , hang him ! he was polite enough . But he did n't say one word about his plans . I finally asked him for // orders , telling him what troops I had . He simply told me to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't the slightest idea what they will be . I believe he has n't any more sense than my horse . " How often have subordinates left their leader 's headquarters under a similarly false impression ! To dissemble well is an art useful to the general . Before this paper is finished it will be necessary to suggest that on one occasion General Lee himself suffered pretty severely for omitting a precaution of the kind . There are , of course , times when it is most necessary that subordinate officers should thoroughly understand and should have studied the general scope of the operations in which they are to co√∂perate . No pains can then be too great to insure that all thoroughly know the part to be played by every division , and how they themselves are to contribute to the result aimed at . As a rule , however , in these cases it is wise to let the plans be known as short a time beforehand as possible , and to take exceptional precautions that no knowledge even of their existence should leak out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then contemplating , there could be no need for a man in General Whiting 's position to know it . Without knowing it at the time , he allowed his personal vanity to feel hurt because his curiosity had not been satisfied , and from this combined influence arose the unworthy want of confidence in his chief which here found vent in words . The vanity of small-minded subordinates makes them long to be consulted in the plans under consideration , and often to resent , as General Whiting did on this occasion , the reticence of their chief . Now , these are just the kind of considerations which have to give way in war . What is known and believed in your own army is sure to reach the enemy , and before long to be known and believed in all his camps . Rumor has a thousand tongues , and it is amazing how many ears supply the tongue with information . The difficulty which arises when plans are communicated to nobody whatever must be freely admitted ; for if the general be killed , his plans die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one or two of these papers , raised as an objection to Jackson 's method , does not , I think , apply , because all his plans were known to Johnston or to Lee , with whom , whilst in the Shenandoah Valley , he was always in telegraphic communication . Any one who had succeeded to his command would naturally have applied by telegraph to Richmond // for further instructions . As a rule , this difficulty is easily met by imparting confidence to the one officer who is usually necessary for the execution ot details . That is one reason why it is so important to have a chief of the staff of rank , as the right-hand man of a commanding general . It was evidently Jackson 's practice always to communicate his plans to one confidential subordinate . Indeed , so thoroughly does this seem to have been understood by his staff that Colonel Kyd Douglas ( page 622 ) uses the expression , " It was my turn this day to be intrusted with the knowledge of his purpose . " A general who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon exciting at least some temporary ill-feeling among those of his subordinates who do not understand his method , who have not as yet learned to trust their chief implicitly , and who have not learned from the study of war to appreciate to the full the importance of secrecy and of the mystification of an enemy . That is one of the reasons why it is so indispensable for a man intrusted with high command to have about him those who do understand and fully trust him . The arrival of a man , no matter how able a soldier he may be , who allows himself to entertain towards his commanding officer the feelings of General Whiting , is a danger to the service of a state proportionate to the importance of his rank and the influence and authority which he exercises . The brilliancy of Jackson*s moves was marred by one flaw at the last . It is clear that he underestimated by nearly twenty-four hours the time when he could get his force into position to deliver its great blow against McClellan 's right flank . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which cost the Confederates dear . I incline to attribute this to the fact that Jackson did not know the Peninsula as well as he knew the Shenandoah Valley . Apparently the roads by which he had been previously moving were at least fairly good when compared with the execrable bush roads  --  and even they were few in number-over which Lee and McClellan were then moving . His marvellously rapid marches could not have been made if they had not been so . The roads in the valley of the Chickahominy were of mud , which Napoleon , when suffering , during his Polish campaigns , from the same difficulty , called the " fifth element . " Those marches of McClellan which created so much annoyance in Washington by their slowness-fifty-two miles in sixteen days-show how // the mud was impeding movement on both sides . Relatively , therefore , Jackson 's move was , in all probability , exhaustingly rapid ; an effort made by his enthusiastic troops to accomplish what proved to be the impossible task for which he had pledged himself to Lee . Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Richmond to have the ground in the Peninsula thoroughly surveyed and reported on . From all accounts it is clear that in this respect the Northern troops had a great advantage . Pains were taken by McClellan , whose education made him realize the importance of good maps , to have surveys and reports made of the whole country during his occupation of it . The Confederates , as so often happens with troops in their own country ,  --  as was the case , for instance , with the French in 1870 ,  --  had omitted this precaution , and they paid dearly for the neglect . If the belief is correct that Jackson 's troops had made a most exhausting effort prior to the battle of Gaines 's Mill , that would account for the fact which has been so much commented on , and which produced so injurious an effect on the subsequent seven-days ' battles , that Jackson did , after Gaines 's Mill , " let up in the pursuit . " His qualification of his own principle explains it ,  --  " as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a point at which human energy , with the best troops , reaches its limit . Probably that limit had been passed by the end of the battle of Gaines 's Mill . It is desirable here to leave for the moment General Jackson at the end of his Shenandoah campaign and of his attack on McClellan 's flank , and turn oack to a period in the Peninsula antecedent to that attack . There is , obviously , some mystery which has not as yet been cleared up , which two men only can clear up , and on which they , for some reason or other , both seem indisposed to enlighten us , as to tjiie first day 's battle at Seven Pines . General Smith 's account of that fight clearly throws the responsibility for the failure to crush the Federal left wing upon General Longstreet . Yet there were no written orders given to General Longstreet , and General J. E. Johnston himself seems unwilling to speak pointedly as to what his actual orders to Longstreet were . It seems to be writ large on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Johnston 's plans , as explained by General Smith , had been fully carried out during the early morning ,  --  as it seems they easily might have been ,  --  the whole of the Federal forces south of // the Chickahominy on that morning would have been broken up , dispersed , or captured , and in all probability the slowly-arriving detachments , from the north bank would , in their turn , have been driven into the river and destroyed . When two soldiers like Johnston and Longstreet decline to discuss the question , we have no business to try to set them by the ears . The deductions from the facts are in no way affected by the question as to which was to blame for allowing McClellan 's forces to escape destruction . There can be no doubt , it would seem , that here , as elsewhere , bad maps and insufficient acquaintance with the ground were largely responsible for the confused crossing by the Confederate corps commanders of one another 's routes , and for that dislocation of the intended order of battle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan 's army stood , part on one side and part on the other of a river liable to sudden floods , and apt in those floods to break down all means of communication across it , was a very dangerous one , is obvious at once . It is very evident that , as long as General J. E. Johnston was operating only with the army then present at Richmond , the Federal left wing was the right fraction for him to strike at . As the army defending Richmond could be wholly concentrated to the south of the Chickahominy without exposing the Capital , which lay well to the south , a sudden and secret movement against McClellan 's left flank was easy , whilst an attack upon the right flank would have been tedious and difficult . The moment selected for the attack was happily chosen immediately after the river had risen in sudden flood . All that failed was the execution . In war there is in regard to almost every question a Scylla as well as a Charybdis to be avoided . When an elaborate combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out by aid of very imperfect maps , it would have been better to have written orders explaining the whole situation prepared and given personally at the last moment to each of the commanders , the utmost precaution being taken against the loss of any one of the copies . It was a case in which , even if in the course of the day a copy had fallen into the enemy 's hands , it would have profited him very little . Nothing could have enabled the Federal forces to the north of the Chickahominy to arrive in time to support the left , or the left to escape over the Chickahominy , if the Confederate corps had taken their proper directions . Nevertheless , here as elsewhere , // one can only say that men , like mice , will often fail in their best efforts . By the second day the golden hours and opportunity had slipped away . The lost moment never returns in war . It is interesting to compare this scheme of Johnston 's with Lee 's plan for attacking the right wing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak right wing of the Federals was now to the north of the Ohickahominy River , as when Johnston attacked it had been on the south side , and Jackson 's corps was now free to move , because of the paralysis of the troops against whom he had been contending . Moreover , the course of Jackson 's operations had brought him relatively near to Richmond , and Stuart 's brilliant ride round McClellan had given Lee full information as to the distribution of the Federal forces . The destruction of the Federal right would cut off McClellan 's whole force from his original base . It is clear that at a very early date Lee anticipated the possibility of McClellan 's transferring his communications to the James River , and may have calculated on that move before he ordered the attack on the Federal right wing . Such a change of base by McClellan would not affect the fact that the defeat of that wing would deprive the Federal army of vast supplies , and would provide the Confederates with stores of which they stood sorely in need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal right could , by the arrival of Jackson 's force , be developed with better chance of its being a surprise than any attack on the Federal left could have been . It is , therefore , clear that Lee 's selection for his point of attack was as sound at Gaines 's Mill as Johnston 's attack on the left was at Seven Pines . The fact  --  a fact fully reckoned upon by Lee-that McClellan was counting upon the Federal forces west of the Blue Ridge to detain Jackson in the north , and that he was continually appealing on this subject to the authorities at Washington , helped to make the movement more deadly . Lee contrived very cleverly to make it be thought in the Federal army and at Washington that he was sending reinforcements to the Shenandoah Valley , when Jackson was in reality on his way to Mechanicsville . The one just defence which McClellan is able to offer for the dangerous division of his army astride the Chickahominy is that , accordin* to his statement ,  --  and it is undisputed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington , the object being that he might keep in communication with the force under McDowell , which , however , never came to his assistance . As qnoted by Colonel Irwin ( page 437 ) , McClellan said : " Our men at Gaines 's Mill did all that men could do , . . . but they were overwhelmed by vastly superior nnmbers , even after I brought my last reserves into action . . . . I have lost this battle because my force is too small . " Clearly this assertion is not borne out by the facts . The last reserves of the whole army were never brought into action because they were then south of the Chickahominy River . The battle was lost because , owing to the separation of the right wing of the Federal army from its left by that river , it was possible to throw the mass of the Confederate army in a deadly direction upon a fraction of the army opposed to it . This answer is evident ; it is complete . Without doubt the authorities at Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small to occupy the position which they had ordered it to assume . But , according to my views as to the powers and responsibilities of a general commanding in the field , McClellan can never be excused , under the shelter of Government orders , for placing his army in the false , and therefore the dangerous , position it was in when attacked on the Chickahominy . It was the gravest of errors , for which he had to pay in reputation , and his army in blood . Only by reinforcing his army to such an extent that the position on each bank of the river should be equal to the whole Confederate army , Jackson included , could his position astride the Chickahominy have been excusable , and even then the situation would not have been free from danger . Most people will agree with the Comte de Paris that McClellan had a tendency greatly to exaggerate the numbers of the forces immediately opposed to him  --  a failing which led him frequently into a hesitating mode of action , which was of great advantage to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play and temperament of your opponents , you may often score points which the mere routine play of the game would not give you , so it would seem that Lee and Jackson , who personally knew McClellan , each counted on this quality of his mind . Oddly enough , just as at whist , play of this kind may sometimes be punished , if the player against you is for once , for any reason , above his mark : so in the subsequent campaign Lee and Jackson // found that they had reckoned without their host . But of this it will be convenient to speak more fully presently . The retreat to the James was an exfremely ably-conducted operation , carried out under great difficulties and , above all , in the presence of such opponents as Lee and Jackson . It ought not to have succeeded as it did : had the defeated army been pressed as it should have been , it must have been destroyed . For some reason or other , however , Jackson and his army did not show their usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted by those who fought in the campaign . Whether the reason suggested for this be the true one or not can never now be fully known . It is not possible now to deal fairly with the reputation of a great soldier who has left no records to explain his action or his difficulties . With the greatest respect for General Longstreet as a soldier , it must be admitted that there is at times a tone in his writing about both Lee and Jackson which grates on the ear . Any general who has commanded such numbers in the field as he has done , must know how often criticism is unjust to leaders , whose surrounding circumstances , whose motives and intentions we can never now have fully laid before us . Surely we ought to judge them by what they accomplished in those instances where we do fully know and understand all that took place . The excuse made for Jackson in one of these papers , that he was only at his best when he was acting entirely on his own responsibility , is neither satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon him as his most effective agent , but the saying of Jackson about Lee , elswhere recorded- " That man is a phenomenon ; I would follow him blindfold anywhere " - shows how perfect may be the subordination of one really able general to another , when it happens to be his duty for the time to play second fiddle . It is said to be just possible that at the epoch of the War marked by the seven-days ' campaign Jackson had not yet learned to appreciate Lee 's genius as fully as he did later ; few will , however , attach much importance to this notion . Next comes one of those periods when Jackson , under circumstances most trying to an energetic man , strictly adhered to his own principles . Despatched to the north to meet the forces which were gathering under Pope , he had , in consequence of the insufficiency of his force , to remain inactive from July 12 to August 9 , 1862 . These are just the times when every newspaper in a democratically-governed // country begins to cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor will any previous reputation for zeal and activity save him from such charges . They were constantly and freely preferred against the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula during some of his most wise and necessary pauses in that long contest , and after some of his most brilliant victories had shown the world of what stuff he was made , and had shown England how entirely she could trust him . Jackson , however , was strictly adhering to his own principle , " Never fight against heavy odds , if by any possible mano*uvring you can hurl your own force on only a part , and that the weakest part , of your enemy , and crush it . " For the latter purpose it is often necessary to bide one 's time , and to have patience in biding it , which is not always easy . In this instance the time was entirely independent of anything that Jackson could do . As Lee puts it , " The uncertainty that then surrounded the designs of McClellan rendered it inexpedient to reinforce him Jackson from the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are seldom taken into full account in the ranks of an army , and very rarely indeed by sensational newspaper writers , who , during a war , discourse so learnedly on all that goes on . Had this time of waiting been longer than , fortunately for Jackson , it actually was , his " inactivity " would doubt . less have been the subject of many a savage leading article . In these days of telegraphic daily reports , even three uneventful weeks  --  the tune during which he actually remained quiescentmay suffice to damn the fairest military reputation . However , on July 27 , 1862 , A. P. Hill 's division was ordered to join Jackson . As soon as Hill joined him , mark with what rapidity he acted ! On August 9 he caught Banks at Cedar Mountain , and once more showed how a small army may be superior at the point of contact to the fractions of a larger . His superiority was not great ,  --  20,000 to 17,900 , according to the best estimates ,  --  but it was sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their war-tried experience under him , were elements which added indefinitely to his fighting strength . The wide-sweeping move round Pope , which followed , depended for its success , first , on Jackson 's faculty for carrying out a secret manouvre , secondly , on the trained marching rapidity of his troops , and , lastly , on the fact , which had become apparent to the Confederate generals , that the Washington authorities had so tied Pope to a post that // 176 it was safe to march round him because he could not move . It is rather remarkable that , in General Pope 's description of the campaign , he appears to treat the loss of the stores at Manassas Junction as a trifling matter . In the long run , no doubt , that loss may not have been very important to the well-supplied Northern armies ; but there can be no question that both by its material and moral effects it enormously increased the demoralization of the Union army after the second defeat of Bull Run . Before that battle it exercised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers in their commander , however much justification he may have for throwing the responsibility for it upon other shoulders . In a campaign men do not nicely argue out questions of abstract justice ; it is the broad effects which tell on the spirit of an army . There can be no doubt that , in fighting the second Bull Run , the successful raid was worth several thousand men to the Confederates , from the encouragement it afforded them and the depression it produced among their opponents . When I was with General Lee 's army at Winchester , in the autumn of 1862 , the soldiers in every camp laughingly spoke of Pope as " Stonewall Jackson 's Commissary , " so entirely had Jackson in the " Pope Campaign " depended upon capturing from that General everything he required for his men . To put in practice Jackson 's principle of bringing a small army to bear upon the fractions of a large one , it is often necessary to employ a portion of that little army , in a strong position , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . Jackson practised this when he employed some of his troops in the passes of the mountains to hold Fr6mont in check , whilst with all the troops he could collect he moved to attack Banks . It is clear that this was also Lee 's object at the battle of South Mountain . He sought to check the advance of the Federal Army whilst Jackson overwhelmed the garrison of Harper 's Ferry . As far as I can follow the circumstances , it seems to me that , if Jackson was to secure the desired result , Lee was right in what he did . I can not see how , if Lee had at once fallen back in the way suggested by General Longstreet , Franklin could have been prevented from relieving Harper 's Ferry . On the other hand , from the evidence before me in these papers , it would appear that several things happened which neither Lee nor Jackson had anticipated . It is interesting to note what these events // were and how they came about . General Walker quotes Jackson as saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I knew McClellan , but this movement of his puzzles me . " Though a good deal of Walker 's evidence has been disputed , I do not think that anything brought forward tends to shake this statement , which is very precise , and not one about which memory would be likely to mislead . This commentary of Jackson upon McClellan , before devising the plan of campaign at Frederick , and the remark made by Lee ( also quoted ) - namely , " Are you acquainted with General McClellan ? " - prove that both Lee and Jackson planned their course of action upon what they believed to be a just estimate of McClellan 's character and of his genius for caution . Th. demoralization of Pope 's army was well known to the Confederate generals . It seems clear to me that Lee counted upon it , and upon McClellan 's slowness , to enable him to take Harper 's Ferry and , perhaps , to move beyond it before McClellan had reorganized his army . In this calculation Lee was mistaken . All the descriptions we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rode out to meet it returning beaten , disorganized , and demoralized from the second battle of Bull Run , agree in this - that the fact of his presence with it restored confidence to all ranks . I would ask those who have not been in the habit of considering the conditions which determine the power or weakness of an army in war to read these accounts of McClellan 's reception by his army . Let them observp the reports made by all upon the state of the army as it retreated , or rather fled , to Washington ; mark the impression produced on Mr. Lincoln and Stanton as to the utter powerlessness of the Union Army to stop the Confederates and to save Washington . Let them note the conviction in the minds of Lee and Jackson that this army was so shaken that it could not be in a state to fight for at least three weeks or more ; and then let them turn to that summary , made in the last article , of the blunders , the ignorant self-confidence , and the folly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of the Army of Virginia . All those mistakes were now coming home to roost , with consequences fatal to the power of the army . The troops had no confidence in their leader , no confidence in themselves . Here , visibly , under the eyes of the man who had caused all this disaster , though probably even then he did not realize his own absolute and complete responsibility as to the cer vot . OXUX. - *O. 339. 12 // taiii cause of it , the army was not going , but had gone , to pieces . He had imagined he could drive the horses of the Sun , and horses and he . were being dashed to pieces . He had attempted a task for which he was absolutely incompetent . He seems to have imagined that mere self-assertion would carry him through ; that the conduct of a campaign was the easiest and simplest thing imaginable , and that , if only he gave orders , the rest must go like clock-work . Suddenly the man who can drive the horses seizes the reins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a moment all is changed . Those who will be at the trouble to study the evidence for this story will see that it is no exaggeration . Now , what must have been , what was , according to his own account , the effect of all this upon McClellan himself ? The precise mistake which gentlemen like Mr. Stanton make lies in supposing that soldiers and armies are machines , instead of men living under certain special conditions-men whose ways and feelings and prejudices you must understand before you can command and lead them with advantage . But generals are as little machines as armies are . The Napoleon of 1Th6 and the Napoleon of Waterloo were two different men . So the cautious , rather cold-blooded , and indecisive , timid soldier whom Lee and Jackson had known at West Point , and had fought with in the Peninsula , was not the McClellan who felt himself to be the one man who had restored confidence to a beaten army . All at once he heard nothing around him but enthusiastic demands to be led forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , were only seeking safety in individual flight . No man could go through such an experience and not be affected by it . All the circumstances that had preceded this event tended to deepen its effect upon his mind . Failure in the Peninsula , for which he felt he was not to blame ; snubbing from ilalleck , who , whenever he appears on the scene , shows himself as the very incarnation of what Shakespeare meant by " the insolence of office " ; the sound of the guns of his distant army , which he was not allowed to join , while he felt it was being led to certain defeat through the incompetency of its commander ; his reception at Washington , where his warnings as to the condition of the Union Army were despised ; then the ample fulfilment of his worst fears , and the sight of the abject panic of those who , until that moment , were full of oVerweening confidence ; add to // all this the attempt made even at the last moment to hamper him ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rode out to meet his army , he seems to have regarded the proceeding almost in the light of a revolutionary act which his duty to the Nation had rendered necessary . All these things must have sent the blood coursing through his veins , bracing him for the supreme moment of triumph over his enemies in Washington which his enthusiastic reception by his old soldiers at length afforded him . Under such conditions , a man 's nature for the time may well be changed . How could McClellan help feeling a renewed confidence in himself , when he and all the army , and all those whom he believed to be his personal enemies , were thus convinced of his power by the efficiency restored to the army the moment *e appeared again as its leader ? Under ordinary circumstances , his methodical disposition might-perhaps it may be said certainly would-have led him to spend those weeks in reorganization upon which Lee had counted . But in the position in which he then found himself , it must have seemed to him that , as the disorganization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so his presence with it-hailed as it was by all ranks-was , of itself , sufficient to restore it to order and efficiency . He may well have thought , under these circumstances , that no weeks of repose were necessary to prepare it for battle , and may well have looked only for some good opportunity to test its fighting value , now that it had been again placed under his command . It must , indeed , have been * proud event of his life , for he felt that he alone of all men was able to restore heart and life to that beaten army as it streamed back towards Washington . All he now wanted was that Lee should afford him the opportunity to show what that army , under the spell of his name , could accomplish . This General Lee was preparing to offer him , and a lucky accident suddenly placed in his hands the full detail of Lee 's intended plan of operations . The paper containing it had been picked up by chance . From it he learns that Lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal army , had ordered Jackson to take Harper 's Ferry , whilst the main Confederate army had been broken up into several disunited fragments . The evidence is supplied in McClellan 's own letter to the editors of the Century , as to the importance which // he attached to this information ( page 603 ) . Within little more than an hour after McClellan had read that paper , orders for the advance of the Federal Army on South Mountain were given . But such moments of exaltation as that then experienced by McClellan are apt to bring their reaction after them . In this instance the character of the man reasserts itself when he arrives before the slender Confederate screen then in occupation of South Mountain . As usual , he allows himself to estimate the forces opposed to him as vastly greater than they really are , and to act as if they were so . Still , the vast numerical superiority of the Northern army could not but assert itself over the Confederates , reduced , by the straggling of the numbers of bare-footed men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting area . Lee had driven back the Army of the Potomac and that of Virginia to the point from which they had started in the spring and summer . He knew how demoralized those armies had become from repeated defeats , and he was fully aware of the scare which Pope 's disasters had occasioned at Washington . Mr. Lincoln was known to be very nervous for the safety of that capital . Lee felt that if he could but still further increase this fear of losing Washington , he might so retain the Federal armies in its neighborhood as to free the northern districts of XTirginia from all hostile occupation during the autumn . His object was to keep McClellan 's forces far away from Richmond until winter had so destroyed the roads as to render all field operations near that city practically impossible . Although a vast amount of valuable equipment and military stores had been taken by the " Army of Northern Virginia " from Pope , it was still a very badly-supplied army , and sadly in want of transport . Notwithstanding this fact , Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view was to invade Maryland , wherc the Southern cause had thousands of sympathizers , and by that operation keep the war at a distance from Richmond . Lee had , however , it seems to me , underestimated the revivifying influence which McClellan exerted over the Federal armies when again placed in actual command of them ; nor did Maryland afford him the assistance he had expected . He also miscalculated the time required for the capture of Harper 's Ferry  --  a miscalculation which placed him in a position of real danger . An enterprising commander* not impressed as McClellan always wa* // with the notion that his enemy was vastly stronger than he actually was , would then have pushed Lee very hard indeed . McClellan , with Lee 's plan of campaign in his pocket and the large force at his disposal , was in the position where a really great general would have destroyed an adversary who had crossed the Potomac and distributed his troops as Lee 's were on the 13th , 14th , 15th , and 16th September , 1862 . The battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was not strong enough to carry out an aggressive campaign against the now united armies of the North . From the moment that McClellan had restored confidence to the Northern army , and , thanks to the captured despatch , had made up his mind to act , it was obviously Lee 's policy to avoid fighting as much as possible and recross into Virginia . Antietam , though a battle unwittingly fought by him , was , however , unavoidable . It is necessary to estimate a general 's purposes in judging what he has gained or lost by a battle . That the actual result on the battle-. field was a Confederate victory seems to be little disputed . Lee had gained what he had hoped to secure by that battle , which was to make good his repassage of the Potomac . The Confederate army had won a battle , but had achieved no victory , whilst the Confederacy had failed in its intention to carry the war into ' the enemy 's country . Colonel Kyd Douglas states the case very fairly when he says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when , on the night of the 18th , he recrossed into Virginia , he left the prestige of the result witb McClellan . " ( Page 629 ) . Lee 's management of the battle against vastly superior forces was wonderfully successful . His retreat afterwards was as wise and . necessary as it was admirably conducted . It is only for schoolboys that retreat under such circumstances can be said to take anything from the prestige of men like Lee . He was soon to show , against generals who , as McClellan put it , " acted before they were ready , " how brilliantly he could deal with the opportunities victory gave him , as well as with circumstances which , as in this instance , made it necessary to prepare the way for retreat . I must reserve for the next article all notice of the few papers on the events in the West which appear in this second volume . They are too closely connected with those which follow in the third volume to be dealt with separately . WOLSELEY . To BE CONTINUED. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
