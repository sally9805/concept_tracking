THE MOCKING-BIRD 'S NEST . " Superb and sole upon a plum*d spray That o'er the general leafage boldly grew , " as literally as though Lanier had sketched that particular bird , stood the first free mocking-bird I ever heard . His perch was the topmost twig of the tallest tree in the group . It was a cedar , perhaps fifteen feet high , around which a jasmine vine had clambered , and that morning opened a cluster of fragrant blossoms at his feet , as though an offering to the most noted singer on our side of the globe . As I drew near he turned his clear , bright eye upon me , and sang a welcome to North Carolina ; and several hous s later , when the moon rose high over the waters of the Sound , he completed his perfect performance with a serenade , the like of which I fear 1 may never hear again . I chose to consider his attentions personal , because , of all the household , I am sure I was the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling and tossing ocean to make his acquaintance . Nothing would have been easier , or more delightful , than to pitch one 's tent in a certain pine grove not far away , and pass days and weeks in forgetting the world of cares , and reading favorite books , lulled at all hours of day and night by the softened roar of the ocean , and the wonderful bird " Singing the song of everything , Consummate sweet and calm . " // wished to know him ; nor to watch his dainty and graceful ways as he went about the daily duties of food-hunting , singing , and driving off marauders , which occupied his hours from dawn to late evening , and left him spirit enough for many a midnight rhapsody . It was in his domestic relations that I desired to see him , - the wooing of the bride and building the nest , the training of mocking-bird babies and starting them in the world ; and no loitering and dreaming in the pine grove , however tempting , would tell me this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had set up his homestead . Thoreau - or is it Emerson ? - says one always finds what he looks for , and of course I found my nests . One pair of birds I noticed through the courtship , the selection of the site , the building and occupying of the nest ; another couple , already sitting when discovered , I watched through the incubation and nursing of the little ones , and at last assisted in giving them a fair chance for their lives and a start in the world . It may be thought that my assistance was not particularly valuable ; the birds shared this opinion ; none the less , but for my presence not one of those birdlings would be free and happy to-day , as I hope and believe they are . To the study of these two households I gave nearly every hour of daylight , in all weathers , for a month , and of the life that went on in and around them I can speak from personal knowledge ; beyond that , and at other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mocking-bird . The bird whose nest-making I witne3sed was the one whose performance I chose to consider a welcome , and his home was in the pine grove , a group of about twenty trees , left from the original forest , possibly ; at any rate , nearly a hundred feet high , with all branches near the top , as tbough they had grown in close woods . They were quite scattering now , and lower trees and shrubs flourished in their shade , making a charming spot , and a home worthy even of this superb songster . The bird himself was remarkably friendly . Seeming to appreciate my attitude of admiring listener , he often perched on the peak of a low roof ( separated only by a carriage drive from the upper " gallery " where I sat ) , and sang for hours at a time , with occasional lunches ; or , as Lanier , his most ardent lover , has it , - " Then down he shot , bounced airily along The sward , twitched in a grasshopper , made song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Whatever he did , his eyes were upon me ; he came to the corner nearest me to sing , and was so intelligent in look and bearing that I believe he liked a quiet listener . His wooing , however , the bird did not intend me to see , though two or three times I surprised him at it . The first part that I chanced upon was curious and amusing . A female , probably the " beloved object , " stood demurely on one of the dead top branches of a large tree down in the garden , while her admirer performed fantastic evolutions in the air about her . No fly-catcher ever made half the eccentric movements this aerial acrobat indulged in . He flew straight up very high , executing various extraordinary turns and gyrations , so rapidly they could not be followed and described , and came back singing ; in a moment he departed in another direction , and repeated the grotesque performance . He was plainly exerting himself to be agreeable and entertaining , in mocking-bird style , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he perched a little nearer his audience of one , until , after some time , he stood upon the same twig , a few inches from her . They were facing and apparently trying to stare each other out of countenance ; and as I waited , breathless , to see what would happen next , the // damsel coquettishly flitted to another branch . Then the whole scene was repeated : the most singular and graceful evolutions , the songs , and the gradual approach . Sometimes , after alighting on a top twig , he dropped down through the branches , singing , in a way to suggest the " dropping song " so graphically described by Maurice Thompson , but never really falling , and never touching the ground . Each performance ended in his reaching the twig which she occupied and her flight to another , until at last , by some apparently mutual agreeinent , both flew , and I saw no more . A remarkable " dance " which I also saw , with the same bird as principal actor , seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resembled a war-dance as well ; but love is so like war among the lower orders , even of men , that it is hard to distinguish between them . I shall not try to decide , only to relate , and , I beg to say , without the smallest exaggeration . The dances I saw were strictly pas-de-deux , and they always began by a flash of wings and two birds alighting on the grass , about a foot apart . Both instantly drew themselves up perfectly erect , tail elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees , and wings held straight down at the sides . Thea followed a most droll dance . Number one stood like a statue , while number two prai*ced around , with short , mincing steps and dainty little hops which did not advance him an inch ; first he passed down the right , then turned and went down the left , all in the queer , unnatural manner of short hops and steps , and holding himself rigidly erect , while number one always faced the dancer , whichever way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , number one decided to participate , and when his paitner moved to the right he did the same to the left he still accompanied him , always facing , and maintaining the exact distance from him . Then number two described a circle around number one , who turned to face him with short ho1 s where he stood . Next followed a chass* of both birds to the right ; then a separation , one dancing to the right and the other to the left , always facing , and always slowly and with dignity . This stately minuet they kept up for some time , and appeared so much like a pair of old - fashioned human dancers that when , on one occasion , number two varied the performance by a spring over the head of his partner , I was startled , as if an old gentleman bad suddenly hopped over the head of the grand dame his v is  --  a - vis . When this strange new figure was introduced , number one i ) roved equal to the emerge hey , hopping backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were facing , and about a foot apart , as before . The object of all this was very uncertain to a looker-on . It might be the approaches of love , and dluite as probably the wary beginnings of war , and the next feature of the programme was not explanatory : they rose together in the air ten feet or more , face to face , fluttering and snatching at each other , apparently trying to clinch ; succeeding in doing so , they fell to the ground , separated just before they touched it , and flew away . 0 wings most madidening to a bird-student . It was not very long after these performances , which seem to me to belong to the courtship period , when I noticed that my bird had won his bride and they were busy house-hunting . The place they apparently preferred , and at 1 ' st fixed upon , was at a eery unusual height for mocking-birds , near the top of one of the tall pines , and I was no less surprised than pleased to see them lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated myself that at least one brood in North Carolina would have a chance to come to maturity and be free ; and so persistent is the warfare waged against this bird - unfortunately marketable at any stage from the // egg - that I almost doubt if another will . The day after they began building a northwest storm set in , and for three days we had high winds and cold weather . In spite of this , the brave birds persevered , and finished their nest during those three days , although much of the time they made infrequent trips . lit was really most touching to watch them at their unnatural task , and remember that nothing but the cruelty of man forced them to it ( one nest had been destroyed ) . Their difficulty was to get up against the wind , and , having little experience in flying upward , they made the natural mistake of starting from the foot of their chosen tree . Sometimes , at first , they flew with the body almost perpendicular ; and afterwards , when they held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so directly up that they turned the head back over the shoulder to see where they were going . The wind , too , beat them far out of their course , and they were obliged to alight and rest , occasionally being forced to cling to the trunk of a tree to recover breath and strength to go on . They never attempted to make the whole ascent at once , but always stopped four or five times , perching on the ends of fallen branches , of which there were eight or ten below the living part of the pine . Even when no wind disturbed them , they made these pauses on the way , and it was always a hard task to reach the top . They learned , after a few days , however , to begin their ascent at a distance , and not approach the tree till at least half as high as they wished to go , which simplified the matter very much . It was beautiful to see them , upon reaching the lowest of the living branches , bound gayly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular spot they had fixed upon . During the building I missed the daily music of the singer . Occasionally he alighted on the roof , looked over at me , and bubbled out a few notes , as much as to say , " You must excuse me now ; I am very busy ; " but all the time I hoped that while sitting was going on I should have him back . I reckoned ignorantly ; I did not know my bird . No sooner was he the possessor of a house and family than he suddenly became very wary . No more solos on the roof ; no more confidential remarks ; no more familiarities of any sort . Now he must beware of human beings , and even when on the grass he held himself very erect , wings straight down , every instant on guard . His happiness demanded expression in song , certainly , but instead of confining himself to the roof he circled the lawn , which was between two and three hundred feet wide . If he began in a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flew to the fence next the road without pausing in the music , and in a few minutes passed to the group of pines at the left , perched on a dead branch , and finished his song there . It was most tantalizing , though I could but admit it a proof of intelligence . Another change appeared in the bird with the advent of family cares : he was more belligerent ; he drove the bluebird off the lawn , he worried the tufted titmouse when it chanced to alight on his tree , and in the most offensive way claimed ownership of pine-trees , lawn , and all the fence bordering the same . Neighboring mocking-birds disputed his claim , and many a furious chase took place among the trees . ( So universal is their habit of insisting upon exclusive right to certain grounds that two mocking-birds are never found nesting very near each other , in that part of the country . This I was assured , and found it true of those I observed . ) These little episodes in his life kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the top of the tall pine , where , by the way , he went now and then to see how she was getting on . Sometimes his spouse received him amia // bly , but occasionally , I regret to say , I heard a " huff " from the nest that said plainly , " Do n't you touch those eggs ! " And what was amusing , he acknowledged her right to dictate in the matter , and meekly took his departure . Whenever she came down for a lunch , he saw her instantly , and was ready for a frolic . He dropped to the grass near her , and they usually indulged in a lively romp , chasino ' each other over and through the n trees , across the yard , around the garden , and back to the lawn , where she went on with her eating , and he resumed his singing . While I was watching the pine-tree household , the other nest , in the top of a low , flat-topped cedar , perhaps twentyfive feet high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . I could not see into the nest , for there was no building high enough to overlook it , but I could see the bird when he stood upon the edge . Sitting , in a warni climate , is not particularly close work . Although the weather was cool , yet when the sun was out the sitter left her nest from six to eight minutes at a time , and as often as once in twenty minutes . Of course in rain she had not so much liberty , and on some days left only when her mate was ready to take her place , which he frequently did . On the ninth day of my watching ( I had not seen the beginning of the sitting ) , the 3d of May , I found work was over and the youngsters were out . There was much excitement in the cedartree , but in a quiet way ; in fact , the birds became so silent and so wary in approaching the nest that it required the closest watching to see them go or come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beak . I discovered very soon that mocking - bird babies are brought up on hygienic principles , and have their meals with great regularity . For some time both parents were exceedingly busy , going and coming almost constantly ; then there came a rest of a half hour or more , during which no food was brought . Each bird had its own way of coming to the tree . Madam came over the roof of the cottage where I sat , and was exposed to view for only a few feet , over which she passed so quickly and silently that I had to be constantly on the alert to see her at all . The singer had another way , and by rising behind a hickory-tree beyond the cedar managed to keep a screen of branches between him and myself nearly every foot of the way . I could see them roth almost every time , but I could not always tell whether they carried food . Now the bluebird , honest soul , always stops in plain sight to rest , with his mouth full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand staring at one for two minutes with three or four wriggling worms in his beak . It is quite a different affair in the mockingbird family , as is certainly natural , after the persecution it has endured . No special fear of inc was the cause , - it is a marked peculiarity of the bird ; and I think , with a little study , one could learn to know exactly the moment the eggs hatch by the sudden silence and wariness of both birds . Poor little creatures ! a sympathetic friend hates to add to the anxiety they suffer , and he can not help a feeling of reproach when the brave little head of the family alights on the fence , and looks him straight in the eye , as if to demand why he is subjected to all this annoyance . I had to console myself by thinking that I was undoubtedly a providence to him ; for I am certain that nothing but my watching him so conspicuously that every negro within a mile saw me , saved his family to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day those nestlings were one week old they uttered their first cry . It was not at all a " peep , " but a cry , continued a few seconds ; at first only when food was offered to them , but as they increased // in age and strength more frequently . It was much like a high-pitched *-&amp;* , " and on the first day there was but one voice , which grew rapidly stronger as the hours went by . The next day another and a weaker cry joined the first , now grown assured and strong . But the music of the father was hushed the moment the youngsters began ; from that time until they had left the nest , he sang not a note in my hearing . Perhaps he was too busy , though he never seemed to work so hard as the robin or oriole ; but I think it was cautiousness , for the trouble of those parents was painful to witness . They introduced a new sound among their musical notes , a harsh squawk ; neither dog nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for nie , though I was meekness itself , taking the most obscure position I could find , and remaining as absolutely motionless as possible , they eyed me with suspicion ; from the first they " huffed " at me , and at this point began to squawk the moment I entered the gate . On one occasion I discovered that by changing my seat I could actually see the nest , which I much desired ; so I removed while the birds were absent . Madam was the first to return , with a beakful of food ; she saw me instantly , and was too much excited to dispose of her load . She came to my side of her tree , squawked loudly , flapping her wings and jerking herself about . I remained motionless , and did not look at her , pretending to be absorbed in my book ; but she refused to be mollified . It evidently did not please her to have me see so plainly ; she desired to retain the friendly screen of leaves which had secured her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I felt myself intrusive ; and at last I respected her wishes , and returned to my old place , when she immediately calmed down , and administered the food she had held till then . Poor mother ! those were trying times . Her solicitude overpowered her discre tion , and her manner proclaimed to every one within hearing that the nesthugs were out . Then , too , on the eighth day the little ones added their voices , and soon called loudly enough to attract the dullest of nest robbers . I was so fearful lest that nest should be disturbed that I scarcely dared to sleep o nights ; the birds themselves were hardly more anxious than I was . The eleventh day of the birdlings ' life was exceedingly warm , without a breath of air stirring , suffocating to humanity , but preeminently inspiring to mockingbirds , and every singer within a mile of me , I am sure , was singing madly , excepting the newly made parent . Upon reaching my usual seat I knew at once , by the louder cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after some searching through the tree I found him , -a yellowish-drab little fellow , with very decided wing-markings , a tail perhaps an inch in length , and soft slate - colored spots , so long as almost to be streaks , on the breast . He was scrambling about the branches , always trying to get a higher place , calling and perking his insignificant tail in true mocking - bird fashion . I think the parents disapproved this early ambition , for they did not feed him for a long time , though they passed him to go to the nest . So far from being lightened , their cares were greatly increased by the precociousness of the youngster , and from this moment their trouble and worry were grievous to see . So much self-reliance has the mockingbird , even in the nest , that he can not be kept there until his legs are strong enough to bear his weight , or his wings ready to fly . The full-grown spirit of the race blossoms out in the young one at eleven days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers that I wonder there is one left in the State . The parents , one after the other , came down on to a bush near my seat to remonstrate with me ; and I must admit that so great was my sympathy , and so // uncomfortable did I feel at adding in the least to their anxiety , that I should never have seen that young family fledged , onl** that I knew perfectly well what they did not , that I was a protection to them . I tried to reassure the mother by addressing her in her own language ( as it were ) , and she turned quickly , looked , listened , and returned to her tree , quieted . This sound is a low whistling through the teeth , which readily soothes cage birds . It interests and calms them , though I have no notion what it means to them , for I am speaking an unknown tongue . The baby on the tree was not quiet , climbing about the branches every moment that he was not engaged in dressing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly emancipated nestling . After an hour or more of watching there was a sudden stir in the family , and the youngster made his appearance on the ground . He was not under the side of the tree on which he had been resting , so , although I did not see the passage , I knew he had not fallen , as he is popularly said to do , but flown as well as he was able . I started slowly down the yard to examine the little stranger , but was absolutely startled by a cry from the mother , that sounded exactly like " Go way ! " as I have often heard a negro girl sayit . Later it was very familiar , a yearning , anxious , heart-aching sound to hear . The youth was very lively , starting off at once on his travels , never for an instant doubting his own powers . I saw his first movement , which was a hop , and , what surprised and delighted me , accompanied by a peculiar lifting of the wings , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the thin grass till he reached a fence , passed down beside it till a break in the pickets left an open place on the bottom board , sprang without hesitation upon that , and after a moment 's survey of the country beyond dropped down on the farther side . Now that was a lane much frequented by negroes , and , being alarmed for his safety , I sent boy after him , and in a moment had him in my hand . He was beautiful little creature , having a head covered with downy dark feathers , and soft black eyes , which regarded me with interest , but not at all with fear . All this ffme , of course , the parents were scolding and crying , and I held him only long enough to look carefully at him , when I replaced him on the grass . Off he started at once , ( lireetly west , - like the " march of empire , " - went through the same fence again , but farther down , and , as I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments was safely through a second fence into a comparatively retired old garden beyond , where I hoped he would be unmolested . Thus departed number one , with energy and curiosity , to investigate a brand-new world , fearless in his ignorance and self-confidence , although his entrance into the world had not been the triumphant fly we might look for , but an ignominious " flop , " and was irresistibly and ludicrously suggestive of the manner of exit from the home nest of sundry individuals of our own race , which we consider of much greater importance . The young traveler set out at exactly ten o'clock . As soon as lie was out of sight , though not out of hearing , - for the youngster , as well as the parents , kept the whole world of boys and cats well informed of his whereabouts for three days , - I returned , and gave my attention to number two , who was now out upon the native tree . This one was much more quiet than his predecessor . He did not cry , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time dressing his plumage , in preparation for the grand entr6e . At twelve o'clock he made the plunge , and came to the ground in a heap . This was plainly a bird of different disposition from number one ; his first journey evidently tired him . He found the world // hard and disappointing , so he simply stayed where he dropped in the middle of the path , and refused to move , though I touched him as a gentle reminder of the duty he owed to his parents and his family . He sat crouched upon the gravel and looked at me with calm black eye , showing no fear , and certainly no intention of moving , even indulging in a nap while I waited . Now appeared upon the scene several persons , both white and black , each of whom wanted a young mocking-bird for a cage ; but I stood over him like a godparent , and refused to let any one touch him . I began to fear that I should have him on my hands at last , for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he could not be hurried , and both were still busy following the vagaries of number one . The mother now and then returned to look after him , and was greatly disturbed by his unnatural conduct , - and so was I. He appeared stupid , as if he had come out too soon , and did not even know how to hop . It was twenty minutes by the watch before he moved . His mother 's calls at last aroused him ; he raised himself upon his shaky little legs , cried out , and started oft exactly as number one had done , - westward , hopping , and lifting his wings at every step . Then I saw by the enormous amount of white on his wings that he was a singer . He went as far as the fence , and there he paused again . In vain did the mother coax and scold ; in vain did I try to j ) ush him along . He simply knew his own will , and meant to have it ; the world might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . He rested in that spot fifteen or twenty minutes more , while I stood guard as before , and preserved him from cages of both negroes and whites . At last he did manage to squeeze through the fence , and , much relieved , I left him to the old birds , one of whom was down in the lot beyond the garden , no doubt following up his ambitious first-born . Whoever , meanwhile , was left in the nest had a poor chance of food , and one was already crying . It was not until six o'clock that the birds seemed to remember the nestling ; then it was well fed , and left again . Nothing would be easier than to follow the wandering youngsters , see how they got on and how soon they were able to fly , but this so disturbed the parents I had not the heart to do it ; and besides , I feared they would starve the infants , for one was never fed while I was near . Doubtless their experience of the human race forbade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was well that only two of the young appeared in one day , for keeping track of them was so serious a matter that two parents could scarcely manage it . Number three differed from both of his elders ; he was a cry-baby . He was not bright and lively like number one , and he did not squawk like number two , but he cried constantly , and at six i*. lvi . I left him calling and crying at the top of his voice . Very early the next morning I hastened to the scene of yesterday 's excitement . Number three was out on the tree . I could hear number two still crying and squawking in the garden , and from the position and labors of the male I concluded that number one was in the next lot . It was a dismal , damp morning , every grass blade loaded with water , and a heavy fog driving in from the sea . I hoped number three would know enough to stay at home , but his fate was upon him , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eight o'clock he stretched his little wimigs and flew to the ground , - a very good flight for his family , nearly thirty feet , twice as far as either of his predecessors had gone ; silently , too , - no fuss about it . He began at once the baby mocker 's hop with lifting wings , headed for the west fence , jumped upon the lower board , squeezed through , and was off down the garden before the usual crowd of spectators had collected to strive for // his head . I was delighted . The parents , who were not near when he flew , came back soon , and found him at once . I left him to them , and returned to my place . But silence seemed to have fallen upon the cedar , late so full of life . In vain Ii listened for another cry ; in vain I watched for another visit from the parents . All were busy in the garden and lot , and if any baby were in that nest it must surely starve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ground in the yard , perched a moment on the fence , and saluted me with a low squawk , but their interest in the place was plainly over . After two hours I concluded the nest was empty ; and a curious performance of the head of the late family convinced me it was so . He came quite near to me , perched on a bush in the yard , fixed his eyes on me , and then , with great deliberation , first huffed , then squawked , then sang a little , then flew . I do not know what the bird meant to say , but this is what it expressed tome : " You 've worried us all through this trying time , but you did n't get one of our babies ! Hurrah ! In the afternoon I had the nest brought down to me . For foundation it had a mass of small twigs from six to eight inches long , crooked and forked and straight , which were so slightly held together that they could only be handled by lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth , where they were carefully tied in . Within this mass of twigs was the nest proper , thick and roughly constructed , three and a half inches in inside diameter , made of string , rags , newspaper , cotton wadding , bark , Spanish moss , and feathers , lined with fine root fibre , I think . The feathers were not inside for lining , but outside , on the upper edge . It was , like the foundation , so frail that , though carefully managed , it could only be kept in shape by a string around it , even after the mass of twigs had been removed . I have a last year 's nest , made of exactly the same materials , but in a much more substantial manner ; so perhaps the cedar-tree birds were not so skillful builders as some of their family . The mocking-bird 's movements , excepting in fright , are the perfection of grace ; not even the cat-bird can rival him in airy lightness , in easy elegance of motion . In alighting on a fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manner is fairly poetical . He flies a little too high , drops like a feather , touches the perch lightly with his feet , balances and tosses upward his tail , often quickly running over the tips of half a dozen pickets before he rests . Passing across the yard , he turns not to avoid a taller tree or shrub , nor does he go through it ; he simply bounds over , almost touching it , as if for pure sport . In the matter of bounds the mocker is without a peer . The upward spring while singing is an ecstatic action , that must be seen to be appreciated ; he rises into the air as though too happy to remain on earth , and , opening his wings , floats down , singing all the while . It is indescribable , but enchanting to see . In courtship , too , as related , he makes effective use of this exquisite movement . In simple foodhunting on the ground , - a most prosaic occupation truly , - on approaching a hummock of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alighting on a tree , he does not pounce upon the twig he has selected , but upon a lower one , and passes quickly up through the branches , as lithe as a serpent . So fond is he of this exercise that one which I watched amused himself half an hour at a time in a pile of brush ; starting from the ground , slipping easily through up to the top , standing there a moment , then flying back and repeating the performance . Should the goal of his journey be a fence picket , he alights on the beam which supports it , and hops gracefully to the top . // 1887 . The Mocking-Bird 's Nest . Like the robin , the mocking-bird seeks his food from the earth , sometimes digging it , but oftener picking it up . His manner on the ground is much like the robin 's : he lowers the head , runs a few steps rapidly , then erects himself very straight for a moment . But he adds to this familiar performance a peculiar and l ) eautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover . At the end of a run he lifts his wings , opening them wide , displaying their whole breadth , which makes him look like a gigantic butterfly , then instantly lowers his head and runs again , generally picking up something as he stops . A correspondent in South Carolina , familiar with the ways of the bird , suggests that his object is to startle the grasshoppers , or , as he expresses it , to " flush his game . " I watched very closely , and could not fix upon any theory more plausible , though it seemed to be weakened by the fact that the nestlings , as mentioned above , did the same thing before they thought of looking for food . The custom is not invariable ; sometimes it is done , and sometimes not . The mocking-bird can not be said to possess a gentle disposition , especially during the time of nesting . He does not seem malicious , but rather mischievous , and his actions resemble the naughty though not wicked pranks of an active child . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay claim to a rather large territory , considering his size , and enforces his rights with many a hot chase and noisy dispute , as remarked above . Any mocking-bird who dares to flirt a feather over the border of the ground he chooses to consider his own has to battle with him . A quarrel is a curious operation , usually a chase , and the warcry is so peculiar and apparently so incongruous that it is fairly laughable . It is a rough breathing , like the " huff " of an angry cat , and a serious dispute between the birds reminds one of nothing but a disagreement in the feline family . If the stranger does not take the hint , and retire at the first huff , he is chased , over and under trees and through branches , so violently that leaves rustle and twigs are thrust aside , as long as the patience or wind holds out . On one occasion the defender of his homestead kept up a lively singing all through the furious flight , which lasted six or eight minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own kind the mocker seems usually indifferent , with the single exception of the crow . So long as this bird kept over the saltmarsh , or flew quite high , or even held his mouth shut , he was not noticed ; but let him fly low over the lawn , and above all let him " caw , " and the hot-headed owner of the place was upon him . He did not seem to have any special plan of attack , like the king-bird or the oriole ; his aim appeared to be merely to worry the enemy , and in this he was untiring , flying madly and without pause around a perching crow until he took flight , and then attempting to rise above him . In this he was not always successful , not being particularly expert on the wing , though I have two or three times seen the smaller bird actually rest on the back of the foe for three or four seconds at a time . The song of the free mocking-bird ! With it ringing in my ear at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night for many weeks , how can I criticise it ! How can I do otherwise than fall into rhapsody , as does almost every one who knows it and delights in it , as I do ! It is something for which one might pine and long , as the Switzer for the Ranz-des-Vaches , and the more one hears it the more he loves it . I think there will never come a May in my life when I shall not long to fold my tent and take up my abode in the home of the mocking-bird , and yet I can not say what many do . For variety , glibness , and execution the song is marvelous . It is a brilliant , bewildering // exhibition , and one listens in a sort of ecstasy almost equal to the bird 's own , for this , it seems to me , is the secret of the power of his music lie so enjoys it himself , he throws his whole soul into it , and he is so magnetic that he charms a listener into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also lends enchantment ; he is seldom still . If he begins in a cedar - tree , he soon flies to the fence , singing as he goes , thence takes his way to a roof , and so on , changing his place every few minutes , but never losing a note . His favorite perch is the top spire of a pointed tree , low cedar or young pine , where he can bound into the air as already described , spread his wings , and float down , never omitting a quaver . It seems like pure ecstasy ; and however critical one may be , he can not help feeling deep sympathy with the joyous soul that thus expresses itself . With all the wonderful power and variety , the bewitching charm , there is not the " feeling " the heavenly melody , of the wood thrush . As an imitator , I think he is much overrated . I can not agree with Lanier that " Whateer birds did or dreamed , this bird could say ; " and that the birds are jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe . On the contrary , I do not think they recognize the counterfeit . *h tufted titmouse called as loudly and constantly all day as though no mocking-bird shouted his peculiar and easily imitated call from the house-top ; the cardinal grosbeak sang every day in the grove , though the mocker copied him more closely than any other bird . He repeats the notes , rattles out the call , but he can not put the cardinal 's soul into them . The song of every bird seems to me the expression of himself ; it is a perfect whole of its kind , given with proper inflections and pauses , and never hurried ; whereas , when the mocker delivers it , it is simply one more note added to his repertory , uttered in his rapid staccato , in his loud , clear voice , interpolated between incongruous sounds , without expression , and lacking in every way the beauty and attraction of the original . The song consists entirely of short staccato phrases , each phrase repeated several times , perhaps twice , possibly five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty or thirty , - and I think he has more , - he can make almost unlimited changes and variety , and can sing for two hours or longer , holding his listener spell-bound and almost without consciousness that he has repeated anything . So winning and so lasting is the charm with which this bird enthralls his lovers that scarcely had I left his enchanted neighborhood before everything else was forgotten , and there remain of that idyllic month only beautiful pie and delightful memories .
