SCENE I.  --  Interior of Sol Gill 's Instrument Shop  --  Sol discovered , melancholy and musing , cleaning a Telescope . Sol . Everything 's a going wrong . Even the chronometer 's five-sixths of a second for'ard of the sun , a thing that 's never happened afore , since I 've been in the business . Poor Walter ! he ought to come and see me . What a stupid old crawfish I am ! have n't I chained him to his desk like a galley slave ? No wonder I do n't sell anything  --  the people must see old savage uncle , in every wrinkle of my pitiless old phiz ! Wal . ( Without , D. F. ) Hallo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sol ! Sol . There he is , with a voice as merry as though I had made him a skipper , instead of a galley slave ! Enter WALTER , D. F. Comes down , L. H. Walter . My dear uncle ! bless your old soul , how are you ? What 's the matter ? a little down in the mouth , eh ? ca n't get on well without me ? I thought not ! Sol . Walter , my boy ,  --  come now , it wo n't do ! you think me a brute , I know it ! that 's not real joy that 's in your eye . Confess it , I 've sold you into slavery , have n't I ? and I ought to be kicked for it ! Wal . Slavery ! not a bit of it ! I never was half so happy in my life ; I have an excellent opportunity to establish myself in the world , and am no longer a burthen upon you , my kind old benefactor ! Sol . Do n't , Wally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly the enormity of my crime ! I suppose it 's all for the best . Believe me , my darling boy , I could n't help it ,  --  and I do think , when you come to consider of it , that you 'll forgive me ! Wal . I 'll never forgive you , if you do n't cease this kind of talk . Tell me , how goes on the Wooden Midshipman ? Sol . Badly , Wally , badly ! I 've fallen behind the time , and I 'm too old to try and catch it ,  --  therefore it was , Wally , that I was anxious that you , young , free-hearted , and active , should leave the old milestone here , and be on the world 's track . I 'm only the ghost of this business . Wal . Confound it ! when I see the people walking past in shoals , I feel half-tempted to rush out and collar a customer , drag him into the shop , and make him buy 50 worth of instruments , ready money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that 's no use ; why do n't you come in and buy , eh ? Why , I declare , uncle , here is a customer ! two of ' em , as I live ,  --  rather equivocal looking customers , too ! Enter BROGLEY and GRIPP , D. F. Sol . Brogley ! now it 's all out , Walter , my boy ! go back , quick ! get out ! I do n't want you here  --  it 's nothing  --  that is to say  --  ( Sinks into a chair . ) Wal . What is the meaning of this ? Who are you , sir ? uncle , tell me ! Brog . Pshaw ! young man , it ai n't nothing  --  only a little payment on a bonded debt that ai n't been remembered , and so we 're come to take possession . Wal . What ! Brog . ( R. C. ) Possession ! It 's an execution  --  but do n't let it put you out of the way . I came myself . so that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things , but do n't let it put you out of the way ,  --  they 'll be very safe with me . Wal . ( L. ) But can nothing be done ?  --  a little delay ? Brog . Bless your soul , there has been a monstrous deal of delay already ; the thing has been over due more than an hour . The old man will have to move , but do n't let it put you out of the way . Sol . ( C. ) Walter , my boy  --  such a calamity never happened to me afore  --  I 'm an old man to begin !  --  ( Weeps . ) Wal . Do n't , uncle , do n't ! Mr. Brogley , you can not have the heart to turn the old man out ? Brog . Must , really , but I would n't let it put me out of the way . Wal . But can nothing be done ? Brog . Well , if you could find a friend that you would n't mind putting a trifle out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is just the wrong time to find one . There 's no such thing ! Enter CAPTAIN CUTTLE , D. F. Cut . " A friend in need 's a friend indeed , " and " time and tide doth wait for no man , " overhaul your Walker 's Dictionary , and when found , make a note . What cheer , old messmet ? taken by Algerines , or how ? What 's in the wind , anyhow ? Wal . Captain , you are a friend indeed . My uncle 's goods have been taken in execution . Cut . I thought so ! " when taken to be well shaken , " overhaul your poticary 's stuff . Which is the piratical craft ? to offer to venture to lay fist on him ,  --  so chock full of science too , as an egg 's full of meat . So you 've been and gone and coveted your neighbour 's goods ! overhaul your catechism , you land lubber , and when found make a note . Look where he stands ; why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quiet and resigned , if he had a mind to  --  he could make a clock , he could .  --  Lord , how that clock would go ! and to go for to lay hands on an individual as could make a clock ai n't in natur ' ! but " many men of many minds , and many birds of many kinds , " overhaul your copy book , and when found , make a note . Brog . Sorry to put anybody out of the way , but if you could make a note that would pay my bill , it would be more to the purpose . Cut . Land shark signals all the world over ; but never mind , old shipmet , lay your head to the wind ; all you have to do is to lay your head to the wind and we 'll fight through it . Stand by for a second or two till I go into my bunk . Wal'r , my boy , keep up the old man 's spirits , I 'll make all right in a jiffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you ? and remember there 's a " sweet little cherub sits perched up aloft , " overhaul your catechism , and when found , make a note . Exit R. Brog . Now that old sea monster has departed , I presume we can proceed to businesss . Gripp , pen and ink ! get ready to take an inventory , although I really can not tell the names of all those outlandish implements and excessively shocking electrical affairs . My dear young sir , would I be putting you out of the way by asking the names of those various articles ? Sol . Stay , Mr. Brogley ; why should the dear boy be worried thus ? I 'll describe them all  --  yes , all my pets  --  for the last time , like children . Walter , somehow , I love those familiar things . I did n't like even to sell my favourites , but now to see them consigned to people who wo n't understand them , but look upon them only as so much brass and wood and useless figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dear uncle , you shall not lose them ; they must not be torn away from you . I 'll go myself , and  --  Re-enter CAPTAIN CUTTLE , singing . Cut . In the South Seas a cohorting All for to catch a whale . It 's there we 'll make a fortin As we sail ! as we sail ! Brog . You perhaps can purchase what you like at the sale . Cut . Sale ! Aye , aye , sail ahoy ! " Now we sail With the gale . " Overhaul your Bay of Biscay , O , and when found sing a note . Clear decks for action ; lay your head to the wind , old messmet , see here ! ( Takes out handful of silver , a pair of sugar tongs , some silver spoons , and pulls out enormous watch ; places them on table . ) Sol . Bless you , Cuttle , bless you ! Brog . What on earth is this ? Cut . Plunder , you pirate ! take it all and leave the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , and sheer off . Come , what do you make of it ? Brog . Make of it ? You do n't suppose that property 's of any use ? Cut . No use ! the money , them spoons and that watch no use ,  --  ' specially the watch ? Brog . Why , the amount is three hundred and seventy odd . Cut . Wheugh ! Breakers ahead ! but all 's fish that comes to your net , I suppose ? Brog . Certainly , Mr. Cutlet  --  I mean Cuttle ; but sprats ai n't whales , you know . Cut . Messmet , I 'm out of soundings . What 's the bearings , Wal'r ? Sol . ( C. ) Ned , it 's no use . I 'm behind the time a long way ; the stock had better be sold , it 's worth more than this debt , and I can go and die somewhere on the balance . Yes , yes , let them sell the stock , take down the old worn-out Wooden Midshipman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do , may I  --  if it was n't that I had n't enough  --  we must . Pooh ! pooh ! old messmet , it 'll be all right enough , if you just do as I tell you . Lay your head well to the wind . Wal'r , I have it ! I have it ! right as a barnacle . ( Crosses , L. H. ) Your governor 's the man to advance the money . Wal . Mr. Dombey ? Cut . Precisely ; we mus n't leave a stone unturned , and you see there 's a stone for you . Wal . A stone ! Dombey ! Very like , very like . Cut . To be sure . Come along now , at once . Cheer up , old messmet . ( Gathers up his silver , &c.); I say , you , spell out some of them ere hard words till we come back . Bear a hand , Wal'r , I 'll go with you , just to give you a sort of courage . Remember " 30 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when found make a note . Exeunt Cuttle and Walter .

Rough and tough is Joseph , and de-vi-lish sly ! What are you grinning at , you confounded extract of chicory and liver complaint ? anything remarkable in my personal appearance ? I 'll chop you into curry , if you dare to wink , you spawn of a Hindoo alligator ! Native . Me no winkee , Massa Bagstock ! Joe . Do n't open your mouth ! Is n't this Dombey coming this way ? Native . Iss , massa ! Joe . Who spoke to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammoth of Mercantile Capacity , old Joe B. is proud to shake you by the hand . An old campaigner  --  a smoke-dried , invalided , used-up old dog of a major , is delighted to meet with such a man as the illustrious Dombey ! Dom . You do the unworthy representative of the name too much honour , major . Joe . By Thunder and Mars , it 's a great name , sir ! It 's a name , sir , that old Josh is proud to recognise ! nothing adulatory about J. B.  --  a plain old soldier is Joe , but it is a great name , sir . Joe Bagstock says it , deny it who can ! J. B. says it ! old Josh  --  a thorough , rough-going , downright plain-spoken old trump , and nothing more ! Dom . Thank you for the compliment , Major Bagstock , you will excuse my leaving you . Joe . Hem ! are you going to sleep . ( To Native . ) Lazy dog , sir ! Oriental sun , sir , dries up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , though ! One moment , Dombey  --  see who approaches ! By Venus and all the Graces at once , the star of old Josh 's admiration , the magnificent Skewton , and her superb daughter ? If old Joe were a little younger , by George , there 's not a woman alive he 'd sooner prefer for a wife ! Dom . Which , major , the daughter , or the mother ? Joe . Is old Josh a turnip , that he should mean the mother ? Dom . You were equally complimentary to both . Joe . Rather an ancient flame  --  devilish ancient , so I humour her . Dom . They impress me as being decidedly genteel . Joe . Genteel ! The honourable Mrs. Skewton , sir , is sister to the late Lord Feenix , and aunt to the present lord  --  poor , but devilish high ! No money , but talk of blood ,  --  pooh ! hush ! here they are  --  I 'll introduce you ! MRS . SKEWTON is pushed on in garden chair , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , is a proud and happy man for the rest of his life . Mrs. S. You false creature , where do you come from ?

Mr. Dombey may be devoted to her in secret , but as a man of his immense influence in the City  --  ( Aside to her ) give him a touch ! Mrs. S. No one can be a stranger to Mr. Dombey 's position . Joe . Devilish fine compliment ! deserves a reply , Dombey ! Dom . ( To Edith . ) I feel flattered . Do you reside here , madam ? Joe . There 's something in that  --  cultivate him ! ( Aside to her . ) Edith . Silence ! Joe . Hem ! ( Rushes at the Native . ) Edith . We do not reside here ,  --  we have been visiting . Mamma likes charge . Mrs. S. Edith , of course , does not ? Edith . I have found no change in any place . Mrs. S. They positively nel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation ,  --  those are my  --  what 's its name ? ( To Edith . ) My dearest child , you know I am wholly dependent upon you for those odious names ! I assure you , Mr. Dombey , nature intended me for an Arcadian . I am entirely thrown away in society  --  cows are my passion ; what I have sighed for all my life , is a rural retreat in some shady retirement , with nothing near me but nature , surrounded by the feathery warblers of the grove , revelling in cows and china ! Edith . Nature is whispering to us to proceed , mamma . I shall walk on . Good morning . ( Crosses to L. H. ) Joe . A fair challenge , Dombey ! By Jupiter , such a hint would n't be thrown away on old Joe , had he your number of years in his withered old trunk ! Dom . Do you think so ? Will you permit me to be your escort , Mrs. Granger ? Edith . I do not wish to trouble you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will afford me great gratification . Exeunt Edith and Dombey , L. 1 E. Joe . That will be a match , or old Josh Bagstock knows nothing of human nature ! He 's touched , is Dombey ! The Colossus of commerce is bayonetted right through the pericardium . Old Joe has his weather eye open wide , tremendously wide ! Mrs. S. Go away , you insupportable creature ! what can you possibly mean ? Joe . Mean , ma'am ! ca n't your maternal glance penetrate the vista of futurity , and see your adorable daughter perched on the topmost pinnacle of prosperity ? Mrs. S. Major Bagstock , this world is a false place , where the music of the heart , and the gushing of the soul , and all that sort of thing , is seldom heard , but there is an allusion to my extremely dear child , to which my heart vibrates deliciously ! Joe . Bluntness , ma'am , is the distinguished characteristic of the Bagstock breed ! Old Joe admits it . Mrs. S. I know the duty of a mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can observe an amount of heart in your friend Dombey . Joe . Devilish little heart in friend Dombey now , ma'am ! Mrs. S. Wretched man ; be silent ! Joe . Old Joe is as dumb as a lobster ! Mrs. S. Edith is said to resemble me . I believe we are alike ! She has great force of character ,  --  mine is said to be immense , though I do n't believe it . Joe . Dombey is a great catch , ma'am ! Mrs. S. Aggravating monster ! but seriously ,  --  Withers , retire awhile . Joe . Villain be off ! Exit Withers and Native . Mrs. S. Wretch ! Joe . Divinity ! Mrs. S. Do you think he 's in earnest ? Tell me ,  --  there 's a sagacious Caliban ,  --  what would you advise ? Joe . Shall we marry him to Edith , eh ! Mrs. S. Mysterious creature ! How can we marry him ? Joe . Shall we marry them ? Old Joe asks that simple question . Mrs. S. Do n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dombey is safe , ma'am ,  --  old Joe Bagstock has him there ,  --  there , ma'am , under his thumb ! Old Joe B. knows a thing or two ! He 's a shy trout , is Dombey , but the old soldier knows how to play him , and when we have him in the fish-basket ,  --  we 'll be at the feast , eh ? Cleopatra , the peerless , and her Antony Bagstock will often speak of this , when we are sharing the elegance and wealth of Edith Dombey ! Old Joe is sly ,  --  devilish sly ! Mrs. S. Incorrigible monster ! I do n't believe a word you say ! Joe . Withers , approach ! Rascal , appear ! Mrs. S. Farewell , brute ! Enter WITHERS and NATIVE .

Dom . If you wish it , Carker , certainly  --  it 's of no consequence . Enter FLORENCE , WALTER , and CAPTAIN CUTTLE , L. H. Car . Ah , my young friend Walter , I 'm delighted to have been of service . At my suggestion , Mr. Dombey has postponed my demands and those of business , to listen to your petition . Wal .

Take this check , and let it obliterate all recollection of that circumstance . Remember , Gay , I pay you for the service you rendered ; do you understand me ? Wal . Fully , sir ; but as I have already forgotten the circumstance , I regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour in such a way that I can not but blush to receive it . Dom .

And you too , Captain Cuttle ; how happy should Walter be in having so good a friend ! Cut . Bless you , my lady lass , I ai n't nothing but a poor shattered old hull of humanity .

Ah ! it 's an outrageous element : think on it when the winds is roaring and the waves is howling . Flor . Were you ever in a dreadful storm , captain ? Cut . Why , aye , my lady lass , I 've seen my share of bad weather ! but it ai n't of myself as I was meaning to speak . Our dear boy , Wal'r , darling , as was drownded . There 's perils and dangers on the deep , my beauty , and over many a bold heart the secret waters has closed up , and never told no tales ; but there 's escapes upon the deep , too . I  --  I know a story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me once ; maybe you 'd like to hear me tell it .

Oh yes , yes , pray do . Cut . That there ship met with such foul weather as do n't blow once in twenty years : she went to pieces , beauty , and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned that ship . Flor . They were not all lost  --  some were saved ? One  --  Cut . Aboard of that there unfortunate wessel was a lad  --  a good , a brave lad  --  for when the stoutest hands and oldest hearts were hove down , he was firm and cheery . Flor . And was he saved ? was he saved ? Cut . That there lad , along with the second mate and one seaman , was left of all the beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures , lashed to a fragment of the wreck , and driftin' ' on the stormy sea alone , beneath God 's heaven  --  Flor . Were they saved ? Cut . Days and nights they drifted ,  --  do n't look behind you , lady lass  --  there 's nothing there ,  --  until a sail hove down and they were taken aboard , two alive and one dead . Flor . Which of them was dead ? Cut . Not the lad I speak on . Flor . Thank Heaven ! Cut . Amen , with all my heart ,  --  do n't be took aback ! aboard that ship , the lad went a long voyage ; the other seaman died  --  but the lad was spared , and  --  Flor . Spared ! Cut .

Wal'r , my lad , here 's a little bit of property as I want to make over jintly . ( Takes sugar tongs and spoons , and puts them in Walter 's hand . ) Drowned , ai n't he , pretty ?

" Cut . That 's the identical indiwidual ! Toots . ( Aside . ) Here a pretty situation ! a hated rival to turn up at this critical moment !  --  he 's been more fortunate than I have ! I wo n't hate him ! ( Crosses to Walter , and shakes hands with him . ) I 'm delighted to see you again  --  tho ' I never saw you before ! how were they all  --  when you left  --  that is  --  I mean the people on the other side of the water ?  --  I hope you did n't get wet when you were drownded  --  that is  --  I mean  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been happening at Mr. Dombey 's  --  and that Miss Dombey , herself , has left her father , who , in my opinion , is a man  --  a brute  --  that it would be wretched flattery to call a bird of prey ,  --  and I 've been positively poetic !  --  the ruin you behold  --  a living exemplification of the author 's meaning  --  when he speaks of the wreck of matter  --  and the crush of worlds ! Exit Cuttle , R. 1 E. Wal . Mr. Toots , I 'm extremely happy to be able to relieve your mind ! Miss Dombey is safe and well ! Toots . Sir !  --  the relief is so excessive and unspeakable , that if you were to tell me Miss Dombey was  --  married , even  --  I could smile  --  I 'm so relieved  --  at least , I 'd try to ! Wal . It will be a greater relief to your generous mind to know that you can render Miss Dombey an essential service . Toots .

Flor . What we wanted to ask you , Mr. Toots , is , if you knew where Susan was , and if  --  Toots . I never tasted an iota of happiness till this moment ! the person you name is now outside , being as anxious as your humble servant to hear tidings of you ! I 'll go and bring her in ! Exit , D. F.

( In L. H. corner . ) Wal . But my poor uncle , Captain Cuttle ! is there no hope ? Cut . No , Wal'r , I 'm afeared not . Along with the figure-head of hope there 's holways a hanchor , but where 's the use in a hanchor when there no bottom to cast it on ? Enter SOL GILLS , D. F.
