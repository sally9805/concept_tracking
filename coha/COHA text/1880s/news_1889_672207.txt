txt With  --  a blare of financial trumpets the North , American Salt Company introduced itself to the public only one week ago . Its prospectus was tinted with the rosiest of rosy hues . The salt interests of the country were to be unified and systematized , said this cheery prospectus ; English and American capitalists were to join hands and make fortunes by gently pushing up the price of the modest commodity . Wall-street likes to call things by short names . The North American Salt Company is a dignified and ponderous title , and so Wall-street simply condensed it to " Salt Trust . " and that 's what everybody  --  except its promoters  --  called it . They contended that it was not a trust , yet the unfeeling public insisted that it was . And so the Salt Trust for one short week had a big place in the talk of the Street . It had a bigger place than ever yesterday , but this prominence was not just exactly what was desired . With nothing of the trumpet tone at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday : " While the subscriptions have been very numerous and in the aggregate large . the Trustees feel that they are not justified in proceeding to an allotment of shares on the present basis without further conference with subscribers and vendors . This , on account of subscribers being on both sides of the Atlantic and the vendors widely separated . will take time , and it has been decided to return subscriptions and postpone further action until these negotiations can be completed . " Wall-street read and pondered just au instant , and then chorused : " The Salt Trust has busted . ' " This was not elegant , but it was expressive . The cause of the sudden drop was speculated upon with much interest . There was a wonderful unanimity in the opinion that the public on this side of the water as well as on the other was not lured into coming in and subscribing for the bonds and stock by the cheery and extended prospectus . The articles of incorporation of the company were filed in Albany on July 19 . The incorporators were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazard , and Charles F. Burger . The capital was to be $11,000 , - 000. in shares of $50 , or ? 10 , each , divided into 140,000 ordinary shares and 8,000 8 per cent . preference shares . The Central Trust Company of 54 Wall-street was the agent in this country , and in England the trust was represented by Glyn , Mills . Currie &; Co. of London ? thelOnion Bank of Manchester and its branches , and Parr 's Banking Company of Liverpool audits branches . Agents were authorized to receive applications at par for debenture bonds . preferred and common stock until July 25 , when the books were to close . The subscriptions were payable 10 per cent . on application . 30 per cent . on allotment . 30 per cent . on Aug. 10 , and 30 per cent . on Sept. 1 . Somehow or other the public did not make a mad rush for the stock . July 25 came along , and there was dust all over the prospectus with the rosy hue . On Friday there came this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with more than ordinary in-terest : LONDON ' , July ** Board concluded to return subscriptions as there Were large withdrawals on reports in papers that American public failed to respond . All agree that if vendors will accept fair proportion stock sufficient can be got hero in October to make success and that debentures can be placed . No adverse criticism and plenty or money ready , if vendors show confidence . Then these of the Board of Directors who were in the city held a meeting . The board is made up of Horace K. Thurber and Richard T. Wilson of New-York . John Canfield and William S. Conklin of Michigan . William A. Hazard of New-York , Joy Morton of Chicago , Lord Thurlow of London , and Joseph Verdin of Cheshire . England . The President of the company is Wellington R. Burt of East Saginaw , Mich. ? , the Vico President is Franklin Woodruff of New-York , and the Treasurer is Horace K. Thurber . The result of the meeting of the Directors was the announcement that was issued yesterday . That the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some quarters , and in others  --  more limited ones perhaps  --  it is not . There does not seem to be much stock taken in the intimation that the company has only suspended operations for the time , to resume in the Fall or some other time . What the negotiations are which need to be completed before anything else is done is a mystery , and none of the projectors of the enterprise seem willing to solve it . 1n fact the Salt Trust seemed to be a sore topic upon which to touch yesterday when talking to any of those interested . Franklin Woodruff . Vice President of the company , said that he had nothing to say about it . When asked what amount of money had been subscribed he again remarked that he had nothing to say . Just about as much as Mr. Woodruff revealed could be learned at the office of the Central Trust Company . There it was said that instructions had been left to say nothing about the matter , and questioners - were referred to the officers of the company . Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London when interrogated , and said that the announcement was made here after that had been received . He would not say how much money had been subscribed . When asked whether the reports in the papers that the American public had failed to respond , mentioned in the cable , were true , he said : " I do n't think that they are true , " and when asked if the company - would go on in the Fall he remarked : " That is hard to say . " Many things have operated to bring the Salt Trust into its present state . Its projectors got to work on the scheme when the se-called " industrial " stocks were booming in fin &fashion; on the  --  Stock Exchange , cottonseed oil ' certificates were selling at 58 or 59 , the Distillers ' Trust was quoted at 48 , Lead Trusts were at 35 , and Sugar Trusts were up to 126 . The votaries of these trusts - were in high feather and the popularity of the certificates was at its height . Then the public learned something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so ' high that they were astonishing , Other things disturbed the feeling of confidence and the certificates began to start downward , with Sugar Trust leading in the decline . Cottonseed oil is now selling at about 53 , Distillers ' at 43 , or thereabout ; Lead Trust has been selling at 23 , and Sugar Trust has been down around par . This sort of thing was not reassuring , and , in consequence , the Salt Trust did not come to life in a particularly good time . There is a surfeit of industrial securities . Investors who want to invest that way have a big enough list to pick from , and so the public staid out when the North American Salt Company invited it in . Another thing that operated against the Salt Trust was the fact that the properties it proposed to control are situated in so many different States . and in some of these commonwealths legislation is likely to be inimical to trusts , no matter under what name they.tra-vel . Discoveries of salt mines made it a difficult matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be controlled by the trust . The outcome of the scheme makes some of the lines in the advertisements of the company rather interesting reading  --  for instance , this one : " If a larger-amount is subscribed than asked for , as now seems probable , the company reserves the right to reject any excess of subscription and to close the share list at any time . " It would be interesting , too , to know how much money , if any , was subscribed in this country , but none of those interested seems to be anxious to reveal information on this point . It has cost the company something to get along as far as it has gone . Besides the expense of placing the scheme before the public , paying attorneys , &c.,; the incorporators had to pay a State tax of $13,750 , one of the largest incorporation taxes ever paid .
