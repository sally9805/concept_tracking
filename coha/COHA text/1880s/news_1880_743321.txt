txt The Committee of Ways and Means to-day heard an argument by John E. Searles , Jr. , of New-York , in support of the memorial recently presented to Congress by a large number of importers and manufacturers of sugar , asking for speedy legislation on the sugar tariff . Mr. Searles argued that the unsatisfactory condition of the sugar business throughout the country makes prompt action necessary ; that while the revenue was the ? first thing to be considered in the establishment of this tariff , the importers were entitled to such consideration as would enable them to transact business safely ; that the memorial represented the majority of refiners , who were now , with a few exceptions , united on a basis that was equitable to all . The orders of the Secretary of the Treasury , by which the tariff was virtually changed last Summer , through the application of the polariscope test , were dwelt upon , and Mr. Searles charges that the enforcemeneof those orders had proved disastrous to the trade . Much time was spent in an elaborate argument showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importation and manufacture of sugars in this country . The point insisted on was that under one rate of , duty such sugars as were required by manufacturers would be imported , and that discrimination in favor of certain grades of foreign manufacture would only result in the raising of the Price to consumers of those sugars which are really the cheapest , because the purest , or the compulsory use by the masses of a sugar made in a cheaper way from the commonest foreign article . To-morrow the advocates of the present tariff will be heard . Capt . Frank Vosburg , of Albany , and a large delegation of Hudson River steam-boat owners arrived here to-night to oppose the plan of improving the river channel which has been put in practice by Col. Newton , of the United States Engineers . They say that from experience they are assured that his method of diking will eventually result in ruining the channel . To-morrow , after consultation with Congressmen Starin and Bailey . they will appear with their complaint before the Secretary of War . In accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Navy will adopt the British method of plating war-vessels with armor , using iron and steel combined instead of iron alone . A layer of iron and one of steel , whose combined thickness is 11 inches , are equal in power of resistance to a layer of iron 14 inches thick . The British method was explained and advocated before the committee by Nathaniel , of Philadelphia , who had obtained particulars from the head of the British Naval Office .
