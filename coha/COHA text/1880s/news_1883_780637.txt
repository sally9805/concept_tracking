txt The little town of Kingston , about two miles from this place , was this afternoon the scone of a terrible explosion , by which seven young persons were fatally burned , two having since died . The names of the dead are Mettle James and Hattie Norris , and the injured are Lizzie Edwards , . Tames Steele , Albert James , Mary Moss , Lizzie Quinn . and John Evans . The factory was situated in the western part of the borough , and consisted of one frame building about 40 by 30 . At the time of the explosion the proprietor , John Smith , was absent , the work being in charge of Mettle James . How the explosion was caused is impossible as yet to say , but about 2 o'olock the neighbors were startled by three loud explosions in rapid succession . which made the ground tretnble and broke every window within a circuit of 300 yards . The terrified women living in the adjacent houses rushed from their shaking tenements , dragging their children after them . On turning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nearest house a terrible scene presented itself . The force of the explosion had torn off the roof of the building and blown out one side , while flames and smoke were pouring from every portion of the wrecked structure . Through the blinding smoke the blazing forms of the unfortunate victims were seen to stagger , shrieking wildly in their agony . A small creek runs within 10 yards of the factory , and two girls were seen to rush down the batik and endeavor to extin-guish their burning clothing by plunging into the stream . Willing hands were WOO at work helping them . They were found to he Hattie Norris and Lizzie Ed wards , both about 19 years old . They were terribly burned , there being scarcely a portion of their bodies hot , burned to a crisp . Hattie Norris died within an hour , and Lizzie Edwards can not live till morning . One boy , John Evans , about 15 years old , was found on the other side of the creek , where it is supposed he had been blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , aged 20. the forewoman , was found a blazing heap in a field 20 yards from the factory . Her clothing was burned and her body was charred almost beyond recognition . She was removed to her home , but died about 4:30 o'clock . James Steele and Albert James . two young lads about 15 years old , were found near the building half buried in the burning ruins . They were both fearfully burned , but James Steele will probably recover , having no serious injuries except to his legs and feet ; Albert Jame , a brother of Kettle James . was burned principally on the head and chest and can not survive . Mary Moss , aged 18 , ran toward the creek , but fell before she reached it . When picked up her clothing was blazing . the is terribly burned on the head and body and will probably die before morning . Lizzie Quinn . aged 1f3 , dragged herself , all blazing , to a neighbor 's fence . Willing hands helped her over and soon extinguished the flames , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of her recovery . In the confusion of the moment it was reported that three or four more were within the blazing building , and a scene of terrible excitement ensued . A chain was formed to the creek and nails of water passed from hand to hand and flung upon the flames . Others sought to tear down the building with poles and ladders , while many of the women who had gathered round the spot fainted with the beat and excitement and were hurried off by their friends . It was finally discovered that all the inmates had been rescued and the useless effort to quench the flames was abandoned . The sad accident has cast a deep gloom over the community . All the injured persons resided in the immediate vicinity and wore well known by nearly everybody in Kingston . They are all of respectable families , and the two young women whose deaths are announced were daughters of well-to-do parents and were both reckoned among the beauties of the town . The suffering of the injured is terrible and several of them are praying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the explosion was caused can not be exactly ascertained , hut it is thought that a spark flew out of the stove , into which some wood had been put into some loose powder the squibs are made of powder and straw and are used by miners as slow mathes in firing their blasts . It is claimed by the owner of the factory that there was not more than 20 pounds of powder in the building , but the terrible force of the explosion seems to indicate a larger quantity . The factory had been only working for about five months , the process being one newly invented by Mr. Smith . It was by the purest accident that the work was being carried on in that building to-day a larger one is being built , and had it not been for the sickness of a man who was completing the internal- decorations , the factory would have been removed two days ago . This makes the second fatal accident in Kingston within a month , the disaster at the Woodward mine occurring just 30 days ago .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
