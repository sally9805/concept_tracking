txt Elections in this country are decided by the votes of the plain people , but the influence of prominent educators in schools and colleges and other institutions of learning is felt in politics as it is in trade and in every other manifestation of human intelligence and activity . Many a political leader who has carried thousands of voters with him owes his power in great measure to the patient instructors who developed his mind , taught him how to use it , and directed him to stores of useful knowledge . JAMES G. BLAINE decided that his sons should have all the advantages of what is sometimes called a liberal education . He knew the value of the training to which young men are subjected in universities and of the influence exerted upon young men by earnest , thoughtful , and learned instructors . Desiring to place his sons under the care of the best and most trustworthy educators  --  men of sound judgment , wide learning , and pure character  --  he selected the two leading American universities . One son he sent to Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Professors of these universities were , in his opinion , the men of all others best fitted to direct the education of his children , to teach them how to distinguish the true from the false , and how to perform in the best manner the highest ' duties of an American citizen . He must have had the greatest respect for their wisdom , their judgment , and their honesty . He could not have regarded them as " dudes " or as " Pharisees . " In the course of time the sons completed their college education and went out into the world . In the course of time the father was nominated to be President by the Republican Party , with which for many years the Presidents and Professors of the two universities had been identified . They had supported that party by their votes and by their works , but , dear as it had been to them , they could not vote for this Presidential candidate , because they had become convinced by the testimony of his own letters that he had used the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because the history , of his public life and political career proved to them that he was the foremost and most dangerous advocate and representative of the corrupt methods and evil tendencies against which they had been fighting all their days . To vote for BLAINE would be to acknowledge either that for years they had been teaching false doctrine or that they had not the courage of their convictions and were not fit to educate young men . But when Mr. BLAINE placed his sons in their care he regarded them as pure , honest , wise , and of sound judgment . Have they now suddenly become foolish ? Are they no longer able to judge fairly and wisely as to a public man 's career , character , surroundings , and influence ? Is it not possible that deep in his heart the Republican candidate regards the recent action of these men as additional proof of their wisdom and honesty ? It may be that he does , but if this be his real opin-. ion it is not probable that he will make haste to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
