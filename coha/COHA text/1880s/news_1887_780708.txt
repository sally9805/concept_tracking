txt When ex-Judge Henry Hilton purchased . Meissonier 's famous picture , " Friedland , 1807 , " for $66,000 , at the recent sale of the Stewart collection , it was with the intention of presenting it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , but his purpose was kept secret until yesterday , when , for the first time , the Directors of the Museum knew of the rich art treasure which had been intrusted to their keeping . " Friedland " was purchased by Mr. Stewart early in 1876 , and he . paid the artist for it at that time $60,000 , which , with the duties on its importation , made its actual cost to the merchant prince just about what ex-Judge Hilton paid for it . The picture is 96 by 54 inches in size , and represents the officers of Napoleon passing in review before their chief when he was in the height of his power and glory . Meissonier , in his letter to Mr. Stewart when the painting left his hands , wrote of it : " I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon at the zenith of his glory . I wanted to paint the love , the adoration of the soldiers for the great captain , in whom they had faith , and for whom they were ready to die . " The picture has been regarded as a masterpiece of the great painter , and its reputation is as wide as the world of art . Judge Hilton purchased it with a view of presenting it to the Museum in memory of his dead friend , A. T. Stewart , but he hesitated to make the gift until he was assured that the Museum was in every respect a safe receptacle fora treasure , which , if once destroyed could never be replaced .

" " The Defense of Champigny " is almost as famous throughout the world as the Meissonier of the Stewart collection .
