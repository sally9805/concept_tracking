COMMERCiAL BUILDINGS . OUR commercial buildings offer just now a peculiarly interesting field of inquiry . In no department are we doing more work . " Down-town " New York , for example , is being so rapidly remodeled that small trace will be left in the year 1900 of the work that stood but ten years ago . In no department , again , do problems of greater difficulty and novelty suggest themselves ; and in none , I think , is more strenuous effort being made to secure better artistic as well as better practical results than have hitherto been common . It is well , indeed , that this should be the case , since we are not , like our fathers , building for a short time only . Their structures have proved but temporary , while for ours a life may be predicted as long as the city 's own . No one can ever build them bigger , and , however ugly we may leave them , our children are not likely to pull them down for aesthetic reasons only . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some forty or fifty years ago-simple cubes of brick or stone broken by regular rows of unornamented windows . They were not even to be considered from the point of view of art , but from their very humility were not actively distressing or offensive . Offense came quickly , however , with the dawning of the " iron age . " The world then thought it had found a new material which would meet its practical needs as they had never been met before , and would revolutionize the art on its artistic side as well . At first a new " iron style " was prophesied ; but when this failed to appear , every time-honored fashion was drawn upon for help . Many , diverse , and frantic were the efforts made to achieve success . There were no bounds set to ambition ; for the cheapness and facility with which iron could be cast into any shape , put within common reach such possibilities of elaboration and display ( of sham elaboration and display , however ) as had hitherto been reserved for occasional use in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition , more experimenting , and more frantic " originality " than with us-as a walk up the central portion of Broadway will prove . But the ultimate result was as far as possible from the hopes we had cherished at the outset . No new iron style was evolved , and no old fashion showed its fitness for truthful , or even for satisfactory superficial treatment in the novel substance . And I think these years of struggle had a definitely pernicious as well as a merely disappointing outcome . I am sure our public would never have grown to misconceive so utterly the true grounds of architectural excellence , had not the cheap and showy lies of iron been paraded for so many years before its eyes . Had we always kept to brick and stone , we could not have been so lavish with our " applied ornament , " and could not have come to love it so unwisely . We could not so have forgotten that construction is the basis of architectural excellence ; that simplicity and repose are among its finest factors and that elaborateness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate sorts , and executed with artistic feeling and manual , not mechanical , skill . Surely to iron we owe the greater part of our architectural falsehood , restlessness , ostentation , and vulgarity ; and surely to it , the greater part of our present incapacity to distinguish between an organism and an aggregate of inconsequential features ; between " decorated construction " and " constructed decoration " ; between ornamental detail that is wrought by an artist 's hand , and ornamental detail that is coarsely cast in ignoble forms . It is impossible to find any really good iron buildings among our many thousands . All we can say is that the simplest are the best ; or , more properly , the least distressing . The plain fronts that abound , for instance , in the so-called " dry-goods district " of New York are not beautiful , and neither their arches nor their lintels are a satisfactory expression of the qualities of iron . But they are infinitely better , at all events , than elaborate vulgarizations of palatial magnificence like the Grand Hotel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square with its colossal statuary , or the Venetian or Arabic or flashy nondescript facades farther down Broadway . But iron no longer greatly interests us except for interior constructional expedients . We no longer make much use of it in our visible exteriors . It has proved intractable from an artistic point of view ,  --  whether of necessity or owing to our want of ingenuity , I do not pretend to say , though it does seem as though thirty years of earnest effort in every // land must pretty well have exhausted its possibilities . And practically it has been tried in fiery balances and found conspicuously wanting . Fortunately for our art , we are forced 1 ) ack almost entirely upon 1 ) rick and stone as our visible materials . Are we now to do something really good with them ,  --  something that will be neither a mere square box nor a superficial flourish of mendacious forms and mechanically wrought details ? Certainly we are making the effort ; and as certainly , I think , we are beginning to succeed . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take as an example of its simple but successful solution a warehouse Messrs . Babb , Cook &amp; Willard have recently erected on Duane street , in New York . There was little to work with here : cheap materials , scanty ornament , and not even a corner site ; only one of those high narrow fa√ßades that go so far to discourage effort . But effort , intelligent effort , has been brought to bear , and the result is fine in the first and chief essential of good architecture- fine in composition . The straight lines of equal windows demanded in a building of the sort are preserved throughout the lower stories ; but their uniformity is relieved by the piers and great round arches which , furnishing strength to the wall , also express that strength and introduce the artistic element of design . The fifth-story openings are accommodated to the arches , and their bold variety completes the effect of intelligent composition . Such a building , as truly as the most elaborate , is an architectural growth , an entity , an organism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to express it ; that he was neither a mere mechanical piler-up of bricks and window-sashes , nor a mistaken searcher after that effectiveness which , it is supposed , will result from the introduction of " unnecessary " decorative features . Such excellence seems very easy of attainment ,  --  but only now that we see it gained . Let us imagine one of our unpretentious business streets lined with buildings of this sortI do not mean identical with it , but analogous to it in simplicity , appropriateness , and architectural feeling . We do not conceive it as a street to be merely tolerated , even if our more ambitious thoroughfares were of equal excellence in a richer way ; rather as one in which we should find true pleasure , and of a l ) ermanent , because a ra/io ; ia/ sort . Another similarly simple and successful essay , due to the same firm , is to be found in Newburgh on the Hudson , and may be judged from the illustration on page 514 . A leather warehouse , which is still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent work of art , stands near the New York end of the Brooklyn Bridge , and has fronts on Jacob and Frankfort streets though the corner between them is occupied by another building . It is extremely sturdy , almost rude , in effect , and without the slightest trace of ornament - with not even so much as we find in the little moldings which , inconspicuous though they are , yet add a tangible grace to Mr. Babb 's results . But its wall is composed by means of piers and arches ; it has a strong though simple cornice ; and its openings are well designed and varied , those of the ground story being powerful round arches . Its solidity and strength are not more evident than its fitness of expression , or than its testimony to how much a clever architect may ( 10 with a problem so humble that it has long been held beneath the dignity of art . It is only recently , I think , that such simple works have been confided to hands more skillfulthan those of the ordinary builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had ocular proof of an architect 's interference . And therefore it is that I count them such valuable signs of progress . The facades which are being built to inclose the Bridge arcades and fit them for storage purposes give , by the way , welcome evidence of a similar sort . Now , for variety and the sake of pointing an instructive contrast , let us look at a great wholesale store Mr. Richardson has lately built on Bedford street in Boston - a work of the richest and most elaborate kind , and , considering its place and purpose , of the greatest possible novelty . It would be hard to exaggerate the " true architectural emotion " it produces when we first see it through a vista of narrow streets lined with commonplace commercial structures . Mr. Richardson worked , it is true , under favoring conditions . The site is a rounded corner of two diverging streets , facing a third which affords a good distant view , and is extended enough for good proportions to be possible in spite of great necessary height ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profuse decoration . But otherbuilders have had opportunities as good , or better even , in this immediate neighborhood . It is not the fault of fate or clients that their results are so farinferior . In Mr. Richardson 's building we see composition of an admirable kind . Variety exists with ( luietness and harmony , and imposing solidity in spite of those wide modem windows which are so often an architect 's destruction . Its beauty is imill , not applied by means of decoration . This last is profuse , as I have said , but is guided and inspired by the structural forms . It enhances and accentuates , but does not itself siq5jiy the element of architectural " delight . " A detail to be noted is the com // paratively small size and unaccented simplicity of the doorways . Their subordination to the windows in a structure of this kind is as appropriate and expressive as is the emphasis we have seen Mr. Richardson lay upon them in buildings of another sort . Boston may well be proud of this splendid pile of dark-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our commercial structures . And yet we may ask ourselves whether , after all , it is as hopeful a sign for the future of our art as is such a work as Mr. Babb 's . It would be absurd , of course , to compare , on their intrinsic merits as pure works of art , the sumptuous richness of the one with the frank poverty of the other . But I can not too often repeat that architectural creations- especially with us in this first beginning of our art - have another aspect from which also they must be judged . When we look at them sensibly , they seem valuable in proportion as they offer the best practical solution of the most frequent and characteristic problems of our day and land . The power which can do well with humble opportunities , and create true art at little cost and under difficult conditions , is the power of which we have most need . A comVOL . XXVIJJ. - 48. mercial building is primarily a financial investment , and the architect 's art should help , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a chance like Mr. Richardson 's , there will be a hundred to have a chance like Mr. Babb 's . To the one we shall look to give us now and then a splendid monument ; but upon the others we must depend if the generality of our city streets are to be redeemed from their barren ugliness or hideous deformity . And 50 1 think that Mr. Babb 's simplicity affords a presage of greater value than Mr. Richardson 's magnificence . Indeed , a further word of criticism may be registered . He would be an ungrateful critic who could wish that in this one case Mr. Richardson had built in any other way . He would be a theoretical purist who could say that since here we have something far too splendid and ornate to be strictly appropriate for commercial uses , it is something , therefore , which should be distinctly condemned as sinning against architectural excellence because sinning against fitness and expression of purpose . Yet , nevertheless , I think it would he unfortunate if our architects , dazzled by the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a standard , or as a model fit for imitation . On general grounds such a conclusion would be false ; and on special grounds it would be extremely hurtful . Mr. Richardson 's talent is of a very peculiar sort . Its results are , perhaps , a law unto themselves ; but they are sometimes the last results in the world which should be made a law for others , or which could be safely diluted with the water of imitation . Take away the exuberant strength and fervor which enable Mr. Richardson at times to do unlawful things in a magnificently seductive way , and we should merely have the unlawfulness without the compensating charm . We have not , I repeat , so many fine monumental structures that we need quarrel with this because Mr. Richardson produced it when simply bid to build a warehouse . But it is not every one who would create a monument instead of a pretentious failure in striving for a similar transformation ; and no one at all could do it , I am very sure , if attempting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner which is natural to him . Let us return now to New York , and see how admirable a work of art may be wrought by the perfectly straightforward resolution of a peculiarly utilitarian problem , and without STORES , 173 DUANE STREET , NEW YORE. // the slightest recourse to ornamental embellishment . There is no building in the city which has greater beauty of a purely architectural kind than the huge storage warehouse that Mr. James E. Ware has erected at Lexington Avenue and Forty-second street . Certain factors in the programme gave him , it is true , fine opportunities of a sort which the modern architect seldom enough encounters . For one thing , he had a most unusual chance to build great unbroken fields of wall . We know what effects of imposing grandeur the architects of old realized in such fields . We know the temples of Egypt , the warehouses of Nuremberg , the various wide walls of Spain . And we are tempted to believe that the Roman baths , for instance , are finer in their present denuded state - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were overlaid with a gorgeous dress of " applied " unnecessary features . No complaint is more often in the mouth of the modern architect or his apologist than the complaint that such possibilities are not within his reach . But when by chance they are , how often does he use them well ? How often does he even try to use them at all ? Is any sight more common in our streets than a wall , of necessity unpierced , which its builder has seen fit to " decorate " with blind windows over its entire expanse ? Mr. Ware has not fallen into such suicidal folly , nor has he left his wall in a naked monotony which would make it a mere brute pile , and not a struc/ure . He has grouped his windows , strongly accentuated his string-courses* formed his angles of powerful turrets , and crowned the whole by a finely effective cornice . He has left his fields in simple strength , but has redeemed them from barrenness , emphasized their scale , and turned his building into an imposing work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more truthfully explained . No feature is added for the sake of beauty only , yet each brings its own quota toward general beauty of effect . In detail , as in disposition , there is nothing with which we can find fault , I think , save perhaps the corner doorway , which might have been either more simple or more forcibly accentuated . Everywhere we see evidence of original and happy inspiration . And it is original and happy , because entirely based on practical necessities , which are turned ( not forced ) into artistic opportunities . The building is , by the way , an especially instructive example of the value of light and shade in enhancing architectural forms . Look at it under a bright sun , and you will see how much it owes to the strong markings of its string-courses , to the depth of its reveals , and to the splendid shadows of its cornice and its turret roofs . It is built throughout of red brick , a slight and welcome diversity of color coming through the use of a somewhat darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself beforehand that thus and so a warehouse in a modern street should be conceived . But every eye must now acknowledge that this is just its proper form-for use , for expressiveA STORE AT NEWBURGO. // ness , and for appropriate beauty . It is novel , unexpected , and original ; yet our first glance convinces us that it is right as well as strikingly effective . And are not these the reflections always suggested by a truly fine work of art , and by none that is not fine and true ? No architect of the day deserves more hearty congratulation than does Mr. Ware for the artistic excellence of this building , and still more for the truthful , rational , strictly architectural way in which this has been gained . Its influence ought to be as strong and vital as its birth was unforeseen and welcome . If it could be transported to some ancient town , and tenderly touched with the softening hands of time and of historical association , its beauty would be recognized by all , as it now is by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the new retail stores in our large cities , while far from being perfect or even very good works of art , are yet a noteworthy improvement on their immediate predecessors . We can not really approve , for instance , of the tall Gorham building at the north-west corner of Broadway and Nineteenth street , with its trivial " Queen Anne " detail appropriate only to a structure of one-tenth its size . But since it is of brick , and since its detail , though so feeble , is not loud or vulgar , it is in happy contrast with such a neighbor as Lord &amp; Taylor 's iron shop . At the south-east corner of Twenty-second street is a much better work , still weak in composition , but quiet , straightforward , unpretentious , and agreeable . With others of its class it proves , if nothing more , that rampant ostentation is going out of fashion . Messrs . Peabody &amp; Stearns bave built in Boston a large corner store which , in spite of some unfortunate detail , shows a fair attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is recessed in the corner , the overhanging story being held by powerful columns which strike , in a rational and unforced way , an effective note of variety . In our smaller towns , too , we are giving up the shrieking bathos which characterized our commercial structures of a few years ago - their cast-iron columns , their top-heavy cornices of sanded zinc , their extravagantly awkward detail . If in place of these we usually find as yet only a more or less fantastic " Queen Anne " design , we must still recognize a distinct step in advance . Though not always sensible or appropriate , and sometimes very distressing , yet such designs have now and then a sufficient grace or picturesqueness to make us partly forgive their lack of deeper excellence . And occasionally we find something that is different in character and really good . One such example I have already S 's STORES IN BEDFORD STREET , BOSTON . // noted at Newburgh ; and another , quite unlike it , and of a very charming sort , we see in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sturgis . It is especially interesting since , for once , Gothic forms have been chosen , and have been treated in a very straightforward , sensible , and yet effective fashion . Let us glance a moment at the little Industrial School Mr. Stratton has built on Sixteenth street , in New York , which is illustrated on page 519 , and then pass to something very different . Retail shops and warehouses we have had always with us ; but of late years a new member has been born into our commercial family , which is one of the most unmanageable architectural children that have ever claimed attention in any day or land . We see quite clearly that architecture is not an abstract , merely Kesthetic " art , but an art rooted in practical requirements , and molded by material conditions , when we remember that the invention of the steam passenger-lift has brought about the invention of what have not improperly been called our " elevator buildings , " and that they offer problems as new as they are characteristic of American soil , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enoimous height . This height might not be hopelessly obstructive if one 's other dimensions could be enlarged in proportion , if several stories could be put into a lofty roof , and if windows and wall spaces might be regulated quite at will . But with it goes , most often , a width that is totally inadequate ; almost invariably , the impossibility of adopting a steep roof ; and quite invariably , the necessity for a multitude of small rooms within , and so a multitude of small and monotonously spaced openings without . What is to be done with such a problem ? I have not been surprised to hear some architects say , " Nothing . It is hopeless . We may as well surrender at once . The most we can do is to use good materials and discreet ornamentation . We can attempt no architectural composition , and if we are expressive we must , of WINDOW OVEN DOORWAY OF BEDFORD STREET STORES . course , be monotonous , since there is nothing but monotony to render . We must retire in ignominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , indeed , it would have been well if this modest hopelessness had sometimes regulated action . Especially when we look at our most ambitious apartment houses do we feel that nothing could possibly be worse , and that the barest factory would have been a good deal better . But with apartment houses we are not here concerned . Only the " office building " falls within our present chapter , and when we look at its embodiments we may change our tone a little . I do not know why it should be so , but certainly our down-town " elevator buildings " are far better than their up-town brethren . Perhaps it is because in the commercial work our desire has often been simply to build well , while in our resi A CORNER OF THE MANHATTAN WAREHOUSES . // RECENT ARCHITECTURE IN AMERICA . dences we have wished to be stylish , elegant , and even " pretty , " too Unfortunate desire , and thrice unfortunate results ! By this I do not mean to say that all our office buildings are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art . Some are hideous , and many are simply commonplace . But some are promising , and others , taking into account the difficulties which have hedged them round , may fairly be called successful . No skill , no talent , no inspiration , can ever make a really beautiful building if its proportions must remain radically and glaringly wrong , and if no opportunity is given for masking them by composition with its roofs and masses . And yet we certainly are proving that something bettel may be wrung from even the worst proportions and the most monotonous masses than absolute deformity or barren nakedness . Moreover , if we look at these office buildings chronologically , we can trace , I think , a general advance toward comparative excellence . Surely , most of the latest among them are better , for example , than the Tribune VOL . XXVIII. - 49. building or the Western Union . And when we ask how and why they are better , we find it is because they are simpler , and because their architects have attempted structural composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , is bad in many ways , but good in the bold disposition of its masses , which has been effected by recessing the central portion , and thus putting the courtyard outside , so to say , instead of inside the structure . The Sherman building , at Broadway and Wall street , is hideously bad below , but its upper stories show good structural intentions in their piers and arches . Nor is the Morse building without evidence of effort in the right direction , as we see most clearly when we compare it with " Temple Court " across the street . And the Williamsburgh Insurance building is also comparatively successful in its main mass , in spite of the grotesque ugliness of its porch , with stumpy columns sliding down its balustrade . But better than any of these is Mr. Post 's Post Building - at once simpler , more ra MANHATTAN WAREHOUSES . // tional , and more agreeable than any of its rivals . An irregular site , which might well have proved embarrassing , has been cleverly turned to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls are composed - and as well , I think , as was possible , considering their proportions- by sturdy piers and arches ; and the modest detail is pleasing in itself , and rightly placed best to perform its office . The use of a single tone of pale yellow brick and terra-cotta throughout increases the refinement and reticence which characterize the work . Far more costly and ambitious , and far less successful , is the Washington building on the Battery . Here stone is used throughout , and is treated with a profusion of delicately carved decoration . Composition is attempted , but can hardly be said to be achieved ; for the tall pilasters which run up to the cornice and are crowned with capitals do not compose the wall and unite its features , as do true piers with arches thrown between them . And the elaborate detail is wasted ; for it is too delicate and too small in scale , and is distributed too impartially . One of the most sumptuous of these great structures is Mr. Clinton 's Mutual Life Insurance building on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gives it a certain elegance , and suggests , by the way , the streets of Paris . Its rather elaborate detail is sufficiently well distributed , and its mass has some excellence ( though not striking excellence ) of composition . Mr. Clinton has given us a work which is attractive in many ways , and is neither vulgar nor commonplace . And yet it does not interest us as much as does the Post building , because it is the result of richer opportunities , and because , moreover , it does not look so simply natural and indigenous . We feel that its architect has had a foreign model in mind , while before Mr. Post 's work we feel that he has merely been trying to make the best of his problem in the frankest and easiest way . A work that does not exactly rank with the foregoing , since its scale is so much less , we see in No. 55 Broadway , which is due to Messrs . Babb , Cook &amp; Willard . Its modest extent did not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height remained so lofty . Here there was absolutely no chance to use the truest sort of structural composition ; but there is composition , nevertheless , in the arrangement of the string-courses , of the openings , and of the ornamentation . A treatment so detailed would be out of place in a broader building , but here it was the only thing possible , and has been most successfully carried out . Unity is not lost in variety , and yet the variety is great enough almost to hide from the eye the preposterous proportions of the wall . If such a front can be agreeably treated , there must be hope for all things - more hope than , upon theoretical grounds , we might be inclined to cherish . A new building on the east side of Broadway below Cortlandt street , designed by Mr. Hunt , offered a less difficult problem . It is rich , dignified , and pleasantly effective . Yet we can not give it quite unqualified praise , since it is hardly a piece of true architectural composition . Its beauty comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ajj5iied beauty , though honest and elegant in its own way . A very charming work is Messrs . McKim , Mead &amp; White 's Columbia Bank , on the corner of Forty-second street and Fifth Avenue . THE FARMERS ' SANE , ALBANY , N. V. // Its masses are modeled by the strong projection of two bays on its longer side , the narrow Fifth Avenue front being analogous to these bays in the treatment of its upper portions . The lower story throughout is of stone beautifully worked , and is finished with a delicate cornice . The brick wall above is set back a little , producing a fortunate effect of variety and increased apparent stability . The windows are grouped in large square openings , and a delicate ornamentation of terra-cotta enforces the architectural lines and adds an element of quiet richness and elegance . The small loggias which surmount the bays are welcome features , lightening the structure in the place where lightness is appropriate . There is perhaps some confusion in the use of the terra-cotta , its role sometimes being constructive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined treatment that always characterizes the interior work of these architects , though properly subdued into accordance with utilitarian purposes . On the south-east corner of Broadway and Broome street is a building which can hardly be called a successful work of art . But beneath the infelicities of its execution we perceive a general idea which seems deserving of much praise . This is the idea of treating the central portion of the long wall in a somewhat screen-like fashion , subordinating it to bays which project at its extremities . These bays correspond in width to the narrower p*r * facade , and the corner , of course , is treated as a whole . I should like to see what the architects of the Columbia Bank would make of this arrangement , which is well suggested , but not well developed , in the Broome street work . With a front as narrow and a height as great as those of their bank , a rather towerlike treatment of the corner might be an interesting experiment . I may note , in passing , an accessory detail which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempt ( and it is not unsuccessful ) to bring the sign-boards which so disfigure our business structures into harmony among themselves , and to render them as little hurtful as possible to their architectural background . But the most conspicuous of all the new commercial buildings of NewYork still remains for notice . This is the Produce Exchange of Mr. Post . There is no recent work of which it is so difficult to speak with fairness ,  --  so great are its defects , and yet so great in some respects its excellence . I may as well confess at once that its ornamental details are as bad INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL IN WEST SIXTEENTH STREET , NEW YORE. // STORE AT 55 BROADWAY , REW YORK . as bad can be . Also ,  --  and this is a more important point ,  --  that it is an extremely untruthful structure , so far as expressiveness is concerned , its exterior being quite unrelated to the disposition of its interior parts . The problem was not an easy one , I know - to build an immense hall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and above it in every inch of space it left unfilled . But a better solution , if not a perfectly true one , might well have been secured ; and knowing Mr. Post 's ability , we may believe he would have found it but for the feverish haste with which the work was pushed - a haste that is likely to do us ill service very often in the future , as it has done in the past in more instances than this . But , after all possible deficiencies are noted , it remains true that the Produce Exchange , superficially considered for beauty only , is one of the most imposing monuments we have . I have often spoken of the sort of composition which results ftom the harmonious disposition of diverse masses and features ; but there is another sort which comes through the emphatic repetition of a few well-chosen motives . This is the kind Mr. Post has used in a broad , powerful , and singularly effective fashion . Take away in imagination the story above the cornice , which was , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utterly superfluous and disturbing tower ; forget the unfortunate porches and the crude ornamentation , and we have a structure which is very fine in general proportion , and in the shape , sequence , and contrast of strong and even noble features . The good qualities of the Produce Exchange must be good indeed , since they so easily persuade us to shut our eyes to so many and so grave defects . I might , of course , very much extend this list of our commercial buildings . Without going further afield ,  --  where I doubt not there is much of value and of interest to be found , -I might note other good works in Boston , and certain bank buildings in Philadelphia which are rich and ambitious without being vulgar or inadequate . But no good purpose would be gained . This is not , as I have said before , a ca/alogze raisonn* of everything we have lately done . It is merely an attempt - how imperfect and unduly brief no one knows so well as I - to indicate the direction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of progress they are making . I can not really record this progress . I can only il/us/rate it by a few examples , and try to explain it so that some hitherto indifferent eyes may be interested in its true nature and its best possibilities . If I have not done thisif I have not explained the excellence of certain works in a clear enough way to enable my readers to appreciate the kindred excellence of such others as may fall beneath their notice , and to see wherein lie the faults of less successful essays - if I have not done this , I say , I have lamentably failed in my chief intention . I have rendered of no avail the only excuse that could justify a layman in passing criticism upon the work of a profession which , more than any other in our day , is surrounded by limitations , fettered by difficulties , and discouraged and hampered by a lack of true popular understanding . If I may still be granted a little space , I will utilize it to dwell upon an important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have said that what , for want of a better term , may be called // FORTY-SECOND STREET ENTRANCE , COLUMBIA BANE BUILDING . structural finish is an influential factor in architectural beauty , and one which can not at all be appreciated in illustrations . By structural finish I do not mean the arrangement of features nor the execution of ornamental details . I mean an architect 's treatment of his materials in the main portions of his work . Structural finish may be imperfect in two * different ways - mechanically or artistically . It may sin through mere carelessness , stupidity or dishonesty of workmanship . A structure may be badly built through being weakly or clumsily put together ; but the best built structure , mechanically considered , may sin artistically through the unwise selection and arrangement of its units . Most of our work did sin conspicuously in just this way until a very few years ago . Either there was no attempt at beauty and variety in the shaping and disposition of the units of construction , or that attempt was made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  an average brown-stone dwelling , built of uniformly proportioned blocks , often sadly out of scale with the size of the structure , and always smoothed to the dreariest monotony of surface , or such a basement as that of the Sherman building , with its brutal masses of rock and its various other vagaries of treatment . Look now at the lower story of the Columbia Bank , and you will see what I mean by good structural finish . The stones are neither too small nor too large , too rough nor too smooth , for their position and for appropriate contrast with the brick wall above ; and they are disposed in a way which gives them a truly COLUMBIA BANE BUILDING , CORNER OF FORTY-SECOND STREET AND FIFTH AVENUE , NEW YORE. 521 *zrr *t*9 // decorative beauty of their own . We are improving rapidly in this point , I rejoice to say . We are beginning to feel how greatly beauty depends upon the proper size , surface finish , and arrangement of our building-stones , and to divine how under given circumstances it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon judicious treatment , since they have less individual excellence to redeem bad disposition . Awhile ago there was but one way in which we cared to use them . We built all our visible brick walls as smooth as possible , painting them bright red as soon as they showed signs of " weathering , " and " pointing " them into conspicuous individual life with strong white lines . Certainly , we could have hit upon no worse device ; for when our units of structure are hopelessly ignoble , their individual effect should not be insisted upon . It should be allowed to sink unperceived into the effect of mass , or to produce mere vague diversities of tone . This is the way in which the Lexington Avenue storage warehouse has been built . If it is left intact , its present crudeness of color and hard smoothness of texture will after a while be subdued into softer beauty . But suppose that as soon as it begins to show traces of dust and weather , it is spruced up after our time-honored fashion with bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into exasperating prominence ! I do not care to dwell upon the thought . I may add , moreover , that judging from the beauty of the old brick-work of Spain and Italy , a rougher , so-called " commoner , " surface than that of our pressed brick would often tell to better advantage ; and also , that the introduction of more varied sizes and shapes is a great desideratum . The bricks the Romans used , for instance , were more like what we call tiles in form , and were set with very much thicker and rougher mortar seams between them . The result is , that the impression of tiny units is lost in an impression of mass , and that this mass has a less mechanical surface and a pleasanter variety of tone than are attained in our regular and neatly laid constructions . I am glad to note , therefore , one instance in which a bold innovation has been made upon our current practice , and with the distinctest success . Messrs . McKim , Mead &amp; White are building a large house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARE BUILDINO.
