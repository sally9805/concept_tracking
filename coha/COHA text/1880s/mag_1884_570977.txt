ARTICLE II. - * - -  TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES . II . THE CUSTOMS TARIFF . THE State in the form to which political evolution has finally carried it is the consensus and enrollment of all the people , partly for the transaction of business in which all are equally concerned but principally for security from dangers to which all are equally exposed . If it has any right to exist at all it has zpso facto the right to the means necessary for the ends of its existence , and among the rest to so much of the national wealth as it requires for the protection of the remainder and of the persons of its subjects . As the expenses of the State are all practically current expenses provided for by continuous or periodical taxation , what rightfully belongs to it is a definite proportion of the whole product or revenue of the wealth of the nation ; for the capital required to produce the wealth of future years can not belong to the State for the expenses of the current year . This proportion of the whole again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several revenues of all the subjects ; for the State can have no rightful claim upon the property of any one beyond the uniform rate for all . On the one hand the budget which calls for a sum-total greater than the legitimate expenses of the State , and on the other the taxation which in the end takes from any subject more than his proportion , is appropriation of the very property which the State is set to protect . With this recapitulation we may return to the case with which we began . Brown&amp; Co. have imported a certain num ber of watches upon which , delivered at their house in New York , they have paid $1000 to the manufacturers and a fourth of this in duties to the government . To bring out more clearly the full effect of the tax let us suppose that they have invested all their available means , say $1,000,000 , in foreign watches , of which sum they will have paid $800,000 to the manufacturers and $200,000 to the government . It is evident that this latter sum as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the // rate of taxation , at the same time is uniforn everywhere th' government will have taken one-fifth part of the whole capital wealth of the country . Now there are several contingencies in which this may be supposed to have actually occurred . For example , it may have been concluded that communism is the true political gospel , that the State as everybody 's trustee and agent is rightful proprietor of all property , and the people may have resolved hy a constitutional majority to begin the experiment by conveying to its agent a fifth part of its wealth to be administered in its behalf . Or again , it may have been concluded and resolved that the best provision for the expenses of the State is a permanent endowment to that amount , the annual revenue from which will release the people from all future burdens of taxation as the police relieves it from service on the posse comitalu8 , a standing army from military service , or the constitution of certain courts from service on the jury . Or again , to meet some excepi4onal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now matured and payment on which is demanded , so that caught , if one may say so , between the devil of default and the deep sea of liquidation it meets its engagements by appropriating to that purpose the requisite portion of the national wealth . In all these cases the confiscation once effected the account is closed ; its force is exhausted when the money is taken and the necessity provided for . The State put in possession of a fifth part of the national wealth , whether as administrator in behalf of the people , or as permanently endowed for transacting its business and protecting its rights , or as furnished with the means of paying off its debt capital , has no further claim until a new necessity of the same kind arises and another portion of the national wealth is appropriated to meet it . But as it happens there are no traces of any of these necessities in the fiscal position of the United States . The doctrine of communism is a mere speculation of certain peculiar theorists , the magnificent national endowment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homestead law and in land-grants , and as to its capital debt the anxiety of the creditors is not that it will not be paid at maturity but that it will . In a word it is under no pressure of instant and final liquidation whatsoever , but is tranquilly providing // for its current expenses , in which all claims upon it have been merged , by continuous taxation . So when Brown &amp; Co. pay a fifth part of their capital in import duties they are not only paying an exceptional and disproportionate tax , but a tax which does not close the account and release them from further taxation ; on the contrary , every time their capital comes back in the shape of a new importation they pay the fifth part of it over again . How can they possibly continue business under burdens like these ? The answer is that the duty paid to the government is as much a part of the cost of the watches as the price paid to the manufacturers , and is at once charged along with all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Brown &amp; Co. are provided with the requisite capital to advance to the government and are sure of a sale at remunerative prices , the amount of the duty is a matter of perfect indifference to them ; all they have to fear is that the ii*creased. cost of their goods may increase the difficulty of finding purchasers and so diminish the volume of their business ; otherwise they wholly escape the effects of what looks like exorbitant and ruinous taxation . They are in fact what is called middle men , mere transfer agents whose business is to put goods on the market , and the capital they advance to the manufacturer , the carrier , the underwriter , the government , to all in short whose charges have added to the cost , is immediately reimbursed to them upon sale , that is , is circulating capital which distributes the burdens put upon it to the capital in which circulation ends , the fixed capital of final investments . He who last buys the watch not for sale but to keep and use , foots the whole bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers to the merchants , and among the rest the duty charged by the government . Brown &amp; Co. are in effect unaccredited agents who collect for the government the duty distributed among and ultimately paid by the consumers. * * Capital , according to the standard definition , is distinguished from Land or Labor as wealth accumulated to assist in the further production of wealth ; which to the uninitiated sounds much like a distinction without a difference , since land and labor are not only wealth in that they may be exchanged for their equivalents but are two of the three factors which assist in producing more wealth . Capital , so defined , is // Now this function might be exercised by all other middle men whether dealing in foreign or domestic products ; they could all as easily collect the duty for the government as first cost for the manufacturer , freight for the carrier , insurance for the underwriter , or interest and profit for themselves . If it were in the power of the government to surprise and detain the goods in* the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the consumer , and to ascertain their cost at the moment of detention it would have no difficulty in levy . ing a duty upon them as in the case of the imported watches . In this way the entire expenses of the State for the current year might be charged upon the circulating capital employed in putting the year 's product on the market and so distributed *among the consumers , who are the whole population . But this is not all . When one buys a watch he does not usually draw on any part of his capital to pay for it . The living wealth he holds invested in real estate or securities or in his business is continually reproducing itself in rent , interest , or profits , and he is no more likely to stop the reproduction and turn it into dead wealth by buying watches with it than the laborer is to impair his productive capital by maiming himself or ruining his health . Either will do it in an emergency or under strong either circulating capital consisting of the food and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or fixed capital consisting of machines , factories and other things which assist labor and are consumed slowly . It seems to be therefore a part of labor , which is the discovery Mr. Henry George makes after defluing it as that form of productive wealth which is not land or labor . I venture to use the word according to its etymology and popular acceptation as any source or fountain-head of revenue , whether land , labor or accumulated savings ; and revenue as any return or income of capital , whether rent , wages or profits . The generic term is wealth , whose two species are capital and revenue in their several varieties . By circulating capital I mean simply capital in circulation , wealth of any kind held for exchange with other kinds ; and by fixed capital , as I have said , the wealth in which the circulation ends . Real estate , slaves , machines , railways , to the dealers in those articles are as much circulating capital as food or clothes ; they all become fixed capital when taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the same wealth gets back into circulation again sooner or later , but in a different form and other relations . Practically the solution of continuityis complete and this I take to be the basis of the real distinction between the two things . // temptation , but in ordinary circumstances he will pay for his watch out of his wages or his income . The daily wants , conveniencies and luxuries of life , in general the whole consumption of the country , are ultimately provided for out of the earnings of capital and not out of capital itself . We may therefore define the direct taxation of the circulating capital of any country as an indirect income-tax and admitting for the moment that the State is justified in renouncing , as all States do , the direct appropriation of what rightfully belongs to it , namely a uniform proportion of every man 's income , there is probably no more satisfactory source of public revenue than a tax on circulating capital . But it is to be observed that of the whole volume of this capital a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the government to stop the goods and ascertain their value anywhere on the way from the producer to the consumer . For example , the most of the hay grown in the United States is consumed on the farms where it grows , in which case producer and consumer are one ; there is no middle man , no advance or re-imbursement of capital , no measurement and valuation of the product . Of the surplus if any , nearly the whole is sold in the immediate neighborhood , in which case if there is no middle man there is measurement and valuation of the thing sold ; but it would be clearly indefinitely easier to tax the whole income of every farmer en bloc than the several products sold separately from his farm . Produce of this sort requiring no process of manufacture to fit it for the market is absorbed so promptly and in such endless detail that it escapes all possibility of assessment . This is true too of manufactured commodities produced in small quantities for neighborhood consumption . The capital advanced all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailor , the miller , like that advanced to the farmers around the village , flows in quantities too minute , through circuits too short and complicated to admit of computation . It is only the surplus products natural or manufactured left over by local consumption , and gathered from a broad territory in great quantities at a central point for wide re-distribution thence , that are accessible to the go.vernment . // Now concentration of this sort takes place on the largest and most conspicuous scale when the varied surplus of one country is brought together to supply the wants of another . Thus the entire exportation from the United States to Europe must be collected at a few sea-ports and subjected there to exact measurement and valuation before being shipped . So far as accessibility is concerned there is no part of the circulating capital of any country more clearly indicated for taxation than the capital advanced by the exporter , and in the United States none probably would better bear the burden . Our position today is so peculiar and commanding that the ordinary expenses of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our surplus cotton and food products . But a tax on circulating capital , at whatever point in the circulation levied , is paid by the consumer , who in this case is an alien , so that it is in our power to shift the whole cost of government to the subjects of other States . The objection is that it is not they who make government with us necessary or for whose benefit it exists ; a tax paid by them , unless a war-measure , is spoliation , the appropriation by the State of property not its own . But this very consideration which excludes from taxation the capital advanced by the exporter of domestic produce , selects for taxation the capital advanced by the importer of foreign produce , for imports into the United States are for consumption in the United States and the duties upon them are paid by residents of the United States . Nothing can be more artless than the notion which actually survives in some quarters that duties on foreign goods are a means for shifting our burdens to foreign shoulders , paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer who pays , whoever he is . If we want the foreigner to pay the costs of our government we should levy duty on our exports ; if like honest men we want to pay them ourselves we may levy duty on our imports . Here then are clear and intelligible motives for taxation ; first , property in a form eminently accessible to the government , seeing that it is concentrated at the points where the great channels of commerce intersect the national frontier , and is delivered there under exact measurement and valuation in The accompanying invoices and bills of lading ; second , prop // erty which distributes the charges upon it including the import duty to all the subjects of the State by whom the duty is levied and to no one else . Accordingly all civilized States have retained the duty and we may be sure will continue it until indirect taxation of all kinds is abandoned . The ideal of the free tFader is an impracticable dream as things are . He will never strike off what he calls the schackles and fetters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its revenue in direct taxation of the product of the national wealth . Meanwhile the only question in order is whether in taxing the capital employed in the importation of foreign merchandise , the State is controlled exclusively by the two considerations which justify the sax , namely , the accessibility and the distributing power of the property on which it is laid . The customs tariff of the United States in its original form was one of a group of measures adopted on the spur of the moment to save the commonwealth from extreme and instant peril . It was in effect , like the call for volunteers or for subscribers to the national loan , an appeal to the patriotism and self-sacrifice of the people , and with its companion act , the internal revenue tariff , was drafted , with the single intent of bringing into the treasury the largest possible tribute in the smallest possible space of time . It would be unreasonable to consult the taxation of 1860- ' 64 for anything beyond the supreme necessity and emotion of the hour . There was in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no preparation by previous experience , for scientific calculation of the most productive and equitable sources of revenue . All considerations as to the relative accessibility and distributing power of different forms of property gave way to the apparent necessity of drawing at once from property in any form that was at all accessible the utmost tribute that it would bear . No doubt even as a war measure , a desperate provision for a desperate emergency , the whole fiscal system of that time , including both the contraction of the public debt and the corresponding taxation , is open to technical criticism , but it is forever absolved with all its errors by the simple motive of its inspiration and the triumphant vindication of results . The question of motives enters only with the continuance of the customs tariff // after the emergency had passed , and all the other measures adapted to meet it had been abandoned . Why are we here to-day in a time of profound peace and an overflowing treasury paying upon our imports substantially the same duties we paid during the war of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxed to save as we were taxed then to save the commonwealth ? What considerations have determined the State to leave upon a particular form of property burdens long since removed from forms which the other day were equally bur-dened ? The war duties upon imports have been maintained since the close of the war for the distinct and specifie purpose of augmenting the cost of the goods and thereby obstructing their sale in the American market . This evidently is so far from being a legitimate and permissible state motive that it is not a state motive at all , for it is the business of the State as protector of the property of its subjects to protect it from arbitrary and artificial charges ; and its interest to maintain the natural price and so promote the sale of commodities which it taxes , inasmuch as the larger the sale the greater is the available source of its revenue . They who are interested in the artificial price and the obstructed sale are neither the people nor the agent of the people ; they are the producers of commodities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch is handicapped with a duty equal to one-fourth of its real value , that the untaxed American watch may have easier sale in a better market ; in general the open arena accessible to the whole world of commerce in which prices adjust themselves to real values according to the laws of world-wide demand and supply is closed to the foreign producer that the producer at home may advance his prices beyond real values yet retain his customers . It goes without saying that a close market of this kind becomes at once and inevitably a rendezvous for all the blind avidities and rapacities of commerce . Every producer exerts himself to maintain or procure the highest possible duty on the foreign article both to diminish competition and to increase his prices , coalitions are formed of all producers of the same and of affiliated products to influence legislation , and the simple motive of providing for public expenses by equable taxation of the na // tional wealth disappears in the chaos of conflicting personal and class interests which dictate the tariffi This perversion of the functions of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few is disguised under the taking euphemism of protection to American industry , or more exactly American manufactures ; a capital instance of that delusive generalization or " realization of abstractions , " common enough in metaphysics and theology , but nowhere more mischievous than in the domain of the historical and political sciences . For twenty years the intelligence of the people has been paralyzed or perverted by a phrase , as the political energies of all Europe were for ages by the doctrine of the divine right of the sovereign . The implication is that the industries in question are American in derivation and right , as the kingship was divine , that the whole people in some way participates in them and is responsible for them as for American liberty or American law ; that they are a national concern to be defended against all comeris by the State . Stripped of the imposing abstraction the naked facts are that the industries i-epresen*ed in the tariff are the private enterprises of certain American citizens , or residents on American soil , which concern the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to add to the prosperity of the country , like American agriculture or American labor which do not figure in the tariff at all . The humblest of them is entitled to protection , if need be in the full measure of the power of the State ; but protection from what and what kind of protection ? From fraud and violence , from the common enemy for whose repression the State exists . But foreign competition is not a common enemy . There is no disturbance of public order and security , no wrong to person or property , no violence or fraud , in putting a Swiss watch on the American market . On the contrary the presence of the Swiss watch at its real value is a factor for determining the real value of the American watch ; the free admission of the world 's products along with our own is the only way of finding out what our own are worth and should be " protected " by the State in the interest of the people , for the whole people is concerned in buying what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its real value . But this is precisely what the producer fears , and // asks to be protected from under the alarming generalization of foreign hostility , namely an open market whose free exchanges settle the real value of his products . If he were content with or could afford to take this he would not require protection . So what he demands and has actually got is compensation for incompetence and a bounty on inferior goods. * The remarkable thing is that the inferiority is openly avowed - under another euphemism , and made part of the plea for protection . It is said that American manufactures are as yet in their " infancy " and therefore unprepared for competition with robust foreign manufactures , which , it is further said , have acquired their adult vigor and their aptitude for infanticide by having been protected when they were infants . This I am persuaded is the most picturesque and pathetic abstraction in the whole range of political philosophy . Here the implication is that the American people has incurred the solemn responsibilities of paternity by having engendered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , but doomed to untimely extinction unless sheltered from the foreign foe , and suckled at the maternal bosom of the State . The fact again is that the American manufacturer himself is no infant whatever his manufacture may be , but as adult as any . body and one of the shrewdest of his kind , a man who like the American farmer , or miner , or merchant , or banker , has availed himself of the liberty secured to him by the State to choose among all the ventures of commerce the one which suits * The point may be best made by an example . Let us suppose two watches , each the exact duplicate of the other , the one made in the United States at a cost of $100 , the other , owing to differences in methods and the wages of labor , in Switzerland at a cost of $80 . The latter will then sell at a profit of 25 per cent . for $100 , which is the manufacturing cost of the other , and supposing the profit to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each . The import duty of 25 per cent . on the wholesale price of the Swiss watch overcomes this difference and enables the American watch to dispute the market at a profit of 25 per cent . and to command it at a profit of 24 . Whichever of the two he takes the American purchaser is forced to pay 24 or 25 per cent . more than its real value . It is beside the point to plead the benefits to American industry or to the country of such protection . Were everybody else the better for it it is spoliation of the purchaser and the immorality of it simply does not admit of discussion . // him best . As he is the sole author of it so is he solely responsible for its issue , and as he isto reap all the profits so should he bear all the losses . That the enterprise is new to the country , and so under the disadvanages of inexperience , untrained labor and a preoccupied market , is perfectly well known to him in advance as a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open in expectation of finding his ultimate reward in it . It must be said of him therefore , that he pleads the baby act with perfect absurdity in the wrong court . His appeal should be to his friends if his own means are insufficient , or to the capital around him waiting for investment , or to the charitable public which founds lying-in hospitals and infant asylums . But he has no right to ask , and the State none to grant , a modification of the common environment for his exclusive benefit , an artificial milieu in which he can force upon us the products of his infant industry at prices beyond the real values of the products of industries in full maturity . That the infant sufferer is American is an appeal to our sympathies and our patriotism , but absolutely no concern of the State whatsoever ; an occasion for charity perhaps , but certainly not a motive for legislation and not an excuse for spoliation of the people . The crowning wrong is that there are no assignable bounds to the spoliation as there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the law , however rigorously defined , is a wide generalization of the most practical kind , establishing a principle and a precedent which may be rightfully invoked against the State in all similar cases . The principle is that it is the duty of the State to enable the American manufacturer to undersell his foreign competitor at remunerative prices . This it has effected by creating artificial values which make up for the higher cost and inferior quality of his goods . If now for any cause , and especially for any cause attributable to the action of the State , the inferiority and costliness increase , the right to increased protection follows ; the poorer and dearer the goods become the higher the duty required to overcome foreign competition . Now the policy of protection itself tends to the deterioration of the protected industry , that is to the necessity of ever increasing protection . For the law of all // development is the inexorable law of survival of the fittest , and fitness for survival , in other words the superiority of any product to competing products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of protection is meant to exclude . The watch like any organism has grown by minute successive modifications in the instrument itself and in the processes of its manufacture , each of which is an improvement or an advance on all previous modifications struck out by the inventor in the struggle for life to keep up with the rising demands of the consumer . What any manufacture requires and never more than in its infancy is that universal demand which stimulates invention , and that unrestricted competition which instructs the inventor and puts him on his mettle . But what occasion is there for inventiveness and business enterprise of the normal kind , for improvement in the process and the product , for that superiority which beats the competitor out of the market , when the bare fact of American origin c*mmands higher prices than the best work ? The time , talent , and capital needed for improvement are spent to better purpose in influencing legislation , with the sure result that while the individual manufacturer may grow rich on his spoils American manufactures stand still or lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrepitude and decay . At the same time the obstructed market is a perpetual temptation to the foreigner who exerts himself to recover it by the only means left to him , the greater excellence and economy of his work . The incentives taken from the native are offered by the same hand to his rival and the improvement of foreign products goes on with the deterioration of our own as the same wind blows two ships in opposite directions . But this transfer to the foreigner of all the incentives to improvement leaves with the native manufacturer a most powerful incentive to production . The artificial price by which he profits being created outright by act of the legislature and not gradually evolved under the natural conditions of unobstructed supply and demand takes effect suddenly , excluding foreign competition and delivering up the home market without preparation to the home producer . Thus the equable competition without violent pressure or strain anywhere between // all producers in all markets is abruptly converted into a life and death struggle of a few producers each of whose fortunca depends upon prompt preoccupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be gradually recovered by the increased excellence and cheapness of the foreign product , or thrown open at any time by another act of the legislature . Over production follows and a suffocated market , a fall in prices which wipes out the artificial price created by the duty on imports , enforced idleness of capital , machinery , and labor , all reacting in acute crisis or long depression of the business interests of the whole country . Already the cry goes up all over the land that the home market is insufficient and that an outlet must be found into the foreign market . At this moment every minister and consul of the United States is under orders to " push " the sale of American products abroad . But as it is beyond the power of the State to augment prices beyond the range of its own taxation the only means it has for capturing the indispensable foreign market is a bounty on exports , a contribution from the public treasury which will remunerate the manufacturer for his loss in underselling the foreign competitor on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either it has exceeded its rights in laying the duty on imports or betrayed its trust in withholding the equally necessary bounty on exports . In fact it has practically conceded the principle by remitting the internal revenue duties on certain articles . when sold abroad . This then is the fatality of all class legislation that it immediately creates the necessity for further legislation of the same sort . You ca n't hold the Rhine without the Rhine provinces . The smallest perversion of the functions of the common agent of the people to the exclusive service of an individual or a class means in time the subversion of the State . If the acquisi. tiveness of the manufacturing class had any logic in it and the courage of conviction the protective tariff would be a pronunciamiea to , the proclamation of a revolution . Finally it is to be observed that exceptional privileges of any kind can be secured to one class of subjects only by exceptional burdens imposed upon some other . The artificial price by which the producer profits is created by the duty on // imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fundamental principle of our polity the only motive permitted to the State for imposing exceptional burdens is wrongdoing of the subjects who bear them ; that other subjects benefit by them is an aggravation of the injury if the sufferers are unoffending . The usual argument that American manufacturers are benefited by the exclusion of foreign competition , that protection does in fact protect , is irrelevant and offensive . It may be perfectly true , but if true it only forces the previous question , what right has the State to tax the consumer of foreign products beyond the uniform rate for all ? The answer is that it has no right unless the purchase and use of foreign products is a public wrong , an injury to the people and an offense to the State ; for disproportionate taxation is of the nature of penalty , and penalties are to be inflicted only on the subject who has merited them . This is a point which it is not easy to treat with becoming gravity , but the fact is that the whole protective policy rests upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praiseworthy in using the products of our own country so there is a kind of disloyalty in using those of other countries ; a latent feeling which strikes fire sometimes in the collisions of two peoples , as when the ladies of Berlin resolved the other day to import no more fashions from Paris , or when the Boston patriots threw the contaminated tea overboard . So to buy English cottons or an English ship is to enrich the English spinner or builder , and through him to add to the wealth and power of our hereditary rival and foe . The very existence of foreign States , however amicable our actual relations with them may be , is a perpetual menace to our security , and one of the principal reasons why we have to maintain and arm a State ourselves . To help them by making a market for their products is a sort of treason deserving reprobation . An expression of the enormity of the offense and of the popular feeling about it may be found in any recent budget of the United States . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the rebellion of 1860 were in round numbers about $200,000,000 , no part of which was drawn as penalty from the revolted States . For the same year the customs revenue was $187,000,000 , // which nearly balanced the account . So that the sin of rebellion , if it was a sin , has been most fittingly expiated , not by the rebel but by the consumer of foreign products . Now to this it might be replied as before that the popular feeling is the realization of an empty abstraction , that it is not in their industries that foreign States are a menace to us or to anybody but in their dynastic ambitions and race animosities , the political antagonisms which have arrested the civilization of the old world in the dead-lock of an armed truce and burdened the industries by which we all benefit in a thousand ways under the weight of military preparation . But the fitting and conclusive answer is that if the use of foreign commodities is a public wrong it is not a proper source of public revenue . Importation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be taxed ; it should be prohibited , and if persisted in should be punished ; a principle of wide application to which we shall have to recur . The position into which the State has been betrayed is morally intolerable and impossible . It gives character to a specific act by laying burdens on the agent which in our polity are nothing if not punitive ; and condones the offense of its own defining in order to continue the burdens by which it profits . To resume . The protective tariff is an anomaly in American legislation ; a violent interruption and reversal of the normal evolution of our fiscal system justified only for the moment by exceptional conditions which have long since disappeared . Our duty is to get it out of the way with what promptitude is possible ; to dismiss at once and forever as a motive for State action the protection of any class at the expense of any other ; to remove from the market every vestige of arbitrary and artificial prices as rapidly as the business situation will permit ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions of regular development toward the only result any honest man can avow , the uniform taxation , for the equal benefit , of all . // 48* ARTICLE 111. - TIlE GENESIS OF MODERN FREE INSTITUTIONS . GOVERNMENT is not an accident . It has its origin in the essential elements of human nature . Aristotle styled man a political animal ; and the profoundest investigations into the nature of the State have only confirmed the appropriateness of the epithet . While the individual will is free , men in masses act , under Providence , in accordance with clearly defined laws . Social and political organization and progress are the outcome of tendencies common to the race . Forms may vary , types may change ; yet behind all the vicissitudes in the history of states lie principles as invariable in their application as the physical and moral laws of the universe . A chain of causes and effects connects the past with the present , the present with the future . True , indeed , great men rise up , and the whole commonwealth may seem to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their less gifted fellows , with clearer insight into the realities of their time , and hence with greater power to influence others .

A single will may influence , may in a measure direct or control ; but human society is too complex an organism to be built up or destroyed by an individual . Political institutions are the incarnations of ideas , which , implanted in the race , are developed according to circumstances . Like a living organism they have periods of growth , maturity , and decay . They have a reason of being , a mission ; when this is fultilled , they crumble and disappear and live only in results . They are the outcome of efforts , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men with // one another as members of a common body , or natural group . toward the adjustment of life with its surroundings . They take shape in accordance with the tendencies and needs of the society in which they originate . The study of political institutions is important and fruitful ; for thereby may be sought out the principles that underlie and condition their origin and destiny . Hence may be drawn useful lessons for the throbbing political life of to-day . This is especially the case with those institutions that had their originative impulse in the desire of a people to achieve self-government ; for in the civilized portions of the world the trend of States has long been towards democratic forms . The political history of the race may be summed up as the gradual realization of the idea of freedom .

Equality of rights , by which all stand on a like footing before the law ; civil liberty , which grants to every man not fool nor traitor the privileges of citizenship and a voice in the government ; representation , the means by which the individual will is exercised through delegated powers -- these three elements distinguish the complex tendencies of modern political life from those of the past . Could there be equality of rights in antiquity , when every people made its captives slaves , and the bondmen outnumbered the free ? Even Aristotle taught that slavery exists by nature ; while Plato recognized in it a natural and just institution when slaves were of other birth than Greek .

Slavery had been replaced by serfdom and the underling still cringed before the master . Nor was civil liberty known in the past . Nowhere ,  --  not even in the so-called democracies of Greece ,  --  was there popular government in the modern sense . Large classes , including foreigners and slaves , were without the franchise and had no political guaranties . Local and class interests prevailed . There was no national spirit in Greece , at any time ; little among the iRomans even in the pairniest days of the republic . Thus in the states of antiquity there was always a ruling class ; it rested its claims to supremacy on blood , or on wealth , or on military power ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , with the guaranties it pre-supposes and must have in order to be lasting , was a thing not dreamed of . Freedom and citizenship were great boons that the magnanimity of the State might grant ; they were . never looked upon as rights , to be claimed and asserted . The man is made for the State , the State may him if nee use him , may sacrifice d be , was the fundamental dogma of ancient politics ; and the voice of the individual was hushed before the image of that gigantic abstraction , the State . And what was the State ? Simply a town , not a nation . The city , not the man , was the political unit . Sparta , where through a harsh and unnatural communism personal will was made entirely subservient to public law , was cited by the philosophers as the highest type of polity ; and many of the political Utopias of modern as well as well as of ancient times have been patterned after it . The Roman Empire , which held its sway over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private law breaking down the distinctions of locality and class , yet gave to the individual as member of the commonwealth no greater prominence than the States of the earlier time had done . The cause of the long duration of its power is not , indeed , to be found in the intelligent patriotism of its citizens . The career *of the city-state , when standing alone , is short and brilliant , // as is shown by the history of Greece . But in the Roman Empire there was a balancing of authorities , a counterpoise of local and central powers , that insured permanency to both . The Empire , politically , was made up , not of nations but of cities ; over against the municipal tendencies towar ( l disintegration was set the unifying , centralizing power of the Emperor . With the decline of morals and the insatiate extortions of the government , I ) owever , the curial , or mi ( ldle class of the cities degenerated and lost heart . As an element of strength it had been to the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic  --  the mainstay of the state . With its decline the last prop of the crumbling Roman power was gone . The wild tribes of the north swept down , to find little to oppose their progress . The municipal organizations alone remained ; the cities stood , like rocks in the torrent , destined to await the dawning of a brighter day when the reviving impulses of a new order of things should stimulate them again to activity an ( l prosperity . The decaying fabric of Roman supremacy utterly disappeared . Out of cities the Roman Empire had been made up , back into its original units it was resolved . The barbarians destroyed indeed , but nothing of the old civilization of real value to humanity perished . Rather , into an effete existence were intro ( luced new elements of strength and vigor . Among the Teutonic conquerors do we first find those principles of freedom and loyalty which , breathed upon by the hallowing spirit of Christianity and wrought into full expression through centuries of turmoil , form , in the Magna Charta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anglo-Saxon liberties . The Germanic race , moreover , not only molded the polity of the English-speaking peoples , but also left strong impress upon the political institutions of all Western an ( l Southern Europe . In the recesses of his native forests the German acknowledged no master save himself . Rulers and leaders there were , it is true , but the functions of king and general were not united in the same person , and both were chosen by the people . " Kingly power , " says Tacitus , was " not unlimited nor arbitrary , " and command was " by example rather than by authority . " // None had the right to punish save the priests . Brave and warlike men gathered about them bands of hardy followers and went forth to seek conquest and victory ; but the only tie between leader and troop was loyalty ; there was no compulsion . The most characteristic feature of the tribal orgaruzations was personal independence , individual freedom . When the Germanic tribes passed down into Western and Southern Europe , they settled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusty followers , as rewards for service , portions of land , which were to be held at his pleasure , or for life , on condition of rendering aid whenever he should desire it . The former inhabitants were not destroyed ; they remained as a subject population , tilling for the victorious invaders . The conquering chiefs from the circumstances of the case became kings ; but the kingdoms thus founded were unsubstantial and short-lived . The tract of land allotted to warriors became transferable by inheritance , the property of the heir being subject to certain conditions , the principal of which were that of military service and of reversion to the chief or sovereign in case . the line of descent should be broken . Hence arose the feudal system , with its many gradations of rank and its intricate relations . The fief instead of the kingdom became the unit of political organization , and kingship was but an empty title , a shadow of authority , attached to the line of some larger fief . The power was distributed among lords and barons , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villians priedial and personal , the lines of social and political demarkation were sharply drawn and as closely observed as might of arms could enforce . Disintegration and isolation were the characteristics of feudalism . The period was one of gloom , of ignorance , of discord and oppression . Even the towns , being obliged to place themselves under the protection of some lord , standing as it were in vassalage in order to insure their own safety , maintained a precarious existence . Only one agency disseminated light amid the darkness , sought to harmonize conflicting elements . The Church , the one thing stable , furnishes the only clue to guide through the labyrinth of medieval history . Yet feudalism , in the bold independence , assertion of rights , mutual aid and mutual dis // trust of its aristocracy , contained the germ both of free and of representative institutions ; civil liberty found a mature development only in much later times . In antiquity representative government also was tinknown . For it presupposes nationality , a national life ; but the nation as we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greek cities sometimes leagued together for mutual aid in war , but after the danger had passed away they were isolated as before . They had also associations and general assemblies for the performance of common religious rites ; political matters , however , were for the most part excluded . Of such character were the colonial confederacies , which , formed mainly for purposes of common worship , could never become very close or very binding . So loose were these coalitions that Halicarnassus , although one of the principal cities of the Dorian Hexapolis , because one of its delegates at the festival of the Triopean Apollo , contrary to custom , carried off instead of dedicating to the god the tripod assigned him , was excluded from the league . At the Amphictyonic council met delegates from twelve Greek States ; but at the beginning it was purely a religious body , and only by perversion of the original design was it in later times made to serve political ends . Even then the delegates could not legislate in common for the states . They had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the observance of certain religious rites and festi. vals , they were very little concerned with inter-state relations . The council was not therefore a representative body . Nor has the Achaian League in this connection special significance . It presents a very perfect type of federation , but it lacked the characteristic features of representative government , in that its congress was a primary and not a representative assembly . Similar in nature were the leagues of early Italy , which illustrate only a kind of delegation . In the Roman provincial system , indeed , may be found a trace of the representative principle ; but it is in the conditions accompanying the growth , maturity , and decline of feudalism that we must look for the origin of modern free institutions . Among the des . potic empires of the Orient the personal will of the ruler has never suffered any institution , representing the will of the people , to exist . // The feudal system was a necessary result of the transplant . ing of the Germanic peoples , with their principles of freedom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mon*archy the inevitable outgrowth of feudalism . Even in the midst of anarchy , monarchical traditions had by no means lost their force ; while by escheat and by inheritance and intermarriage , as well as by superiority in arms , fiefs tended to mass together under the hands of a lord more cunning or more bold than his neighbors . This tendency early became apparent ; it was accelerated by that series of events which forms the transitional movement from medisival to modern history , the crusades . Fired by the wild preaching of fanatics and burning with a desire to avenge the sufferings of the pilgrims at the sacred shrine , under the banner of the cross , raised by a designing Papacy , the best blood of Europe went forth , to perish on the long and dangerous way or before the walls of the Holy City . Estates were alienated in order to obtain funds for equipments and provision . Many of them came into the possession of the clergy . Others were purchased by wealthy members of the merchant class , who broke in upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by introducing *elements of peace and thrift in connection with the holding of land . The greater lords , moreover , bought up the flefs of their neighbors , or acquired the estates of their own vassals , thus becorriing absolute owners and establishing a direct relation between themselves and their serfs . Through the diminution of numbers and the increasing inequality in the division of land the aristocratic class as a whole was riiore and more weakened . At the close of the crusades the kitg was everywhere firmly seated on the throne ; the flef had given place to the kingdom . But from the nature of the case the monarchy , thus originating , could not be absolute . Three elements , the clergy , the nobility , and the commons , the three estates , were to limit fts prerogatives and modify its character , in the conflict and counterpoise of the three estates with the monarchy are to be traced , not only the development of equality of rights and civil liberty , but also the growth of that by which alone , in the complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed , and which is a distinctive characteristic of modern times , representative government . // As the kingdom grew out of the massing of fiefs , there was of necessity a strong tendency toward disintegration into its primitive elements . First of all , with the nobility , jealous of his power and eager to regain their former rights and independence , the king must struggle . Then , the church possessed vast estates , held by bishops , who had at heart not only the same interests as the nobility in resisting encroachments on the part of royalty , but also the furtherance of the designs of that powerful hierarchy to which they belonged . The inferior clergy , drawn from the masses , now supported the higher ecelesiastics , now gave their influence to the side of the king . Thus the contest between crown and fiefs went on , the crown gradually gaining the supremacy . In the primitive organization of the German tribe the popular assembly had been a marked feature . All public matters of importance were discussed in the meetings of the warriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became conquerors , this assembly was still retained . With the declin&amp; and extinction of allodial , or independent , proprietorship , however , it was reduced to a meeting of the barons together with their vassals for conference on matters of common concern . The functions of this feudal council were mainly judicial ; they were also in some degree financial . According to feudal law , a man must be tried by his peers , and judgment was valid only when rendered by several ; while the principle that no *flnancial burden could be imposed on the vassal without his consent was early established and jealously observed . As now a lord by successive incorporations of fiefs became king , he summoned the great landholders of his realm , temporal and ecclesiastical , to sit as a tribunal for the trial of high crimes and to discuss with him matters of special importance . This royal court and council in England , under the name of the Great Council , replaced the Anglo-Saxon Witan Agam6t and still survives in the House of Lords ; in France , it found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme judicial authority of the realm . Finally , when modified by the introduction of a new element , the commons , it formed the basis of the representative bodies of Europe . Modern civilization is characterized by a marked tendency
