txt At the meeting of the Board of Electrical Control , to be hold in the Mayor 's ( ace tomorrow , one of the most important questions which has yet come before the coin mission will be taken up and very probably disposed of . The law gives the board , which was created to abolish the overhead wire and pole nuisance , discretion to authorize the erection of new poles and . the stringing of new wires , and in the exercise of this discretion it has been applied to by the electric light companies , to which contracts were awarded last Thursday for lighting certain streets on the east and west sides of the city , for permission to erect some four or five thousand new poles . The board is to consider this request tomorrow , and upon its action will depend to some extent the value of the contracts which the city has given to the electrio light companies . The board will do well to remember that the companies making the request have been organized since the law for burying the wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning that the erection of any more unsightly poles and the stringing of any more dangerous cables over head was against the policy of the city , as approved by the State Legislature . If the right to erect the poles asked for is denied them , they at least will have no legitimate cause for complaint . On the other hand , the fact must not be lost sight of that the streets which the companies propose to light are now very poorly lighted , and that the citizens along them have good cause to demand a better service than is given by the present gaslights . Then , too , it must not be forgotten that the new companies , if they are honestly managed , are calculated to break up the electric light monopoly and cheapen the price of electric service , a fact which entitles them to all the encouragement which can be given them under a just and fair construction of the laws . All these things should be considered by the board before finally deciding upon the application of the companies , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of them involves the granting of the permission sought for . The proper course for the companies to pursue was to apply to the commission for the construction of proper subways for the reception of their cables ; but this course they have not seen fit to take . It will require but a very little longer time to place the wires properly under ground , under the supervision of the board ; than it will to put up a line of overhead cable . and once under ground the conductors of ' thecoimpanies will be safe from accidents , and the ' streeta will not be filled with the very obstructions which the board was created to abolish . It is scarcely the proper thing for the city to authorize a violation of the , law which we have been so many years in securing . The just and proper action for the board to take is to refuse permission to erect any poles , except such ornamental ones as are required by the lamps , and to offer to provide the companies as rapidly as possible with underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that purpose .
