txt The excitement in this part of Somerset County , N. J. , concerning the sudden death of Mr.JohnJerolemon , a most respect-ed citizen of Peapack , is unabated . On Monday of last week Mr. Jerolemon went to Somerville , the county seat . He had a growing sore upon his hand , which he had believed to be a cancer . When at Somerville he concluded to see " Voter S. Van Zandt , a veterinary surgeon , ( so called. ) of that place . who had advertised to cure cancers by merely applying a powder . Being advised to remain over for a second application . ho did not return until Wednesday , on which day the powder was put on for the second and last time . The hand was heavily covered with a white , meallike powder , which contained a large quantity of arsenic . Next day he was taken sick , vomiting and showing other signs of general derangement . Dr. Sutphen , of Bedminster , was called to visit him . On Saturday the Doctor called again and considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of fainting manner , with no one by him but his family . Dr. Sutphen granted a certificate of burial , setting ' forth that Jerolemon died suddenly of arsenio administered externally for a cancer . But he raised no question about it . The funeral sermon was preached on Sunday . The body was not buried , however , owing to a delay in the arrival of the coffin from New-York . The fire in the Potter Building had in some way interfered with the undertaker 's arrangements , and so the burial was postponed a day . That same afternoon the matter was talked of and reached the ears of Coroner Wagoner , of Somerville . who ordered an Inquest . This was held today . Dr. Van Zandt testified that Jerolemon came to him early last week and via ' alv en two different . applications , one arsenic , carbonate of magnesia and lard , and the other white oak bark and some bromide . He was asked if he knew how much arsenic it required to kill a human being , and he replied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admitted that his applications contained half a dram . He was a graduate of the Veterinary College of Philadelphia , having gone there four or five times hi the year 18G9 , ana having also attended lectures in Boston and New-York for a month at a time . He was sure the death was not caused by arsenic . The physicians present believed death was canoed by the arsenic applied to the hand , but were unwilling to declare it positively to be so until certain parts of the body were analyzed . The housekeeper , Miss Jane Wartman , produced the arsenic given to Mr. Jerolemon to use at home . and it created quite a sensation when it was found that a large quantity of clear arsenic had been given Mr. Jerolonion in a bottle , with no label whatever upon it . He was to mix it with lard and apply ad libitum . One or two more witnesses were examined , when the Coroner adjourned the inquest until the portions of the body removed by the surgeon could be analyzed by New-York chemists .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
