A Priest , a Notary , Guests , Servants , &c.; Scene , Tuscany . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Marquis di Tiburzzi 's Castle . Enter the Marquis and Marchioness di Tiburzzi . Marquis . Marquis di Tiburzzi Why urge forever Marsio 's rich estate ? Wealth is not sovereign . Should his money sprout , And yield a thousand-fold , it could not change Its master 's nature . In the glare of gold Unnumbered blemishes oft come to light , That had been better hidden in beggar 's rags . Marchioness . Marchioness di Tiburzzi What faults has he ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi It matters not . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Why not ? Marq . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end is gained Without a summing of antipathies . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi But should Costanza love him ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Bless me , madam ! Am I an oracle ? Your questions reach Beyond my thinking . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Stranger things have been . The maids of Greece , for all their dainty tastes , Gambolled with Satyrs . Men can never know The shifting fancies of a woman 's heart . Some love the outer , some the inner man , And some the garniture which fortune gives ; Some love to rule , others to be enslaved ; Some love for pity , some affect the bold ; Some on entreaty , others from sheer spite And sturdy opposition , will consume With three-fold fire . This slender bodkin 's point Is ample basis for a woman 's love . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Not for Costanza 's . Do not wrong our daughter With empty fables , nor impute to her The melting weakness of all womankind . If she should love  --  Poh ! poh ! I squander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ di Tiburzzi Pray , what see you , sir , In signore Marsio  --  think him what you may  --  To banish him beyond the pale of love ? He is not handsome ! Well , and what of that ? These girls have apes for playthings . Can not talk ? She 'll slit his tongue , and busy her for hours With her new human magpie . Here 's a husband To banish Maltese cats and singing-birds ! What if she love ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Her love would sanctify More vice than Marsio 's little soul can hold .  --  But this is idle . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Now , what do you mean ? First , Marsio 's blemishes ; next , your dislikes ; Then , Marsio 's vices , and his little soul ! Why do you hate him ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Hate is not the word : I would not choose him for my daughter 's husband . First , his mean birth .  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Ho ! pause we at his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold you , sir , he is so nobly minded That he will pick an empress for his dam , If you give choice . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Like still engenders like : ' T is nature 's law . The rugged mountain horse Breeds not the silk-skinned barb ; the shaggy cur Litters no fine-limbed greyhounds . It may take Whole ages of ancestral blood , to crown A long-drawn race with one true gentleman . Think you his peddling stock can shape a mate For her whose fathers , at great Csar 's voice , Out-flew the conquering eagles ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi There it is ! Csar and all his legions ! We have stood A hungry siege from him for many a day . Would he had strangled at his birth , With all his captains ! Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Why this argument ? I have heard ten thousand , in my time , yet never Knew one wry notion straightened by them all . What would you ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Why not ask me that before The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiburzzi Speak ; I attend you . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Should Costanza 's eyes Have found some merit , unobserved by you , In signore Marsio  --  should it so have wrought Upon her woman 's fancy as to gain , In Csar 's spite , that precious heart of hers  --  Would you oppose her choice ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Oppose her choice Why , you amaze me . Have you seen good grounds For such a question ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi I have seen enough . I have observed kind looks from Marsio 's eyes By echoing blushes answered from her cheeks ; I have  --  Lord , Lord ! what have I not observed ?  --  Sufficient to have bred a plague of love , If love were catching . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi This is very strange . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi No ; ' t is as old as Adam . Maids will love , And fathers will not see it . From these signs , Knowing our daughter 's happiness might hang Upon your voice , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love has grown a habit ; Or , should you wish , confirm her doubting heart By your full sanction . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Wonderful indeed ! She fancy Marsio ! Had I been asked , I 'd said she shunned him . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi No unusual trick Of love-sick girls .  --  But here Costanza comes . Leave her to me  --  nay ; if you question her , You 'll scorch her words in blushes . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi As you will . You are wrong , believe me . She has ever borne So plain a heart to me , so dutiful , So zealous to fulfil my wish as never To question of its justice  --  yet such acts Performing not with the cold hand of duty , But with the fiery eagerness of love  --  That I shall feel some twinge of jealousy , If she has ousted me from my fair seat , Henceforth a stranger 's , without common notice . Question , but do not vex her . I would rather Your keen suspicion had o'ershot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Upon this  --  this  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Noble , thrice noble man ; Half deified by her subliming love ! Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi I have no heart for jesting . Exit . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Nor for acting : Your feeble nature shifts the deed on me . ( Enter Costanza . ) Costanza . C ostanza Where went my father ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi To concoct some scheme About a penny-worth of musty bread . It takes more work , to live this starving way , Than would be used in earning us a fortune . But we are noble , very noble , daughter ; We have some centuries of rich , proud blood , On which we live , and therefore need not labor We feed , like fleshy men , upon our fat ,  --  Self-eating cannibals . Cos . Costanza Fasting has its mirth , Feasting its sorrow . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Ay , ay ; much the mirth We see the death 's head grinning . Cos . Costanza True , my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us poor mortals . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You are gloomy , child . Cos . Costanza No more than usual . ' T is a gloomy thing To see a father , so deserving love , Bowed with a load of vulgar , petty cares  --  Too mean to tax the housewife of a hind  --  That nip and pinch him into actual life , Giving his aching mind no dreaming pause ' Twixt day and day . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Of all disgusting things Commend me to our old , familiar friend , Proud poverty . Cos . Costanza Would I could lighten it ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi And so you can . Cos . Costanza I ! how ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi I trow , my daughter , You 'll be no victim , no burnt-offering , No chattel , traded for your father 's peace : No ; let us starve , drown , hang  --  why , what care you ? You have a heart , forsooth , a virgin heart , Not to be hung on matrimonial shambles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costanza What is your purpose , mother ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi There 's signore Marsio ; do you fancy him ? Cos . Costanza I never weighed my feelings for him . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi No ? But he loves you . Cos . Costanza For that I owe him thanks . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Now  --  do you mark me ?  --  should you marry him , We are rich at once . Cos . Costanza That never crossed my mind . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi It has ours . Cos . Costanza " Ours " ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Your father 's and my own . Cos . Costanza My father spoke of this ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Just ere he left . Cos . Costanza Does he desire me to wed Marsio ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You know your father far too well for that . He would not have you wed for his sake only ; Would not persuade you , press you , and so forth . With such spasmodic eagerness , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He says these things , that I , who know his ways , With half a thought can fathom his desire . Cos . Costanza Which is ?  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi That we should want no longer . Cos . Costanza How ! Wed Marsio ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Not unless with your consent . Well , would you try it ? Tell your father , then , You love rich Marsio , whose countless wealth Can bribe his sorrow , ease his shaking mind , And make his days lapse calmly to their end  --  Marsio , whose golden finger puts to flight Duns , bailiffs , tradesmen , all the brood of want , And makes a jest of every former grief To talk of in foul weather . Nay , my child ; Breathe not a word of this : say simply thus  --  I love good Marsio ; I would be his wife . You 'll see the issue . Cos . Costanza Signore Marsio stands Far better with my father than I thought . Doubtless there is some good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marchioness di Tiburzzi Well , Well ! Why do you dwell upon his name ? Cos . Costanza There seems A strangeness in it , I ne'er marked before . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You will attempt this little loving ruse ? Cos . Costanza Mother , I dare not tamper with the love My father bears me . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Poh ! ' t is but a trial . You need not marry Marsio , for all . Cos . Costanza This I will say : if to my father 's mind Marsio appear a proper husband for me , And signore Marsio should incline to me , I will accept him . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Bravely spoken , child ! I know you do this for your father 's sake ; And ' t is a beautiful , most saint-like act , On which the angels smile . May Heaven reward you ! Then , in Italy , marrying is one thing , Loving is another . Cos . Costanza What did you say ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are resolute , let every action , Which falls beneath your father 's eyes , appear Full of kind thoughts for signore Marsio . Cos . Costanza I feel but kindly towards him . O , my mother , If he , or any man  --  a clown  --  a fool  --  More hideous than the nightmare , crueller than The ragged tooth of famine  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Tut , tut ! daughter , Marsio is none of these . Cos . Costanza I hope not , madam . Doubtless , I 'll learn to love him very soon . It seems to me , duty would tutor love , At the first moment my poor father smiled . Marsio must know the terms . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi What need of that ? When did love ever chaffer about terms ? I 'll tell him , if ' twill ease you . Cos . Costanza Let us go . My father 's word must sanction this high treason Against the sweet dominion of god Love .  --  You see I am merry , mother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; very merry . Cos . Costanza As we go along , Give me a catalogue of all our ills . Tell o'er my father 's sufferings ; then rehearse The royal qualities of Marsio 's gold . How do you think my father 's face would look With one bright smile upon it ? Do you know , ' T is a long , dreary age since I beheld What you might call a smile upon his face ? I need to hear these things . Think you this marriage Would be no sin against my better nature ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Heaven counsels filial love . Cos . Costanza Yes ; you shall feast , And wear gay clothes , and build our shattered house , And brush the cobwebs from our ancestry ,  --  That seem to suffer like decay with us ,  --  And there shall be no name in Italy Prouder than the Tiburzzi ! Did you think , When you first saw me lying in my cradle , An impotent , cross bantling , that one day Your poor Costanza could do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ha ! ( Laughing . ) Woe is me ! Tears are close neighbours to such mirth as mine . Exeunt . SCENE II Another Apartment in the Castle . Enter Marsio . Marsio . Marsio If I know money  --  Heaven knows I should  --  They must come to it . Needy , needy , say you ? I have known the needy murder for a ducat : Lo ! here are millions ; and but for a name . A very ancient , very noble name , I grant ; but somewhat damaged in the keeping .  --  Easily patched , however , easily patched with gold . Join Marsio 's riches to Tiburzzi 's name , And who can stand against them ? But the name , Ungilt and naked , is an empty noise , Which Marsio 's gold  --  Marsio 's hard , solid gold  --  As well can purchase in the daily market Where parents vend their marriageable wares . Why should I doubt ? There 's nothing like a heart To chaffer for . I never bought a heart . Men say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Laughing . ' T is a great rock on which all commerce wrecks . There is no rival , no keen moneyed man , To weigh his scrapings ' gainst may topmost bid ; So says the Marchioness  --  O , pardon me  --  Our mother , I should say ; though ne'ertheless A marchioness for all that , Costanza dear .  --  Conny , and Con , and Stanza , when you please me , Besides a hundred other sweet , pet names , To come up on occasion . Ha ! our mother ! And all one splendor with a blaze of smiles ! ( Enter the Marchioness . ) I guess your meaning Marchioness . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Hist ! the Marquis comes . Show no surprise ; one doubt may mar the whole . Hear , ere you speak . Mar . Marsio I am all ears , no tongue . ( Enter the Marquis . ) Marquis . Mar quis di Tiburzzi Welcome , friend Marsio ! Mar . Marsio " Friend Marsio ! " Well spoken , friend Tiburzzi ! ( Aside . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Stoop not too low , or you may never rise . Apart to Marsio . Mar . Marsio  --  My deeds shall ratify . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Turned just in time . Aside . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Frankness is best  --  Mar . Marsio The coin of honesty ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi For Heaven s sake , peace ! Art talking for a wager ? Apart to Marsio . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Signore , it seems my daughter and yourself , Unknown to me  --  and therein much I blame you  --  Have leagued your hearts  --  Mar . Marsio What ! she  --  March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi O , silence , silence ! Apart to Marsio . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi You would excuse her , signore , with such reasons As , to the partial wits of lovers , seem Both law and right ; on me they fall full coldly . That love , which breeds such ecstasy in you , To me is breach of trust . But let that pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquis di Tiburzzi Do not deceive yourself ; Hearts will make way against ten thousand words . Mar . Marsio Are you so wilful ? Forward , then . Aside . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You see , My lord but seeks our daughter 's happiness . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Yes ; take her , sir . No foolish whim of mine Shall stand ' twixt heart and heart . Mar . Marsio " ' Twixt heart and heart ! " What does he mean ? Well , I will swallow all . Aside . Your frank approval stifles my poor thanks . Let me repay your frankness with its equal . No man , who is your friend , has wanted eyes To see how , day by day , that ancient wealth , Which once so proudly propped your mighty name , Has slipped beneath the thing it should support ; Till all the glories of this noble house Seem tottering down to ruin and oblivion .  --  Nay , do not chafe ; I can not choose but know it . Marq . Marquis di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beggars know it , And , with unbegging laughter , pass me by ! My name 's the jest of all this mocking land .  --  The blind , dumb , deaf , conceive it ! Idiots , jays , Parrots , have wit to say , " Poor , poor Tiburzzi ! " Mar . Marsio I would not ape them . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi O , ' t is nothing new : Heaven makes us feel our chastenings commonly . Of all realities , the reallest thing  --  Of all heart-sickening , spirit-killing things  --  That can unnerve , unsex , and bring to naught The proudest purposes of stubborn strength , Making brawn Hercules a whining baby  --  The very top and crown is poverty ! It feeds on hope , it glories in despair , It saps the brave foundations of the will , It turns our simple faith to blasphemy , It gnaws its way into the very spirit , And with a weary siege starves out the soul , Sending to judgement that bright denizen So changed in hue , so fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warped , and shivering thing , Can scarcely recognize its handiwork ! Mar . Marsio My purse shall aid you . Use it , without stint , In common with me . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Pshaw ! I need it not . I and my wants have grown such intimates That ' t would seem strange to part us . Prisoned men Have wept at parting from their old , dull cells : So custom , I doubt not , may reconcile A father to an unconfinding child . I can take naught of him . Aside . Walks apart . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Urge him no more : His mind is troubled with an idle fancy About Costanza 's want of trust in him . He has scarce patience , now , to speak with her : But he will change , next moon . Apart to Marsio . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Pray treat her well , Pray treat her well , good signore Marsio : One sin makes not a sinner . She is worth it ;  --  Yes , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , we fathers have no vows Like you hot lovers ; have no skill , to show The depths and heights of customary feeling , With high-spiced words . Love grows a gray-beard in us , And lacks the prattle of the wingd boy . Pray treat her well . Mar . Marsio I 'll have no other care . A precious store ne'er wants a zealous ward . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Let not that promise rust . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Our daughter waits Signore , go on before . What , what , so tardy ! Does your love use a herald ? Mar . Marsio By your leave , then . Exit . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Stands it not as I said ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Is she my daughter ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi If she is mine . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi That strain I can not doubt : There the blood cries . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi If it amuses you , Pray rail away . There 's many an out-door saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces forth a lamb . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Love Marsio ?  --  No ! What , sell herself ?  --  pah ! pah ! Come , let us in . This shivering on the brink is worse than drowning . I 'll link these lovers . When the knot is tied , The galling process of the action stops , And I may rub my fretted hands at ease . I 'll not be tortured .  --  Marry , marry shall they ; And sooner than they think ! Still waiting , madam ? Heavens ! what a new Tiburzzi fortune sends ! Exeunt SCENE III . Another Apartment in the Castle . Enter Costanza and Filippia . Filippia . Filippia Would I wed Marsio ? Would I wed the  --  Costanza . Costanza There ! Your common phrases have sufficient strength , Without appealing to another world . Fil . Filippia Would I wed Marsio ? ( Laughing . ) Why , ' t is something new To hear you jesting , cousin ! Would I wed A man who ever thrusts his money forth As his best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's nobility , But , like the poor ass with his golden freight , Is worth just what he carries ? Then he has A wicked , subtle , and consuming devil , Pent in the corners of his red-rimmed eyes , That 's always dodging , like a serpent 's tongue , Angry but fearful . Cos . Costanza What a character ! Fil . Filippia ' T is Marsio to an eye-lash . Cos . Costanza Your wild tongue Ever outruns your stricter meaning , cousin . I shall wed Marsio . Fil . Filippia What a woful sigh ! That is the tone Gonsalvo gave me , when , Tearing his tattered ruff  --  worn for the nonce  --  He cried , " I shall drink poison ! " But he did not . Cos . Costanza But I will . Fil . Filippia Drink poison ? Cos . Costanza No ; wed Marsio . Fil . Filippia The poison in another shape . Cos . Costanza Fie ! fie ! Are quibbling jests the best advice you give ? Fil . Filippia ' T was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Costanza Indeed I am . Fil . Filippia Then here 's a weeping matter . Cos . Costanza Marsio has made an offer for my hand , Which I intend accepting . Fil . Filippia O , you shall not , You shall not , by my faith ! Cos . Costanza By mine I shall . Fil . Filippia I hate him , hate him ! Cos . Costanza I 'm not jealous of you . Fil . Filippia Who 's jesting , now ? Cos . Costanza You 've taught me your own tongue . Fil . Filippia I see through this . You marry that base wretch  --  That sallow , spider-legged , bow-shouldered wretch  --  That man of money  --  that great human purse  --  That  --  that  --  Cos . Costanza Hie forward , forward , cousin dear ! I would not have you keep such humors to yourself ; They might breed inward danger . Fil . Filippia Out upon you ! Your father 's wants have driven you to this end . You should not dare  --  I say , you should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Offer the holiest portion of your nature To this gold calf . ' Twill have a grievous answer , One day , Costanza ; for ' t is mortal sin To strike at the dim instincts of the heart . Why are you weeping ? Cousin , dear Costanza , The sun shines upon nothing that I love As I love you . That 's generous ; smile again .  --  But , lo ! the gentle lover ! lo ! sweet Marsio ! Dragging his fingers o'er the entrance wall Like a belated school-boy ! Cos . Costanza Cousin , cousin ! Fil . Filippia He sees you  --  blushes ! Ay : by my faith , blushes , Through all his leathern skin , from ear to chin ! Come , that is cheering ! Marsio can blush . Cos . Costanza Do leave , Filippia . Fil . Filippia I ! I dare not leave . Look to your trade , Costanza . Push him sharply . He 'll get the better of you . I 'll be witness ; And if he slip one tittle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dear This season ; the supply of maiden hearts Has dwindled down ; he may have widows ' cheaper ; Old maidens ' for the asking . Money 's plenty , And begs for usury . Nay , mark these things ; He 'll trick you else . We must protect our interest . Cos . Costanza Have done ! have done ! ( Enter Marsio . ) Good welcome , sir ! Marsio . Marsio I thank you . A fair day , lady ! Fil . Filippia Dare the knave say that , With such a falling-weather face ? Perhaps , Some day , he 'll find I 'm not invisible ,  --  The ill-bred cur ! Aside . Mar . Marsio May we converse alone ? Fil . Filippia Better and better ! He has seen my ears ; I 'll show my tongue , next . Aside . Seats herself apart . Cos . Costanza Signore Marsio  --  Mar . Marsio Yes , lady , yes .  --  I have a mortal dread Of girls and babies . Aside . Cos . Costanza You would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . Aside . Has not your mother  --  Pshaw ! I came to lay my fortune at your feet ; And I will hold it doubled fifty times , If you bestow one smile upon the act . Fil . Filippia Prolific smile ! Aside . Cos . Costanza Sir , if my simple smile  --  Fil . Filippia Or my compounded laughter , shout on shout . Aside . Cos . Costanza This is deceit . Aside . Mar . Marsio O , horror , what a strait ! Never a word ! Her silence will upset me . Would she might fall to cursing ! Aside . Fil . Filippia Conny , dear , A million , Conny ; ' t is well worth a million . Mar . Marsio What means you lady ? Fil . Filippia You shall see , anon . Aside . Cos . Costanza ' T would pose my cousin , signore Marsio , To show a meaning in one half she says . Mar . Marsio Your servant , lady . Bowing . Fil . Filippia Of the latest date . Curtseying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Costanza . Fil . Filippia A fair excuse , indeed : I know no fairer , sir . Mar . Marsio I said not so : You might teach schoolmen , if you knew yourself . Fil . Filippia Well done ! We get on bravely . Aside . Mar . Marsio Gentle lady , Our business waits . To Costanza . Fil . Filippia There the mart speaks again . Aside . Cos . Costanza Has not my mother told you of the terms . On which I listen to your suit ? Mar . Marsio She has  --  O , golden chance ! here comes the Marchioness ! I 'd have gone mad , ere long . Aside . ( Enter the Marquis and Marchioness . ) Marquis . Marquis di Tiburzzi Daughter , Costanza , Do you love signore Marsio ? Cos . Costanza I hope To love him better , sir . Marchioness . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Well said , well said ! Love 's but a baby , Hymen is a boy ; He grows apace in wedlock .  --  Well said , daughter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel her to a public blush . Apart to the Marquis , who walks up the stage , gloomily . Cos . Costanza How sad my father seems ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi ' T is very natural ; He parts from you ; but it is like the parting Of a young twig , that , when it sunders , adds A vigorous life to the old parent tree . Think of that , daughter . Cos . Costanza But the twig will wither.  --  So be it , though , if it revive the tree . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi You would wed signore Marsio ? Cos . Costanza I will wed , With your approval , signore Marsio . Mar . Marsio It irks me much that you must bare your heart ;  --  Both irks and pleases . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Are these questions decent ? Apart to the Marquis . Fil . Filippia She changes words , and never answers straight . She 's mad for misery . There 's something wrong . If I but dared  --  I will  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marquis di Tiburzzi She has declared it . Take her , signore , take her ! And may she never want the duteous love A wife should show a husband ! May she lean , In an unbroken confidence , upon The upright manhood she has found in you ; And may you never know what bitterness Burns in the silent chambers of a heart That loves , yet can not trust ! God bless you , child !  --  Yea , give your husband all you held from me ! Aside . ACT II . SCENE I. The Park of the Marquis di Tiburzzi . Enter Juranio and Salvatore . Juranio . Count Juranio Whose grounds are these ? Salvatore . Salvatore The Marquis di Tiburzzi 's  --  A sorry sequel to an ancient stock , Whose wide dominion once outstretched our sight . Alas ! for him , poor man , malicious fortune Threw all the choicest of her random smiles Upon the wrong end of his famous race , And now mocks him with what his fathers were . Ju . Count Juranio A pretty place ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clustered blossoms Star the dark back-ground of you shady wood . Sal . Salvatore O ! yes ; but mark how jealous avarice Has shorn the chiefest saplings to the root . Ju . Count Juranio Yet spared us every flower . Praise be to Heaven ! Their beauty is not marketable . See , A living bower , a bower of growing vines , All carpeted with last year 's fallen leaves ! Sal . Salvatore A thrifty thought ! The very dead are used . That hint was stolen from Egypt , where they burn Their spicy ancestors . ' T were a proud thing , To sit down at a fire of Ptolemies , With Cleopatra for a back-log . Ju . Count Juranio Ugh ! You would put out the harmony of heaven With your great sprawling jokes . The hand of taste , Making best use of few materials , Is here . Sal . Salvatore The hand of woman . Ju . Count Juranio Worse and worse ! I 'll fly you , shortly . Sal . Salvatore ' T would confess your devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shun These dainty blossoms of humanity With such stern care ?  --  So ho ! run , run for life ! There go two maids  --  two full-blown , dangerous maids  --  Hide you , sir modesty ! Ju . Count Juranio You know them maids ? Sal . Salvatore I take them so on credit . Ju . Count Juranio Save you , save you ! Good lady-broker , you will one day fail From such long credits . Sal . Salvatore See , they make this way . Here comes the goddess of your living bower . Ju . Count Juranio Which one ? Sal . Salvatore The shorter . Ju . Count Juranio No ; the taller one . Sal . Salvatore How know you that ? Ju . Count Juranio I trace her little fingers In the soft curvings of each vine . Sal . Salvatore Ho ! ho ! ( Laughing . ) Ju . Count Juranio I 'll bet my Arab  --  saddle , spurs , and all  --  Against your empty laugh , those cunning girls Are plotting to ensnare some luckless man : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sal . Salvatore Done ! Ju . Count Juranio Done !  --  Come hide . Sal . Salvatore A mere excuse for running , You arrant fly-frock ! Ju . Count Juranio Here , behind the bower . They secrete themselves . ( Enter Costanza and Filippia . ) Costanza . C ostanza Press me no more ; my motives are my own . You grant me judgment ? Filippia . Filippia More than you grant me . You have some cloudy fancy in your brain , That needs but airing ,  --  some weak , flimsy notion , That common reason would dry up at once . Cos . Costanza You rate me poorly , cousin . Fil . Filippia There again ! You would be off . Stick to the text , Costanza . Do you love Marsio ? Cos . Costanza Would I wed him else ? Fil . Filippia You dare not answer strictly . Cos . Costanza Why then ask ? Fil . Filippia I know you do not . ' T is not in your nature To fall so meanly . O ! be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe allegiance , To whom , perforce , you must surrender love , Will track you out at last . How fearful , then , To perish piecemeal with a smothered passion , Or  --  I will not repeat it : ' t was a story Old at the flood . Cos . Costanza Here I dare answer strictly . If you will not allow me Marsio , At least , I love no other . Fil . Filippia But you will  --  Nay , never raise your brows  --  you will , I say , Fall in a frenzy of outrageous love With some stern , mulish creature , like yourself , Who swears he 'll wed the blackest blackamoor , And will  --  that will he !  --  though the heavens should fall ! Tell me , Costanza ,  --  tell me , darling cousin ,  --  What are your motives in this strange affair ? Cos . Costanza Then will you cease your torments ? Fil . Filippia Ay ; and vow To keep good counsel . Cos . Costanza Nor by word or deed Again oppose my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ' t is a bitter contract . Cos . Costanza Let us walk : The story is a long one . They walk up the stage . Ju . Count Juranio Salvatore , This eavesdropping is scarcely honorable . Sal . Salvatore What a fine moral sense ! Just as you lose The last faint whisper of their pretty talk , Up starts indignant honor . Ju . Count Juranio Ah ! her voice Held honor spell-bound . Did you mark , with me , How the low music trickled from her lips ? All heaven was listening to her , why not we ? Sal . Salvatore Which one set heaven agog ? Ju . Count Juranio The taller one . Sal . Salvatore The small one spoke the more . Ju . Count Juranio More , but less valued . The other 's phrases served to bind together , As baser metal solders sovereign gold , The broken links of her harmonious thoughts . Sal . Salvatore Zounds ! are you mad ? Ju . Count Juranio I know not what I am : I am something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot ! Ju . Count Juranio See , see , she walks ! Sal . Salvatore A wonderful exploit ! Ju . Count Juranio I must address her . Sal . Salvatore Fellow , there are two . To my unbiassed eyes , The smaller is the fairer . Let us leave , As partial penance for our vulgar fault . Will you not come ? Ju . Count Juranio No ; I must speak to her . Sal . Salvatore That were ill-bred . Ju . Count Juranio I 'll frame new codes of manners . Fair lady , by your leave  --  Advancing to Costanza . Sal . Salvatore Nay , be not startled . ' T is but a simple kinsman of my own , A poor brain-darkened lunatic ; but harmless , Quite harmless to a lady . Pray you know him ; The Count Juranio  --  once a wiser man . Juranio bows . Ju . Count Juranio And here his cousin , signore Salvatore , Salvatore bows . A world-wide jester , a professed buffoon ; The globe 's his bauble , all mankind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant for such . A cunning ferret after doubtful phrases , A subtle reasoner upon groundless proofs , A deep inquirer into shallowness , A dangerous friend , a harmless enemy ; His own best jest , oftener laughed at than with . Weigh well your words , give him no cavilling point , And you are safe . Fil . Filippia Two weighty characters ! Cos . Costanza What mean you , gentlemen ?  --  You should be such By dress , if not by manners . Ju . Count Juranio We  --  I  --  I  --  What would we , Salvatore ? Sal . Salvatore We would know The way to town . Fil . Filippia Why , all the steeples stare Above you hill . Sal . Salvatore Ah ! yes .  --  True  --  true , indeed  --  I see  --  What would we , Count Juranio ? There is an awful mystery here , which I Would fain explain , if we might meet again . Apart to Filippia . Fil . Filippia A mystery ! How , meet me ? I can not tell But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sal . Salvatore Our ways are doubtful : odder things have been Than two chance meetings . Apart to Filippia . Ju . Count Juranio Has my tongue strayed off ? Aside . Lady , from that small spring , the human heart , Arise a thousand swelling impulses , Each one a mystery to the sober brain : ' T were vain to ask why we do thus and thus , Why crush that good intent , and rear this wrong , While the poor reason , that would fain inquire , Is impotent to rule . ' T was such an impulse Drove me to what I did ; which , being done , I forge no false excuse , but simply beg Your gentlest censure . Cos . Costanza Sir , a fault confessed Pardons itself one half . I will not grudge A full forgiveness , if you ask it of me . Ju . Count Juranio I do , most humbly . It is not my wont To sue for breach of manners . Sal . Salvatore That I swear ! He was the flower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are my manners Of the sour , formal cast that freezes back The generous feelings of o'erflowing nature , And bars the way between our hearts and lips ; Nor  --  nor  --  Indeed I know not what I say  --  I talk at random . Pray you , leave me , sir : You trifle with me . Ju . Count Juranio Lady , are you just ? Cos . Costanza O , heaven ! I am not ; neither to myself , Nor those who own my duty . Say no more ; But leave me , leave me ! Ju . Count Juranio I obey ; how sadly ! May we not meet once more ? Cos . Costanza No ; never , never ! Exit with Filippia . Sal . Salvatore Gods ! we are all mad together ! Ju . Count Juranio " Never , never ! " Sal . Salvatore You lost your Arab . Ju . Count Juranio Did I ?  --  " Never , never ! " Sal .

Marsio Where I had purposed to court , beg , and bribe  --  To out-scheme Machiavelli , and so tug Against the disadvantages of birth and rank , That , by sheer strength and resolute force of will , I hoped to barely conquer  --  they at once Thrust the fair prize in my astonished arms , Blow all my crafty net-works to the wind , And half undo me with sheer wonderment . They say she loves me.  --  Hum ! I 'll think of that : It looks suspicious .  --  Nonsense , Marsio ! Hold up thy head ! Did they not , upon ' Change , Marvel at thy advancement ? Ah ! did not That sneering beggar , Volio , who can boast Some half-score drops of gentle blood  --  Who never condescended  --  bless his stars !  --  To speak with thee ;  --  did not that ragged wretch  --  Ha ! ha ! I watched him from behind a pillar , Close , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did not even he turn blue with choking envy ? Swore ' t was a lying scandal ; but no less Bowed his majestic forehead to his belt When next we met ? Lord bless us ! and he spoke , So sweetly spoke , in such a winning whisper , Of the " dear Marquis , " of the " dear Marchioness ; Hoped the fair lady of my heart was well ; When would my marriage be ? " And then he took So grave and formal a farewell of me !  --  The devil claw him ! ( Enter Pietro Rogo . ) How now , Master Rogo ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo So ! How now , Master Marsio ? Men have said Your grand betrothal has upset your brains :  --  By heaven ! I think so . " Master Rogo , " sooth ! Why , yesterday ' t was " Good friend Pietro ; " And " Kinsman Pietro ; " and " Pietro , I have a secret for you ! " Out upon you ! I thought to hear some folly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prithee be not rude ; Nor so presume on former fellowship  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo Where are your wits ? Mar . Marsio Cease your blunt manner , sir ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo What ? Mar . Marsio Cease ; I say ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo The world is full of marvels ; I myself can dream some stretch of wonder , And they say poets , and such-like madmen , can , By some shrewd knack , make that appear as truth Which really is not ; but roll all the poets , All my wild dreams , all the earth 's prodigies , In one huge mass , and Marsio makes them tame . Mar . Marsio Good Master Rogo  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo Pietro is my name . No man shall master me . Mar . Marsio Pietro , then ; Since yesterday , as you observe , a change Has come across me . Yesterday we met As Marsio , the merchant , and his friend : To-day I represent the last great branch Of the Tiburzzi ; and as such expect That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my duty to demand , And is as much your duty to bestow . Rogo . Pietro Rogo You thrice-dyed fool ! With the Tiburzzi s daughter , Did you receive the blood of all the race ? Their gentle culture , their refined politeness , Which wins , but never asks , a man 's respect ? I tell you , Marsio , you have climbed a tower , To make your shameless folly further seen . Come , come , be ruled . Mar . Marsio Begone , sir ! Leave my house ! I wear a sword . Rogo . Pietro Rogo A lucky thought , my lord ,  --  My bold Tiburzzi ! By the devil 's beard , I 'll try your lordship 's hand at noble arts ! When we get through with this , we 'll run a tilt . Draw ! Mar . Marsio Will you leave me ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo Draw , my noble sir , Or I will thresh your noble lordship 's shins With a good Milan blade . The devil take me , If I endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion in you . Draw , you oaf ! They fight . Rogo drives Marsio round the stage . Your lordship gives , gives to this vulgar man ?  --  That 's charitable ! Marsio is disarmed . Now , sir , were it not For the huge sin of surfeiting the devil , With such a lump of folly , I would let Your windy soul out of some ugly gash.  --  Nay , you 're not off yet . Promise me to be My old , dear friend , Marsio of yesterday , Or I will send that semblance of my friend , Into whose body you have falsely crept , To sup black Pluto !  --  Swear ! or , on my life , Your shrift is short ! Mar . Marsio Come , come , friend Pietro . Rogo . Pietro Rogo You are improving . Swear it ! Mar . Marsio Well , I swear . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Never to be a lord to me ? Mar . Marsio No , never . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Ever to listen to my wholesome counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And to receive it , if your candid judgment Can bring no cause against it ? Mar . Marsio Yes , and yes . Take your cursed rapier from my throat ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo ' T was blessed To your salvation , most ungrateful man . Go up , old Milan : when you are sunned again , May you be umpire in as good a cause ! Now of this marriage ; is the rumor true ? Mar . Marsio Ay ; have you aught to say ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo Against the fact , Nothing .  --  Though , in this easy-jogging land , Marriage seems quite superfluous to me :  --  And the same cause which makes a single state Endurable , should scare us from a wedding . Well , let that go . You are a wealthy man , And must have lineal heirs  --  either your own , Or seeming so  --  undoubtedly , your wife 's  --  To squander your slow millions in a day . Mar . Marsio Are the sour sneers of an old sapless miser What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend . Who is the maid ? Mar . Marsio Had my heart rhetoric , ' T would answer in fit phrases . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Bless my soul ! He 's metamorphosed to a first-class lover ! You have a tongue , perchance ? Mar . Marsio The fair Costanza  --  Costanza di Tiburzzi is the name  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo They doused her with at baptism . Fair , you say ? Mar . Marsio Fair as  --  as  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo What ? Mar . Marsio As any thing you choose . Her charms outsoar my fancy ; fly your own : Come , Pietro . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Ecstatic driveller ! Fair ? I like not fair . The ugly ones are best : They bear the patent of their chastity In their brown skins , in their green , filmy eyes , Their clawish hands , their broad , earth-flattening feet , Their crooked ankles and their camel backs . Without temptation , there can be no sin ; But where the fruit is jolly , and hangs out As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows who tastes , who handles it , And who goes harmless past ! Mar . Marsio Pietro Rogo , Is there one subject under the mad moon Too weak to found an argument upon ? I 'll venture , with your talents , you can prove , Against all comers , that incontinence Is but a wide benevolence ; that murder  --  Under the million given circumstances With which your nimble wit shall hedge it in  --  Is a humane achievement ; theft , an instinct ; Cheating , a thrifty thoughtfulness of self ; And so forth , on through all the deadly sins . Poh ! poh ! what stuff you talk ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo Back to our subject . Costanza di Tiburzzi should be daughter To an old dwindled noble of that name : Is it not so ? Mar . Marsio It is . Rogo . Pietro Rogo They want your wealth . Mar . Marsio And they shall have it ! Our long-shadowed name Shall blaze , with a new light , through Italy . Rogo . Pietro Rogo O , ho ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scabbard . Friend , you have not one generous aim in this ; Your own huge pride awakes this forward zeal : But you 'll learn wisdom through humility . Mar . Marsio How , raven , how ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo A hundred little things Shall make you gnaw your fingers to the quick . You 'll haply blunder at the first grand feast : At which Lord So-and-so will titter , titter ; And Lady Somebody will simper , simper ; And sly Count Nobody , a noted wit , Will wink and wink ; while some bluff honest duke Howls out his laughter . Then our father wriggles , And stares straight through a six-foot granite wall ; Our mother blushes , and talks violently About the price of spaniels to her neighbors ; Our bride hangs down her head  --  perchance a tear , Like a full dew-drop , gathers on her cheek , And drowns out its carnations . Mar . Marsio I will hire The world 's opinion till my manners mend . Life is but one long lesson . Rogo . Pietro Rogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rude coin . Now hear me , Marsio ; if you are horn-mad , Wed some fresh country girl , some honest thing , Too big a fool to be a lady sinner  --  Too proud of you to think you aught but perfect  --  Too ignorant to know your faults of breeding  --  One every way inferior to yourself  --  And I will chime in with your marriage-bell . Mar . Marsio You waste your wisdom , Pietro ; I 'll wed No other than Costanza . Pulti sings within . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Hark ! here comes Our merry gossip , Pulti . Let us ask A fool 's advice . Babies and naturals Speak , sometimes , by a kind of inspiration . Mar . Marsio You will not condescend ?  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo ' blood ! he 's a man ! I have no princely notions , like your own , To pull me from my fellows . ( Enter Pulti , singing . ) Pulti . Pulti The devil wriggled , The devil squealed , The devil gave a shout ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiend to rout . Mar . Marsio Stop your din ! That villain has one long , unending song About a certain devil , who has seen More sad adventures than the Golden Legend Recounts of all its saints . Pul . Pulti Hem , hem , hem , hem ! Mar . Marsio What do you hem at ? Pul . Pulti I have seen in churches , When the dull preacher would not hem himself , The congregation would hem for him . Rogo . Pietro Rogo True . What thinks your wisdom of your master 's marriage ? Pul . Pulti Lord ! sir , I seldom think ; it spoils my talking . I scorn your thoughts ; the stealthy , spectral things Smell of the church-yard , and of heaven and hell  --  And bygone happiness , and present pain  --  And barren futures filled with new-made graves  --  And baby-hopes nipped in our nursing arms  --  Of all that 's dreary , and of naught that 's bright . They are huge stoppers for a flowing mouth , That still by strangling . Rogo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulti I 'll race my tongue with any man 's . I say , My master will be wiser than he 's rich . Rogo . Pietro Rogo A goodly store of wisdom , that ! How , boy ? Pul . Pulti When he has gathered in his bursting brains All the fantastic humors of a woman , He 'll have more thoughts than ducats . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Marsio , mark : The knave 's a prophet . What is wedlock like ? Pul . Pulti Much like sin 's journey after happiness . We start upon it with a merry heart , Proceed upon it with a sober one , And end  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo Ah ! yes ; where end we ? Pul . Pulti Not at all : We stumble in our graves . Rogo . Pietro Rogo A gloomy thought . Pul . Pulti ' T is not a thought . I lit upon the fact By seeing , and not thinking . For your thinkers Go stumbling headlong in with all the rest , Thinking of all save death . Rogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your doctrines . Pul . Pulti I will , sir , In one short rule .  --  Keep your eyes ever open . Mar . Marsio Have you not done ? For Pulti will reply Till doomsday break . ' T is not his wonted mood ; He 's oftener gay than sad . Pul . Pulti ' T is a sad thought  --  Note , signore Rogo , thinking makes one sad  --  To weigh two losses with a single gain . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Your wit outshoots me . Pul . Pulti With a feeble shaft . I , by this marrying , must lose a master ; My poor , poor master  --  who may comfort him ?  --  Must lose a servant !  --  Such a servant , sir !  --  So sober  --  when you keep his wine away ; So sweetly tempered  --  when you do not cross him ; So grave and seemly  --  when there 's naught to laugh at ; So frugal  --  when you give him naught to spend ; So every way perfection  --  where you grow not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on these conditions , many a day , The best of slaves . Rogo . Pietro Rogo But where 's your single gain ? Pul . Pulti Nay , ' t is but half a one : master and man Share it between them .  --  ' T is an untried mistress  --  A vast , dim , shadowy , uncertain fear , That may be saint or devil . Mar . Marsio Pulti !  --  dog ! Saddle my horses ! Pul . Pulti For the beggar 's ride . Mar . Marsio Dare you presume so far upon my kindness , You coarse-grained knave ? Pul . Pulti Not I ; I never trespass On such unstable ground . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Where do you ride ? Mar . Marsio Where should a lover ride ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo O , pause at once . All things cry out against this unmeet match : Blood , rank , and breeding , fortune , friends , and tastes , In rigid opposition stand between . You can not mould these opposites to one ; Force them together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal jar . Mar . Marsio You could not move me , had you Tully 's tongue ; Prop heaven with virgin gold , you could not buy me ; Summon the damned , with all their terrors on , You could not daunt me !  --  To the horses , Pulti ! Pul . Pulti I am going , sir . Sings . These horns were worn , Ere you were born , The grinning devil said ; Then take no care , But proudly wear  --  Mar . Marsio You know this cudgel , sirrah ? Pul . Pulti Thank you ; we 've often met before . His name Is oak ; his mother was an acorn . See , I know the family from end to end . You need not introduce us , signore . Exit . Mar . Marsio Rogo , The aims of my existence have been few , Yet , in the service of the thing I sought , I have offered up my health , my life , my soul . He must be rash , or confident , who stands Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pulti !  --  I have set my heart Upon this marriage ; let heaven frown or smile , Till I am blasted into nothingness , I will pursue it as if heaven were not !  --  My horses , knave ! Pulti . Pulti ( Without . ) Here , sir . Ho ! Lucifer . Rogo . Pietro Rogo I 'll try to cross you for your own advantage , If honest means may prosper . Mar . Marsio Well , push on ! Choose your own weapons , fight as you think fit ; But , Pietro Rogo , when we are at the tug  --  When the blood boils , and timid conscience flies  --  When what opposes , with a friendly front , Is not distinguished from an enemy  --  Then call for mercy to the prayer-stunned saints , And hope an age of miracles may come , But not to Marsio !  --  My horses wait . Exeunt . SCENE III . A Room in the Castle of the Marquis di Tiburzzi . Costanza and Filippia . Filippia . Filippia Saw him before ? Costanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Filippia But where , and how ? Cos . Costanza Can you not call to mind The day our duke was welcomed by the people ? Fil . Filippia As well as yesterday . Cos . Costanza Indeed , indeed ! It seems a weary age since then , to me . Among the nobles , who rode nigh the duke , Was one who , in all noble qualities Of port and majesty , rode there supreme : Clad in black velvet , for his father 's death ; Yet wearing a long plume of ostrich white , As a fit emblem of the general joy . Fil . Filippia Lord ! you know all about him ! Cos . Costanza Yes  --  why  --  yes .  --  Surely the people talked of him alone . Fil . Filippia I was beside you , yet I heard them not . Well , well , go on . Cos . Costanza It chanced a beggar 's child , A pretty boy  --  one of those nimble imps That live by miracles ' twixt horses ' feet , And under carriage-wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help ; Then , suddenly , was still for very fear . The whole crowd held its breath , and one great heart Beat through it all . Now there arose a cry : Yet while the silly people did but scream , Down from his charger leaped the cavalier , Dashed in the throng , and , ere I cried God bless him , The boy was laughing in his mother 's arms ! Fil . Filippia Now , I recall some little scene like that . Cos . Costanza ' T was a great scene ! The Duke stretched out his hand ; And , glorious in his dimmed and miry suit , The hero mounted lightly on his horse . Some nobles laughed , some sneered , some looked askance ; But all the people raised a mighty shout ; And the great sun , bursting a heavy cloud , Shone round Juranio like a halo ! Fil . Filippia Brave ! Yet , cousin , I saw not one half that you did . I heard a child scream ; heard some voices call ; Saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint murmur ; then the show went on .  --  About the sun and halo I know nothing . Cos . Costanza ' T was many a day ere I forgot the Count ; And when we met this morn , a sudden thrill Of the old feeling stirred my memory , And brought me back that moving scene again ,  --  Which much confused me . Fil . Filippia Ah ! " Which much confused you ! " Take my word , cousin , our heroic Count , When he caught up the beggar 's little boy , Caught up a certain lady 's heart , I wot of .  --  But I approve it . Cos . Costanza What do you approve ? Fil . Filippia The catching up of fair Costanza 's heart . Cos . Costanza I beg you , cousin , not to break your jests Upon so grave a subject . Had my mother O'erheard your heedless nonsense , this would be A stormy day for me . Fil . Filippia I have a secret  --  Nay , a surmise , which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Cos . Costanza I am listening . Fil . Filippia I fear to speak ; knowing the steadfast love You cherish towards your parents . Cos . Costanza Dear Filippia , My marriage has perplexed you sadly . Speak ; For it must be your subject . I absolve you From your hard promises . Come , come , give tongue ; Draw off your rancor to the very dregs : Ill words , well-purposed , have no mischief in them . Fil . Filippia Has not your mother an o'er-anxious care About this marriage ? Cos . Costanza Is it not a duty She owes my father ? Fil . Filippia But your father looks So sad and moody ! Then he never speaks . There 's something in his silence . Cos . Costanza It reveals The wishes that lie nearest to his heart . He fears his choice has swayed my inclination ; And that I marry signore Marsio More from a sense of duty than from love : So he withholds his counsel , leaving me My own conclusion . Fil . Filippia Doubtless that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints forgive me ! Love , gratitude  --  owed , if not well repaid  --  O , why do you cry out so loud against me ? She took me when a child , a helpless orphan  --  When no one else would keep me  --  when my kin Hawked me about , with a sour charity , From one hand to another ;  --  reared me so That the most jealous eye could not detect Wherein my training differed from her own , Her own dear child , Costanza 's ; for whose sake  --  But what affection pardons treachery ? Cos . Costanza Filippia , darling , pray be plain ! Fil . Filippia No , no ; I can not , dare not . I have said too much . Your mother 's smile will be a long reproach To me , who should deserve , above all others , The never-ending smile she suns me in . I have had thoughts , base , base , degrading thoughts , But I will kill them , if I perish with them  --  Which , but to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their frames ; would shake This ancient roof-tree on my wicked head , And hide my shame in ruins ! It were just . Believe me not , Costanza ; scorn my hints ; Cling to your mother  --  she is worth your love . I , I  --  O , vile !  --  nay , do not pity me  --  Am the most faithless of a high-souled race ! Cos . Costanza What mean you ? Speak !  --  You do not love me . Speak !  --  What is this mystery ? Speak ! Fil . Filippia No ; never more . We must all wreck together ; I am dumb . ACT III . SCENE I. The Park of the Marquis di Tiburzzi . Enter Juranio . Juranio . Count Juranio Hail ! once again , thou blooming vineclad bower ! How long is it since the fair mistress ' hand Curled thy soft tendrils to this artful flow , Moulding the straggling wildness of thy humors Into such harmony ? By your leave , rose . Plucks a rose . These crumpled features tell some dainty hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force its backward nature into flower . Say , have you told her , treacherous confidant  --  For you are full of whispering winds , that tell To me , a late companion , many a tale Of the gray East , where all your kindred speak The lover 's low , close language  --  have you told How oft your leafy screen has covered me , While she , the mistress of us both , swept by , Sad , but majestic ? Wherefore is she sad ? My tongue runs tripping , but my heart is lead . O , Count Juranio , what a fool art thou , To waste thy manhood on a maid who cares No atom for thy countship ! To lie hidden , Hour after hour , upon the dank , rough ground , Merely to catch the glimmer of a girl  --  A girl who casts the pearl of her affection Before that swinish usurer , Marsio ! By heaven , ' t is villanous ! And were it not  --  So much her seeming gives report the lie  --  That I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our land , I 'd fly her as infectious . What , what ! she To prop a selfish dotard 's crumbling house With the untimely ruins of her youth ! To spin a few thin moments for his age Out of her heart 's blood ! Suffer worse than death , That one old man may crawl down to his grave With a stuffed pocket ! By the blessed saints , Blood has no claim upon her ! She is mad , To nurse the childish folly of old age To such portentous bigness ! Ha ! once more Hide love and me , my sweet confederate ! Goes behind the bower . ( Enter Costanza . ) Costanza . C ostanza Fit season for my visit . It was morn When first I met him ; every leaf and flower Looked up and opened to increasing day ; Nature spread wide her arms , in liberal joy , Yielding her flushing bosom to the sun . Even as a tardy flower , my heart unclosed To revel in his presence ; even as Rejoicing nature , my whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plunges in haste behind yon western clouds , To course dun night around his broad domain , The leaves and flowers may weep themselves to rest ; Nature may cross her placid arms in sleep , And dream of morn beneath the merry stars ; But , ah ! to me there is no tearful rest , No quiet sleep , no dream of happiness , No star of comfort . In the middle heaven , Yet veiled and ominous , burns my sun of love , Never to set again . Ju . Count Juranio Hold your peace , winds ! Silence , ye fluttering leaves , that I may hear her ! Aside . Cos . Costanza Juranio  --  Ju . Count Juranio My name ! Aside . Cos . Costanza Juranio , ' T is weak , ' t is wicked , to maintain my grief On thoughts of thee .

Cos . Costanza Begone , begone , sir ! Ju . Count Juranio Hear me , dear Costanza ! Kneels . Cos . Costanza By what new license do you use that title ? Ju . Count Juranio By the allowance of your lips . ( Pietro Rogo crosses the back of the scene , observing Costanza and Juranio , significantly . ) Cos . Costanza How low , How far beneath my honest scorn , you seem , Poor Count Juranio ! Will you not arise ?  --  The place is public . Or do you intend To crown your treachery with my dishonor ? Ju . Count Juranio A day of marvels ! ( Rises . ) But a minute since  --  The words even now are echoing in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense  --  I heard you , lady  --  Cos .

Our former meeting was in some such way As this wherewith you honor me . Ju . Count Juranio Coquette ! Cos . Costanza Signore ! Ju . Count Juranio I heard enough to settle such a name On all the seed of Eve . Cos . Costanza Redoubted cynic ! Where has your manhood fled , that you employ Knowledge so basely found , so weakly used , Upon a lady ? What I may have said In lavish fancy , granted truth compact , Stands by the favor of your merit only : After this paltry act  --  this poor attempt To scare me to confession , by arraying My private thoughts against my open words  --  How rank you your own merit ? Had you been The generous man I one time held you for , My thoughts had sunk , as rain-drops into sand , To cool , but not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juranio Costanza di Tiburzzi , ere I go , Listen .

Hidden by yon bower  --  While peeping buds unfolded into flowers  --  While infant leaves uncurled their tiny scrolls , And , full-grown , basked them in the mellow sun  --  While all creation was an active hymn Of ceaseless labor to approving God  --  I have stood idly , though the dear time sped , Waiting to catch the faintest glimpse of you . Then , happy with that treasure of my sense , Have hied me home , to fill my waking thoughts With growing fancies ; or , through fleeting night , Made my dreams golden with the memory Of what had blessed my day . I cover nothing : I have no skill nor wish to circumvent you . You know the mystery of my presence here ; You know the secret of my love ,  --  ah ! yes , You knew it ere I spoke it . You can lift , By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapture . Speak , O , speak ! My fate hangs on your mercy ! Cos . Costanza Have you heard No rumor of my marriage ? Ju . Count Juranio Yes ; a rumor ,  --  A baseless rumor . Cos . Costanza Ere another week , That rumor and my fate will be but one . Ju . Count Juranio Is there no hope ? Cos . Costanza I chose my portion , sir . And must abide the issue . Ju . Count Juranio Dear Costanza , Did you but know the energy , the power , Which I might use to sway your destiny ; To foil a wretch  --  Cos . Costanza Hold ! Do you counsel me To scheme against my honor ? Farewell , sir ! I know not by what weakness I have staid To hear  --  Kind Heaven , some strength ! Aside . Exit hastily . Ju .

I can not call her cruel . I hope not heartless . Yet she loves me not . Nay , she was very sparing of my feelings . I broke upon her rudely  --  startled her ; At such a time too . Yet she loves me not . Ah ! yes ; at such a time ! while every word Lightened the freight of her o'erburdened heart . ' T was rash in me  --  thoughtless : I should respect Maiden reserve . She likes not sudden passion . In faith , nor do I. Reason should confirm Our hearts ' emotions , ere we give them way . Perhaps she loves me yet ! I 'll swear she does ; Or sovereign Love is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Salvatore Ho ! there , Juranio ! Ju . Count Juranio Signore Marsio  --  Sal . Salvatore My name is Salvatore , please you . Ju . Count Juranio So ! But let him stand aside ; I can not answer Where love may drive me . Sal . Salvatore Can you answer me ? Deaf man !  --  Juranio ! Are you dumb too ? Here , Let us talk with our fingers . Ju . Count Juranio Salvatore , I 've met her , spoken with her ! Sal . Salvatore So have I. Ju . Count Juranio What said she ? Sal . Salvatore Little . In my breathing-times , She edged a word in . Ju . Count Juranio What had you to say ? Sal . Salvatore O ! nothing plainly ; I 've not come to that . But , here and there , I tumbled in a hint , Like love astray , which she may ponder on . Ju . Count Juranio You love her ? Sal . Salvatore Ay , sir ; she is not preserved ; I was not poaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did she take it ? Sal . Salvatore Kindly , very kindly . Ju . Count Juranio Villain !  --  traitor ! Seizes him . Sal . Salvatore Lord love the man ! Let go ! Is she the only she within the realm ? I have another she , to whom your she Is only cousin . Ju . Count Juranio Miserable jester ! Sal . Salvatore No ; I am serious . O , thou dear Filippia , Couldst thou but hear this shabby creature sneer At us , and at love 's majesty ! Base , vile , Soulless Juranio ! Ju . Count Juranio On this very spot , Hidden behind yon bower , I heard her own Such feelings for me  --  ah ! such rapturous feelings Of maiden innocence ! My beggar heart Was rich at once , as if the heavens rained love ! Sal . Salvatore Heard whom ? Ju . Count Juranio Costanza  --  why , Costanza , surely Sal . Salvatore I pray you do not gall me , kinsman , thus . I am rashly jealous , deadly quarrelsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count Juranio While the words Still tingled in my ears , upon this spot , This very spot ,  --  see where her little feet Have nestled in the grass ,  --  I heard her say She could not love me , never would be mine , And , worse than all , would marry Marsio ! Sal . Salvatore Worms gnaw the fellow ! All Filippia said Was " Marsio , and Marsio , " and " Cousin , Poor , poor Costanza ! " And now you begin ! Think you the heathen means to wed them both ? What is this Marsio ? Ju . Count Juranio A wealthy merchant , Or usurer , or some such sorry thing , Picked by the Marquis for his daughter 's bed : A slow , sure matrimonial poison , used To fatten purses ,  --  death to flesh and blood . Sal . Salvatore I understand . We must be rid of him . Ju . Count Juranio But how ? Sal . Salvatore Quite simply  --  Musing . Ju . Count Juranio How ? Sal . Salvatore Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just burying him , By an unfailing plan ; but you destroyed it . ( Enter Pulti , singing . ) Pulti . Pulti The devil looked down , With a curse and a frown , And to the young witch he said , ' Ods blood ! I 'd far rather Quell hell in hot weather , Than govern one headstrong maid ! Ju . Count Juranio Whence comes that devilish song ? Sal . Salvatore From yonder knave . Come hither , nightingale . Pulti . Pulti You called me , signore ? Sal . Salvatore Ay , warbler , unperch . What is the news in hell ? Pul . Pulti The devil has a surfeit of light fools , And sends for solid food ; I 'll pass you by . Sal . Salvatore Now , by his tongue , the bird 's a wood-pecker . Pul . Pulti And rapping on your poll . Sal . Salvatore His tongue 's a foil : He foins and parries like a mountebank . Whom do you serve ? Pul . Pulti Myself most faithfully , To answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at large , slack services To signore Marsio . Sal . Salvatore That name again ! How many Marsios are there ? Pul . Pulti One at present . He gets to breeding shortly ; there 'll be more Ju . Count Juranio Are you purveying for a cudgelling ? Pul . Pulti Heaven knows . What means the gentleman ? Sal . Salvatore Scarce nothing : His thoughts are hardly fantasies just now . How do you like your service ? Pul . Pulti Why , so far As one may thrive on musty wine , thin diet , Most scanty wages  --  Sal . Salvatore What a churlish wretch , To treat so brave a fellow to such fare ! Pul . Pulti Signore , you wrong him . I 'm as well supplied With work as bees are ; I 've more blows than Winter ; Oaths thick as stars ; frowns bountiful as sunlight : I am called up early , like an April violet ; Sent to bed tardily , like a waning moon ; I am railed and sneered at like Heaven 's providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! boy , so ! Is Marsio honest ? Pul . Pulti Passably , so far ; But then , you know , the devil has a say , Sooner or later , in the best of lives . Sal . Salvatore Would you change masters ? Pul . Pulti Ay , with Satan 's dog . But that is hopeless ; wit 's uncurrent coin ; Men drop me sooner than they take me up . Sal . Salvatore Serve me . Pul . Pulti I 'm yours . Now , farewell , Marsio ! I 'll leave my rags as keepsakes . Sal . Salvatore Not so fast . My service is peculiar ; but its wages Out-go your dreams . A fortnight I desire You watch o'er Marsio , note his slightest act , Become more zealous , more familiar with him ; Let naught escape you . When the time is fair , You 'll run to me , and make a full report . I have suspicions of this Marsio 's truth , From certain hints a shrewd-brained lady dropped ; And should I catch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pul . Pulti How ! I play spy ! Sal . Salvatore Are you a Christian man ? Pul . Pulti Yes ; of the latest make . Sal . Salvatore Then hearken , man ! If Marsio 's honest , you can say no ill ; If he is false , ' t is nothing but plain duty To fright his brother sinners with his sins . Make him hell 's scare-crow ; for example , brother , Is your best governor of coward man . There is a pithy sermon , preached for you , Upon the mote and beam text . After this Short fortnight 's service , life is all your own . Pul . Pulti I 'll do it . But forgive me , if I think Your promise better than your argument . Sal . Salvatore The knave is apt . Aside . Ju . Count Juranio Kinsman , ' t is treacherous To set a spy upon your enemy : You lower to his level . Sal . Salvatore Well , sir saint , E'en leave the schemer to his wicked schemes . Wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember  --  What 's your name ? Pul . Pulti Pulti , good master . Sal . Salvatore Remember , Pulti . Pul . Pulti Ay , sir ; have no doubts . This wretch , this crooked beast , this Marsio , Must be  --  What , what ? I 'm working in the dark . Sal . Salvatore That saves the sin . Pul . Pulti I am not tender-minded . I have the knack of talking sins to naught , With your best casuists . Use your pleasure , master . ( Sings . ) Quoth the fiend , I was born On a Friday morn , My fall out of heaven was Friday , On a Friday the reign From my kingdom was ta'en ;  --  The curse of the seven was Friday ! To-day is Friday , sir . Sal . Salvatore That 's the tune , bird ! Time wears , Juranio . Ju . Count Juranio Why , let it wear ! Would you clog time ? Put wings upon his feet : Each passing day 's a drop of precious balm To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will but add another , deeper pain , The curse of memory ; a dreary waste Of blasted life , stretching from now to death ! Sal . Salvatore You and your love make up the universe ! Ju . Count Juranio Then leave me to my world . I would not talk ; I wish no comfort , no companionship , No mocking hope , no fruitless sympathy . Sal . Salvatore Ugh ! what a wintry heart ! I hope yet .  --  Come ! Exeunt . SCENE II .

Pietro Rogo You would not credit it . Mar . Marsio Upon his knees ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo As fine a looking fellow as you 'll meet . A Court-gallant , a man of her own tribe , A new Adonis , who strings women 's hearts On mournful osiers , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , with broad , white brows , That buzz with sonnets , and such lady-traps , Like two great bee-hives . There I saw him down , Down on his knees .  --  ' T would pose you , Marsio , To spring your chalky joints . Mar . Marsio Pshaw ! Pietro , Your trick is barefaced . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Trick , trick !  --  How ? pray how ? Mar . Marsio You 'd make me jealous . Rogo . Pietro Rogo By the blessed Virgin , I swear I spoke the truth ! Mar . Marsio If it be so , I 'll crush Tiburzzi , daughter , wife , and all , Into the dust ! Look you , friend Pietro , I hold these beggars in my open hand . Here , here  --  I have been provident for slips  --  This little parchment covers all their worth Down to a lira . Only let them blench , And they shall pray for Purgatory . ' Sblood ! Trick me !  --  use me !  --  make me security For a cracked daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Mar . Marsio Enough of that . I 'll watch her , Pietro  --  Nay ; are you serious ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo On my soul , I am ! Mar . Marsio I 'll tax her with it . Will you not confront her ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo That were base usage . Mar . Marsio Furies ! what care I ? She 'd make a stale of me before we 're coupled ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo Mend your own botching . Mar . Marsio Marry , that I will ! And yet I 'll wed her , spite of her and you . Rogo . Pietro Rogo That frets me little . Mar . Marsio O ! I know your drift ! You have bred a crooked notion in your brain , That still keeps twisting . You would shape the end Of the disastrous prophecy you made , Merely to be called prophet . Look you , look you , Martyrs are fashioned of such holy stuff ! Rogo . Pietro Rogo Your rage defeats your judgment . I would guard , Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Park .

Filippia . Filippia By that same oath , I doubt it strangely , signore ! Sal . Salvatore Try me by all love 's ordeals ; if I fail In any point of doctrine , faith , or duty , Protest me arrant . Fil . Filippia Fairly challenged , sir . I have a test . Sal . Salvatore O ! name it , name a thousand ! Fil . Filippia You are acquainted with my cousin 's fate , With her betrothal to one Marsio ? Sal . Salvatore Gods ! I know nothing else ! Fil . Filippia Fie ! restive lover ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My precious knowledge  --  scraped by hard degrees  --  Bids fair to be ingulfed in that one fact . Fil . Filippia Be patient . Would you win ? Sal . Salvatore On any terms . I might stand Marsio 's name some ten times more ; Costanza 's some two-score.  --  But do be brief ; My reason totters when you mention them . Fil . Filippia We 'll drop their titles . If you foil this marriage , My hand is yours ; ay , and the largest piece Of a most grateful heart . ( Enter , behind , Marsio and Pietro Rogo , observing them . ) Sal . Salvatore But should I fail ? Fil . Filippia Were mankind merged in one , and you that one , I vow I would not  --  Sal . Salvatore Hist ! swear not ; ' t is wicked . What if you broke your oath ? ' T were perjury ; A deadly sin . I swear by saving rules , That take the peril from a broken vow : Let me do all the swearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking this ; but , having erred , I 'll have my wish to lull my conscience with .

Starting up . Mar . Marsio He is used to kneeling . This pair , Pietro , And your old eyes , have cozened you . Rogo . Pietro Rogo No , no ; Yon doting couple , and the pair I saw , Are no more like than geese and swans . This park Must breed such creatures . Fil . Filippia Marsio himself ! Sal . Salvatore You fellow , there !  --  Sirrah !  --  you thieving clown , I 'll have you whipped for poaching ! Mar . Marsio Sir ! Sal . Salvatore You trespass : You are intruding upon private grounds .

This were a speedy way to settle all . Apart to Filippia . I wait you , sir . To Marsio . Mar . Marsio I do not wish to kill you . Put up your sword . I would advise you , friend , To find as safe a scabbard for your tongue . Rogo . Pietro Rogo ' blood ! do you bear that Court-fly 's impudence ? Hark you , sir ; signore Marsio is my friend , My next of kin ; might I supply his place ? Draws . Sal . Salvatore Most charmingly . One of the family Is something toward . To Filippia . Fil . Filippia Have you no respect , No feeling for a woman ? Mar . Marsio Shame upon you !

Marsio I pardon you , unasked . The gentleman Has the infirmity of wrath . Alas ! Heaven made him so , for mortals to forgive . Sal . Salvatore We 'll settle , one day . Fil . Filippia Come , come , signore Firebrand ; I wish a valiant escort home . Sal . Salvatore Dear lady , Forgive my rudeness . Fil . Filippia No ; I praise your zeal . This bold beginning is a happy presage . Exit with Salvatore . Mar . Marsio Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha !  --  You would gull Marsio , ha ? Laughing . Know you that man ?

Go , Rogo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll abide him . Mar . Marsio Mad as a March wind ! Is there no other way to tame wild bulls Than butting at them with a pair of horns ? Meet him with his own weapons ! Where 's revenge  --  Where 's honor , satisfaction , and all that  --  When you are wriggling half-way up a rapier , Your heart pinned to your back ? I have a way To make his bilbo harmless as a rush ; I have an airy weapon that can stab , Without a wound ; yet make our satin signore Grovel for life . I 'm master of that blade , And he is not : I 'll use it , Pietro . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Keep to your own dark pathway , leave me mine  --  Nay , sir ; I will not go ! Mar . Marsio Pish ! headstrong man ! I am walking towards the Castle , I shall meet him ,  --  With the most lowly reverence of my cap ,  --  If you persist , I 'll lead him round this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin me . Now , dear friend Pietro.  --  Rogo . Pietro Rogo O ! well , to please you . The sun must rise to-morrow . Mar . Marsio Are you sure These two were not the pair seen yester eve ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo I swear it , by Saint Peter ! She alone , Lady Costanza  --  ' sblood ! I know her well  --  Was the divinity ; the worshipper I never saw before . Within an hour You shall know all about him . Mar . Marsio At my house Meet me , anon . I 'll bring her secret to you . Lady Costanza has an open heart , And I will tax it . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Do not trip yourself . You have a dangerous ignorance of rank , And the refinements of its ticklish honor . I fear some blunder . Mar . Marsio ' T is the quickest way ; I can not sleep until the fact stand clear . Exit Rogo . As for our heady signore of the blade , Let him look well to his economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what holds  --  To what he eats , what drinks , what physic takes  --  To how he sleeps , and how he goes abroad ; Let him beware dark nights , and crooked lanes  --  Smooth billet-doux , and angry challenges ; For , by the wrath to come , a sudden death Might lurk in any of them ! Let him watch : He opened credit with a punctual firm ; We must break quits ere long ! Here lies my path . Exit . SCENE IV . A Room in the Castle of the Marquis . Enter the Marquis and Marchioness di Tiburzzi . Marchioness . Marchioness di Tiburzzi ' T is the perversity of woman , sir , A subtle fiend forever creeping in Between a young maid and her interest . Our girls are spoiled . The women of this age Are infants from the crib down to the grave ,  --  Weak , mindless children , full of baby whims  --  All smiles , all tears ; but he is weather-wise Who can predict their changing humors surely . Ah ! for the Roman matrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast of yore !  --  What , not bite at the Romans ?  --  sad indeed ! Aside . Marquis . Marquis di Tiburzzi Our daughter 's grief is deeper than a whim ; And now her gloom seems doubling . Oft of late I have seen her slyly wiping tears away . If I observe her  --  for I can not help The old love rising sometimes in my eyes  --  At once she makes such frantic starts at mirth  --  The dreary ghost of bygone merriment  --  The dismal echo , when the sound has died  --  The laughing lip , but not the laughing heart  --  That I can not but wonder at a state So nigh to frenzy . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi She has lost your love . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Can it be that ? She shall have all my love ; Yes ; I will double its best outward show . I have been cruel . It may be that , indeed .  --  But she has Marsio 's love , for which she bartered , Most wittingly , most calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . My old age Is over-greedy , to presume her youth Should cramp its action to my selfish bounds . What arrogance ! I had a father once , And loved him dearly ; but a little maid Stole me and all my duty . Right , Costanza !  --  She 's right , I say ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi I did not question it . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi I grant you , madam , natural love is pure , Holy , and calm , and fixed unalterably ; Yet there is something in that other love , With all its turbulence and fiery passion  --  Its frenzies verging into bitterness  --  Its sudden heats , and sudden shivering chills  --  A mystery , and a far-fading feeling , So wraps this fruitful union of two hearts , That I can rather think its hidden start To be from some great viewless source above , Than from the many , obvious , natural springs Which rise around us in our wonted paths . What think you , wife ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself hold this debate . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Two struggling passions cause Costanza 's grief : Her love for Marsio jars her love for me . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You 're in a desperate way , sir , if you hope , With the small pack of human faculties , To hunt down girlish freaks . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Freaks , madam , freaks ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi My plot works cross-grained . ( Aside . ) Could you trust Costanza  --  Ah ! how he winces !  --  ( Aside . ) You might condescend  --  ( Enter a Servant . ) Well ? Servant . Servant Signore Marsio . Exit . ( Enter Marsio . ) Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Fair day to you ! Marsio . Marsio Thank you , my lord . Your daughter ? where is she ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Out in the Park . Mar . Marsio What business draws her there ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Her love of nature . Mar . Marsio Nature !  --  Human nature ? Marq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Sunshine , and air , and flowers , Have stronger charms , for the full pulse of youth , Than the gray walls which chill age cowers in , Through dread of sun-strokes , draughts , and sickening scents . Mar . Marsio Sunshine , and air , and flowers ! Fine things , no doubt ! Is she oft out for sunshine , air , and flowers ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Yes ; every hour . I can not keep her in . She seems to draw some comfort from the breath Of these bland May-days . Mar . Marsio The old man is frank . Aside . Have you much company ?  --  I ask you this Because I seek acquaintance with your friends . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Friends ! I have none .  --  How your thoughts skip about !  --  Besides yourself , and my large family Of well-known creditors , no one , save those Whom it scarce shelters , comes beneath this roof . Mar . Marsio No one ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi No one . Mar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ di Tiburzzi Custom has made What troubled me at first , an easy loss . Mar . Marsio But , then , your Park has many charms , Even for the dainty relish of your daughter , And her fair cousin  --  I must not slip her : But now I met her with a cavalier . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi How now ! Filippia with a cavalier ! I am her guardian ; but ' t is news to me.  --  Wife , wife , Filippia with a cavalier ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Well , well , what harm ? This is no nunnery : She is full-aged . Her own sharp-cornered wit Is her best guardian . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi I must look to this . Mar . Marsio ' T is said  --  but with what truth I 'll not avouch  --  Your daughter has another cavalier . These cousins hunt in couples . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Fairly said ! You would excuse Filippia . Ha ! ha ! sir ; Laughing . By the sly twinkle of your eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsio ' Sdeath ! no ! I have no taste for sunshine , air , and flowers ; ' Ods blood !

March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi What is all this ? Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Our sweet son , Marsio , Gives us an inkling of his filial love ! Mar . Marsio Ne'er sneer at me , sir ,  --  never sneer at me ! Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi I am talking to this lady . March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Pray be calm . Apart to Marsio . If signore Marsio has been well informed , He has just cause to take offence . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Gods ! madam  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set us right . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi No ; she can set you wrong ,  --  can show how basely You slander purity ! ( Enter Costanza . ) March . Marc hioness di Tiburzzi You have been walking ? Costanza . Costanza Yes .  --  Good-day , signore Marsio ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Alone ? Cos . Costanza O , no ! O , no ! There was one little bird Followed me strangely on , from tree to tree , Measuring his lagging flight by my slow steps , As if he sought to keep me company ; And when I paused a moment , he would hop , In open view , upon the nearest spray , And pour into my ears such moving notes  --  So melancholy , yet so sweet withal  --  That I scarce knew whether to stop and hear , Or to pass on , and end his melody . Mar . Marsio Sunshine , and air , and flowers ! and now a bird !  --  Pish ! do they take me for a fool ? Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other company ? Cos . Costanza None , mother . Mar . Marsio Bah ! how she feathers us ! I 'll pluck your bird . Aside . Lady Costanza . Cos . Costanza Signore Marsio . Mar . Marsio I am a candid man  --  a little rough , Perchance , sometimes , yet meaning honestly . I never steal upon my enemy , But march straight to him , pounding all my drums . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Your enemy ! Cos . Costanza Must I be rated one ? Laughing . Mar . Marsio I hope not , lady . But this busy world Buzzed ugly sounds  --  unlike your pretty bird 's  --  Into my ears , as I walked hither . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Well ! Would you out-stare each other ? Mar . Marsio Bluntly , then : ' T is said  --  I hope without foundation , lady  --  A bird is not the only company Of your long walks and pauses in the Park . One gossip winks , and swells his windy cheeks , As I go by ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealthy tale , told in fierce whispers ,  --  Of how you wander with a cavalier , Pensive and silent , treading down the flowers , That glitter so amid the dark-green grass , As if you really cared not to blot out God 's handiwork . Another has a tale , Fetched through a multitude of serving-men  --  But all truth 's truth , he will go bail for that  --  Of how this self-same cavalier was seen Upon his knees to you  --  to you ! At this The whole fraternity smile forth a sigh , And pity poor , dull Marsio . Lady mine , I loathe man 's pity ! Is there aught in this ? Whom saw you yesterday ?  --  the day before ? You do not answer . Cos . Costanza First , sir , by what right Do you advance the question ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi Answer , child . You are betrothed : he has a right from that . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi He has not , madam ; nor will I permit My daughter to be catechised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho ! I 'll tame you shortly . Cos . Costanza Signore Marsio , Do not misjudge me . Till my wedding-day , My erring acts will fall on me alone . When I do aught to peril my fair name  --  Which , now , I hold you have no check upon  --  I shall be first to show it , and absolve you From all your obligations . Until then , I am the proper guardian of my conduct . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi Well spoken , daughter ! March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi You maintain her folly . Mar . Marsio You 'll not deny it ? March . Marchioness di Tiburzzi ' T is but a word , love  --  Nay , for your mother 's sake . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi For my sake , peace ! Cos . Costanza Neither will I deny it , nor affirm it .

Rogo . Pietro Rogo Ho ! ho !  --  Why no , no ! Laughing . Neither outside nor in . Mar . Marsio I do not see The justice of it , Pietro . Why chance Crowds this man 's clay into Apollo 's mould , Yet scrapes the fair , plump flesh from my lank fingers , From my gaunt , bony arms , from my crook 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , Where usage orders , steals my buxom matter , To pile it in one lump upon my back ; Making me hideous with the very stuff She uses to create a paragon . Why this should be , I say , amazes me , And gravels reason . Well , to kick at fate Is but a laming trick . My reptile form , At least , contains the reptile 's cunning . Now , There is some justice there . Perhaps your Count , For all his beauty , lacks the use of it . Has this fair shape a mind ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo We 'll see anon . The people give him out as full perfection . What said your lady-love ? Mar . Marsio Ah ! there 's the doubt ; I can not fathom her . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Nor ever will . When you believe you touch the lowest depths Of women 's hearts , there 's something still beneath , You wot not of . Mar . Marsio Tush ! Pietro : I tell you I hold my friend Tiburzzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may whistle him . Rogo . Pietro Rogo How bears he that ? Mar . Marsio He struggled for a while ; But when I hinted what a time they pass Who tug their lives out at a galley 's oar , Neither for gain nor pleasure ; how to row Even a shallop , without any aim , Would be a sad thing ; and described a hulk As something bulkier than Costanza 's shoe ; When , to all this , I hinted doubtful fears Of his dear daughter 's fate , if he were gone , He grew a rival for the meekest dove . Rogo . Pietro Rogo You are a villain , Marsio . Mar . Marsio I know it : I 'm what is called a villain by a world That sees its huge face in my little glass . ' T is false ! I am no villain . I am one Who must achieve what my heart prompts me to , Or be no more forever . I 'm as well As any man who works his purposes , Despite his fears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still are doubtful . Why not give her up ? I would far rather wed a Magdalen Than a suspected woman . Doubts and fears Make up full half the substance of our ills . Mar . Marsio I 'll solve my doubts before the wedding day . If she prove true , I gain a trusty wife ; If she do not  --  why , even as I said , Tiburzzi rows a galley . I will have My wife or my revenge . Gods ! Pietro , The girl looks chaste . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Looks chaste !  --  O , save us !  --  looks ! Yet that might cozen one . I often gaze Upon a piece of ruined womanhood With strange , blind feelings  --  a blank wonderment That one so fair , so chaste , to outward show , Must by the cautious intellect be held As mere corruption . There 's a fearful jar Betwixt the heart and brain upon this theme . Mar . Marsio I have an ordeal for her . It may be That Count Juranio knelt and prayed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , With bootless zeal . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Yes ; even that might be . Mar . Marsio You are lenient to-day . Rogo . Pietro Rogo Low-spirited , Dyspeptic . Mar . Marsio Ah ! Here is my little plan . Tiburzzi dare refuse me nothing : I Will bring together the enamored Count And his fair idol ;  --  yea , I will cast in His friend , fierce signore Salvatore . Thus His Countship shall have scope , unbounded room ; Tempted by love on one side , on the other Urged up by valor . I will throw Costanza And the sweet Count , ablaze ' twixt love and wrath , Into incessant contact , while I watch The play my puppets make .  --  Ha , Pietro ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo Blast your dark plots ! But reason splits on you ; You 'll have your way . Mar . Marsio That will I. Come with me . I 'll take you to Tiburzzi 's house . Perchance He 'll hold me better for my company .  --  Ha , Pietro ? Rogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I will not go . Mar . Marsio You fear Tiburzzi ? Rogo . Pietro Rogo No ! Curse your Tiburzzi ! Would you take me there , As a set off to your own awkwardness ? Mar . Marsio Ho ! ho ! well thought ! Laughing . Rogo . Pietro Rogo I 'll meet you in the Park . Let me have notice when this pretty plot , Against your own repose , is toward . Mar . Marsio Yes . Rogo . Pietro Rogo You 'll rue your plotting . Crime has its degrees ; Wade in its shallows , and you drown at last . Mar . Marsio Lord , Pietro ! what a good man you are ! Laughing . Rogo . Pietro Rogo I 'll have the laugh upon you shortly , sir , If I know aught of woman . Mar . Marsio That would be A bitter laugh for old Tiburzzi . No ; It must end well . Costanza will prove true ; My test will school her virtue , not destroy it ; And Count Juranio  --  Rogo . Pietro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly love the boy , men speak so farily . Mar . Marsio Why , so do I. But he must feel his trespass ; Know what it is to woo a man 's betrothed . That were a moral lesson , fitly taught For his soul 's health . But lightly , Pietro  --  I will but check him with a father 's hand  --  Quite lightly , Pietro . Ha , ha ! poor boy , Laughing . He will not need correction more than once . Come , come , to business ! Love has played wild tricks With my neglected balances , of late . Exeunt . SCENE II . The House of Juranio . Enter Juranio and Salvatore . Salvatore . Salvatore Cheer up , Juranio ! Do not hug your grief ; All that is lovable in you is wasting Before its sickly drought . Remember , man , You are supported by a deity . The blind brat , Love , despite his want of eyes , Will find you out a way to win at last . Trust your own idol . Shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheer me , with a cheerless heart ; Between your words , your face is sad as mine . Salves for a mortal wound , drugs for the dead , Hopes for the hopeless ! Sal . Salvatore Every thought 's astray . Why , all things are merely as we behold them , Taking such qualities as we bestow . One only looks at the bright side of things ; And he 's your gull , the prey of all mankind . Another gloats upon the darker side , Pleasing himself with self-inflicted pain ; And he ' s your misanthrope . Another scans Both bright and dark , with a calm , equal eye ; Lo ! your philosopher . But then  --  now mark  --  Comes up the happy soul who looks at nothing , Yet turns whatever is to present pleasure ; Tastes Fiascone in thin Pavian wine ; Wallows in down upon a bed of straw ; Smells roses in a swine-yard ; hears sweet tones From the harsh , grating rasps of puffing smiths ; Beholds the sunshine glorify the flower , And change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky of bare December . Here ' s your true liver , kinsman mine ! A man Who neither fools , nor frowns , nor calculates , But dreams away this aching thing called life : Make him your model . If your lady frown , Why , look up one who smiles . Ju . Count Juranio Dear Salvatore , ' T is but a vain attempt to reason down Our smallest feeling . The mind 's snow may lie A dreary winter on the torpid heart , Yet never kill it . Slack the rigor once , And , like a violet that leans its cheek In mockery against some melting drift , Up springs the heart , more fruitful for its rest . ( Enter Pulti , singing . ) Pulti . Pulti So the devil was wroth At the gentlemen both , Though no one could fathom his matters ; And he dashed around hell , Like a dog tailed with bell , And tore all his dwelling to tatters ! Sal .

Would you could see him now ! He foams and rages round his frighted house Like a bear newly caged . He 's full of curses , Full of dire threats against some hapless foes ; And every time he passes me  --  O Lord !  --  My humble manner seems to prick him so  --  He takes compassion on his enemies , And deals me half their vengeance . See me , sir ! I am basted like a piece of English beef : I had just strength to crawl here , and no more . Sal . Salvatore Who has enraged him ? Pul . Pulti That I can not tell . Two gentlemen , I judge , by what I hear : By what I feel , I judge these gentlemen Must bear a striking likeness to myself . Sal . Salvatore Can he suspect ? Ju .

Salvatore Why , signore  --  Ju . Count Juranio We will come . Sal . Salvatore How , Count ? Ju . Count Juranio We 'll come . I rage with thirst ; the sweet I can not taste , I 'll drain the bitter to the very lees , And she shall see it ! Aside . Mar .

Salvatore A strange request : I think him honest , though . Ju . Count Juranio I care not what he be . Sal . Salvatore The saints protect us ! You ' re roaring drunk with love and jealousy , Blind and incapable . Ju . Count Juranio I 'd reach the worst . To be forever baited by my passions Is more than I can bear .

( Renter Pulti . ) Pulti . Pulti Signore Salvatore , Sings . O ! pray what said the devil , With his cloven tongue of evil , As he drew his hoof under his gown ? Why , to them he said sweetly , Sweet gentlemen , I greet ye ! But he wished they might hang , starve , and drown . Sal . Salvatore Whate'er he wished , he spoke us fairly , Pulti . Pul . Pulti I heard it all . Beware of Marsio ! You know him not , as I do . I suspect You are the gentlemen who woke his wrath . Ju . Count Juranio Pish ! how ? Pul .

" Says Marsio ; " black hairs thatch empty heads . " Here is enough to raise a riot , sirs , And overturn a state . Why will you go ? I am sure he means you ill . Sal . Salvatore Why think you so ? Pul . Pulti I can not tell ; I have no reason for it ; My mind jumped to that end . Ju . Count Juranio We waste time , kinsman . Pul . Pulti O ! do not , do not go ! Ju .

I love you for your kindness .  --  Hear me , sirs  --  I 'd rather see this fair world torn to shreds , Than harm befall you . Ju . Count Juranio I respect your grief ; And were my life not centred in this thing , Your single wish should sway me . Salvatore  --  What , you hold off ! Sal . Salvatore You know for whom I do it . Pul . Pulti If Marsio escape my eyes to-day , May I want eyes to see him on the morrow ! Aside . Ju . Count Juranio I 'll go alone . You can not balk me thus .

Each act which sinks him in my mind , Binds me more closely to him . I but think Of my poor father , feeble , heart-sick , dying , With nothing but the mercy of this man Between him and the galleys . Gracious heaven ! Marsio dared threaten him with even that , While all the glory of the setting sun Looked on him through the windows ! Do men think That this vast theatre of their wickedness  --  With its brave lights of sun , and moon , and stars  --  Its shifting scenes , from Spring around to Winter  --  Its moving canopies of cloudy blue  --  Is crowded with a spiritual audience , Keeping mute watch upon our lightest acts ?

Marsio By your leave , I bring two friends of mine , or rather guests  --  Guests for the present , friends henceforth I hope  --  To share our feast to-night . Receive them kindly ; For they deserve no less . Let me present , Lady Costanza , Count Juranio . Cos . Costanza Sir , we have met before .  --  Mar . Marsio Ah ! so indeed ? A chance acquaintance , doubtless . As my friend , He asks a double share of your regard . Mistress Filippia , signore Salvatore : I pray you know him . Fil . Filippia Do not jeer at me !

Hang on no ceremonious usages . I beg you 'll know each other . Laugh , dance , sing ; Open all avenues to fellowship ; For , by my hopes of wedded bliss , old Time Shall make oblation of this day , at least , To rouse the gods of genial jollity ! Where hide the old folk ? Let us seek them .  --  What , You laggards !  --  Forward , to the stretching Park ! Stone walls cramp action . Lead my lady forth , Good Count Juranio .

My presence must have been a chill upon them . Bless us ! Filippia 's all alive with speech ; Arms and hands going  --  how she brings them down !  --  Clinching some sentence , through and through , with truth . And now she darts her head and curving neck , Like an affronted swan . Ha ! quiet yet , Costanza , pensive still ! And your fine Count Striding as at a funeral ! Why is this ?

Costanza Sir , you dissemble with me . Ju . Count Juranio Do I , lady ? Who taught the lesson ? Cos . Costanza Is it manly in you To seek so poor a victory over me ? Perchance , you thought to see my features pale , My eyes swim blindly , and my limbs give way , When you approached me first .  --  You did not , sir ! Perchance you think when , at the festival , They toast my union with Marsio , To see me falter , nay , to faint outright  --  A crowning triumph for your vanity .  --  You shall not , sir ! O ! Count Juranio , This is unworthy a less man than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you wrong me much . Why have you ever held me in contempt ? Why have you sought the motives of my acts Among the lowest heaven allows the base ? Why have you turned my honest love aside With irony ? I never wronged you , lady ,  --  No , by my soul , neither in word nor thought ! I never wished to tempt you into ill , With the bare modest offering of my love . Why do you fly a gentleman 's regard , And fix you on this loveless Marsio ? Cos . Costanza These are strange questions , Count Juranio . After to-day , our paths lie far apart ; Pledge me your honor ne'er to see me more , And I will answer .  --  Nay ; my fate is fixed . Ju . Count Juranio You will not understand me : your ill thoughts Stretch to futurity , and hint at things Beyond my heart 's conception .

Costanza , dearest ,  --  turn not from me now : I am all yours . O ! I have loved you long : I 'll spend my life in telling you how much .

Costanza Forbear , forbear ! You should not taunt me thus . My destiny Tramples on love , and overrules my life . O ! tempt me not ! Ju . Count Juranio Explain , explain yourself . I would not think unworthily of you . Cos . Costanza You know my father 's poverty  --  Ju .

Ju . Count Juranio The outrageous wretch ! I 'll bury him in gold ! Cos . Costanza Too late , too late ! Though you held all the Indies in your fee .

I can not , can not yield you . Chance , nay , heaven Has thrown me in your way to succor you .

Marquis di Tiburzzi I believe you : Although men 's tongues too oft outnoise their deeds , And gain in clamor what they lose in aim . When you approached me for my niece 's hand , I saw in you such manly qualities As led me to receive you , not alone As her best suitor , but as my best friend .

Marquis di Tiburzzi You mock me . Sal . Salvatore Mock you ! No , no ; I 'll show you what I rest upon . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi You seem a sober man . Sal .

Marquis di Tiburzzi O , horror ! Has the wretch Such depths in his dark soul ? Sal . Salvatore It so appears . Marq . Marquis di Tiburzzi I 'll hurl him from my windows !

I named them too  --  ha ! ha ! I named them for him ! Laughing . Called one Juranio . Striving thus to cheer His melancholy with my happiness : But yet he never smiled . When he would speak , ' T was only " Marsio , O ! were I you ! " And then he ' d blush , and catch his sentence up With  --  " I 'd do so and so "  --  some petty thing , Beneath my memory . Even now he talked , So sweetly talked , of " Death , dear life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep their cares away !

The one Shall rack him shrewdly , with a piercing colic , Until the opiate act ; when he will fall , Upon a sudden , in a torpid stupor , Which will so balance between life and death , That but a feather 's weight might turn the beam , And land him in eternity .

Had I believed A lover 's prophecies upon this point , I 'd have been fool enough to build an ark , Against a second deluge . What a close To all your rhapsodies ! Here 's a scant bath For a foul fly ! Sal . Salvatore Enough to drown your wit . Pul . Pulti If that 's the substance of love 's happiness , Pray trust it to my handling .
