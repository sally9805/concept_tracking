The firm is composed of Henry Clay Butcher and Horace Butcher , sons of the late Washington Butcher , and Henry P. Darlington , a son-in-law of the founder of the house , and William S. Harvey and Albert Miller , young men who have been in the service of Washington Butcher 's Sons for a number of years and recently became partners in the business . The standing of the firm was unexceptionable , and nothing has happened in its recent history to impair its credit . Its accounts ranged from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 per annum , and its direction was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it took an active hand in the provision corner , and , it is understood , had over S1,000,000 locked up in lard at one time . When the animated movements in grain began lately the Chicago branch of the firm operated heavily , and ? it was these transactions that brought about the suspension of to-day . The Chicago house has sent drafts for several thousand dollars repeatedly , but to-day , when a draft for $15,000 came , it was not met , and the failure was announced at 3 o'clock .

Bradley has $100,000 invested in his business and is a large owner of real estate . To-night he is making efforts to tide ovor the trouble without suspending payments .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
