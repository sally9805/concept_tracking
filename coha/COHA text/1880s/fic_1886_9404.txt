Richly furnished and upholstered . Large double doors up C. Doors up R. , up L. and R.1.E . Mantelpiece and fire down L. Large table , C. , half upstage . Armchairs , L.C. and R. Small table , R. High-backed chair up R.C. Small chairs , R.C. and up C. When the double doors at back are thrown open , a richly furnished drawing-room is seen . Discovered : M. Fonblanque , sitting down , L.C. , in thought . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Our little daughter , Julie , is to sign her marriage contract this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to me in her nurse 's arms . Enter Dr. Girodet , up R. , looking at a document in his hand You have finished with the solicitor , Franois ? Doct . Dr. Girodet Yes . The marriage contract is quite correct , if it satisfies you . Thank Heaven ! I have had nothing to do with the document , except to save you the trouble of reading it over with the lawyers . Fonb . M. Fonblanque I am under great obligations to you , cousin . These business affairs always annoy me . Doct . Dr. Girodet And the marriage of a young girl is a strictly " business " affair . The solicitor says that the Count de Crebillon has insisted , to the last , that you told him Julie 's dowry was to be six hundred and fifty thousand francs . Fonb . M. Fonblanque The count assured me that the offer of his hand to my daughter was based on that amount . Doct . Dr. Girodet He threw in his heart for nothing . Aside It 's all it 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on the difference between us ; it was only fifty thousand francs . Doct . Dr. Girodet It would be a pity for a stern father to blast an ardent lover 's affection for so small an amount . Gives Fonblanque the paper and turns away , R. I suppose it has become my duty , at last , Phillippe  --  my formal and painful duty  --  to congratulate you on Julie 's approaching marriage . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Your " painful " duty ! You have persisted in opposing this union from the first . The Count de Crebillon 's title is one of the oldest and most honorable in France . Doct . Dr. Girodet His title ? Yes . But the count himself ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque His ancestors  --  Doct . Dr. Girodet His character ! When a family improves as it grows older , it commands my most profound respect . So does a cheese . But in the case before us , if we test the cheese , I would say , the family  --  Fonb . M. Fonblanque The Crebillons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Froissart 's chronicles . Doct . Dr. Girodet The Crebillons of the nineteenth century figure most conspicuously in the columns of the sporting press . The present count is a rou ; a notorious duellist ; and , without the dowry he is about to gain with your daughter , he would soon add the honorable degree of " Bankrupt " to that of " Gambler . " His first wife was a disgrace to his title ; but even she did less to dishonor it than he , himself , has done . Fonb . M. Fonblanque The count has his peccadilloes , I admit . As to his first marriage , he appreciates the error very deeply ; but , luckily , there were no children . The real question at issue is that of uniting two streams of noble blood . On all questions of that kind , my dear Franois , your ideas are always  --  I may call them revolutionary ; and , really , I object to them . Doct . Dr. Girodet I dare say you object to the revolution of the earth around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you have grave doubts of the social respectability of the planetary system . The more recently discovered planets are mere parvenus . Fonb . M. Fonblanque The Count de Crebillon 's personal character is a mere incident in the progress of a noble family . Doct . Dr. Girodet And poor little Julie ? She , too , is a mere incident . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Julie is delighted at the idea of becoming a married woman . Doct . Dr. Girodet I can quite understand that . She longs to be free from the restraints to which every young girl is condemned  --  in France , at least  --  from infancy to matrimony . She can see little or nothing of the world , and she dreams of pleasures in store for her beyond her prison bars . Marriage , to a young French girl , means all that freedom does to a convict . Of course , Julie is happy at the idea of becoming a married woman . But does that fact relieve you , cousin , of all responsibility for the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . M. Fonblanque In marrying the count , Julie merely fulfills her social duty , in the position to which she was born . Our own family dates back many centuries  --  Doct . Dr. Girodet Yes . The original ape , from which the rest of the human race descended , was a pet monkey in the Fonblanque family . Phillippe , you are trying to unite two great French families by a young girl 's hand . Mark my words  --  her heart will be crushed between them ! Enter Mme. Fonblanque , up R. Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I have just left our dear little Julie . She 's the brightest and merriest bride-elect that ever signed a marriage contract . Her governess can do nothing with her ; and her dressing-maid can hardly keep her still long enough to arrange her hair . Sitting , R. Have n't you heard her laughing ? Doct . Dr. Girodet Up C. I hope I shall hear her laugh in the future . Fonb . M. Fonblanque By the bye , my dear  --  Showing a note I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. From Henri ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque He reached Paris , from South America yesterday . I dare say he will be out here today . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque How very strange ! Julie told me that she dreamed of Henri last night . I have been thinking of him , myself , continually of late . Doct . Dr. Girodet I have always hoped that Henri Saint-Hilaire would be something more to Julie than her old playfellow . For my own part , I heartily wish that he were in the place of the Count de Crebillon , today . Fonb . M. Fonblanque You are talking nonsense , Franois . I  --  I  --  love Henri , myself , very dearly . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque And I also ; very dearly ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque We always have  --  both of us . Henri was an excellent student , too ; and he has already distinguished himself in his humble profession . But he is a mere scientific man . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque We can not forget our own blue , blood , Franois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doct . Dr. Girodet No family ! Etienne Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire ! The discoverer of truths in science that have advanced the human race ! Isidore Saint-Hilaire ! Mere scientific men ! Their names and their works have carried the glory of France beyond the reach of her armies . The Crebillons and the Fonblanques , mentioned by Froissart , were only preparing the way for such men as they ! That is the family of Henri Saint-Hilaire ! Enter Pierre , up L. Pierre . Pierre M. le duc de Fouch-Fonblanque . Doct . Dr. Girodet Here 's more Froissart . Damn Froissart ! Enter the Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque , up L. Exit Pierre Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Mathilde ! Phillippe ! Fonb. and Mme. F. Fonblanque and Mme. Fonblanque Victorien ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Franois ! To Doctor , bowing My dear cousin . Doct . Dr. Girodet Bowing On my mother 's side . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I am quite aware that you are related to the Fonblanque family , on your mother 's side , doctor , but why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as my cousin ? Doct . Dr. Girodet Out of respect for my father 's memory . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Oh ! That has something to do with science , I suppose . I never do know what you are talking about , doctor . Turns down I lost another hundred thousand at the races , yesterday , Phillippe . That makes nearly a million francs since January . I have n't been so lucky this year as I was last ; I lost only half a million francs last year . Someone always tells me which horse is going to win , and I always bet on that horse ; and then one of the other horses comes in first . Speaking of my losses , by the bye , some of my creditors are getting anxious . When did you say you expected Mme. Fonblanque 's rich American niece from New York ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque We may hear of her arrival at any moment , now . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I thought you said about this time . You wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl as soon after her arrival in France as possible . Did you say anything about the dowry I should expect ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque I asked him to communicate with me on that subject . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque We have received a photograph of Kate . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Oh ! Her name is Kate . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Here it is , duc . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Thank you ; I 'll look at it , presently . What do you think we ought to put the dowry at , Cousin Phillippe ? We must remember , of course , that Mr. Shipley is a  --  not exactly a common tradesman , I believe  --  but an ordinary business man ; and only an American business man at that . Fonb . M. Fonblanque He is a banker and capitalist . Doct . Dr. Girodet Up R.C. You must n't sell your title too cheaply , duc . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Pardon me , doctor , but I do n't like that word sell . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little American girl , herself , I must remember that she will come to me without education , or the manners of a lady . Of course , I know that she is your niece , Mathilde ; but , as your sister ran away from France with an American husband , twenty years ago  --  Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Ah , duc ! it was a source of untold grief to us . Our families were never reconciled  --  until  --  Doct . Dr. Girodet Until Mr. Shipley had made a large fortune . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Until we felt that further persistence in our family pride would be unchristian . When my sister returned to visit us , seven years ago , I wished to detain her daughter in France . If they had allowed me to do so , the girl would have been a refined and well-bred lady , now . As it is , you can not expect the elegance of manner and the accomplishments , which have been beyond her reach , in a partially civilized country . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the ladies of my family ; it will be a great trial to them . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque It will , indeed . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I think the dowry should be at least twice as large as I should expect if I were conferring my hand and title on a lady of our own nationality . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Quite double the amount . Enter Pierre , up L. Pierre . Pierre A letter , monsieur . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Taking it From New York . Exit Pierre , up L. This is Mr. Shipley 's answer . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Ah ! Sits , C. Fonb . M. Fonblanque Reading " New York , March 21st , 1885 . My dear Fonblanque : Kate will sail on the Ville de Paris to-morrow .

A girl of nineteen does n't know what the word " check " means ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I 'm sure Julie has n't the slightest notion . Doct . Dr. Girodet I have been informed that American girls do understand the expression . An American patient of mine , in Paris , once told me that both his daughters used the word check frequently , in conversation with himself . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque What does Mr. Shipley say about my approaching marriage with his daughter . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Reading " I remain , in haste , yours , etc. , Robert G. Shipley . " Duc .

Taking a card from table and continuing , as if reading from it " Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque , speculator in thoroughbred horses  --  imported from England ; and in wealthy young girls  --  imported from America . " Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque " Kitty " and I  --  can " settle the matter "  --  between us ? What has the girl , herself , to say about it ? Mr. Shipley has n't any objection to me ! Doct .

Major Radclift , of our regiment , got acquainted with a number of Americans , once . They were girls . He told me they were rather nice . Most girls are rather nice ! Enter Kate , up L. , followed by Fonblanque . She stops , up L.C. , glancing about , quickly , then dropping her eyes . She looks up and advances a few steps towards Mme. Fonblanque , who has risen . Kate stops , as if noticing her cool dignity of manner , and waits for her to speak Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque My niece ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Aunt ! She goes to her with a quick step , but stops suddenly , before her , again checked by her manner . Mme. Fonblanque kisses her forehead Mme. F. Mme.

This is Dr. Girodet , a relative . Doct . Dr. Girodet You and I will be very good friends , my dear . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Heartily I am sure we shall be , doctor . Fonb . M.

I trust you had a pleasant voyage , Miss Shipley . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Charming ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque It was a long distance for a young girl to come , alone , with no one but your governess in charge of you . Sitting , R.C. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley My  --  governess  --  uncle ? I 'm nineteen years old . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The same age as Julie . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Has Julie a governess ? Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque All young girls in France have , until they are married . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I am my own governess ; and papa 's , too . Every American girl is . Papa needed a governess badly , poor darling , after he lost clear mamma , until I was old enough to look after him . I keep house for him , aunt , and manage all the servants . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's married , I do n't see how she can govern her husband and the rest of her household afterwards . Sitting , L.C. Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Aside Govern  --  her  --  husband ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I arrived in Paris on Tuesday evening , and should have come out here at once , only I had so many purchases to make . I bought two new trunks , and I filled them both . I wanted to see my bankers , too . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Aside Her bankers ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Aside A young girl of nineteen with a banker ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Papa gave me some New York Central shares for my last birthday present , and , just before I sailed , he wanted to sell them for me . But they were only ninety-nine cents , and the secretary of the company is superintendent of our Sunday school . The clergyman told me that he whispered to him , on the previous Sunday , while he was changing his gown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central shares were sure to go up . So I told papa not to sell mine . My bankers in Paris told me , yesterday , that they were a hundred and ten ! Dear papa ! I never could get him to go to church , but he 'll go regularly after this ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque You say you have no governess ; but surely you were not alone on the voyage . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh , no ! A family  --  old friends of ours  --  came on the same steamer ; a father and mother and their two sons . I was never alone ; one of the young gentlemen was always with me . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Aside One of the gentlemen ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The party came as far as Rouen , also , on the train from Havre . I came the rest of the way alone . Fonb . M. Fonblanque All the way from Rouen to Paris ! It was very unsafe , my dear girl ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque And highly imprudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles alone , in America ; why not here ? But I confess my first experience was an extremely disagreeable one . A gentleman sat opposite to me , when we left Rouen . That is , I mistook him for a gentleman at first , because I heard his servant address him as a " Count " before the train started . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque You were alone in the compartment with a  --  a count ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley All alone , duc !  --  with a French count  --  in a French train  --  on a French railway  --  in France . To tell the truth , the count made himself exceedingly disagreeable to me the first five miles . Doct . Dr. Girodet My child ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque What did you do ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I looked him straight in the eye , for the next five miles ; and he changed his compartment at the first station . Capt . Captain John Gregory Aside If I were charging a redoubt , I should n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonb . M. Fonblanque You must never expose yourself to such a risk again , Kate . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I never shall . If I ever again see a nobleman in a railway train , I 'll get into another compartment . But Cousin Julie ! I 'm longing to see her again . Fonb . M. Fonblanque You have come just in time to witness the signing of her marriage contract . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley What 's that , uncle ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque Have they no such ceremony in America ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The only marriage contract I ever heard of is where a gentleman asks a young lady to be his wife , and she says " no " and changes it to " yes " before he has time to drop her hand ; then they kiss each other . That 's the American ceremony . But we never have any witnesses to the contract ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Allow me to remark , my niece , that a gentleman in France is never permitted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged to be married , much less to kiss her ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley It 's different in America . I 've never been engaged myself , but a lot of other girls I know have been . When two young people , there , are making love , other people get to the furthest room in the house , and shut all the doors between . If anyone looks into the parlor , he dodges back as if he 'd just thought of an engagement somewhere else . Two lovers in America are put in quarantine . They might as well be on a desert island together  --  but they never seem to be lonely ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Do gentlemen in your country make love to young ladies in person , then ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley They 'd all die old bachelors if they did n't . You are in the Fifth Lancers , Captain Gregory ? Capt . Captain John Gregory Yes . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I met Major Radclift , of your regiment , in Paris , yesterday . Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shipley He said you were visiting here . Capt . Captain John Gregory Ah ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley He told me you were the bravest officer in the regiment . Capt . Captain John Gregory Yes . I mean  --  exactly  --  that is  --  of course  --  I would say  --  I  --  I beg your pardon  --  Moving up but I have n't had my regular exercise this morning ; I 'll take a few turns in the garden . Aside Damn Major Radclift ! Exits up L. Doct . Dr. Girodet Captain Gregory never beat a retreat like that in the face of an enemy . Enter Pierre , up L. Pierre . Pierre M. le Comte de Crebillon has arrived , M. Fonblanque . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Rising . To Duc Will you join us , duc ? Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque With pleasure . Exit Fonblanque , up L. , followed by Pierre Au revoir , Miss Kate ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Au revoir ! By the bye , duc , my father received a letter from uncle just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Fouch-Fonblanque Yes ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley About a matter of business . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Aside Business ! Aloud I requested M. Fonblanque to address your father . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I am papa 's agent . But I 'll not detain you , now . We will settle the  --  business  --  at some future time . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Yes . Aside , going I 've proposed to an American girl ! I 'll leave it to my lawyer . I could never manage it myself . Exits , up L. Doct . Dr. Girodet Aside , sitting at table , up C. I suspect the duc 's creditors will have to wait awhile for that dowry . Mme. Fonblanque rises , R. Kate rises , L. Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The apartments prepared for you , Kate , are at your service . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Thank you , aunt ; but I left all my trunks at the hotel , to follow me . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Aside All her trunks ! Doct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French aunt and an American niece . A book or paper before him Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Did I understand you to say that you were alone in the streets of Paris , yesterday and the day before ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes , aunt . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Surely , there was a maid , at least , with you . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I never had a maid . It 's bad enough to look after the other servants . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Permit me to say that no young lady , in Paris , is expected to be seen on the streets without a suitable companion . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley If a girl ca n't be trusted alone at nineteen , aunt , she ca n't be at ninety . I spent all yesterday afternoon at the Louvre gallery . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The Louvre ! No young girl should visit a public gallery without a governess , or other older companion . They all contain many pictures which are highly improper for a young girl . Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out the improper pictures , so I looked at the others . My friends came on from Rouen , and joined me again , yesterday noon . One of the young gentlemen took me to a concert in the evening . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I am positively shocked ! You  --  you went out  --  in the evening  --  with a gentleman ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes , aunt . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Let me say to you , once for all , that nothing whatever of that kind must ever occur again , while you are under my roof . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Surely , aunt , when a young lady is entrusted to a gentleman 's care , he is her natural protector until she returns to her home . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I dare say you have invented a new kind of young man in America . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley There must be some gentlemen , here , that can be trusted like that . What kind of young men do girls marry in France  --  nice girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Mme. Fonblanque I will converse with you further , my niece , when we are at leisure , on the customs to which young girls are expected to conform in countries more civilized than America . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Thank you , aunt . I will try to do everything I can to please you , while I am a visitor at your house . If I find it impossible to do so , without sacrificing my own self-respect , I shall cease , of course , to be a visitor . They both bow with great dignity . Mme. Fonblanque moves up L. Doct . Dr. Girodet Aside End of the first encounter . There 'll be plenty more ! Rising Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque You will assist M. Fonblanque and myself in receiving our guests , Franois ? Doct .

But I am to be married , in a few weeks , and  --  oh ! I can be your chaperon ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Laughing My chaperon ! Julie . Julie You wo n't be obliged to have your governess with you all the time . Have you a nice governess ? I have . She never tells mamma anything I do . Ha , ha , ha ! I ran away from governess , in Paris , last week , and I was all alone on the streets for nearly two hours ! I was almost run over , once ; but it was such fun ! Ha , ha , ha ! I went into the Champs lyses all by myself ! Governess found me , at last , in front of one of the marionette shows ; she was awfully frightened , but she never said a word about it to mamma . If your governess is n't a nice one , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Thank you , my dear ; I 'm perfectly satisfied with my own governess ; when I do anything wrong , she never calls anyone 's attention to it . But now you must tell me , darling  --  Putting her arm around her waist , and walking to and fro all about your marriage . You must be very happy . Julie . Julie Yes ; I am . My trousseau will be lovely ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Is the gentleman light or dark ? Julie . Julie He has dark hair and eyes , I believe , but I barely noticed him when he called . Kate stops , L.C. , drops her arms from Julie 's waist , and falls back , step by step , staring at her Mamma did n't tell me , till just before he came , that he was to be my husband ; and it seemed so strange , you know . I hardly raised my eyes ; and the room was rather dark , too . My wedding dress is to be white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first train I ever had  --  with sprays of orange blossoms running  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You are going to marry a man you have never seen but once  --  and you did n't look at him , then  --  and the room was dark ! Julie . Julie The count was obliged to leave Paris that afternoon . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! He 's a count . Julie . Julie Yes . A gentleman usually calls at least twice before the contract is signed , but he wrote to father and apologized . He could n't get back until this morning . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Did n't he ever propose to you ? Julie . Julie The count proposed to father for my hand , of course . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Why did n't you tell him to marry your father ? Julie . Julie Ha , ha , ha , ha ! It 's quite immaterial to me which of us he marries . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You do not love him , Julie ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? No ; I 'm only going to marry him ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! That 's all ! Julie . Julie Married ! I can go where I please , and see what I please . I can meet anyone I like  --  and there must be a lot of nice , wicked things in the world that an innocent young girl does n't know anything about . I 'm to be a married woman ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Ah ! I see . A canary to be suddenly released from its cage ! We American birds are bred in the open air , Julie ; we 're a little wild , perhaps , but we choose our own mates ; and we settle down very comfortably in our nests , with them , afterwards . Do girls really marry men , in France , before they have listened to words of tenderness and affection from their lips ? It does n't seem  --  forgive me , Julie  --  but it does n't seem modest and womanly to me for a girl to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  before they have even kissed each other . Julie . Julie Kissed each other ! Oh ! That would be very wrong  --  before marriage . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley If a girl does n't love a man so much she ca n't help kissing him , she ought n't to marry him at all . But you and I ca n't make each other understand these things . We have been brought up so far apart , and in such different countries . We 'll talk about old times , when we were children together ; we understood each other perfectly , then . Is the old garden just as it used to be ? And  --  oh !  --  where is the big boy , now , that used to play with us ? He was three or four years older than we were ; the one that was visiting here . Julie . Julie Henri Saint-Hilaire ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes ; that was his name . Julie . Julie Henry went a way from France soon afterwards ; but he came back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited here , again . Do you remember the old well , Kate , down in the furthest and darkest corner of the garden ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes , indeed , I do , and the story about it . If a girl sees a gentleman 's face beside her own , when she looks down into the water , on a moonlight night  --  that gentleman will be her husband . We girls used to climb up and look over the curb , but , ha , ha , ha , ha ! We always omitted a very important part of the ceremony ; we did n't take the gentleman with us . Julie . Julie I did see a face beside mine , one evening , about two years ago . It was during Henri 's last visit ; the very night before he went away again . Ha , ha , ha ! It was such a lark ! I ran around one side of the chteau , and Henri ran around the other side . Governess saw us coming back , but she never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story of the old well wo n't turn out true in this case , Julie ! Julie . Julie With a shade of momentary sadness Of course not . It could n't turn out true . Henri does n't belong to an old French family , as I do . Then brightening and looking around , laughingly , her fingers to her lips H  --  s  --  h ! I 'll tell you a secret . Henri kissed me at the old well ! Ha , ha , ha ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You said , just now , that it was wrong , in France , to allow a gentleman to kiss you , before you are married to him . Julie . Julie But I 'm not going to marry Henri . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Julie . Julie Besides , there was nobody looking , and that is n't wrong , in any country ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Henri gave me his picture , set around with diamonds , which he had gathered for me , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how he looked two years ago . Takes miniature from her dress , suspended by a ribbon to her neck Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You are wearing that picture , on your breast  --  today ? Today , Julie ? Julie . Julie I 've worn it there ever since Henri gave it to me . I shall tell him so when he comes back to Paris . He 'll be very glad to learn I 've always remembered him . What fun we used to have together . Ha , ha , ha ! Laughing and kissing the picture This looks exactly as he did then . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I hope Henri Saint-Hilaire will never return to Paris . Julie . Julie Oh , yes ; he 's on his way home , now . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Julie ! Earnestly , laying her hand on her arm You must never see him . Julie . Julie Why ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! What queer notions you American girls do have about everything ! Moving R. , upstage When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see each other as often as we like . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Julie ! Julie ! Enter Fonblanque , up L. Fonb . M. Fonblanque Ah , Julie , you are here . Enter the Count de Crebillon , up L. Kate moves down R. Fonblanque crosses to Julie , upstage , L. The Count moves down L. He and Kate see each other .

Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Apologize  --  for  --  his  --  mistake ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque I trust it will be a lesson to you . The mistake was a natural one .

As to the count , himself , believe me , he will treat you , hereafter , with the most profound respect Exits , up L. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley A lesson  --  to me ! Such a man as that is considered a proper husband for a young girl  --  and Julie will sign her marriage contract with the picture of another in her bosom !

Henri Saint-Hilaire Julie  --  to be married to another ! It is for this that I have struggled  --  for this that I have been dreaming of her , in a foreign land  --  for an end like this . Another 's wife ! Julie ! Julie ! Enter Pierre , up R. , with large inkstand and pens . He is followed by an elderly gentleman , the Solicitor , with the contract in his hand .

The Count takes the pen , turns and bows to Julie ; then signs the contract . He then extends the pen to Julie , who moves down and takes it . She sees Henri Julie . Julie Oh ! Henri ! She drops the pen and rushes down , laughing , brightly , and extending her hands You 've come back already . Henri takes her hand , eagerly I 'm very , very glad to see you again . Henri .

Miss Kate Shipley Writing " My own darling papa : I 've just spent three mortal hours at the dinner table , and there 's a grand reception to follow , at eleven . The gentlemen are still at their cigars . I have run away from the ladies to write you a letter in time for tomorrow 's mail . I was trying on all my lovely new dresses this afternoon , so I had n't time to write before . There were sixteen people at dinner  --  m  --  m  --  m  --  Continuing , as if giving words or lines as she writes m  --  m . Awfully full dress . Ambassadors in court costumes , officials in all their decorations , and military officers in their full uniforms  --  m  --  m  --  m  --  m . The young English officer I told you about  --  the one that was visiting here when I first came  --  he has come back from England again , and is now living in Paris . He is here tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Speaks He told me that he could n't stay away from France . It 's very curious  --  I did n't tell him so  --  but , after he returned to London , I found it all I could do to keep away from England . Writes " I am dressed in pistache ottoman silk and velvet to match , and "  --  Speaks Father wo n't understand a word of that . Writes " It cost seven hundred dollars . " Speaks He 'll understand that . I know they 're all awfully shocked at my costume tonight , especially by the diamonds . A young girl in France is n't allowed to wear diamonds at all ; but give any American girl a pair of solitaire earrings , and look at her ears the next time you meet her  --  no matter where . They regard me here as a wild , young Indian princess , anyway . I might as well dress like one and enjoy myself . They ought to be glad I have anything on , except a string of beads around my waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the count , and I 've been the only unmarried girl in the house , aunt has been holding her breath all the time to see what I 'd do next ; an American girl , in Paris , is always doing something next , and its always the very last thing the people here expect a girl to do . They think a young woman ought to be so fresh and " innocent , " as they call it . Well ! I tried as hard as I could to please aunt , at first . I have n't any objection to being innocent for a few months , but , somehow , I ca n't understand French innocence ; and they ca n't understand my sort of innocence . So now I 'm just my own American self ; and that 's all I intend to be . I 'll surprise ' em with a war whoop one of these days . Writes " Papa , dear , they ca n't make me out , here , at all . I 'm shocking everybody awfully , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear aunt reminds me of a very dignified elderly hen with one chicken to look after , and that chicken a duck . My languages come in very nicely with the foreign swells here . I 've been talking German with a grand duke , tonight , and Italian to a prince ; but , whatever language I talk in , I seem to shock people , all the same . " Speaks I verily believe they 're astonished to hear me talk any human language . I 'll learn Choctaw before I come again , and confine myself to it ; that 's the only way an American girl can keep from shocking people in Europe . As to my other accomplishments  --  ha , ha , ha ! When I played one of Beethoven 's sonatas in B flat , the other day , that fat marchioness nearly choked with astonishment ; and I ended it off so suddenly with " Yankee Doodle " that she nearly tipped over backwards on the little Spanish count . If she had , there 'd ' a been one less foreign ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the life of me , I could n't help telling him , when he complimented me on my playing a classical selection , that I picked it all up in Europe during the last six months , and that New York ladies never played on anything at home but a tom-tom ; and they went about barefooted , except on Sunday , and then they went to church in moccasins , embroidered with beads . Writes " The worst of it is , papa , they believe everything one says about America , and I ca n't help telling them awful fibs . I 'd die if I did n't . " Speaks I believe that nice , old , French field-marshal half suspected I was n't telling him the exact truth , tonight , when he got his wig twisted over his left ear , and I tried to make it pleasant for him by saying that nearly all American gentlemen over thirty years old wore wigs , because they usually scalped each other before that age . I 've often heard father talk about his best friend being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right if I 'd stopped there , for it did n't surprise him a bit ; it seemed to be exactly what he expected Americans to do to each other . To save my life , I could n't help going on till I thought of something that would surprise him . When I told him that an American kept his eye on the top of his enemy 's head every time he met him with his hat off , and as soon as his hair began to grow thin he scalped him at once before it was too late , the old gentleman did have a puzzled expression , then . Writes " If anyone ever tells them the truth about some things I 've told ' em here , there 'll be war between France and America . " Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha ! Leaning back and laughing very heartily .

Kate . Miss Kate Shipley When you left us , captain , it seemed as though I was further from my own country than ever ; and when you came back to live in Paris , the Atlantic Ocean did n't seem half as wide .

Dr. Girodet Try to forget your sorrows in your profession , Henri . Be a hermit , hereafter , in the modern Religion of Science . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire My dear , old friend . With a warm grasp of the hand . He moves R. , pauses at door . Aside The count will meet me ! Exits , up R. , through apartment Doct . Dr. Girodet If I can prevent this duel , it will be the first time the Count de Crebillon has ever hesitated to meet a man who has once aroused his passion or offended his honor .

Going to him Did you hear that scream ? Doct . Dr. Girodet Yes . It was startling at first , but I once heard a similar scream in the garden . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley What was it ? Doct . Dr. Girodet The footman was kissing one of the maids . Kate draws back If he 'd been murdering her , she could n't have thrown more agony into her voice . When a woman screams , she screams . The girl did n't seem a bit grateful when I rescued her . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Captain Gregory has run back to see what it was . Doct . Dr. Girodet He was in the garden , with you ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes . Looking down Doct . Dr. Girodet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain wo n't meet one of the maids . Some of them are very pretty . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley But , doctor , I ca n't help feeling there was something more in that cry than you imagine . A few moments ago , as I was picking out the path among the trees , I saw a woman peering into the house . Doct . Dr. Girodet Indeed ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley She was not dressed like a servant , so far as I could tell in the shadow of the tree under which she was standing . A ray of moonlight fell across her face . Our eyes met for a second , and she suddenly disappeared . When I heard that scream , just now , doctor , the picture of that woman 's face seemed as clear in my mind as when she was looking into my eyes . Doct . Dr. Girodet What was the face like ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley It was pale and thin ; a hard , cold face , yet it must have been beautiful once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Tall and slender . Enter the Count , from garden , up L. Doct . Dr. Girodet Ah ! Count ! You were in the garden  --  you heard the voice just now ? Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Yes . I presume it was merely some poor wretch in charge of the police  --  Walking down L. in the street beyond . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Do you think that was it , doctor . Doct . Dr. Girodet I dare say . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Poor creature ! I pity her . Going up ; then , suddenly , aside I must get Pierre to run out and post my letter to father , and I 'll put in another postscript . I 'll ask papa for his consent . I 'm quite sure , now , the captain will propose to me before the next steamer . Exits , up R. , through apartments Doct . Dr. Girodet Count , you have arranged for a meeting with Henri . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sha n't give you much trouble with the boy . I 'll only wound him slightly  --  in the arm or the wrist . Doct . Dr. Girodet If you and Henri Saint-Hilaire meet , you will not separate until one of you has received a fatal wound . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Indeed ! It is a serious passion with him , then ? If the young man insists , of course , we must carry it through in his own way . Then , with sinister significance Do you think there is any doubt as to which of us will be wounded fatally ? Doct . Dr. Girodet Not the slightest doubt . You are one of the coolest , most experienced and most formidable duellists in France ; he is a young student of science , whose only knowledge of the weapons you will use is such as every young Frenchman acquires in the ordinary course of his education . But there is enough blood upon your soul , already , count .

With relief I am in no humor tonight to talk of these subjects . Doct . Dr. Girodet M. Saint-Hilaire will wait to hear from you until noon tomorrow . He has given me his promise that if he does not hear from you by that time he will leave France , at once . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Very well . Settle it as you like . I will not challenge him . Exits , R.1.E . The Doctor looks after him a moment , then walks up L. He looks out to garden ; glances back at the door , R.1.E . Doct .

Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I wonder where Miss Kate is ? I 've been trying to arrange the matter of our marriage for the last six months . My creditors are getting anxious . I do n't understand this American way of conducting matrimonial affairs . Our own way is much simpler . One arranges it all with the girl 's parents , and that 's the end of it . Enter Kate , up R. , from apartment . She runs across , upstage , looking out , L. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The captain has n't returned yet .

Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Here ! Alone ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes ! Alone ! I wo n't hurt you . Sits , L.C. I 'm not afraid of being alone with a gentleman , and my father is n't afraid of having me . Aside If my reputation ca n't stand that , I 'm perfectly willing to lose it , and the first French woman that finds it is welcome to it . I dare say she 'll need it . Aloud Sit down . Duc .

If we were all on the same side of the ocean we could get on faster . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley When you first fell in love with me , duc , we were three thousand miles apart . I appreciate the compliment very highly . Of course , your interest in me increased very rapidly as the steamer on which I left New York approached the coast of Europe , at the rate of eighteen miles an hour . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I  --  I do n't quite follow you , Miss Kate . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Concerning my dowry  --  Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Ah  --  yes ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Now , you do follow me . What do you think your title , including yourself , is worth , cash ! Will two million francs do ? Father will pay you that amount . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Two million francs ! Rising Kate . Miss Kate Shipley On the day you and I are married . Duc . Le Duc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! No ! Rising We can not possibly sign the contract yet , duc . Being an American lady , I must insist on following the customs of my own country . Before a marriage contract can be duly ratified in America , there must be certain preliminary formalities , which propriety there demands . The gentleman is expected to make love to the lady , and to win her heart . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I 'm sure I shall be delighted to pay the most devoted attention to you , Miss Kate . I will make love to you with pleasure . Approaching her and attempting to press her hand . She withdraws it Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Not personally , duc ! You misunderstand me . A lady and gentleman , in America , always make love to each other through their lawyers ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Their  --  lawyers ? Oh ! Kate .

Walks up Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Aside , down R. What a very remarkable country ! There are so many queer things in America . Half the gentlemen in the smoking-room had something extraordinary to tell about America , and they all said Miss Kate told them so . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Looking out . Aside The captain is coming up the path . Aloud I do n't think it is best for us to be alone , together , any longer , duc . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque No . I will retire . Rising ; then aside , going I wonder how long it takes a lawyer to win a lady 's heart ? Exits , R. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Captain Gregory wo n't need a solicitor ! Looking out ; then turns downstage He was just going to ask me to be his wife , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together  --  his eyes were looking straight up into mine , from the water  --  when I ran away from him . The word " yes " was so close to my lips , if I had n't run away , I 'd have answered him before he 'd asked me the question . And I had just let him catch me again , under the old oak with mistletoe on it , when we were interrupted . I 'll let him finish the question , now . Ha , ha , ha ! A woman in love is like a girl playing kiss-in-the-ring ; she runs away until she 's afraid she wo n't be caught ; then she stops . Dropping on ottoman , R.C. I 've stopped . Folding her hands , demurely , as if waiting . Enter the Captain , up L. , from garden . He looks at Kate , then takes a book from the table , L.C. , looks at her again , sits on ottoman , L.C. , opens the book . She looks at him I hope he has n't stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captain ?

That is such a curious passage . I marked that double , you see . Capt . Captain John Gregory Oh ! It was you ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Eh ! Then dropping her head Yes , I did it . Aside All the parts marked are about how people get married . Capt . Captain John Gregory Aside I never yet took up a girl 's book that everything like that was n't marked in it . Perhaps this will tell a fellow how the French fellows manage it , when they 're in love . It may help me . Glances at her , then reads aloud " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again you must get a mutual friend to make the first advance , or you may get the clergyman , or the family lawyer . " Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Capt . Captain John Gregory An officer in Her Majesty 's service might as well ask the clergyman or a family lawyer to charge a battery for him . But the French way is n't so bad , after all . Miss Kate  --  Rising I  --  I wish I had someone  --  a lawyer or a clergyman , or something  --  Approaching her to  --  to say  --  exactly what I want to say to you . I 'm only a soldier , you know . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Did you ever read Longfellow 's poem , " Miles Standish " ?

Capt . Captain John Gregory Oh ! Did he ? Walks away , L. , thinking Kate . Miss Kate Shipley But , captain , he came back again  --  Capt . Captain John Gregory Returning to her , quickly And he told her he loved her  --  I 'm sure he did ! I love you , Miss Kate , with my whole heart . She starts to her feet , turns towards him with her eyes dropped , then extends both hands , frankly Kate . Miss Kate Shipley And I love you  --  He seizes her hands , eagerly too earnestly and too sincerely to disguise it . I know that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am very , very glad you love me . Capt .

Discovered : Julie , standing up C. , her head resting , wearily , against the casement of the bay window . Julie . Julie The very spots of sunshine on the grass seem like shadows this morning . I am growing blind  --  blind to everything that used to make life beautiful and bright . Life ! What is life , to cling to ? What is life , now , that I should fear to lose it ? I dreamed , last night , that I was sleeping , and Henri was planting flowers in the earth above me ; I was sleeping so quietly and peacefully . She reaches up and picks a small branch of leaves falling through the casement from a vine He and I planted this vine together . Walking down I used to scold the gardener if he ever touched it . One day , I overheard the old man say that he feared his little mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know what he meant then , but I do , now  --  I know , now ! In chair , L.C. , dropping her head onto her arms on the table , and sobbing . Enter the Count , R.1.E . He stops , R. , looking at her Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon In tears , madame ? Julie looks up at him , brushes her eyes , quickly , and rises Julie . Julie You have returned to the chteau earlier this morning than usual , monsieur . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon You were weeping because I did not return still sooner . Crossing to her You pay me a very high compliment ; the more so as I spend so many of my nights away ; and I frequently do not return at all the next day . But , now I think of it a second time , it is just possible that your tears have not been flowing for me . Pardon me . He takes her wrist in his left hand , quietly , and is about to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles , very slightly . He presses her wrist , firmly , looking at her ; then takes the leaves from her fingers , turning away . She starts , as if to take them again , but restrains herself It is late for the dew to be lingering on the leaves , and yet there are drops upon these . I fear I was flattering myself ; perhaps your tears were falling for another . Pray , do not check them on my account , madame . We , all of us , have sad memories ; but we should feel sadder still to lose them . Their roots must be moistened with our tears , now and then . But the autumn is at hand , and every leaf must soon fall  --  Picking the leaves off and dropping them to the floor one after another . Memories , too , must fall away , one by one , from our lives . Turns , R. I am sorry that I disturbed your thoughts at such a sacred moment . I came to offer you an apology . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupt you and M. Henri Saint-Hilaire in one of those emergencies when every considerate husband is expected to be elsewhere . But even the most scrupulous of husbands will make a mistake , now and then , unless he is given fair notice that his presence is undesirable . I trust you will forgive my indiscretion . There was no intentional breach of etiquette , on my part , I assure you . Julie . Julie I beg of you , monsieur , to say whatever you have to say to me at once . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon I will detain you only a moment . At the earnest solicitation of Dr. Girodet , after the incident last evening , I consented to  --  to give the young man his life . Julie . Julie Dr. Girodet sent me word that the matter had been settled  --  amicably . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon I claim no merit for my magnanimity , however . M. Saint-Hilaire is to leave France today . Julie . Julie Yes . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon And I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife  --  if he is five thousand miles away . Perhaps it would be unreasonable to object to my wife 's devotion to him  --  even to a former lover  --  at such a distance . But I have one thing to say to you , madame . I have never dreamed , for a moment , that I was the happy possessor of your affections . And , if I remember correctly , I have never spoken to you of love . Julie . Julie Never . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Pardon my frankness if I say that I have no interest in that subject . Whatever my faults may be  --  and I do not profess to be perfect  --  I am not a hypocrite . Julie . Julie You have never deceived me , in that respect . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon But I have an interest , madame  --  a very serious interest  --  in my honor as a husband  --  before the world . That is in your keeping . I shall protect the name I bear  --  at all hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of cowardice has never been there . Do not forget that you , also , bear my name . Exits , up L. Julie . Julie His honor as a husband ! His name ! I never should have borne it ! Father ! Mother ! You have given me a greater burden than my poor weak nature can bear . Oh , that my dream last night were true . I long to be asleep  --  asleep . Why should I not be ? She sees the leaves on the floor , picks them up , quickly and nervously ; goes to door Henri leaves me today  --  forever ! Exits , R.1.E . Enter Mme. Fonblanque , up L. , in elegant morning wrapper Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I have not recovered , yet , from the shock which I received last night . If I had seen Julie , herself , kissing a gentleman , I should have been less bewildered . Julie , at least , is a married woman , and has the privilege of deciding upon her own course in matters of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an action is unpardonable ! Down L.C. Enter Fonblanque , up L. , in morning wrapper Fonb . M. Fonblanque Good morning , Mathilde . Kisses her hand Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Good morning , my husband . Fonb . M. Fonblanque I trust you have slept well , after the dinner and the reception last evening . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I have been somewhat troubled in my sleep . Fonb . M. Fonblanque I am very sorry . I have passed a restless night , myself . Moving R. I ca n't get it out of my head that we forgot to invite some very important personage , in high position , to our reception . It has been quite like a nightmare to me . I feel certain that some calamity has occurred , or is about to do so . And among my letters , this morning , I find a note from the prefect of police . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque What can the prefect have to say to you ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque He requests me to meet him , in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque What can it mean ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque I have been asking myself the same question ever since I opened the note . It is couched in the most courteous terms possible , of course , to one of my social position . But it is so particularly polite . I was quite startled when I read it . If I had committed a murder , the authorities could n't have treated me with more respectful consideration . It seems that Dr. Girodet had something to do with the matter ; his name is mentioned by the prefect . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Possibly that may explain his very sudden disappearance last evening . I saw nothing of him after about eleven o'clock . But I supposed a professional engagement had called him away . Fonb . M. Fonblanque You , also , have been troubled in your sleep , Mathilde ? Mme.

Fonblanque I can not believe it ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque With my own eyes ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque A young girl can not possibly kiss a gentleman  --  in France . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque She learned how to do it in another country . What is worse , Phillippe , she told me , to my very face , and in his presence , that she loved Captain Gregory . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Mathilde ! Dropping into chair , R.C. Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque What is still worse , she 's going to marry him ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque And discard a duke ! I can believe anything of the girl after that . Poor Victorien ! Our cousin had set his heart upon her fortune  --  I would say  --  upon Kate . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I had looked forward to their marriage with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given the child my blessing , in the absence of her father . How much is it that the duke owes us , now ? Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Three hundred thousand francs . Enter Kate , R.1.E. , dressed for the carriage . She is adjusting one glove , the other in her hand . Mme. Fonblanque sits , L.C. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Aunt , dear , good morning ; uncle ! I was dressing to go out when Pierre brought me your message , or I should have come down at once . I am going to make a call , in Paris . Julie has kindly lent me her carriage this morning . What did you wish to say to me , aunt ? Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I wish to speak with you , seriously , about the very remarkable incident which came under my personal observation last evening . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Remarkable , aunt ? A gentleman , whom I love very dearly , proposed to me ; I accepted him , and afterwards I kissed him . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The next time I see Captain Gregory I shall do it again . Here , I believe , the lady waits until she is married before she kisses the man she loves , or any other gentleman . Fonb . M. Fonblanque You have so far forgotten your duty to us , your present guardians , as to  --  to choose a husband for yourself ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes , uncle . I have chosen for myself ; and I much prefer to kiss the man I love , before marriage , to kissing one I do not love , afterwards . We are very particular about what is proper in a woman . We do not think that even a marriage ceremony , without love , can make a kiss modest or womanly . I have something serious to say to you , aunt . Do you remember , on the day I first arrived , I said that , if I ever found it impossible to please you , without sacrificing my own self-respect , I should cease to be a visitor at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am very sorry to say it  --  but that has come ! I have followed the dictates of my own heart ; you take a view of what I have done which neither my father nor I can accept ; and my self-respect compels me to leave the Chteau Fonblanque . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I will not say , then , what I had intended , when I sent for you  --  that it is no longer desirable for you to remain here . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Thank you , aunt , for not saying it . I was about to call on the friends from New York , the family I crossed the ocean with ; they have returned to Paris . I know they will be glad to have me with them , at their hotel . I will go there , tomorrow , with your permission . Fonb . M. Fonblanque But what may your father  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Anything I do will suit papa ; it always does . Aunt , dear , forgive me for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard at first , to act as if I was n't an American girl , for your sake . But I am , aunt , and I could n't help being one  --  if  --  if all the armies in Europe surrounded me , with their bayonets pointed at the prettiest bonnet I have . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Sometimes I 've been a very wicked girl , too ; but I could n't help that , either . That was n't because I 'm an American girl , aunt . It was just because I 'm a girl . No girl can help that  --  I do n't care where she was born ; only girls in different countries have different ways of being wicked . We American girls have discovered some new ways ; that 's all . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque You have acted very wrongly , indeed . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Our first trouble of all , aunt , was about a dressing-maid . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque You refused to have one . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was dressing . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque She should have accompanied you whenever you walked out , and you would not allow her to do so . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I found that I did n't care to be responsible for her morals . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Julie 's governess took charge of you , at my own request , after Julie was married . Madame Rabeau informed me , in less than a week , that you had taken charge of her . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I was compelled to , aunt ; I saw that she needed careful watching . Besides , I used to give her lessons in the studies you asked her to teach me . But still  --  as I said before  --  I have been very wicked . I 've told more fibs since I 've been in Paris than half a dozen girls ought to tell in the same length of time . I do n't tell fibs , at all , in New York , now . But , somehow , when one of us American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe everything one says about things at home , how can any girl that likes fun help telling fibs ? Please say to Field Marshal Corlette , uncle , that he need n't be afraid of going to America for fear of losing all his wigs . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Wigs ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I 'm afraid he got an idea from me that it 's dangerous to wear hair at all in the United States . It is n't dangerous , uncle , except when its natural . And I told the Archduke Contagowskoff that I never saw a dinner party with more than one course until I came to Europe . That is n't true , uncle ; we often have two courses , and once I was at a dinner where they had three . The Prince de Molzrieaux remarked to me , last night , that he hoped some day to go to America and shoot buffaloes . I told him there were plenty in Central Park . That is true . There are two buffaloes in the park ; and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression . The Spanish ambassador is a widower , and he does n't intend to remain so , I believe ; he told me he had heard that American gentlemen had an enormous amount of money . I said I did n't know anything about that , but when a New York girl wanted some pin money , she telegraphed to her father , and he sent it up in a wagon . Later in the evening he asked me for my father 's address . Tell him for me , uncle , before he has time to write that I  --  I was  --  exaggerating  --  a little . Papa never sent me anything but a handcart full in all my life .

She stops , C. , as he crosses , R. , and sees the miniature in his hand dangling by the ribbon . She speaks , aside He has Julie 's miniature of Henri in his hand . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon You are looking at this trinket . I just picked it up on the grand staircase . It is a portrait of M. Saint-Hilaire . He may as well take it to South America with him .

Comte Florian de Crebillon A gentleman does not give his portrait , framed in gold and set in diamonds , to a mere friend . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I am very glad you have found it . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon M. Saint-Hilaire is fortunate . And Captain Gregory ? Madame Fonblanque informed me , last evening , that you had chosen him as a husband ; I congratulate the captain , especially on the fact that his rival is going away before your marriage . Husbands are not always so fortunate . Permit me . Offering the locket Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Taking it Thank you . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon When M.

On the contrary  --  I know you perfectly . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Aside Oh ! if there was someone near to resent his insolence ! Aloud You say you know me , count ; know this  --  I hate you ! Exits , up L. Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Ha , ha , ha , ha ! That woman would be worth fighting for . I 've never quite forgiven the girl for playing the prude with me so successfully , when we first met . She compelled me to apologize to my respected father-in-law , on her account ; and she has been laughing in her sleeve at me all the time ; carrying on her intrigue under my very eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is merely one among other ladies in the circle of his fancy . I mistook a boy 's passing fancy for the serious passion of a man . Dr. Girodet was wrong . The young Lothario would have been quite contented with a slight wound in his arm . I might arrange a meeting with him , yet . No , I 'll keep my word with the doctor . Besides , it 's Captain Gregory 's turn now . Walking , L. , laughing , lightly I 'll not interrupt Miss Kate and M. Saint-Hilaire . Stops suddenly , with a change of expression Or was the girl lying to me ?

Doors at R.C. and L.C. , set at an angle of about 45 degrees , half facing the audience . The door at R.C. , well upstage ; that at L.C. , about 3d entrance . The furniture and ornaments of the room are such as are suitable to a rich , young , French gentleman and scientist who has gathered many objects of curiosity and scientific interest in foreign lands . Table up C. ; chair near table . A long , low ottoman or lounge , R. An ottoman , down L. Duelling rapiers crossed above window , at back , with wire masks , pads , gloves , etc .

When we left Brazil , seven months ago , M. Henri said : " Andre ! We will start for Paris in two hours . " Two hours ! And fifteen boxes of curiosities and scientific rubbish , besides our portmanteaus ! Thank Heaven ! We 're going to leave all the scientific rubbish behind this time . But wherever master is , he 'll need his fencing tools , of course . A pair of rapiers in a gentleman 's room serve to defend his honor by implication , so to speak . During the above he has got the various articles from the wall and descended , placing the ladder near door , and the masks , gloves , etc. , and one of the rapiers on the table , C.

I might have saved her , or the count delivered me , from a future that both of us dread to meet . Puts down the rapier and looks at his watch Twelve o'clock . There is no hope , now ; and I can only keep my promise , and my resolution , broken so often , to leave France . Dropping upon ottoman , down L. How vividly I remember the day I left Paris , two years ago . Looks up over his shoulder at the door , R. Come in ! Listens I was mistaken .

The door slowly opens and Julie enters . Henri stops , L.C. , looking at her . She enters , timidly , her hand on the side of the door , her eyes dropped . She moves down R.C. , her eyes still fixed on the floor , and with faltering steps . She at last glances up at him and moves quickly to the ottoman , falling upon it on her face Julie . Julie Do n't think that I 'm a bad , wicked woman , Henri , but I shall die if you leave me with him . I could n't help coming to you ; I could n't help it . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire Julie !

Julie I have taken my choice between a life which I could endure no longer  --  and your contempt . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire My  --  contempt ! Julie . Julie You can never love me now as you used to . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire I would not lose , for all the world , Julie , the respect for you which has always been a part of my love .

Julie Since we parted , last night , my thoughts have wavered a thousand times . When I left home , today , I did not know where I was going . It was only from a last , sudden , desperate thought that I came to you . When I knocked at your door , the world became darker than it had ever been before . I seemed to be extinguishing the only light that had been left to me . But you do still love me ? Turning to him Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire Seizing her hand Never so much as I do now . She kisses his hands , passionately , then suddenly tears herself away from him and starts up towards door What will you do ? He springs after her and detains her Julie .

Comte Florian de Crebillon I can quite believe that my visit was unexpected , M. Saint-Hilaire . Glances at table I see you have weapons at hand ; not with any hostile intent , I trust . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire I did expect to use them . I suppose that I should have seen your own representative before this time . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon You did not meet Dr. Girodet again , last evening ? Walking down , R. Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire He was called away , suddenly , I believe . Count .

Saint-Hilaire that I can be in earnest , also  --  in deadly earnest ; I have found a lady 's glove upon your threshold . Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire Well , monsieur ? Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon And the carriage of the Countess de Crebillon is waiting upon the street below  --  at your door ! I will drag my wife from your room , monsieur ! Henri . Henri Saint-Hilaire Pardon me , count  --  Moving to before door , L. but you shall not enter my private apartment . Count .

A scream is heard within the room Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Aha , monsieur ! He attacks Henri with great vigor and angry determination . A knock at door , R. The combat continues . The knock repeated . Enter Captain Gregory Capt . Captain John Gregory Fencing , gentlemen ? They stop , suddenly , dropping the points of their weapons Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Walking down L. Monsieur Saint-Hilaire and I are practicing , captain . Capt . Captain John Gregory Without your masks , or the pads and gloves . It 's dangerous sport .

The count and I  --  were  --  so interested  --  we both forgot ourselves for a moment . Capt . Captain John Gregory Feeling Henri 's side and putting his handkerchief to it You Frenchmen find as much amusement in this sort o ' thing , I dare say , as we Englishmen do in punching each other 's heads . Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon I will get something for your wound , monsieur , and you will need water . I can find it in this room , I suppose ? Moving to door , L.C. Henri .

He snatches up the rapier and springs toward the door . The Captain seizes him and forces him by main strength back into the chair , holding him firmly as he proceeds Capt . Captain John Gregory I think I understand the situation ; it 's all in dead earnest , I see . But there sha n't be murder on your soul , Henri , so long as I 'm a stronger man than you are ; and I 'm likely to be for some time to come . The Captain stands with his back to R. , as he holds Henri . The Count reappears , L.C. , coming in backwards and bowing Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Mademoiselle ! Enter Kate , L.C. I ask a thousand pardons ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Captain Gregory  --  here ! The Captain turns and sees Kate ; falls back a few steps , R. Capt . Captain John Gregory Kate ! Count .

The Count stands down R. , tapping one hand with the glove Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon Ha , ha , ha ! A pretty little glove ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I must have dropped it  --  after I left the carriage . May I trouble you for it ? Count . Comte Florian de Crebillon I am almost tempted to keep it . I envy you , monsieur ; or perhaps I ought to envy Captain Gregory . The hand to which this glove belongs has been promised to him in marriage . He will be obliged to share its caresses with other men .

Comte Florian de Crebillon By all means ; I would not intrude for the world . One serious word to you , mademoiselle ; you will please not borrow the Countess de Crebillon 's carriage , with the family crest on its panels , the next time you have a disreputable intrigue with a gentleman . Whatever ideas of propriety may happen to prevail among the ladies of America  --  Capt . Captain John Gregory Stepping forward Permit me to return Miss Shipley her glove , count . Count .

With a burst of anger I have had enough insults from you , count , and from your race . Moving towards him I have a protector , now . With all my heart , I hope he will kill you ! Count .

Henri falls backwards , towards the audience , at full length . She turns Henri ! Henri ! She falls to her knees at his side , her hands on his heart ACT IV . Scene : The Chteau Fonblanque . Same scene as that of Act I. The double doors open , showing drawing-room at back , and the furniture rearranged . The large table up R. , with small chair at the left . Armchair at right of table . Armchair up L. , near mantel . The other pieces of Act I , to taste . Enter the Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque , through drawing-room , his hat in his hand . Duc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He has taken his nap at this hour , regularly , for the last twenty years . I wonder if he , also , is one of the parties to the duel . His name was n't mentioned at the club , though nearly everybody else 's was . Enter Mme. Fonblanque , R.1.E. , in elegant wrapper Ah ! Mathilde ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Victorien ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Sorry to disturb you at this hour ; Pierre said you were dressing for the evening ; but  --  do you know anything about the affair this afternoon ? Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque What " affair " ? Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Ah ! You have n't heard of it at all , yet ? There are all sorts of rumors at the club . Somebody has been fighting a duel with somebody else . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Indeed ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Whether anybody killed anybody or not , nobody can find out , but everybody says somebody was killed . The police arrived on the spot just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their regular instructions . I called at the count 's private apartments , in the city , on the way here , but all I could get out of the janitor was , the physician had left instructions that he was n't to be disturbed . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The count was concerned in it ? Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque A gentleman at the club was looking out of the window , and he saw Dr. Girodet going rapidly by in a carriage , and the count lay back on the seat with his face very pale . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Really , duc , I trust that nothing serious has happened to my dear son-in-law , the count . You have aroused my curiosity . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque So it has mine . Captain Gregory 's name has also been mentioned in connection with the affair , but that is evidently an error . A member of the club told me that one of the other members had been told by another gentleman that he had just seen the captain walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join him in a drive to the Bois , but he thanked him , kindly , and said he wished to finish his cigar . M. Saint-Hilaire was one of the principals in the duel . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Henri ! Very earnestly Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Dr. Poncilett was called to attend him . One always gets the latest news at the club , but it sometimes requires deep thought to understand it . It 's very difficult to put this and that together . The count was wounded with a broadsword . M. Saint-Hilaire was shot . They were fighting each other . I have it all on the highest possible authority . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque I hope Henri 's life is not in danger ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Let me offer you my sympathy . I have heard that Henri 's father and you were deeply in love with each other , before you were married . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Considerations of family made our union impossible . But  --  H-s-h  --  Looking around M. Fonblanque knows nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicitly , Mathilde . The same individual can hardly expect to monopolize a woman 's hand and her fortunes , and also her affections . I 'm sure my cousin Phillippe is too well-bred to be so unreasonable . Enter Fonblanque , up R. Fonb . M. Fonblanque Ah , Cousin Victorien ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Phillippe , have you heard anything about  --  Fonb . M. Fonblanque It has come to you already , then ? Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I was just telling Mathilde  --  Fonb . M. Fonblanque I dare say everyone at the club is talking about it . The simple truth is this ; it is a mere ordinary case of suicide . Duc . and Mme. F. Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque and Mme. Fonblanque Suicide ! Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Henri Saint-Hilaire ! Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque The count ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque They have nothing to do with the matter . The prefect of police  --  Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I understood the police did n't interfere . Fonb . M. Fonblanque On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have managed it with the utmost discretion . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque The duel ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque I received a notice from the prefect this morning . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Oh , yes ; what was it , Phillippe ? Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque It occurred this afternoon . Fonb . M. Fonblanque It occurred last night . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I  --  I wonder if we are talking about the same thing . Fonb . M. Fonblanque The prefect was extremely polite to me , and he assured me he was conducting the investigation as a mere matter of routine formality . There are half a dozen similar cases in Paris every day . In the present instance , the woman  --  Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Ah ! We had n't got to the woman , in the club , yet , but we were all looking for her . Fonb . M. Fonblanque A total stranger took the liberty of committing suicide in the gardens of the Chteau Fonblanque last evening . Mme. F. Mme. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact was discovered by Dr. Girodet , about half past ten . He communicated with the police at once . The prefect is a personal friend of his , and he was considerate enough to conduct the affair without disturbing us or our guests , Mathilde . It was extremely kind on his part . It would have been very embarrassing , indeed . It annoys me exceedingly as it is . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Do they know who it was ? Fonb . M. Fonblanque There was nothing whatever to identify the person , and the prefect trusts that I shall hear nothing more of the unfortunate incident . I am sorry it has got to the club , cousin . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque It has n't . I was speaking of another matter entirely . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Victorien was saying that our son-in-law , the count  --  Fonb . M. Fonblanque Oh ! by the bye , I rode to the Bois after I left the prefect . The Marquis de Polignac leaned over from his carriage and remarked that he hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Count de Crebillon had been seriously wounded in a duel . You can imagine my feelings as a father . After a turn or two more in the Bois , I told the coachman to drive home , at once . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I believe the count is seriously wounded . Fonb . M. Fonblanque I wish you would learn something definite about it . I 'll go and take my afternoon nap ; it is two hours after my usual time . If anything of special interest transpires , Mathilde , you may have the servant wake me . Exits yawning , R.1.E . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque M. Fonblanque and I are both very anxious about the count . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I 'll drive down to the club again . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Do , Victorien . I 'll finish my dressing , now . Going Au revoir , cousin . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque Au revoir . Exit Mme. Fonblanque , R.1.E . I feel anxious about the count , too . I bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he offered to lay me three to one against her the first time I raced her . I 'd like to get a few points about her . I hope he is n't seriously wounded . It 's very queer , but I never do buy a horse from a man that he does n't offer me the odds against it . Going up L. Enter Kate , through drawing-room , L. She moves in rapidly , coming down R.C. , without seeing the Duc , who stops , up L.C. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The servants here have heard nothing . Five hours of agony and suspense since he left to meet the most dangerous duellist in Paris ! I could not stay longer with Julie . Perhaps uncle or aunt have  --  Going , R. Duc .

Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I 'll return presently , with the exact facts . Exits up L. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley What torture ! I can learn nothing . The captain has not returned to his apartments . I felt like a mad woman in the street , and everything going on as if his life were not at stake . I have nowhere to turn . Dropping into the chair , up L. Enter Captain Gregory , with Pierre , in drawing-room Capt . Ca ptain John Gregory On second thoughts , Pierre  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Ah ! Capt . Captain John Gregory I 'll not disturb M. Fonblanque  --  Walking down R.C. if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shipley Alive  --  and safe ! Capt . Captain John Gregory I will leave a note . I merely dropped in to pay my respects before leaving for London tonight , and to see Miss Shipley . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley To see me ! Capt . Captain John Gregory Has she returned to the chteau ? Pierre . Pierre Ma'm'selle is here , monsieur . Capt . Captain John Gregory Oh ! I beg your pardon . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Captain  --  Gregory ! Capt .

A note ! and I am absolutely dying to know what 's happened . Capt . Captain John Gregory Writing " My dear M. Fonblanque : Being compelled to return to London this evening , I dropped in to say good-by to Madame Fonblanque and yourself , and to apologize for shooting your son-in-law . With warm regards to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I do remain . The count is a good shot . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Aside I 'm choking ! Aloud Captain ! Capt . Captain John Gregory One moment . Addresses it Pierre , you may give this to M. Fonblanque , with my card  --  Rising but do n't disturb him . Exit Pierre , up R. , with note Yes ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley And you are unhurt , thank Heaven ! But I hope you have n't killed him . Capt . Captain John Gregory I really ca n't say . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley He  --  fell ? Capt . Captain John Gregory Yes . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley He may be dying  --  now ! Capt . Captain John Gregory Possibly . But I 'm under the impression he is n't . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You fought with swords ! Capt . Captain John Gregory No . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Pistols ! Capt . Captain John Gregory Yes . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You met in the field , your seconds gave the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The count was wounded  --  go on . Capt . Captain John Gregory That 's all . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! You Englishman ! You 'd let a woman die gasping for knowledge . Do tell me something about it ! Capt . Captain John Gregory You 've told me . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You have heard nothing since ? Capt . Captain John Gregory No . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! John ! To think that you may have killed a man . Capt . Captain John Gregory I 'm sorry to say that I may have killed a number of men , while I was fighting for my country , when I did n't see half as much good to be gained by it , though the members of the British Cabinet did . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Captain Gregory , you have risked your life , today , to defend me from an insult , because I was a woman ; but you found me in a  --  in a most compromising position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I need not say  --  that  --  you are  --  free  --  from your obligations to me . Capt . Captain John Gregory Oh ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Of course  --  our  --  our engagement is at an end . Capt . Captain John Gregory Ah ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley After what has happened , there can be  --  no further relations  --  between us , of any kind . Capt . Captain John Gregory M  --  m . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Aside He might show some interest in the subject , even if he does despise me . Capt . Captain John Gregory You were in the private apartment of another gentleman . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Yes , I was ; and that ought to excite some kind of emotion in any girl 's lover , even if he is an Englishman ! Capt . Captain John Gregory You were there  --  with the Countess de Crebillon . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You know the truth ? Capt . Captain John Gregory I know it now . Kate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've just told me . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Capt . Captain John Gregory I guessed it was the countess . I 've been long enough in France for that , and I thought you wanted the count out of the way at that particular moment . But I knew one thing absolutely  --  whoever it was , you were not there alone . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Why did you know that ? Advancing Capt . Captain John Gregory Approaching her , looking full into her eyes and speaking very earnestly Because my confidence in you is as strong as my love ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Ah ! Clasping her hands , joyously You fought the count because you believed in me ? Capt . Captain John Gregory I 'm too good an Englishman to risk my life for a woman that is n't worth fighting for ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Jack ! Resting her head on his breast Capt . Captain John Gregory You remarked just now that our engagement was at an end . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , with his head between her hands , looking into his face . She suddenly gives a little cry and leads him down by the left ear , which is tipped with black court-plaster You are wounded ! Capt . Captain John Gregory I forgot to mention that . The count 's bullet took the tip of my ear off . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You were so near to death as that ? My own pet British Lion ! Embracing him , then resting her head on his shoulder . He takes the glove from a pocket Capt . Captain John Gregory I 've brought this back to you . Holding it up Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You may keep it now , John . Capt . Captain John Gregory Until the hand that fits it is mine ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley My knight ! Capt . Captain John Gregory When I looked at that on the way to the field , I felt somehow , that the count was in danger . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The count ! Drawing back Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Capt . Captain John Gregory I hope so , too . Enter the Doctor , in drawing-room , L. Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Dr. Girodet ! The Captain glances up and walks , L. , to mantel Now we shall know the worst . I dare not ask him ! Walking up L.C. Enter Fonblanque , up R. Fonb . M. Fonblanque Ah ! captain , you are still here . The servant has just given me your note and card . Capt . Captain John Gregory I asked him not to disturb you . Enter Mme. Fonblanque , R.1.E. , now in afternoon dress Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Captain ! Capt . Captain John Gregory Madame ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque Mathilde , I have just discovered that we omitted to send an invitation , for last evening , to the Austrian ambassador . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Is it possible ! Very anxiously How very , very unfortunate ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque It has quite broken up my afternoon nap . I could n't sleep at all . It was you , by the bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon . Sitting , R.C. Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The captain ! Pleasantly Then you can tell us something about it . Sitting , R. Do you happen to know the result ? Capt . Captain John Gregory The count has been under Dr. Girodet 's care . The Doctor advances , C. Fonb . M. Fonblanque Franois , I trust you can relieve the very painful tension which suspense has produced in the minds of Madame Fonblanque and myself . Doct . Dr. Girodet When we left you on the field , captain , we drove as rapidly as possible to the count 's apartments in Paris . After reaching there , he fell into a restless slumber . When he awoke , I was standing at his bedside . I told him that he had only a few minutes to live . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Sinking into the chair up L.C. Doct . Dr. Girodet The count turned pale , and he trembled like a frightened girl . The frequently-tested courage of the duellist failed him at that moment . Gamblers are always superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in the field of honor shrink with absolute horror when the Angel of Death hovers over them in the stillness and loneliness of the sick room . These facts in human nature quite agree with a theory of mine in the study of psychological phenomena in their relations to the functions of physical life . I once had a prolonged discussion with Professor  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley But  --  doctor ! Doct . Dr. Girodet Pardon me . This is a digression , and you , of course , can not share the interest in the subject which I feel as a scientific man . The count came more and more under the influence of some secret terror that convulsed his frame . At last he told me to open a small drawer in a cabinet . I did so , and I found a picture there , of a woman . He whispered in my ear that I would find a face like that in the deserted well of the Chteau Fonblanque . I answered him that I had already seen it there . While our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved mahogany doors , the body of a dead woman , an unbidden guest , passed silently out through the little gate in the garden wall . The first Countess de Crebillon had confronted her husband . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque The first countess ! Doct . Dr. Girodet She might have confronted a tiger , in the jungles of India , with less danger . The count has never allowed trifles to stand in the way of his own good fortune . Your daughter , cousin , has never been the Countess de Crebillon . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Julie ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque My daughter ! Doct . Dr. Girodet The count did not know until that moment that his wife was still living . They were separated when the official mistake at Monaco occurred , three years ago . It had become her interest to disappear from the world , and she took advantage of the mistake , until her husband 's second marriage and his renewed wealth made it to her interest to return to life . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! John ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girodet What is it , my dear ? Kate . Miss Kate Shipley The count ! A human being 's death is upon my  --  my husband 's soul . Doct . Dr. Girodet Not at all ! The count will be perfectly well in a week ! Kate , Mme. Fonblanque and M. Fonblanque start to their feet , the Captain starts around , all looking at the Doctor Kate . Miss Kate Shipley You said he had only a few moments to live ! Doct . Dr. Girodet I told him so ; and I am under great obligations to you , captain , for giving me an opportunity to act as an amateur detective . Your bullet went just near enough a vital part for my purpose . But it was quite harmless , I assure you . It is in my waistcoat pocket at the present moment . The count 's written confession is in another pocket . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley My Jack ! Moving down to Captain , R. You have n't killed a man , after all . Doct . Dr. Girodet From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting one . It illustrates this fact : The unusual activity of the nerve centers in the brain , popularly known as " conscience , " can be excited artificially . In other words , there is no actual physical necessity for men to wait till they are dying before repenting of their sins . I shall prepare a report of the case for the Academy of Science . How is your ear , captain ? Capt . Captain John Gregory Very well , I thank you  --  what there is left of it . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Mathilde , my dear , we must speak to Julie . Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque She left the chteau this morning , Phillippe , and she has not returned yet . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Julie is at the bedside of the man she loves , uncle ; and she can remain there , innocently , now . M. Saint-Hilaire has been very severely wounded . Fonb . M. Fonblanque Henri is wounded , too ? Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Henri ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque I  --  I trust he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that he may , with careful nursing ; and Julie will give him that . Doct . Dr. Girodet Let us hope that he will recover , cousin . Let us hope that you have not robbed a brave young lad of his life , and your own daughter of her happiness , for the sake of the Fonblanque family . Returns up R.C. Mme. F. Mme. Fonblanque Aside He was your son , Isidore ! Fonb . M. Fonblanque Aside Pauline , you were Henri 's mother ! They turn , slowly , catch each other 's eyes , and draw up . Both sit . Enter the Duc , up L. , quickly Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque We 've got all the facts at the club , now . Captain Gregory is dead ! General attention . The Duc sees the Captain , puts up his glasses , and stares at him I had it on the highest possible authority ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley It is n't his ghost , duc . Turning to the Captain and putting her hand in his Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her waist it is n't so bad being a ghost . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I beg your pardon , Miss Kate  --  but  --  Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! I forgot all about the  --  the business affair  --  between us , duc . Captain Gregory has been his own solicitor . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque I really do n't understand you . Doct . Dr. Girodet I hope your creditors will wait , duc , until a Frenchman can understand an American girl . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I will write to papa . He will find a place for you , if I ask him , in one of the railway companies he owns . Duc . Le Duc de Fouch-Fonblanque A place  --  for a duke  --  in a railway company ! Kate . Miss Kate Shipley I dare say you can marry in New York . A few of our girls , a very few , but still a few , are quite willing to pay the debts of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , please ; perhaps he knows a girl like that . Turns up L.C. Enter Pierre , up L. Pierre . Pierre A telegram  --  for Miss Shipley . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley Oh ! Taking it . Exit Pierre A cable dispatch , from papa  --  Opening it in answer to the one you sent for me last night . Reading " From Robert J. Shipley . Fifty-five words . Get married at once , and bring him to New York . " Certainly ; of course ! Capt . Captain John Gregory Oh ! Very well ; settle it between you . Kate . Miss Kate Shipley " Who is  --  he ? " O-h ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! I forgot to tell him your name . But papa has perfect confidence in my judgment . I 've given my attention to matters of this kind . Papa has n't .

Reads " Have cabled twenty thousand dollars to hankers in Paris . " For my trousseau ! Reads " And placed two hundred thousand dollars government bonds to your credit here . " My wedding present !
