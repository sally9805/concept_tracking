THERE is hardly anything more uncertain than conjectural geography , unless it be the surmises as to the course of future expeditions that may convert conjectural into assured geographical matters . But having undertaken to write an article on " The Next Polar Expedition , " I approach the subject with a feeling that there can possibly be evolved a series of conjectures , out of which might grow one or two that may prove to be closely allied to prophecy . The facts on which such conjectures can be based are not very numerous , and more difficult than all , it is hard to give the true value to each from which to reach the deductions . As when a person starts an enterprise in a locality and fails it is not always easy to say whether the locality will not support such an enterprise or whether the manager would not have failed in such an undertaking in about any locality , so when a polar enterprise has encountered disastrous results , it is not always quite clear what it has proven , whether or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dangerous journeys , or if the blame is not mostly upon the shoulders of the party that met the unfortunate consequence . It would seem quite clear to a person that if several expeditions had passed safely over a given route , backwards and forwards , and another had fallen wounded by the wayside on the same path , that surely the party and not the path was to blame . But even this is far from being always true , and especially so over polar paths , for there is no element so conspicuous in the disasters of that frigid laud as the element of climate , and none so variable . A dozen indifferently managed and carelessly equipped parties may march over a route safely , and one guided by an experienced and intelligent explorer , with all the known resources in his power , receive a disastrous check from this source should a fickle Nature see fit to launch an unusually severe season , or combination of ice-floes and ice-packs against him . I have stood on // the shore of a polar sea that was historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a yachting jaunt could have been enjoyed on its placid , iceless waters . Therefore , although the subject of danger is a most necessary one to consider in its bearings on the next polar expedition , yet it is nevertheless almost one of too indefinite a nature , from season to season , to consider as being conclusive over some of the routes where such variable results have been obtained as in the past . There is , however , one element of danger in the Arctic , whatever be the route selected , that it is well worth considering , and in which it also differs largely from similar undertakings in other zones of the earth . I refer to the condition of too much preliminary success in an Arctic enterpise not due to the efforts of the party itself . The first successes in almost all undertakings are so generally the most important , as creating an enthusiasm and ardor to carry the projector through the later and probably more difficult parts , that it is hard to conceive that there could be any exception to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a too abundant success in the first part of the undertaking , a success that has afterwards proven to be a trap . This is particularly true of naval expeditions , or of the naval efforts of other expeditions where such efforts have led the party through long and tortuous channels of ice-laden waters . The nearest that any Arctic navigator ever came to accomplishing the Northwest Passage-that goal of all polar exploration for so long a time-was by Sir Robert McClure , of the Royal Navy , in the " Investigator , " who , striking a most fortunate season and combination of open water and freedom from ice , got fully three-fourths of the way through from the Pacific side , and within a day 's unobstructed sail of points that had been reached by navigators from the Atlantic side , when his seeming good fortune turned , and he was shut up in the Bay of Mercy , as he named it , but which came near being a most unmerciful harbor of refuge to his party , as after events proved . Its salvation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes . The next three or four summers were of the usual Arctic character , and , as a consequence , the " Investigator " could not be budged from the Bay of Mercy . Forced to free his party from the frost fettered ship his fate would probably have been akin to that of Sir John Franklin , had not that whole part of the polar // regions been alive with searchers for the ill-fated Sir John ( Sir Robert , too , was bent on the same errand ) , one of which rescued him just as he was starting on a long desperate trip to the nearest Hudson Bay Company 's post , the result of which trip would probably have emphasized the danger of too much good luck in the first part of an Arctic undertaking . We could burden the reader 's time with almost a score of similar examples , wherein too much success at first has only added to the seriousness of the disaster after , or more than likely determined the same . Reviewing this most serious cause of casualties in cold weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements are somewhat variable there , so that icy obstructions may be normal for a number of years , and then , for only a season or two , may practically disappear . The Arctic navigator who strikes such an exceptional season is , compared with his predecessors , either extremely lucky or unfortunate , according to whether it allows him to accomplish his main object , or only sets a trap for him to prevent his escape after luring him into the thickest of Arctic obstacles . Baron von Nordenski6ld , the famous Swedish explorer of the polar regions , in forcing the Northeast Passage , struck such a favorable season , and reaped immortality as a result ; but the list of those who have only been lured into labyrinths of trouble by such preliminary success is much larger , very much larger , so large in fact that it is possible only to refer to the few cases already spoken of . If " the next polar expedition " should be a pole-seeking one - for , despite the popular belief that all Arctic expeditions are of this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that this unfortunate ratio will even be increased , for in the light of past disasters it can never be hoped that any season will ever be so favorable as to allow a successful dash to be made to the pole based wholly on the assistance it can render . There must be many other elements joined to this one to accomplish that allabsorbing but sensational feat . In fact , it seems as if the pole was a centre from which radiated a series of these deep channels of water that were no better than traps , somewhat like the snarenets that boys used to set for quails and partridges , all of which converged to a central net , where the birds were finally forced and killed . If I were to hazard a guess as to the next polar expedition , I would have but little hesitation in saying that it will probably be a // North Pole seeking affair , if it is on the Arctic side of the earth , and for scientific objects if it should be into the Antarctic quarter . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to reach that particular point is founded on the factsor so they appear to me-that the conditions for such an expedition are better than for any other I can now surmise . As the last two or three expeditions in that direction and for that purpose were sensationally disastrous , and as the whole purpose is sensational , they have awakened that peculiar feeling or lines of thought on which such undertakings unwittingly thrive . But while disaster feeds upon itself and starts the ball rolling for the next , better than can any other element , it has its counterpoise in that the patron side of the question  --  the most important side to effect a materialization - is slower to act the fresher the horrors in the popular mind , unless it be to relieve immediate distress of some recently stranded expedition , which is , of course , a wholly different affair , and prompted by wholly different motives . Therefore , there must be time for the last impressions to have faded away before a projector can expect a patron to furnish him with the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next North Polar expedition will not be from the United States , and the reasons therefor are somewhat similar to those that have already been given . The last disaster in this way was from our country , and while it will check the patron side of future undertakings with us , it is not likely to do so to the same extent in foreign lands , where our minor misfortunes are not so widely discussed , and very much less based upon them in reaching any conclusions on any subject . One can appreciate this fact much better when closely following a definite study , as polar exploration , and notice how very little attention is paid in this country to equivalent disasters  --  to expeditions that have originated from foreign sources . In fact , a general perusal of geographical journals from European countries shows that there is much more talk on that side of the world concerning the probabilities of a polar expedition than is to be found at home . Just at present it seems to be turned toward the Antarctic region , on thc basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect to start this boreal ball rolling in all quarters and in all directions , out of which a North Polar expedition is quite sure to V // grow , if , in fact , there is not more than one . This , again , may be followed in its wake by the usual number of relief and searching parties . To hazard a guess as to which European country may take the initiative in such an expedition would be much more vague and doubtful . It will more than likely be some of the maritime nations of the northern half of that continent , Great Britain , Germany , Sweden , etc. , etc. , not only from the greater likelihood of sea-faring people to undertake such expeditions , but also reasoning from the history of European euterprises in the past in these directions . To publish a supposition as to which one of these powers would probably be the base for the next expedition would be a wilder guess than even the wild ones I have already hazarded . From its very favorable position , aud the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to men and supplies , it would seem that Russia would naturally be chosen as a good country to base an opinion upon . Yet in the light of past events all of the northern explorations of Russia have been of a more substantial and practical character than North Pole seeking expedions , and there is no good reason to believe that she will change her record at this period of time . Still , Russia has been one of the most successful , if not the most successful nation , in her northern undertakings , planniug them well and carrying them to practical conclusions ; and , leaving out all national considerations , I think any one who has the North Pole 's attainment at heart , and who has studied Arctic history , would like to see an expedition bound for the northern axis of the earth composed of the walrus and seal hunters , who every summer ply their hardy vocation around the bleak ice-laden shores of Novaya Zemlya , for the naval contingent , and for the sledgemen , such men as assisted Baron von Wrangell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the frozen shores of Arctic Siberia . If , coupled with a favorable season , such an expedition could not make the pole , I would be willing to chronicle it among the impossibilities until successful aerial navigation , or something equivalent , settled the sensatioual question for all time to come . But it is not likely that Russia will take a hand in such an expedition for some i , . ime , or until science clearly proves that there can be something // utilized out of enterprises whose sole direction is the north , until that point is reached where every direction is to the south . Almost directly north of Russia lies the " Franz-Josef route " to the pole that was first discovered by the Austro-Hungarian Arctic expedition in the " Tegethoff , " although its main purpose was to try and determine the navigability of the Northeast Passage . It is probably the route that will be selected by the next pole-seeking expedition , if the united testimony of nearly all Arctic travelers can be relied upon as a basis . More of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give successful results than any other I can now recall . It might not be my selection , but I am not called upon to give my opinion as to the best route , but the one the most likely to be followed , should a North Pole expedition be the next one to leave civilization for the polar regions . Its greatest competitor is the Smith Sound route , between northern Greenland and the Parry or Arctic Archipelago . It is probably much harder to reach FranzJosef Land with a vessel than to secure a footing somewhere in Smith 's Sound , but once on this ill-defined island or continent , it seems to present much better facilities for land work or sledging to the pole . Payer made a sledge journey along its western shores within a few miles of the highest northing known , and from where he returned he could still see it trending off to the North and presenting as good sledging as he left when he turned back . Smith 's Sound has had the most recent disaster of account in the Arctic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers toward Franz-Josef Land . This , it should be remembered , howl ever , has two ship 's bones left on its shores , the " Tegethoff 's , " that bore the discoverers thither , and the " Eiva 's , " an English private ship under Mr. Leigh-Smith , that ventured too near its ill-fated shores . The coast line character of Franz-Josef Land is much less mountainous than that of Smith 's Sound , and it is in this that we find it superior for sledging purposes , and for two reasons . The first , which any one would easily surmise , is found in the fact that the land is naturally more available for sledge dragging , should the party be forced off the ocean ice for any reason , while the second , and by far the most important , although the least understood by those not familiar with Arctic sledging , is in the fact that the lower and less mountainous the land the shallower are the shores , and as a consequence the rough , // hummocky ice ( which is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berg drawing many feet of water ) , are stranded at more or less distance from the shore , leaving a narrow but most acceptable strip of smooth salt-water ice between the hummocks and the shore line . Along this strip , however winding it may be , as it follows all the sinuosities of the shore , far better progress can be made with a sledge than by any " cut-offs " that can possibly be made through hummocky ice . It is the most typical case known of " the longest way around is the nearest way home . " The subject of sledging is one that is going to enter more largely into the consideration of North Pole seeking expeditions , in that it has been so uniformly successful where judiciously managed , while all the great calamities are more or less directly and indirectly traceable to the maritime side of the expeditions , which have about reached their limits of possibilities in Arctic endeavors , unless a favorable season , or other conditions which they can not control , temporarily assist them should they be fortunate enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike them , but on which they can in no wise depend . This subject of hummocky ice therefore is , or certainly ought to be , a very important one in forecasting the probable route of the next polar expedition , whether its object be the North Pole or any other of the many that have lured people to that region . It is probably not putting it too strong to say that hummocky ice has defeated the purpose of more Arctic sledge parties than all other obstacles put together many times over . The Austrogarian party , in retreating from the ice-imprisoned " Tegethoff , " near Franz-Josef Land , made but twelve miles in a month 's hard work , and it is seldom that white men can make over a mile and a half a day traveling through it . The Eskimo sledgemen , of course , do much better under equivalent circumstances , but the farthest I ever knew them to make with a fair sized load ( about six hundred pounds ) was ten miles in fourteen hours ' hard work , and this exertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , and was noticeably weakened for two or three days after that . From this advantage , then , that FranzJosef Land has over Smith 's Sound , despite the disadvantage of harder maritime approach , I think it safe in asserting that it will be the next route selected to reach the North Pole . // There is one route that has been proposed by one of the best Arctic authorities ( Parry ) , where a dare-devil dash for the North Pole may be made some day , although I in no way put it above the Franz-Josef route as the most likely to be taken soon , and that is the route that leads north from Spitzbergen as a base . It has no shores to follow , and the party taking it must put boldly out to sea on the ice which covers it here during the winter and spring , and get back to its base ( the northern capes of Spitzbergen ) before the ice breaks up and cuts off its retreat . This route was used by Parry , of the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northing to that date ( in fact it was the first Arctic expedition whose main object was to gain ground in that direction ) , and his record remained the best for over half a century , until passed by Sir George Nares ' party , to be again passed by Lieutenant Greely 's a few years later . Parry started on his sledge trip late in the spring and soon found the ice floating south faster than he could travel north , when he returned , having made 82* 45 ' N. Getting back to England he urged on the Admiralty the plan of returning to Spitzbergen , which is easily reached by ships , remaining there one winter and starting in the spring a month or two earlier than on his former expedition , or before the fixed ice began drifting south . As a means of beating present records I think Parry 's plan a very good one , and one that is comparatively safe for that notoriously unsafe region ; but to make to the pole and back before the retreat is cut off it ranks among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that order of plans . It is likely that it will be tried some day if the other routes mentioned fail a few times more . Summing it all up into a sentence , I think that the next polar expedition will be a North Pole seeking one , and that it will emanate from some of the northern European countries , its route being by Franz-Josef Land , with Smith Sound a close second , and a bare possibility of the Spitzbergen route being selected . I have not considered the proposed German expedition to the Antartic regions , in which it is said that Mr. Henry Villard , of our own country , is so deeply interested , for the reason that being already half formulated , if rumors are to be relied upon , it is past the point where guessing can be allowed in its case . Its object will be purely scientific , in a region but poorly known . It is ex // 159 tremely doubtful , in fact , if any South Pole seeking will ever be organized until the North Pole struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching them are purely the sensational ones of doing a something in which others have failed , so that the North Pole will answer all the purposes of such objects until it is attained , and its greater convenience to the northern nations will also select it as the one with which to battle . While it is hard , indeed , to cast the hyperborean horoscope as to the next polar expedition , even in the light of past events , it is quite easy , indeed , to say where the next polar expedition should be directed in order to accomplish something worthy of the risks incurred . I refer to the accurate determination of the north magnetic pole , a problem that those best informed have pronounced to be of very considerable scientific value , certainly the highest to be found in the polar regions . This point was determined by its discoverer , Sir James Clarke Ross , in 1831 , as well as could be done with the instruments of that time , and probably to within an error less than its daily or annual fluctuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the compass , seems to have its daily , annual and great secular variations . It is this latter , in fact , a slow movement to the westward , that it is so important to determine in order to settle certain problems of terrestrial magnetism that will be of value to that rapidly developing and now very useful science . Magnetic surveys , at great cost and exertion , have been more or less completed in the civilized countries of the world . Lines of equal magnetic declination , lines of no declination , and other magnetic elements have been carefully , and after much labor thoroughly charted over the greater part of the earth , as aids to navigation and other arts more or less dependent thereon . Magnetic observatories have been established in the higher civilized countries for the purpose of observing the changes and variations of the magnetic needle . With all these carefully conducted observations the only point of great importance , the north magnetic pole , has not been scientifically determined or observed , owing to its comparatively inaccessible situation in the Arctic regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discussion of its importance , which has been so often affirmed by leading scientists familiar with terrestrial magnetism , but if the reader would only reflect on the vast and useful progress made recently in magnetism , electro-magnetism and electricity , he can conceive something of its utility and bearing ; // he can , at least , clearly see that it would be more credit to Smith to accomplish this problem than to reach eighty-five degrees north latitude after Jones and Robinson had turned back at eighty-four degrees north , defeated . Weyprecht , the scientist , originated and elaborated a plan for occupying the " run " of the Arctic regions with temporary scientific observations , and the plan was afterwards carried out , fifteen being so established for a short while . The only point he mentioned as being worthy , and on which he was especially desirous of fixing one of them , was " near the centre of magnetic intensity , " and yet none of the fifteen stations were within a thousand miles of this one spot he had selected , and on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " silent majority 's before his plan was consummated . His view of the North Pole is worthy of mention here as " being of no more significance for science than any other point in high latitudes . " This north magnetic pole is , roughly , about on the intersection of the 70th parallel and the 100th meridian west of Greenwich-two co-ordinates that are always represented on even the smallest maps , and is therefore easily found . To attempt to reach it by the sea , or with a vessel , would be hazardous , as in its immediate vicinity has taken place the greatest number of naval disasters of any district in the polar regions . Small sledge parties , however , have visited it without any calamitous results , and this clearly indicates the nature of the expedition that could safely settle the problem . It is , beyond all doubt , the next polar expedition that ought to be undertaken . FREDERICK SOHWATKA.
