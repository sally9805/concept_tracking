txt The Tall Sycamore of the Wabash , as Mr. VOORICEES is affectionately termed by his admirers , has gone down before a flood of precedents . On his native heath , or , rather , let us say , on the banks of his own Wabash , the Tall Sycamore defies everything that is mortal . But when he comes to grapple with the master minds of the Senate he " loses his grip , " so to speak , and falls ignominiously before a precedent . For a precedent , in the Senate , is a very sacred thing . There is only one thing more to be respected and venerated , and that is the usage of the Senate . A man who has to face a precedent and the usage of the Senate is , so to speak , floored . Yesterday the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash introduced a resolution denunciatory of thb national banks . His resolution said that the hostile attitude assumed by the national banks toward the refunding of the national debt at a low rate of interest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are contrary to the best interests of the people , and well calculated to excite the alarm of the Thoughtful Patriot , or words to that effect . The point of order made against this resolution was that it was a matter of legislation , and , therefore , not in. order at this session of the Senate . Mr. VOORHEES was confident that the precedents were in his favor , and that the Senate might pass bills and joint resolutions , leaving them to be considered when the House and Senate should hereafter be in session at the same time . Objection being made , the resolution was temporarily laid aside in order that the Senate might examine the precedents bearing upon the case . Nothing can be done in the Senate until the precedents are exhumed . Common sense goes for nothing . Usage is everything . Therefore , until Senators know what are the precedents in the case , Mr. VOORHEES is temporarily floored . The remarkable thing about this business is that Mr. VOORHEES , who is widely and favorably known as the Tall Sycamore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of precedents . One would have supposed that a man of Mr. VOORHEES 's lofty and determined character would have said , in effect : " I have prepared a stump speech on this subject , attacking the national bank policy of the Republican Administration , and I mean to deliver it now or perish in the attempt , precedent or no precedent . " This would have been like VOORHEES . But he weakly surrendered to the demand that the Senate should open the tomb of the past and hold an examination of the precedents . He even intimated that he , too , would like to examine the  --  precedents , and so his carefully prepared speech went over , and the country will not be enlightened with the views of the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash upon refunding the national debt at a low rate of interest unless the precedents shall be in his favor . The fact that Mr. Voonnnas has a speech , more or less elaborate , which he desires to deliver from the platform of the Senate does not really enter into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators are fond of saying , is a continuous body . While it is in session , it clearly has a right to express its opinion concerning any question which may properly be brought before it . The Senate may do anything that does not require the concurrence ' of the House while in special session . This is common sense . The Senate has just now , by formal resolution , declared that one set of committees shall go out and another shall come in . The Senate , in the same way , may resolve that the moon is made of green cheese , or that sin is sinful , or that the differential calculus is dangerous to the State and should be abolished . These are all matters of opinion , and the passage of a resolution to the effect that axis or all of these propositions is just is the expression of the opinion of the Senators . A mass-meeting of the unemployed , on the steps of the Capitol , has- just as much weight as the Senate in such a case , no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate , which is " heoretically ) composed of the wisest statesmen of the land , should not be able , at any time , to express by resolution its opinions upon any topic that might ' happen to come up . If both houses of Con. congress were in session , and the House were Democratic ; and the Senate were Republican , for example , it would be perfectly competent for the House ' to declare by formal resolution that the price of whisky is entirely too high , while the Senate might , in the same language , declare that the price of whisky is quite as low as the exigencies of the public service permit . In each case the expression is one of opinion merely , and binds neither body to anything . Therefore , we claim that it is quite reasonable and regular that the Senate should be asked , in the absence of the House , to declare its opinion concerning the national banks , or on any other subject . That declaration will be as harmless as the Pope 's bull against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should find occasion to make a speech , we trust that even this proceeding would not be contrary to any precedent .
