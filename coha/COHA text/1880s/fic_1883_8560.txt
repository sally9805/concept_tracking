The Sentinels salute them . Coronel . Alonso Coronel The saints relieve me from my governorship ! My honors hang about me like wide clothes Upon a shrunken body ; I scarce move Without some awkward stumble , plainly showing My great unfitness for my great command . I 'll never make a courtier . Look , Caedo , How do these silken slops become a frame Worn gaunt in armor ? Does this feathered cap Droop o'er the ugly line my helmet fretted Round my bald forehead ? Can this chain and key Cover my gashes ? Or this slender staff Bear the huge weight of my uncourtly limp . Through bows and cringes ? Bah ! I spat at fortune When I forsook the wars . Caedo . Caedo Despite thy " bah , " One sees the wolf 's tooth grinning plain enough Through the sheep 's fleece . Cor . Alonso Coronel Ay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a boon to ask ,  --  I vow I asked it in my smoothest phrase ,  --  When , to my horror , Doa Leonor Laughed in my face , and said , in her mild way , " Out with your dagger , Coronel ! The act Would fit the voice . " Ca . Caedo And thou ? Cor . Alonso Coronel And I ! I ran  --  Broke through her maidens , like a hurricane Through the rose-gardens of Granada  --  ran To find a mandolin , and pitch my voice Down to its finest note . Pray , hear me now , In the sharp treble of my lady 's page : " Par Dieu , "  --  they say that 's French ,  --  " I 've found a band , A pretty band of silk  --  par Dieu ! I have ; And I have vowed to Mary and Saint James To bind it on its ravishing abode , Or die in treasuring it  --  par Dieu ! I have ! " Which means , in simple speaking , I have found A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fie ! fie ! it turns my stomach inside out , To hear their lady-talk . Ca . Caedo Such blows on hand , While we are rusting here without a rub ! Moors flying pell-mell  --  Don Alfonso 's spears Combing their horse-tails out upon the wind  --  Gibraltar 's garrison with all its eyes Fixed upon Africa , as on a goal  --  The plague afoot too  --  Heaven at work with man  --  Why death must caper like a harlequin ! Cor . Alonso Coronel Ay , how I long to have my iron out ! Caedo , just hold still , and be my Moor , Until I break this stick across thy sconce . Breaks his wand over Caedo 's head . Ca . Caedo Thou dost not strike with the old force . Cor . Alonso Coronel I fear it . Did I not hurt thee ? Ca . Caedo Not a whit . Cor . Alonso Coronel That 's sad ! Had I my great Toledo , thou shouldst dance . Ca . Caedo But had I mine ?  --  Cor . Alonso Coronel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Much the same music . Cor . Alonso Coronel If thy sword agreed , In length or temper , with that tongue of thine , The Cid would shoulder over in his tomb , To give thee room beside him . Ca . Caedo Hold thy prate , Or I may choke thee with thy governor 's chain ! Cor . Alonso Coronel Not till I 'd thumped thy mazzard with its key . Ca . Caedo Saint Jago ! but I 'll teach thee  --  Cor . Alonso Coronel All thou know'st , And after dub me fool . Ca . Caedo Here 's sharper wit . Drawing . Cor . Alonso Coronel It draws as sharp reply . Drawing . Ca . Caedo Now keep thy ward . First Sentinel . First Sentinel Good gentlemen ! Advancing . Second Sentinel . Second Sentinel Keep back ! the blood they shed I 'll catch in a tailor 's thimble . Ca . Caedo Art thou ready ? Cor .

Caedo Where ? Cor . Alonso Coronel O'er the hill . Ca . Caedo I am no hawk . What seest thou ? Cor . Alonso Coronel An armed band Topping the hill  --  a mass of moving steel  --  The fore-guard of an army , if I know A bodkin from a sword . Ho ! ho ! Caedo , Throw up thy cap ! Gibraltar has been won , And here comes King Alfonso with the spoils ! Turn out the guard , and saddle my dun horse ; I 'll meet our sovereign on the way . Ho , there ! Shake out the yellow silk of old Castile !

Exeunt severally . SCENE II . The Same . The Great Hall of the Castle . Leonor de Guzman discovered seated in state , surrounded by Don Juan De Lara , Don Fernando de Villena , Don Tello , Courtiers , Knights , Ladies , Men-at-Arms , &c.; Don Juan de Lara is in the act of investing Don Tello with a crimson Scarf , the order of " La Banda .

I thus salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guzman And , I pledge my faith , He shall prove worthy of the dignity . I pray you , gentlemen , make way for me : Advancing . A mother 's kiss should not be last to greet The honors of a son . ( Kisses Don Tello . ) Don Tello , know This order was bestowed to spur thee on To actions that may make thy worth appear Equal with our bestowing . This fair badge Is not an ornament for festal days , A ribbon to enrich thy vanity , But the illustrious mark by which Castile Knows her great children , and can turn to them With confident assurance of such deeds As raised her glory to its present height . Thy breast is girt as with a ring of fire : An evil act within its circle looks Prodigious to beholders , and draws all To fix their concentrated eyes upon The splendid criminal . Small flames on heights Show further than great fires in humbler spots ; And they who see them from the vale below Oft take a candle for a meteor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption through an empery . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara ( Apart to Villena . ) Right royal that , and to the purpose , too : Some one has told her of Don Tello 's slips . Villena . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena ( Apart to Lara . ) Ay , if a lance-head ever fray that band , Charge me with scandal . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara Hark ! there 's more to come . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Don Tello , thy renown lies next my heart , Close to thy father 's . I have much to say ;  --  But no ,  --  not here . A mother 's privilege Borders too near the sanctity of prayer For public ears . Call the ambassador . Resumes her state . Flourish . Enter the Ambassador from the Rebel , Don Juan Manuel , with Gentlemen , Soldiers , Attendants , &c.,; bearing sumptuous presents . Ambassador . Ambassador ( Kissing Doa Leonor 's hand . ) Lady , my lord salutes you with these gifts , Rather as evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your deserts . The gods , who scorned the shepherd 's sacrifice Of curds , and wine , and bleeding throats of lambs , Looked not unkindly on the worshipper , Despite the simple service of his hands .  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Pray you , end there . To offer mortal ears That which becomes divinity alone , Insults its majesty and our plain sense . The power I hold is delegated trust From the true centre of all power , the king . If you have business that concerns the state , I 'll hear with patience ; if you 'd deal with Heaven , Carry your incense to the nearest church . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara ( Apart to Villena . ) Mark the ambassador ! That lofty stride Tripped up his earthly progress . Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena How he burns ! His throat is full of thistles . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Is there aught , Between Don Manuel and his majesty , That our discourse may further ? Am . Ambassador Much , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doa Leonor de Guzman Speak out . The government deserves distrust That stops the people 's ears while it debates . Am . Ambassador Your wishes are commands . Don Manuel , Some time in arms against his sovereign , Proffers his fealty to you , and swears To be your liegeman on a single term . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Name it . The king would stretch his clemency , To make a friend of his illustrious foe . Am . Ambassador ' T is a condition pleasant to the king  --  Or rumor lies for once in good report  --  And honorable to her for whom ' t is urged : Simply , that Don Alfonso should divorce That hag of Portugal  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Sir , let me say , That is no title in Castilian ears To know their queen by . How now , gentlemen , Is there no gauntlet down upon the word ? You downcast men , do you not blush to see The spurs of chivalry upon your heels ? ( Lara , Villena , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , on my faith , you see ' t is raining steel ! Thou backward , Tello ! He throws down his gauntlet . And , to crown them all , Behold a prince 's glove upon the heap ! Bear our defiance to Don Manuel ; And say , a word of treason is a spell , To conjure up such loyal storms as this , In our Castilian air . Your pardon , sir : We check your lord , not his ambassador . What follows this ? Am . Ambassador Your coronation , lady . After divorcement of the queen , my lord Would see the imperfect throne made whole by you . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman What say you , sirs ? My lord of Lara , speak . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara I only may repeat the general voice , Strengthened by sanction from the king himself . Accept the offer , not as his alone , But as the constant wish of all Castile . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Speak , Don Fernando . Vil . Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman My son , Don Tello ? Tello . Don Tello If they make me royal , I 'll fill my office with what grace I can . Certes , if one held out a crown to me , I should not put my hands behind my back . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Thou art the frankest speaker of them all . Ah , gentlemen , it is your private hopes Of what may follow to yourselves , through me , That hurries this advancement . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara You mistake , At least in me , the object of our hopes . Through you Castile would flourish  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Has it not ? If naught 's accomplished , nothing can I do . I found this land an armd wilderness , A chain of citadels , and all between Was desolation trampled into dust By a fierce soldiery , who only brooked The fiercer orders of their savage chiefs . So , in the midst , I built a house of peace , An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about I spread a garden-plot , Hedged it with flowers , and from its sculptured urns I sent the streams back to their native heaven , Returned in music . No defence was mine , Save the imploring weakness of the flowers , The scented dews my fountains scattered out , And the light blushes of my garrison . Yet at my gate War laid aside his spear , And vines ran round it , from the hand-worn grasp Up to the steely point , whence blossoms hung Trembling with horror . Ay , the rugged god Doffed his grim casque , and sat beside my feet , Until I schooled him with the mandolin ; Or taught his awkward limbs to move apace In other measures than the martial tread . Are these things naught ? These are my conquests , sirs ; And she who steps beyond her threshold 's dust , To play Achilles in her woman 's gear , Shall find the sword-hilt frets her dainty hand , And the great helmet makes her forehead ache . Lara . Don Juan Nuez de Lara Yet there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sway of useful days , Bent on a nation 's welfare . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Ah ! the hand That takes a sceptre up , knows not how soon The royal symbol must become a sword . Am . Ambassador But , lady  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Ay , sir , so much for myself ; Now for the weightier matters of the realm . What are your master 's ends in this affair ? Am . Ambassador I am his spokesman , not his confidant . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Mark , how much nearer to his heart am I. Don Manuel fears Castile 's advancing power May crush the Moor , and win a general peace : In which conjuncture , rebels like himself Could ill abide our undistracted arms . His safety hangs upon our foreign wars . Divorce the queen , and on our western skirts , Instant , insulted Portugal uprears His warlike standard , in the queen 's behalf ; While , from the south , the hordes of Africa Again win footing on our weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With the same readiness he put it on , And rises in our midst a dangerous foe , Made more audacious by his treachery . Say to your master that my lord , the king , Treats with his rebels at the lance 's point , Nor ever recognized , nor ever will , Don Manuel 's right to treat by embassy . Take back the trinkets you designed for me  --  Don Manuel 's needs will shortly ask for them ; And tell him , Leonor de Guzman loves No title in the spacious gift of man , Above the welfare of her native land . Am . Ambassador Must this be final ? Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Yes , sir ; ' t is the fruit Of many a painful hour of solemn thought ,  --  Of many a struggle with a treacherous heart , Whose passions threatened to be paramount . Am . Ambassador Lady , with your reply my functions cease . Now , as a gentleman of Spain , I say That your refusal of this proffered crown Rivals in splendor the ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She who next wears the honors you put by Must sit beneath you in real dignity . Humbly I take my leave . Kisses her hand , and exit with his suite . ( Solemn music , tolling of bells , and cries of grief , are heard . ) Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman What sounds are these That so appal me , like the uplifted voice Of direful prophecy ? ( Enter Don Enrique , and Don Fadrique , followed by Coronel and Caedo . ) Enrique . Don Enriqu Mother ! Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman My son !  --  And thou , twin brother to my eldest born ! The hour that made your difference in birth , Makes none within my heart . En . Don Enriqu Mother ! Fadrique . Don Fadriqu Alas ! En . Don Enriqu O God ! be doubly dear to us a while , Or fate will crush us ! Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Sons  --  Enrique  --  speak ! What is this mystery ? En . Don Enriqu Mystery ! Would ' t were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tell her , good brother . Fad . Don Fadriqu Didst thou speak to me ? Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman This cruelty is not usual with you , sons .  --  The king , the king !  --  Where is your father ? En . Don Enriqu Look , Through the wide casement , on you mournful host !  --  The trailing pikes  --  the furled emblazonry Of our victorious standards  --  the bowed heads Of veterans who behold each other 's scars Channels for running tears , without surprise  --  The empty saddle  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman ' T is thy father 's steed , Roderick , the last of the old Gothic strain ; Oft have I held him by his golden bit , Against Alfonso 's spurring.  --  En . Don Enriqu Mother , mother , Thou dreamest , mother . Wake ! the king  --  Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman The king ? Well , well , the king is ill ?  --  is wounded ?  --  Ha ! Where is the king ? En . Don Enriqu He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! Faints . All . All Dead ! dead ! En . Don Enriqu Fadrique , loose her collar . She revives . O , bitter waking to a world of woe ! Leo .

Doa Leonor de Guzman Thou dar'st not tell me he is dead ? Thou wouldst behold a helpless woman quake ? Such words are treason while the sovereign lives . En . Don Enriqu Alas ! Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman And thou believ'st it ? En . Don Enriqu From these arms  --  For there were few who dared confront the plague  --  That mighty champion of Christendom Took flight for heaven . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Dear Lord ! and is it so ? I feel somewhat bewildered in my mind , And what I see is hardly in clear view , Though I see much  --  much  --  much  --  Walks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nay , slumber on .

Don Enriqu Speak to us ! Dear mother , thou hast sorrows that pass cure , But there are other wounds that need thy aid . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman What said your grace ? Fad . Don Fadriqu The king is dead , good mother . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Ay , I know that . En . Don Enriqu And all the smothered hate Of Alburquerque , and the wolfish queen , Begins to darken in each face we see . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Where is the king ? Fad . Don Fadriqu Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we ? Or what worse fortune can befall ? Why , we May sit and laugh , like beggars , in our rags , At the rich trappings which men fear to lose . En . Don Enriqu Such desperation would disgrace a man , Yet it shows sweetly in thee , mother . I , Who hold the duties of an eldest son , Must not so far forget the blood I bear , As to sit sobbing o'er my father 's corpse , While ruin seizes on his heritage . Fly to thy order , brother . I believe Santiago 's banner can protect its master , Until I rally our undoubted friends . Tello , take horse  --  I need not bid thee spur  --  And bear Fadrique company . Away ! Fad . Don Fadriqu Thy blessing , mother . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman God protect you both ! Exeunt Fadrique and Tello .

En . Don Enriqu O mother , mother , put these toys away , And bless the swords that must be drawn for thee . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman No swords for me.  --  Yet , dear Enrique , do That which seems best , without a thought of me .

You have seen a hawk Mounting the heavens , to strike his rising prey ; When does he wheel , and make the fatal stoop ? Not while his quarry towers above his head , But when his wing has won the upper place ; And the tired heron , shuddering with affright , Sees the sharp beak and talons of his foe Poising between him and the blue of heaven . The Guzmans rise , but we rise faster , madam , To overtop them in their venturous flight . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal Words , words ! you give me naught but pretty words , And I ask deeds . Alb .

But add to this , a hundred haughty lords , Shut up in towns and castles , with demands Upon the crown that grew as days went by .  --  Not to forget the Moorish war , bequeathed By your great husband to his only son . Madam , this net-work cramped me , hand and foot , Till I burst through it . And I tell you now  --  Even while I hold these elements in check  --  That if King Pedro die , or I but slack My rigid grasp , Castile shall see a storm , To which mere chaos would be harmony .

But the king , He must be pleased with hunting-shows and games , Or vexed with tangled matters of the state ,  --  Talked with and mystified ; until for love Of present pleasure , or disgust with rule , He flings his crown into my ready hands . Then , Don Enrique must be found new toys , Before the old ones weary . Even now He scours the country , drumming up old friends , And mustering new allies .

That land Breeds natural warriors ; the children , there , Teeth on a sword-hilt . I have only given Titles and gewgaws , no effective power ; But this Biscay is very solid stuff .  --  They shall not have it . Here is more to do : Wheedle Fernando , threaten Leonor , And gain possession of Juana . Gods ! I am both minister and harlequin ,  --  Head to the state , and jester to the court !

For the king should see Those charms , the churlish maiden hides from him . He must be married .  --  Well , well !  --  Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena Did you say The king designs to marry ? Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Not to-day . Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena My sister is betrothed to Don Enrique . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu A very grievous pity ! Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena Why , my lord ? Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu His star seems waning . He will scarce outlive The many schemes he is so apt at framing ,  --  Rebellions , murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Villena Good Heaven ! Is he a traitor ? Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu ' T is a pity , though ! I chose your sister as a proper maid To bring beneath the notice of Don Pedro .

Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu I 'll not detain you . Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena If you mean Your choice fell on Juana , as our queen , I see no obstacle  --  Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Nor I , forsooth : Who could be worthier ? Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena She shall come to court . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu That would require a deal of management : For Doa Leonor can keep her ward , By the Castilian laws , against us all . Ask the king 's warrant . Vil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu And , lo ! Here comes his grace to grant it . ( Enter Don Pedro from hawking , with a bird upon his fist ; accompanied by Enrique , Courtiers , Falconers with hawks , &c.); Don Pedro . Don Pedro Pray you , brother , Give me your hawk . He is a gallant bird ; How close his feathers lie ! and what a spread Of wing he makes in his audacious flight ! There is a head becomes its feathery crest More than black Edward 's ; and his sinewy neck , Lithe as a serpent 's , joins his arching chest Without a break . Mark , how assured a grip His talons take upon my glove ! Your hand , Cased in a gauntlet , could not pinch me thus . Give me the bird . Enrique . Don Enriqu It flatters me , to think I can bestow a favor on your grace . ' T is only quittance too . Don P. Don Pedro O ! marry , yes ; He slew my falcon . Alburquerque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace ? Don P. Don Pedro Your gift , the great Burgundian hawk , Was but a haggard , after all your praise . This is my brother 's bird . I 'll tell you , now , How your Burgundian suffered . For a wager , As to which hawk could strike the quarry first  --  Mine or Enrique 's  --  we both cast them off . But the shrewd heron slipped between the two , Dropped like a stone , and left the rivals there , Facing each other , in their topmost flight . A while they paused , and then , ' gainst nature , rushed Grappling together . ' T would have moved your blood , Had you but seen the feathered warriors tilt ! Beak threatening beak , and talon locked in talon , Wheeling and darting , striking and retreating , Like two brave jousters at a course of spears , While through the air their riven armor fell In feathery clouds . Now , your Burgundian hawk Waged battle nobly ; then , anon , he turned , Turned like a craven  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head off  --  turned and fled ! But Don Enrique 's falcon closed , and struck , Straight through the coward 's gorge , a deadly blow ! " Foul ! " cried I ; " Fair ! " Enrique cried ; and while We stood there wrangling , down fell Burgundy , Headlong , to earth ! Laughs . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu A battle royal , sire ! Worthy the great spectators . Don P. Don Pedro Tell me , now  --  You store your beauty in your country house  --  Who was the fair one that reclined upon Your window-ledge , as we rode forth to-day ? Par Dieu ! I heard strange music in the air , And smelt new odors , as I gazed upon That wonder , sitting in a haze of light , Which seemed to eddy with my whirling brain , And bring a most delicious sickness o'er me . Alb .

Don Fernando Manuel de Villena Your grace , a boon ! I ask my sister  --  Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu ( Aside to him . ) Hist ! Wait till Enrique goes . Don P. Don Pedro Your sister , how ? Vil . Don Fernando Manuel de Villena I must reply . ( Aside to Alburquerque . ) She is the ward , your grace , Of Doa Leonor , a prisoner now , And , therefore , not a guardian capable To fill her duties . I demand Juana , Both as her brother , and by right of law . Don P. Don Pedro These are high words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Villena . ) Shrink , shrink , or lose your suit ! Don P.

Doa Leonor de Guzman A change from my gay court , a sorry change ! Yet what is life but changes ? And would not Life 's sweetness cloy , without its bitterness ? The ebbs and flows of being keep its tides Fresh on the surface , while the central soul , Like some volcano of the under sea , Boils on forever  --  on , though storm or calm Rule o'er the outer and apparent flood  --  Setting its streams of thought , now here , now there , In purifying motion . I oft think That they whose lives seem calmest to the view , And most unmarked by fortune 's varying stamp , Have most turmoil within . For , were it not , Mere want of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So let me think , though every thought of mine Move with a shadow of remembered grief ; And in my prison , like the close-pent brain , Be still the power that gives free sinews work . I have an influence on the world beyond ; And I , who nothing hope from earth 's desires  --  I , whose sole hope beacons across the grave  --  I , who stand calmly , waiting for God 's breath To waft me towards him and his royal guest , The great Alfonso  --  I indeed should be A mighty instrument for others ' good . Therefore , while life is mine , my sons shall have The best of me . ( Enter Juana de Villena . ) Good-morrow , gentle daughter ! May I address thee thus ?

Doa Leonor de Guzman Heaven spare Don Pedro ! En . Don Enriqu Frankly , so say I , Just now , our friends are scantily prepared To push our fortunes . Fight or fall we must , Should Pedro leave us . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman True . He stood our friend  --  Who had most cause to fear us  --  with a strength That made his boyish port heroical , When the whole court was thirsting for our blood .

It seems to me the summit of my fate , The spot from whence I look on happiness , As on a pleasant land , from some great hill ; Just when the Spring is freshest , ere a leaf Curls with the yellowing Summer ; while the fruit Is folded in the blossom , and a sun , Rich with the humid promise of the year , Looks through the hazy air , and wraps the whole In dreamy quiet . Dearest , if our lives Assume no brightness from this point of view , Let us turn atheists ; for love was given As a foretaste of what the saints enjoy . Jua .

Give up your treachery , at least with me , And take to downright violence at once . Here I , a guardian by Castilian law , Stand on my rights as a Castilian dame : Now let the proudest lord within the land , Unbacked by orders from the throne itself , Abide the conflict !

Suppose I kill her ? with my own true hand Sweep her from earth ? What could Don Pedro do ? Murder his mother ? Well , and what of that ? He could not call the Guzman back to life ; And I 'd die laughing . Ha ! ' t is a new thought , Yet good and tempting . Could I reach her , now ,  --  Find some occasion .

Don Pedro Mother , this mercy shows  --  Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Ay , shows , your grace  --  Nothing but shows  --  you hit the very word ! Her mercy is not real , ' t is counterfeit , It has to me a hollow-hearted sound ; And yet she ' d palm it  --  Don P. Don Pedro Recollect yourself ! Your spleen breaks in upon your sovereign 's speech , To vilify his mother . Have a care , Or even you may carry it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To trust the secret guilt your words betray ? You cover your revenge in robes of state , And ask my voice to sanction the vile hag ; While naked mercy must be shuffled by , To give your harlot room . Beware , my lord , Lest these instructions in cruel policy Be not too well remembered ,  --  lest the spring Of impious knowledge , opened in my mind , Some day , o'erwhelm the opener ! Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu ' T was my haste : Yet I can show the motives  --  Sire , you frown  --  You frown upon your faithful counsellor ! You frown upon the pilot whose true eye Guided your early voyage past many a rock , Unknown to you , who laughed from the high deck ; Through many a storm , whose raging waters strove To tear his hand from the unsteady helm , While you slept lightly in your dangerous berth ! Ay , sire , through treacherous calms , and furious storms , Scorched by hot suns , or blind with hissing spray , Weary with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely . This is my reward ! Ah ! you do well , to push the knave aside  --  The rough , blunt fellow whom you loved at sea  --  Now you are riding , with your anchors down , And all your streamers fanning the mild airs , Safe in the harbor which he brought you to . Don P. Don Pedro My lord  --  Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Still frowning ! Well , discharge me , then ; You may find better statesmen in the streets ; The earth must teem with them ; or you , my liege , Would be more careful in preserving me . ' T is not the minister whose heart is wrung , By this decline from early confidence , It is the man ! Affects to weep . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal ( Aside to him . ) O ! let me see that tear  --  That natural wonder  --  O ! beseech you , sir ! Laughing . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Marplot , begone ! Aside to her . Don P. Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alonso de Alburquerqu Here I lay down the seals and golden key , That marked my office of abundant trust , Here , at Don Pedro 's feet ; and may the hand That lifts them thence be worthier of their charge , By skill and grace , if not by honesty . Lays down the seals and key . Lie there  --  until I pick ye up again . Aside and exit . Don P. Don Pedro My lord ! Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal He 's gone . Alas ! dear gentleman , He was sincere , no doubt , in his intent ; But Leonor , poor creature , must not die : She is the mother of thy father 's sons . Thou ' lt free her soon ? Don P. Don Pedro Not yet . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal Thou ' lt give her hope ? Don P. Don Pedro Yes , if the Chancellor consent . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal But , Pedro , Thou art the king , and can do anything . Don P. Don Pedro I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not govern this Castile of mine , Without Lord Alburquerque . Mother , send , Send to his palace , bid him come to me ; And say , his seals are lying at my feet , A waiting his return . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal I 'll go myself , In secrecy and silence . ' T were not well To have this business noised abroad . True , true , We can not do without the Chancellor . Farewell !  --  Pray , trust thy signet-ring to me , And let me bear a little ray of hope To Leonor . ' T is an odd fancy , ha ? Yet words of hope and comfort , from my mouth , Would move her strangely . Drawing the ring from his finger . Don P. Don Pedro ' T is as well , perhaps , To grant her wish ; for Leonor must die . Aside . Thou must not leave ere you are reconciled . Forgive some rudeness from her natural pride , And say I pity her . But , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will murder her ! ( Aside . ) Well , take my signetring  --  The Chancellor would rage to see it go  --  Aside . Would it were always used in such fair deeds ! Juana keeps with her  --  she owes me that ; I gave Fadrique leave to see her , too ; Another kindness which she 'll thank me for . But , then , the state  --  O ! mother  --  Walks up the stage . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal Farewell , son ! ( As she is going , renter Alburquerque , with a bundle of papers . He regards her fixedly  --  she returns his look . ) Alburquerque . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Well , what now ? Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal Nothing , my good lord . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Hum ! hum ! Nothing , indeed ? You have a conquering look . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal I have been pleading with the king for you . For  --  hark you , sir  --  I have resolved to drop My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , and see I must abide Your lordship 's pleasure ; play a second part , And leave the stage to you . But swear to me Not to give up your purpose till the king Sign her death-warrant . This , at least , I 'll have . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu You shall . But I will have the Guzman , hey ? That , too , I purposed . Ha ! ha ! ha ! she 's mine ! Laughing . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal You are not generous . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu ( Laughing . ) Ha ! ha ! why , no : I like a triumph . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal Pray , address the king : He 's ripe to welcome you . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu ( Laughing . ) Ha ! ha ! ' t was rare ! A woman rival me ! Turns towards Don Pedro . Doa M. Doa Maria de Portugal ( Aside . ) And conquer you ! Now for my swoop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doa Maria steals off . ) Don P. Don Pedro Welcome ! Nay , Do not hold off , but take your seals again . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu My liege , you misconceive me . I have brought The papers , of most pressing consequence , Which lay beneath the judgment of my eye . The man who holds my place as minister Will get some headaches over these , I trow ! They are of urgent moment  --  though I have A wain-load waiting at the palace-gate  --  And so I brought them first . For , notice , sire , Going over the papers rapidly . This is a plan for rating the poll-tax . This is a paper on the custom-dues Established by Navarre . This , from Biscay , Begging their English league may be confirmed . Here 's a petition from the clergymen  --  Long articles , in number twenty-one  --  A most involved and cunning document . Here 's one on criminal procedure ; this Needs instant reformation . Here , the salt-pits ,  --  A question to be managed dexterously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes  --  taxes .  --  This Is the projected treaty with Navarre . Ah ! here is business  --  here is food for thought ! For , sire , I hold that Aragon  --  Don P. Don Pedro Good heavens ! I nothing know of this ! Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Let me explain . The Cortes that will meet  --  Don P. Don Pedro Forbear , forbear ! On your allegiance , I command you , hold ! You drive me frantic with the catalogue ; Spare me the explanation . Take your seals , And end these matters in your own good way . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Forgive me , sire . Don P. Don Pedro You do not love me . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Yes , Most dearly , sire ; but Leonor , my foe , Has got between me and your confidence . Don P. Don Pedro In Heaven 's name , take her , and perform your will ; But , pray , take up your seals and treasury-key ! Alb . Don Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ay , here 's the warrant . Sign , your grace . Puts a pen in his hand . Don P. Don Pedro ( Writing . ) ' T is done . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu And I resume my seals and key . ( Picks them up . ) My liege , Lend me your signet : ' t is a private warrant . Don P. Don Pedro I have it not . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Indeed ? I cautioned you Never to part with it , except to me . Who has it , sire ? Don P. Don Pedro My mother . Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Horrible ! The devil 's rampant in Castile , I think ! That ring bears absolute command with it . O ! sire , you sealed the fate of Doa Leonor An hour before you thought . Going . Don P. Don Pedro Stay , Chancellor ! Where are you going ? Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu To the Guzman 's cell . Heaven grant I be in time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu To stay your mother 's hand , before it reeks With Leonor de Guzman 's blood . Don P. Don Pedro O ! O !  --  O ! terrible conjecture ! Dare not think  --  Alb . Don Juan Alonso de Alburquerqu Abide the issue , and you 'll think with me . The subtle monster ! how she smiled and bowed , And begged revenge from me , and stole away , With the damned purpose packing her hot heart Until it almost burst ! O ! women , women ! Turn you to devils , and the ancient fiends Shall stand aghast with horror ! ' Sdeath ! I dream , I dream , while she ' s at work . ( Aside . ) Farewell , your grace ! The woman has cajoled me , as I live ! Aside and exit . Don P. Don Pedro I 'll not believe it , till the frightful deed Make her as odious as the thought of it . Never ! ' t is monstrous ! And the Chancellor Outdoes suspicion in suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Dungeon in the Same . Leonor De Guzman discovered . Leonor . Doa Leonor de Guzman I can not master them : these gloomy thoughts Crowd and bewilder reason . If a voice Had cried from heaven , Thy latest hour has come , I could not more believe it . Can the soul Warn its dear body of their sad divorce , Ere death confront them ? Or am I the fool Of dreadful fancies , nourished in the dark Of this detested prison ? Bounteous Heaven , If yonder sun , that , like a traveller , Pauses upon the boundaries of his land , To take a survey of the things he loves , Shall ne'er return to me ,  --  grant one last boon ! That I may calmly lapse into thy arms , With time to think of thy beneficence ; And not be hurried to the judgment-seat , By thy grim officer , appalling Death , Crying against the justice of my doom . I fear thee not , O Death ! The grave , the worm , The noisome process of a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , And peace closed up the dying lids for aye . But , O ! the terrors that a sinful soul , Bursting its slumber at the Archangel 's trump , Must feel when it remembers its last act , Ere it lay down to sleep , was guilty fear , That tugged and wrestled with its Maker 's will ! O watchful Heaven , if my poor destiny Have o'er engaged the service of thy thoughts , Grant me my prayer ! And , as my latter days Are full of frowns and dreadful threatenings , Smile at the last , and round my closing hours With all the bounties thou'st withheld so long ! I do not murmur , Lord ,  --  I do not ask , While all are taken , I alone should stay ; I would but choose my way of going hence , Not as a voyager , as a suppliant . ( Enter Juana and Fadrique . ) Fadrique . Don Fadriqu Mother ! Embraces her . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman My son ! Sure Heaven has re-begun Its broken blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  hast thou heard from him ? They tell me he has fled to Portugal . And Tello , too ?  --  and all the little ones Who call me mother ? Stay , Fadrique , stay ! Answer no questions till I look at thee . How thou hast grown !  --  Juana , has he not ?  --  An inch or more . Much like thy father , too : His breadth of shoulder , and his girth of chest , And the fixed eye that looked through coming years , So like a prophet 's . Now , the news , the news ! Thou seest they keep me from it in this cell . Here time is stagnant ; the vast tides of life Flow by you loop-hole , yet no ripple comes To break the calm in which I idly sleep . I am a foolish woman , for I think That I am weeping . Weeps . Fad . Don Fadriqu Mother , do not grieve ! Enrique , and my brothers , are quite safe ; And , as for me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Be of good cheer : I saw the king to-day , And found his spirit was inclined to be Most kindly towards thee . He , by special grace , Sends me , as earnest for his good intents . Juana . Doa Juana Manuel de Villena Your hard imprisonment is well-nigh o'er . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman I know it , dear Juana . Days ago  --  But more to-day than any former time  --  I had undoubted notice . Jua . Doa Juana Manuel de Villena That is strange ! And yet you told me not . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman I could not then . The words seemed doubtful . They are plainer now ,  --  Plainer and plainer , as the moments fly . Fad . Don Fadriqu What mean'st thou , mother ? Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman This : if one should say  --  One of the playmates of my childhood  --  Why , Why do my thoughts run backward to their source , Keeping my childhood ever in my sight ? Fad . Don Fadriqu I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doa Leonor de Guzman O , yes . If one should ask me , " Leonor , Where wilt thou be to-morrow ? " I 'd reply , In heaven , beloved ; and feel I spoke strict truth . Fad . Don Fadriqu Confinement has unstrung thy mind . Alas ! Who put these dreary notions in thy head ? Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Why , so I ask ; and shake my heavy brain , And look around for comfort . Naught replies ; And once again my lonely spirit sinks Beneath the pressure of a dismal doom . Fad . Don Fadriqu ' T is the dark hour before the morning breaks . Leo . Doa Leonor de Guzman Ay , and the morning breaks in heaven . ( Doa Maria appears at the door , looks in , and retires . ) My son , Dost thou believe the spirit can detect The presence of things hurtful ? For , just now , I felt as if the shadow of death 's wing Passed over me , and chilled me to the soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Enter an Attendant . ) Attendant .
