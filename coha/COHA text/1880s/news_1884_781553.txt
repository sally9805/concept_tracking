txt Mr. BLAINE is , of course , his own worst enemy , for no man becomes a prostitutor of public trusts , a scheming jobber , and a reckless falsifier save by his own voluntary acts . But it has until lately been a , matter of some doubt whether he was the more injured by his own false and tricky way of dealing with charges made against him or by the reckless misstatements of his volunteer defenders . His two rash and needless falsehoods about his connection with the Hocking Valley enterprise , however , make it very clear that none of his party friends and none of his organs can outlie him , and henceforth he must be set down as the one man in the whole country who is laboring most assiduously , most cunningly , and with the best prospects of entire success for the defeat of the Republican ticket . Mr. BLAINE 'S ownership of an interest in the Hocking Valley coal lands was , as we have said , a matter for which no one could reproach him . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found no reason to conceal his connection with the enterprise . But Mr. BLAINE 'S mind does not work like that of an honest man . When the Hon. HEZEKIAH BUNDY  --  may the Goddess of Liberty bless his inquisitive , serviceable soul  --  wrote him about the matter , therefore he replied saying : " I am not and never have been the owner of any coal lands or iron lands or lands of any character whatever in the Hocking Valley , or in any part of Ohio , nor have I at any time owned a share of stock in any coal , iron , or land company in the State of Ohio . " This was a lie , as Mr. J. HENRY BROOKS proved when he published , the following letter from Mr. BLAINE , together with Mr. DENISON 'S receipt for the sum inclosed : SENATE CHAMIIER , WASHINGTON , Dec. 30 , 13th , 1880 . DEAR SIR : Find inclosed my draft for $25,000 in payment of my subscription to the Hope Furnace enterprise . Touching the interest , I have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment to be postponed until some matters between Mr. LEE and myself are definitely adjusted . Very resp'y , Mr. DENISON . J. G. BLAINE . Moreover , in a letter Written in August , 1882 , to Mr. LEE , Mr. BLAINE mentions his " investment " in the bonds of the Standard Company . We have already shown that the attempt made by Mr. BLAINE 'S - friend LEE to 5 explain the transaction . as a " loan " was a wretched failure . His statements contradict themselves and traverse those of Mr. BLAINE . But the arch trickster himself comes forward again , and in a letter to Congressman McKINLEY , of Ohio , declares that " his my letter to the Hon. HEZEKIAH BUNDY in July last on this same subject was accurately true . " What is " this same subject " ? This : L " I do not own and never did own an acre ' of coal land or any other kind of land in the Hocking Valley . or in any other part of Ohio . " - This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transparent , and exposing itself . - As the Evening Post - points ? out , the Bundy letter dealt , among other subjects , with " the ownership of lands , " and as to this point Mr. BLAINE may , perhaps , truthfully deny that he ever owned . any specified and defined acre or acres of land in Ohio . But the Bundy letter dealt also with the ownership of stocks in Ohio enterprises , and Mr. BLAINE does not reassert his denial on that point . With all his 4 : bluster he knows ' when he has been ft hopelessly caught in one of his own lies . He ' dodges it , trusting to the short memories of those who hastily read his latest letter to make it pass as a full and sweeping denial . Technically , perhaps he spares his conscience the burden of a new lie , but the burden borne by his groaning defenders receives an addition to be measured by his deliberate intention to deceive , for every intelligent man sees the purpose of the McKinley letter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proneness to mendacity must be tempered to the wavering voter and the hopeful convert .
