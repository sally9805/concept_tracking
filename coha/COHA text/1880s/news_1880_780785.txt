New-York members of Congress have received numerous telegrams to-night from NewYork , announcing the confirmation by the NewYork Senate of the appointment of Silas B. Dutcher , at present Appraiser at the Port of New-Y ork. as Superintendent of Public Works , and urging the claims of various persons for the Appraisership , which Mr. Dutcher will be required to vacate . The names of Capt . Goddard and George W. Palmer are mentioned , and intimations have been thrown out that John Q. Howard , of Ohio , author of the " Life of President Hayes . " and now holding a place in the New-York Custom-house , will be a formidable candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hiscock to amend the Revised Statutes which fix the times and , places for holding terms of the District Court in the Northern District of New-York , provides that the court shall be held at Albany on the third Tuesday in January ; at Utica on the third Tnesday in March ; at Rochester on the second Tuesday in May ; at Buffalo on the third Tuesday in September ; at Syracuse on the third Tuesday in November , and , in the discretion of the Judge of the court , ouo term annually at such time and place within the Counties of St. Lawrence , Clinton , Jefferson , and Franklin as he may from time to time appoint .

The consideration of the bill will be resumed next week , and it is probable that those gentlemen who are anxious to deliver their carefully-prepared speeches on finance will take advantage of this opportunity . No doubt is entertained about the passage of the bill , but a final vote may not be reached for two weeks . In the Senate , Mr. Morrill called up his resolution to instruct the Committee on Finance to make inquiry touching the practicability of refunding at a rate lower than 4 per cent. , and read a carefully-prepared speech ; in which he advocated a 4 per cent . bond .

The bill under consideration was one providing for the removal of obstructions in the Delaware Breakwater harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called attention to the fact that it was a special bill for an object which might as well be included in the River and Harbor bill , and asked whether the Senator would lose his interest in the latter bill if this special bill should pass , evidently suggesting that if Mr. Saulsbury should get his State provided for in advance he might not exert himself in support of the appropriations for the States of other Senators in the general bill . Mr. Saulsbury emphatically asserted that he would vote for what was right and oppose what was wrong in. the River and Harbor bill or any other ; bill . The provisions of the bill were included in one of the general appropriation bills passed at the last session , but were dropped out in some way while the bill was being arranged by a conference between the two houses . It appropriates $25.000 to remove the wrecks of several vessels which have interfered with the navigation of Delaware Bay and River since 1877.                 @ @ @ @
