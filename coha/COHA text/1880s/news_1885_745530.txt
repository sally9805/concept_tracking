txt A man , who is supposed to have been a thief , was fatally injured in a singular manner yesterday at No. 67 East Ninth-street . The store of Brownell , Phelps &; Venino , dealers in artists ' materials and decorative novelties , on the first floor of this place , was almost deserted at 1 o'clock in the afternoon , the clerks having gone to lunch . A saleswoman , who was left in the store , suddenly perceived a man in an inclosure formed by a desk and known as the office , in the northeast corner of the store . He appeared to have been concealed in the office and was in the act of stepping to a window overlooking a deep rear area . The young woman was about to cry out " Thief ! " but she uttered instead a shriek of horror as the intruder jumped out of the window - to what appeared certain and instant death , and a moment later a dull thud told that his body had struck the flags of the area . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the woman in the store , saw the man lean out of the window . He tried to jump to the top of the wall of the area inclosure but missed it . Instead of leaping four feet as he intended , he struck the top of the wall and tell heavily 2 , i feet below it . He went head downward struck on his stomach , rebounded. and lay on his back as if dead . Presently Officer William A. Spolasco. of the Broadway squad , came along and an ambulance was sent for the man who fell and a carriage to take home the young woman who had witnessed the accident and who was in violent hysterics . Just before an ambulance came from St. Vincent 's Hospital the man in the areas began to groan heavily , and it was believed that lie was only stunned by the fail . The ambulance surgeon had to go to the subcellar to reach his Patient , and to carry him to the base of the elevator shaft , and by the elevator into Brownell , Phelps &; Venino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his injuries were undoubtedly fatal , as his skull was fractured at the base , and the internal injuries were severe . Still the man waa able to talk disconnectedly , and his first utterance confirmed the belief expressed at the store that he was a thief , as he had not been seen there before he was at the window . Ho talked wildly in thieves ' argot of " cracking " several places , and of robberies here and there , arta also talked about women and especially of a Kitty Reynolds . An examination of the man 's effects confirmed the suspicion of his calling . He appeared to be about 30 years old , had sanay hair and a mustache , and wore a soft felt hat , a light woolen shirt , and a plaid coat and trousers . He had In his pocket a brand new copy of Roper 's " Engineers ' Handy Book , " publislied by Edward Meeks at Philadelphia .

There was no money in any pocket , but two pawn tickets showed that on Friday he had pawned a Spring overcoat and a watch . Several scraps of paper with memoranda on suggested that his name might be Frank , Frank L. , Howard F. , or F. E. Wood or Woods . An envelope stamped Cambridgeport , Mass. , was addressed to Howard F. Wood , Occidental Hotel , New-York , and such a man stopped there on the 6th inst. , but nothing is remembered of him . There was an express receipt for a bundle sent by F. E. W ood , of New-York , to J. IL Wood , Cambridgeport , and a lawyer 's receipt , the only legible part of which was as follows : Received of Frank Wood two diamonds as security for my fee , which are to be returned in one hour if not satisfactory .
