Child , Lydia Maria Francis , 1802-1880 : I thank thee , friend , for words of cheer from " I thank thee , friend , for words of cheer " ( 1882 ) I thank thee , friend , for words of cheer , That made the path of duty clear , When thou and I were young , and strong To wrestle with a mighty wrong . And now , when lengthening shadows come , And this world 's work is nearly done , I thank thee for thy genial ray , That prophesies a brighter day , When we can work , with strength renewed , In clearer light , for surer good . God bless thee , friend , and give thee peace , Till thy fervent spirit finds release ! And may we meet in worlds afar , My Morning and my Evening Star
