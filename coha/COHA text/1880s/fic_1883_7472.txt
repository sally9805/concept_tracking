Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : Wood-fringe from Wood-fringe ( 1883 ) Lightly as the green earth 's breath From the sod ascending , Flying tendril , fragile wreath With gray rock-tints blending ; Fluttering all your fringes out In the windy weather , You and the grim rocks , no doubt , Love to be together . As the sunshine seeks the shade Sister following brother , You and the rough crags were made Doubtless , for each other . Bless you ! up and down our walks Waving welcomes airy ! Bless you ! as you climb the rocks , Little woodland fairy ! Lucy Larcom
