CHESTER ALAN ARTHUR was born at Fairfield , Vermont , October 5 , 1830 . His father , the Reverend Doctor William Arthur , was a Baptist clergyman , who emigrated from county Antrim , Ireland , when only eighteen years of age . He had received a thorough classical education , and was graduated from Belfast University , one of the foremost institutions of learning in Ireland . Marrying an American , Miss Malvina Stone , soon after his arrival , he became the father of several children . Chester was the eldest of two sons , having four sisters older and two younger than himself . While fulfilling his clerical duties as the pastor , successively , of a number of Baptist churches in New York State , Dr. Arthur edited for several years The Antiquarian , and wrote a work on Family Names , which is highly prized by genealogists . Of Scotch-Irish descent , he was a man of great force of character , impatient of restraint , at home in a controversy , and frank in the expression of his opinions .

He was a personal friend of Gerrit Smith , and they had participated in the organization of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society , which was dispersed by a mob during its first meeting at Utica , on the twenty-first of October , 1835 ( Ihe day on which William Lloyd Garrison was mobbed in Boston , and was lodged in jail for his own protection ) . A friend of the slave from conscience and from conviction , Dr. Arthur was never backward in expressing his convictions , and his children imbibed his teachings . When a lad , young Arthur enjoyed at home the tutelage of his father , whose thorough knowledge of the classics enabled him to lay the foundation of his son 's future education broad and deep . He entered Union College in 1845 , when only fifteen years of age . His collegiate course was full of promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those who had Entered according to Act of congress , in the year 1884 , by John N.

CHESTER ALAN ARTHUR . // taken " maximum honors , " although he was compelled to absent himself during two winters , when he taught school to earn the requisite funds for defraying his expenses , without drawing upon his father 's means . Yet he kept up with his class , and when he was graduated in 1848 , he was one of six out of a class of over one hundred , who were elected members of the Phi Beta Kappa , an honor only conferred on the best scholars . Following the natural inclination of his mind , young Arthur began the study of law , supporting himself by teaching and by preparing boys for college . It so happened that two years after he was the preceptor of an academy at North Pownal , Vermont , a student from Williams College , named James A. Garfield , came there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1853 , young Arthur went to New York City , by the invitation of the Honorable Erastus D. Culver , whose acquaintance he had made when that gentleman represented the Washington County district , and Dr. Arthur was the pastor of the Baptist Church at Greenwich . Mr. Culver had been noted in Congress as an advanced , anti-slavery man , and he was prompted to take an interest in the son of a clergyman-constituent , who did not fear to express anti-slavery sentiments , at a time when the occupants of pulpits were generally so conservative that they were dumb upon this important question . Before the close of the year , young Arthur displayed such legal ability and business tact , that he was admitted into partnership , and became a member of the firm of Culver , Parker , and Arthur . The firm had numerous clients , and the junior partner soon became a successful practitioner , uniting to a thorough knowledge of the law a vigorous understanding and an untiring industry which gained for him an enviable reputation . Among other cases on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one known as the Lemon slave-case . A Virginian named Jonathan Lemon undertook to take eight slaves to Texas on steamers , by the way of New York . While in that city a writ of habeas corpus was issued , and the slaves were brought into the court before Judge Elijah Paine ; Mr. Culver and John Jay appearing for the slaves , while H. D. Lapaugh and Henry L. Clifton were retained by Lemon . Judge Paine , after hearing long arguments , declared that the fugitive slave law did not apply to slaves who were brought by their masters into a free State , and he ordered their release . The Legislature of Virginia directed the attorney-general of that State to employ counsel to appeal from Judge Paine 's decision to the Supreme Court of the State of New York . Mr. Arthur , who was the attorney of record in the case for the people , went to Albany , and after earnest efforts procured the passage of a joint resolution , requesting the governor to employ counsel to defend the interests of the State . Attorney-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the governor as counsel , and Mr. Arthur as the State 's attorney . The Supreme Court sustained Judge Paine 's decision . The slave-holder , unwilling to lose his " property , " then engaged Charles O'Conor to argue the case before the State Court of Appeals . There the counsel for the State were again successful in defending the decision of Judge Paine , and from that day no // slave-holder dared to bring his slaves into the city of New York . Mr. Arthur , who had naturally taken a prominent part in this case , was regarded by the colored people of New York as a champion of their interests , and it was not long before they sought his aid . At that time , colored people were not permitted to ride in the street-cars in New York City , with the exception of a few old and shabby cars set aside for their occupation . The Fourth - avenue line permitted them to ride when no other passenger made objection . One Sunday , in i 855 , Lizzie Jennings , a colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a colored Sunday-school , entered a Fourth-avenue car , and the conductor took her fare . Soon after , a drunken white man objected to her presence , and insisted that she be made to leave the car . The conductor pulled the bell , and when the car stopped , told her that she must get out , offering to return her fare . She refused , and the conductor then offered to put her off by force . She made vigorous resistance , exclaiming : " I have paid n*y fare , and I have a right to ride . " Finally , the conductor called in several policemen , and , by their joint efforts , she was removed from the car , her clothing having nearly all been torn from her in the struggle . When the leading colored people of the city heard of this , they sent a committee to the office of Culver , Parker , and Arthur , and requested them to make it a test case . Mr. Arthur brought suit against the railroad company for Miss Jennings , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial before Judge Rockwell , who then sat upon the bench there . He had just decided , in a previous case , that a corporation was not liable for the wrongful acts of its agent or servant , and when Mr. Arthur handed him the pleadings , he said that the railroad company was not liable , and was about to order a nonsuit . Mr. Arthur called his attention , however , to a recently revised section of the Revised Statutes , making certain railroad corporations which carried passengers liable for the acts of their conductors and drivers , whether wilful or negligent , under which the action had been brought . The judge was silenced , the case was tried , and the jury rendered a verdict of five hundred dollars damages in favor of the colored woman . The railroad company paid the money without further contest , and issued orders to its conductors to permit colored people to ride in its cars , an example that was followed by all the other street railroads in New York . The colored people , especially " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to Mr. Arthur , and for years afterward they celebrated the anniversary of the day on which he won the case that asserted their rights in public conveyances . When a lad , young Arthur had always taken a great interest in politics , and it is related of him that during the ClayPolk campaign of 1844 , while he and some of his companions were raising an ash pole in honor of Harry Clay , they were attacked by some Democratic boys , when young Arthur , who was the leader of the party , ordered a charge , and drove the young Democrats from the field with sore heads and subdued spirits . His first vote was cast in 1852 for Winfield Scott for President , and he identified himself with the Whigs of his ward when he located in New York // City . In those days the best citizens served as inspectors of elections at the polls , and for some years Mr. Arthur served in that capacity at a votingplace in a carpenter 's shop , which occupied the site of the present Fifth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed , Mr. Arthur was a prominent member of the Young Men 's Vigilance Committee , which advocated the election of Fr&amp;. mont and Dayton . It was during this campaign that he became acquainted with Edwin D. Morgan , and gained his ardent life-long friendship . Animated by a military spirit , Mr. Arthur sought recreation by joining the volunteer militia of New York , and he was appointed judge-advocate-general on the staff of Brigadier-General Yates , who commanded the second brigade . The general was a strict disciplinarian , and required his field , line , and staff officers to meet weekly for drill and instruction . Mr. Arthur thus acquired the rudiments of a military education , and became acquainted with many of those who afterwards distinguished themselves as officers in the volunteer army of the Union . General Arthur was married in 1859 to Ellen Lewis Herudon , of Fredericksburg , Virginia , a daughter of Captain William Lewis Herndon , of the United States Navy , who had gained honorable distinction when in command of the naval expedition sent to explore the river Amazon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history among those " names which will never be forgotten as long as there is remembrance in the world for fidelity unto death . " In command of the steamer Central America , which went down , with a loss of three hundred and sixty lives , he stood at his post on the wheelhouse , and succeeded in having the women and children safely transferred to the boats , remaining himself to perish with his vessel . General Sherman has characterized this grand deed of unselfish devotion as the most heroic incident in our naval history . Mrs. Arthur was a lady of the highest culture , and in the varied relations of life - wife , mother , friend - she illustrated all that gives to womanhood its highest charm , and commands for it the purest homage . She died in i88o , after an illness of but three days , leaving a son and a daughter , with a large number of mourning friends , not only in society , of which she was an ornament , but among the poor and the distressed , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Honorable Edward D. Morgan was elected Governor of the State of New York , he appointed Mr. Arthur engineer-in-chief on his stafi and when Fort Sumter was fired upon , the governor telegraphed to him to go to Albany , where he received orders to act as state quartermaster-general in the city of New York . General Arthur at once began to organize regiments , - uniform , arm , and equip them , - and send them to the defence of the capital . His capacity for leadership and organization was soon manifest . There was no lack of men or of money , but it needed organizing powers like his to mould them into disciplined form , to grasp the new issues with a masterhand , and to infuse earnestness and obedience into the citizens , suddenly transformed into soldiers . His accounts were kept in accordance with the army regulations , and their subsequent settlement with the United States , without deduction for unwarranted charges , was an easy task . It was by his exertions , // to a great extent , that the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ninety thousand men , nearly one fifth of the Grand Army of the Union . There were , of course , many adventurers who sought commissions , and some of the regiments were recruited from the rough element of city life , who soon refused to obey their officers . General Arthur made short work of these cases , exercising an authority which no one dared to dispute . Neither would he permit the army contractors to ingratiate themselves with him by presents , returning everything thus sent him . Although a comparatively poor man when he entered upon the duties of quartermaster-general at New York , he was far poorer when he gave up the office . A friend describing his course at this period , says : " So jealous was he of his integrity , that I have known instances where he could have made thousands of dollars legitimately , and yet he refused to do it on the ground that he was a public officer and meant to be , like C*sar 's wife , above suspicion . " When the rebel ironclad steamer Merrimac had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur , as engineer-in-chief , took efficient steps for the defence of New York , and made a thorough inspection of all the forts and defences in the State , describing the armament of each one . His report to the Legislature , submitted to that body in a little more than three weeks after his attention was called to the subject by Governor Morgan , was thus noticed editorially in the New York Herald of January 25 , 1862 : - " The report of the engineer-in-chief , General Arthur , which appeared in yesterday 's Hera*1d , is one of the most important and valuable documents that have been this year presented to our Legislature . It deserves perusal , not only on account of the careful analysis it contains of the condition of the forth , but because the recommendations , with which it closes , coincide precisely with the wishes of the administration with respect to securing a full and complete defence of the entire Northern coast . " Governor Morgan appointed General Arthur state inspector-general in February , 1862 , and ordered him to visit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potomac . While there , as an advance on Richmond was daily expected , he voluntered for duty on the staff of his friend , Major-General Hunt , commander of the Reserve Artillery . He had previously , when four fine volunteer regiments had been organized under the auspices of the metropolitan police commissioners of of the city of New York , and consolidated into what wa* known as the " Metropolitan Brigade , " been offered the command of it by the colonels of the regiments , but on making formal application , based on a desire to see active service in the field , Governor Morgan was unwilling that he should accept , stating that he could not be spared from the service of the State , and that while he appreciated General Arthur 's desire for war-service , he knew that he would render the country more efficient aid for the Union cause by remaining at his State post of duty . When , in June , 1862 , the situation had an unfavorable appearance , and there were apprehensions that a general draft would be necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Potomac , to return to New York . The General did // so , and was requested , on his arrival , to act as secretary at a confidential meeting of the governors of loyal States , held at the Astor House , on the twentyeighth of July , 1862 . After a full and frank discussion of the condition of affairs in their respective States , the governors united in a request to the President to call for more troops . President Lincoln , on the first of July , issued a proclamation , thanking the governors for their patriotism , and calling for three hundred thousand threeyears volunteers , and three hundred thousand nine - months militia - men . Private intimation that such a call was to be issued would have enabled army contractors to have made millions ; but the secret was honorably kept by all until after the issue of the proclamation . The quota of New York was 59,705 volunteers , or sixty regiments , and it was desirable that they should be recruited and sent to the front without delay . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties as quartermaster-ge*neral and established a system of recruiting and officering the new levies , which proved wonderfully successful . In his annual report , made to the governor on the twenty-seventh of January , 1863 , he said : - " In summing up the operations of the department during the last levy of troops , I need only state as the result the fact that through the single office and clothing department of this department in the city of New York , from August i to December i , the space of four months , there were completely clothed , uniformed , and equipped , supplied with camp and garrison equipage , and transported from this State to the seat of war , sixty-eight regiments of infantry , two battalions of cavalry , and four battalions and ten batteries of artillery . " In December , 1863 , the incoming of the Democratic state administration deprived General Arthur of his office . His successor , Quartermaster-General Talcott , in a report to Governor Seymour , paid the following just tribute to his predecessor : - " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-organized system of labor and accountability , for which the State is chiefly indebted to my predecessor , General Chester A. Arthur , who , by his practical good sense and unremitting exertion , at a period when everything was in confusion , reduced the operations of the department to a matured plan by which large amounts of money were saved to the government , and great economy of time secured in carrying out the details of the same . " Resuming his professional duties , at first in partnership with Mr. Gardiner and afterward alone , he became counsel to the city department of taxes and assessments , with an annual salary of ten thousand dollars , but he abruptly resigned the position when the Tammany Hall city officials attempted to coerce the Republicans connected with the municipal departments . When the next presidential election drew near , General Arthur entered enthusiastically into the support of General Grant , and was made chairman of the Grant Central Club , of New York . He also served as chairman of the executive committee of the Republican State Committee of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm of Arthur , Phelps , Knevals , and Ransom . President Grant , without solicitation and unexpectedly , appointed General // Arthur collector of the port of New York , on the twentieth of November , 1871 . He accepted the position with much hesitation , but it met with the general approval of the business community , many of the merchants having become personally acquainted with his business ability during the war . He instituted many reforms in the management of the custom-house , all calculated to simplify the business and to divest it , to a great extent , of all the details and routine so vexatious to the mercantile classes . The number of his removals during his administration was far less than during the rule of any other collector since i 857 , and the expense of collecting the duties was far less than it had been for years . So satisfactory was his management of the custom-house , that , upon the close of his term of service , December , 1875 , he was renominated by President Grant . The nomination was unanimously confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment very rarely paid , except to ex- senators . He was the first collector of the port of New York , with one or two exceptions , who in fifty years ever held the office for more than the whole term of four years . Two years later General Arthur was superseded as collector by General Merritt . The Honorable John Sherman , secretary of the treasury , on being questioned as to the cause of the removal of General Arthur as collector of customs at New York , said - " I have never said one word impugning General Arthur 's honor or integrity as a man and a gentleman , but he was not in harmony with the views of the administration in the management of the custom-house . I would vote for him for Vice-President a million times before I would vote for W. H. English , with whom I served in Congress. ** General Arthur , in a letter written by him to Secretary Sherman , on his administration of the New York customhouse , said : - " The essential elements of a correct civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , which , of course , prevents removals , except for cause . Second , promotion from the lower to the higher grades , based upon good conduct and efficiency . Third , prompt and thorough investigation of all complaints and prompt punishment of all misconduct . In this respect I challenge comparison with any department of the Government , either under the present or under any past national administration . I am prepared to demonstrate the truth of this statement on any fair investigation . " Appended to this letter was a table in which General Arthur showed that during the six years he had managed the office the yearly percentage of removals for all causes had been only two and three-quarters per cent . against an annual average of twenty-eight per cent . under his three immediate predecessors , and an annual average of about twenty-four per cent . since r 8* 7 , when Collector Schell took office . Out of nine hundred and twenty-three persons who held office when he became collector on December r , 1871 , there were five hundred and thirtyone still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his entire term . Concerning promotions , the statistics of the office show that during his entire term the uniform practice was to advance men from the lower to the higher grades , and almost without exception on the recommendation // of heads of departments . All the appointments , excepting two , to the one hundred positions paying two thousand dollars salary a year , and over , were made on this method . Senator George F. Edmunds , at a ratification meeting , held in Burlington , Vermont , on the twenty-second of June , i88o , said - " I have long known General Arthur . The only serious difficulty I have had with the present administration was when it proposed to remove him from the collectorship of New York . No one questioned his personal honor and integrity . I resisted the attempt to the utmost . Since that time it has turned out that all the reforms suggested had long before been recommended by General Arthur himself , and pigeonholded at Washington . " Meanwhile General Arthur had rendered great services as a member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had united his party from one success to another through all the mazes and intricacies which characterize the politics of New York City . VicePresident Wheeler said of him : - " It is my good fortune to know well General Arthur , the nominee for VicePresident . In unsullied character and in devotion to the principles of the Republican party no man in the organization surpasses him . No man has contributed more of time and means to advance the just interests of the Republican party . " The National Republican Convention , which assembled at Chicago , in June , i 88o , was an exemplification of the popular will . The respective friends of General Grant and of Mr. Blame , equally confident of success , indulged during a night 's session in prolonged demonstrations of applause when the candidates were presented that were unprecedented and that will not probably ever be repeated . Neither side was successful until the thirty-sixth ballot , when the nomination of President was finally bestowed on General Garfield , who had , as a delegate from Ohio , eloquently presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention then adjourned for dinner and for consultation . When it reassembled in the evening , the roll of States was called for the nomination for Vice-President . California presented B. B. Washburne ; Connecticut , exGovernor Jewell ; Florida , Judge Settle ; Tennessee , Horace Maynard . These successive names attracted little attention , but when ex-Lieutenant-Governor Woodford , of New York , rose , and , after a brief reference to the loyal support which New York had given to General Grant , presented the name of General Chester A. Arthur for the second place on the ticket , it was received with applause and enthusiasm . The nomination was seconded by exGovernor Denison , of Ohio , Emory A. Storrs , of Illinois , and John Cessna , of Pennsylvania . A vote was then taken with the following result : Arthur , 468 ; Washburne , is Maynard , 30 ; Jewell , 44 ; Bruce , 8 ; Davis , * and Woodford , i . The nomination of General Arthur was then made unanimous , and a committee of one from each State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as chairman , was appointed to notify General Garfield and General Arthur of their nomination . The convention then adjourned sine die . Returning to New York , General Arthur was welcomed by a large and influential gathering of Republicans , // who greeted him with hearty cheers . That night he was serenaded by a large procession of Republicans , which assembled in Union Square and marched past his residence in Lexington Avenue , with music and fireworks . A few weeks later , a letter was addressed to him , signed by Hamilton Fish , Noah Davis , and upwards of a hundred other prominent Republicans , inviting him to dine with them at the Union League Club , and stating that , in common with all true Republicans , they rejoiced at the happy issue of the earnest struggle in the Chicago convention . They hailed the general approval of its work as an auspicious omen , and looked forward confidently to the labors of the canvass . They felt an especial and personal gratification in the fact that the ticket selected at Chicago bore his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity in political affairs , so well understood by his fellow-citizens in New York , had met with national recognition and won for him this well-deserved honor . Their efforts in his support would be prompted , not only by personal zeal and enthusiasm , but by the warmth and zeal of strong personal friendship and esteem . That they might have an opportunity more fully to express to him their sincere congratulations and hearty good wishes , they invited him to meet them at dinner at the Union League Club . General Arthur , in acknowledging the receipt of this letter , expressed his sense of the kindness which had prompted both the invitation itself and the flattering assurances of confidence and regard by which it was accompanied . If circumstances had permitted , he should have been pleased to have accepted the proffered hospitality , and for that purpose no more congenial spot could have been selected than the headquarters of the Union League Club , an association so widely famed for its patriotic zeal and energy , and so efficient in the support of the principles and policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from considerations of a private nature known to many , to decline the invitation . On the fifteenth of July , i88o , General Arthur formally accepted the position assigned to him by the Chicago convention , and expressed at length his own personal views on the election laws , public service appointments , the financial problems of the day , common schools , the tariff , national improvements , and a Republican ascendency , saying , in conclusion , that he did not doubt that success awaited the Republican party , and that its triumph would assure a just , economical , and patriotic administration . The political campaign of i88o was earnestly contested by the great political parties . The Republicans were victorious , and their ticket bearing the names of Garfield and Arthur was triumphantly elected . On the fourth of March , i88i , General Arthur took the oath of office in the Senate Chamber as Vice-President of the United States , and half an hour later General Garfield was inaugurated on a platform before the east front of the Capitol , in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with music and banners . When the ceremony was concluded , the distinguished personages around the new President tendered their congratulations , the assembled multitude cheered , and a salute fired by a light battery stationed near by was echoed by the guns at the navy // yard , the arsenal , and the forts around the metropolis . Republicans congratulated each other on the indications of a vigorous administration , governed by a conscientious determination to promote harmony . But a few months had elapsed , however , before President Garfield was cruelly assassinated , in the full vigor of his manhood , and the Republican party was at first stricken with apprehensions . These gloomy doubts , however , soon disappeared as the incidents of Mr. Arthur 's patriotic and useful life were recalled , and a generous confidence was soon extended to the new President . President Arthur took the oath of office in New York immediately after the death of General Garfield , and he repeated it in the Capitol on the twenty-second of September , in the Vice-President 's room . The members of General Garfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue for the present in charge of their respective departments , were present , with General Sherman in full uniform , ex-Presidents Hayes and Grant , and Chief Justice Waite in his judicial robes , escorted by Associate Justices Harlan and Matthews . There were , also , present Senators Anthony , Sherman , Edmunds , Hale , Blair , Dawes , and Jones , of Nevada , and Representatives Amos Townsend , McCook , Errett , Randall , Hiscock , and Thomas . Ex-Vice-President Hamlin , of Maine , and Speaker Sharpe , of New York , were also present . When President Arthur entered the room , escorted by General Grant and Senator Jones , he advanced to a small table , on which was a Bible , and behind which stood the Chief Justice , who raised the sacred volume , opened it ; and presented it to the President , who placed his right hand upon it . Chief Justice Waite then slowly administered the oath , and at its conclusion the President kissed the book , responding , " I will , so help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS . For the fourth time in the history of the Republic its Chief Magistrate has been removed by death . All hearts are filled with grief and horror at the hideous crime which has darkened our land ; and the memory of the murdered President , his protracted sufferings , his unyielding fortitude , the example and achievements of his life and the pathos of his death , will forever illumine the pages of our history . For the fourth time the officer elected by the people and ordained by the Constitution to fill a vacancy so created is called to assume the executive chair . The wisdom of our fathers , foreseeing even the most dire possibilities , made sure that the Government should never be imperiled because of the uncertainty of human life . Men may die , but the fabrics of our free institutions remain unshaken . No higher or more assuring proof could exist of the strength and permanence of popular government than the fact that , though the chosen of the people be struck down , his constitutional successor is peacefully installed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Prosperity blesses our country ; our fiscal policy is fixed by law , is well grounded , and generally approved . No threatening issue mars our foreign intercourse , and the wisdom , integrity , and thrift of our people may be trusted to continue undisturbed the present assured career of peace , tranquillity , and welfare .

Summoned to these high duties and responsibilities , and profoundly conscious of their magnitude and gravity , I assume the trust imposed by the Constitution , relying for aid on Divine guidance and the virtue , patriotism , and intelligence of the American people . As President Arthur read his message his voice trembled , but his manner was impressive , and the eyes of many present were moistened with tears . The first one to congratulate him when he had concluded was Chief Justice XVaite , and the next was Secretary Blame . After shaking him by the hand , those present left the room , which was closed to all except the members of the Cabinet , who there held their first conference with the President . At this cabinet meeting the following proclamation was prepared and signed by President Arthur , designating the following Monday as a day of fasting , humiliation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America ; A PROCLAMATION : Whereas , in his inscrutable wisdom , it has pleased God to remove from us the illustrious head of the Nation , James A.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed . // Done at the city of Washington , the twenty-second day of September , in the year of our Lord ( SEAL. 1881 , and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and sixth . CHESTER A. ARTHUR . By the President : JAMES G. BLAINE , Secretary of State . President Arthur soon showed his appreciation of the responsibilities of his new office . Knowing principles rather than persons , he subordinated individual preferences and prejudices to a well-defined public policy . While he was , as he always had been , a Republican , he had no sympathy for blind devotion to party ; he had " no friends to reward , no enemies to punish ; "  --  and he has been governed by those principles of liberty and equality which he inherited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even unfriendly critics have pronounced them careful and wellmatured documents . Their tone is more frank and direct than is customary in such papers , and their recommendations , extensive and varied as they have been , show that he has patiently reviewed the field of labor so sadly and so unexpectedly opened before him , and that he was not inclined to shirk the constitutional duty of aiding Congress by his suggestions and advice . An honest man , who believes in his own principles , who follows his own convictions , and who never hesitates to avow his sentiments , he has given his views in accordance with his deliberate ideas of right . The foreign relations of the United States have been conducted by Secretary Frelinghuysen , under the Presi dent 's direction , in a friendly spirit and when practicable with a view to mutual commercial advantages . He has taken a conservative view of the management of the public debt , approving all the important suggestions of the secretary of the treasury , and recognizing the proper protection of American industry . He is in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such tinkering with the tariff as will make vain the toil of the industrious farmer , paralyze the arm of the sturdy mechanic , strike down the hand of the hardy laborer , stop the spindle , hush the loom , extinguish the furnace-fires , and degrade all independent toilers to the level of the poor in other lands . The architect of his own fortune , he has a strong and abiding sympathy for those bread-winners who struggle against poverty . The reform of the civil service has met with President Arthur 's earnest support , and his messages show that every department of the government has received his careful administration . Following the example of Washington , he has personally visited several sections of the United States , and has especially made himself acquainted with the great problem of Indian civilization . President Arthur 's administration has been characterized by an elevated tone at home and abroad . All important questions have been carefully discussed at the council table , at which the President has displayed unusual powers of analysis and comprehension . The conflicting claims of applicants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed , and no action has been taken until all parties interested have had a hearing .
