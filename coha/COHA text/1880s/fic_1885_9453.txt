Enter Villagers , at rise of curtain , across bridge , with flowers , festoons , &c.,; singing rural music .

Vil . Villager ( looking off , r 2 e ) . Long live the bride , Stephen . Ay , and do n't forget the bridegroom , too , Ambrose Verney . No doubt he would like to have a little ' long life ' too , if you are willing ( music ) . Mabel enters from house , r 2 e , with Dorothy . Is dressed as a bride . Mab . Mable Grey Thanks , friends  --  you are before the hour . We start to church at ten , and now ' t is but little after nine ( surprised ) And the mill at work , too , on such a day as this . Stev . Steven Ay ; but he is n't , Mabel ; for he gave orders for no one to work to-day , except old farmer White , who has been sick a long time , and unable to get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mill to-day , free of charge . A charitable deed ! Mab . Mable Grey Noble man !  --  his heart is ever open to distress . May the bright opening of this happy day be an auspicious omen for the future , and may I ( solemnly ) be enabled to make our union one long and pleasant dream . Dor . Deborah Which it will be , if he but remembers what I told him when I gave him your hand . Mab . Mable Grey With regard to drink ? ( proudly ) Have no fears , mother , Ambrose 's word is enough . Dor . Deborah Yes , child ; but I remember your father 's resolve ( wipes her eyes ) . This very day forty years ago , upon his bended knees , he pledged his word , in presence of our parents , never to let the demon , drink , pass his lips . Then , as now , had assembled a crowd of friends with joyful wishes . I , like you , attired in spotless white , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard the vow , and I believed it . What was the sequel ? You know it , child  --  ruin ! starvation ! death ! Mab . Mable Grey Oh , mother , why conjure up these horrid fancies on a day like this ? All night long I heard you praying , while you thought I slept . Would you turn this day of sunshine to one of sorrow and mistrust ? Dor . Deborah No , child . Your happiness is all I ask . Mine lies in the future , in another home , where the curse of drink , with its blighting , withering breath , enters not . Do not wonder that I hate , yes , curse its very name ( mill stops working ) . Mab . Mable Grey Ambrose shall renew his promise of never tasting of it again , until you are satisfied that your foolish fears are false . Dor . Deborah ( sa dly ) . As others have done before . No , Mabel , the resolve must come from the heart , not the lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the moment of temptation . Stev . Steven See , the mill has stopped . It wo n't be long before you see Ambrose , as smiling as the sun on this beautiful morning . Here he comes , and with him his friend , Joe Bennet . ( Music ) . Enter Ambrose and Joe , wearing bridal favours .  --  Come over bridge , and down c.  --  Ambrose kisses Mabel and her Mother . Amb . A mbrose Verney What , all assembled ? I thought I was early myself , but I see the whole village is before me . Nay , then I must offer an excuse . Mab . Mable Grey There is no need , Ambrose , we know what detained you . But , to tell the truth , I am glad you have come . Everything had begun to look more like a funeral than a wedding-morning . Amb . Ambrose Verney And why , sweet ? You do not begin to doubt the sincerity of my love , do you ? Mab . Mable Grey Hush ! do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes forward ) . Ah ! this looks like business . Guests all assembled  --  bride lovely  --  bridegroom all radiant with smiles  --  lovely morning  --  the flowers all in bloom . Oh ! ecstatic moment ! There is but one thing needed to complete our happiness  --  a steaming jug of punch , or the pop of the champagne cork . But here , in this simple community , we must content ourselves with a plain whisky straight , I suppose . Dor . Deborah ( comes forward ) . I am afraid , sir , you must content yourself with water from the well . We have no other beverage to offer . Joe . Joe Bennett Well water ? My dear lady , I have n't tasted the fluid for fifteen years . Do you want to poison me ? Amb . Ambrose Verney ( aside to Joe ) . Easy , Joe ; remember where you are . We run strictly on the temperance principle here . Joe . Joe Bennett What unfortunate creatures ; they are to be pitied ! Let us hope they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 'll have one bottle before we start to church , wo n't we ? Amb . Ambrose Verney No . I too am about to change my course of life . Hereafter , nothing intoxicating shall pass my lips ; water only , if I must drink . Joe . Joe Bennett What ! Amb . Ambrose Verney Joe , I 've passed my word to Mabel , here . She even refused to marry me , unless I made her a solemn promise . That promise ( with great force ) I mean to keep ! Joe Joe Bennett ( aside ) . Perhaps . ( aloud ) What ! after the many carouses we 've had together ? set your face against the Widow Clicquot , or refuse to steady your nerves of a morning with a good cocktail ? for shame ! Think of the good old times ! Fifteen before dinner , just to make your step elastic , and aid digestion ; and at night a steaming jug , and the appetite to swig it . Visions of angelic delight ; no thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ambrose Verney Rather dreams of horrible fancies through the night , to awake next morning , with a splitting head , and cursing the day before , that brought it . Joe . Joe Bennett Exactly , till you ' rosin your bow ' with an eye-opener , to steady your nerves for the day , and then , then , you are an Emperor ! Amb . Ambrose Verney Precisely . Till the day comes when the Emperor becomes a beggar ! ( goes up stage ) . Joe . Joe Bennett ( aside ) . Curse the fellow ! I 'm afraid he 's too far gone . But for that resolve , all might be mine ,  --  mill , land , nay , even Mabel herself ! She spurned my offer of marriage for his handsome face . Why should he mount , and I go down ? No , no ! I 'll show my proud young lady that her dear Ambrose is , after all , only human . A few drops of this opium ( shows phial ) in the glass might indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be tried . Yes , my little friend , you have an important part to play in this new act of mine . Ambrose and Mabel come down c . Amb . Ambrose Verney ( jokingly ) . Why are you so riveted to that one spot ? What villany are you hatching ? Joe . Joe Bennett I was thinking of what you have just said . I too will travel another road for the future . Mab . Mable Grey If the path be an honourable one , I trust you may be successful . Joe Joe Bennett ( aside ) . I trust I may be ; for it is the wreck of your intended husband 's hopes , and the possession of yourself , my lady ! ( aloud ) . Of my intentions , Mabel , you shall yourself one day be judge ( peal of bells heard outside ) . Amb . Ambrose Verney Hark ! That peal proclaims the hour . Oh , Mabel ! how my heart beats in response to those joyous sounds ! They proclaim a new existence to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see beyond a garden teeming with golden fruit , my senses are bewildered . Oh ! had I the power , I would make all the world a paradise ! all God 's children happy , in return for the happiness I feel in the possession of thy love . Mab . Mable Grey May that feeling sink so deeply in our hearts that we may be enabled to make our home a heaven , until we are called to a better and surer one above ! ( Amb. kisses her .  --  they go up ) . Stev . Steven Hello ! who 's coming here , and running like a colt ? Why ! its Fanny Shivers , and Bob Shakes , running as if the cholera was after them ( Music ) . Enter Fanny Shivers and Bob Shakes , over bridge , r u e down l 2 c expressing pleasure . Bob . Bob Shakes Speak ! is it all over ? Is the dreadful deed accomplished ? All . All What is it ? What do you mean ? Fan . Fanny Shivers Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not yet , but will be , I trust , before the clock strikes eleven . ( Bob . faints with joy ; Villagers support him ) . Fan . Fanny Shivers Oh ! with running , I 'm in such a flutter , that  --  oh ! water , he 's off again ? the third time this morning . Bob . Bob Shakes No , no ! brandy , it 's the only sure remedy ( they bring him water , he does not move ; Joe takes brandy from pocket and gives him  --  he revives instantly ) . Joe . Joe Bennett Thank goodness ! we have one sensible man among us ; he knows the value of a good nip . Fan . Fanny Shivers Yes ! but I 'll nip that nip in the bud ! Did n't you promise my father , when you asked my hand this morning , that you 'd give over your drinking from that moment ? Bob . Bob Shakes Yes . But that moment was such a sweet one ,  --  I 'll keep it up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not with my consent ! Now , here in the presence of our friends , the same bargain Mabel made with Ambrose , I will make with you . If we go to church , and are married with them , never a drop of drink shall pass your lips from this day . Come , promise ! Mab . Mable Grey Yes , Bob , promise Fanny , if she is to be your wife , she would not counsel you do wrong . Amb . Ambrose Verney Yes , do , Bob , do ! Bob . Bob Shakes ( to Amb . ) Et tu , Brute ? Must I part with with my soother , my comforter ! who when the natural timidity of my disposition has make me shake like a bowlful of jelly with an ague , has stiffened my back , and put firmness in my quaking legs , when Mrs Winslow 's soothing syrup , and assafoetida have failed to nerve me ; and has never yet gone back on me ? must I , must I ? Omnes . Omnes Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob Shakes Thanks for these words of encouragement ! ( to bottle ) . Old friend ! you and I have passed many a pleasant hour together , but from this time forth  --  ( drinks  --  Fan . seizes bottle and puts it on table )  --  from this time forth we are strangers . ( to Joe winking ) Got a half pint that pop ? Now then , I 'm ready to be led to the sacrifice like a tender lamb . Fan . Fanny Shivers Lamb ! you look more like a goose . Bob . Bob Shakes Goose ! Yesterday she called me an ass , to-morrow I 'll be an elephant , and before I 've been married a year I 'll be Barnum 's whole Zoological show . Amb . Ambrose Verney But how comes it you are to be married , too ? Force of example , eh ? Bob . Bob Shakes Oh , no ! the force of circumstances . Omnes . Omnes Let 's hear it . Bob . Bob Shakes I will . ( aside ) That last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my natural shyness , friend . Omnes . Omnes Yes , yes . Bob . Bob Shakes I have long loved Fanny , but I never had the cheek to ask her hand . Fan . Fanny Shivers Cheek ! you 've cheek enough for anything ! Bob . Bob Shakes No , my dear , firmness . Well , when I heard the parson sing out Ambrose Verney and Mabel Gray , I thought how sweet it would sound if it was only Bob Shakes and Fanny Shivers , and so I says to myself , says I , Shivers and Shakes always go together , why should n't they in this case ? United we stand , divided we fall ( all laugh ) . Ha ! ha ! ( aside ) . I 'm getting warmed up to my work ,  --  I wish I had another toothful . ( aloud ) So I got up bright and early this morning , arrayed myself gorgeously , as you see , and started for old Mr Shivers ' cottage . Mab . Mable Grey Why , that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see I fortified my feeble frame with a big glass of  --  Omnes . Omnes Eh , oh ! Bob Bob Shakes ( winks at Joe , l ) . Water ,  --  cool and sparkling from the well . Then I said to Mr Shivers thusly : ' Mr Shivers , I long have loved your only offspring , Miss Fanny , she loves me . There 's to be a wedding to-day  --  suppose we make it two . Say but the word to make me happy . Amb . Ambrose Verney Which word he spoke , of course ? Bob . Bob Shakes Only one , yes ; he told me to ' get , ' and I got ! Then I took another glass of  --  water , returned and pressed my suit . In the meantime , he had taken his breakfast and felt in a better humour , so he said ' yes , ' ( aside to Joe ) and he added , ' Take her , I 'm glad to get rid of her ,  --  the brute ! ' Fan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father could not withstand his entreaties ; ( aside to Mab. ) and I did n't know that I would ever have another offer , said yes . Bob . Bob Shakes When does the show commence ? The bells are ringing for Ambrose and Mabel , why not for Sarah  --  I mean Fanny ? Fan . Fanny Shivers Shakes , are you happy now ? Bob . Bob Shakes How could I be otherwise ! Have n't I got my Shivers ? When yonder sun sinks behind the horizon , Shivers will be absorbed and become all Shakes . I tremble at the thought . ( aside ) That last mouthful made me poetical , I do believe . Mab . Mable Grey Friends , will you not come in until it is time to go to the church ? On our return , if it pleases you , we will have a dance on the lawn . Amb . Ambrose Verney Mabel , excuse me to our friends , I want to make my peace with Joe . He seems offended at his rebuke , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes outside ) . Mab . Mable Grey Come , friends , there 's no time to lose . Hark ! the bells again remind us ' t is almost time to depart ( music ,  --  exit all but Joe and Amb . ) Amb . Ambrose Verney ( pats him on back ) . Why , Joe , why so moody ? Joe Joe Bennett ( l ) . Oh , nothing ! ( aside ) . Now to play my cards well . ( aloud ) . Only I thought you were my friend . Amb . Ambrose Verney I am and always was . We need not become strangers because I do not choose to travel a road that leads to misery . I am the best judge of the course I should pursue , and I do not seek to interfere with others in their choice . Joe . Joe Bennett Oh ! of course . It will be so genteel to hear folks say , ' There goes Ambrose Verney , the reformed drunkard ! ' Ha ! ha ! Amb . Ambrose Verney Drunkard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are regarded as drunkards by your model temperance people , ai n't they ? Amb . Ambrose Verney I must confess I hardly see where the dividing line between drinkers and drunkards can be drawn . And so , as you say , it is a mere question of time and circumstances , when they may become the latter . Joe . Joe Bennett Spoken like a true son of temperance ! But your strictly temperate man  --  Amb . Ambrose Verney Can never become a drunkard ! I have learned to know what 's right , and knowing it , with Heaven 's aid , I will keep the pledge I have made to that pure and trusting girl to-day . Joe Joe Bennett ( contemptuously ) . Oh , I know how it is when a woman 's arms are around your neck , and her eyes are looking into yours , you 'd promise anything  --  you ca n't help it ! You 'd even denounce your former friends as drunken vagabonds , merely because they differ from her notions about the good things of earth . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say use not abuse . Amb . Ambrose Verney Arguments might tempt some men , not me , Joe . Enter Bob from house . Bob . Bob Shakes Oh , you two are there , are you ? Joe , that last snifter nerved me up wonderfully . I think one more thimblefull would give me courage to stand up before the parson and say ' yes , ' boldly . Joe . Joe Bennett You shall have it , lad . There 's the ' Lethe ' in which to drown your cares ( takes out bottle , fills two glasses , gives one to Bob ) . Verney , pledge one to your beautiful Mabel ,  --  the last one , old boy , we shall ever take together . Amb . Ambrose Verney No , no ! Bob . Bob Shakes No ? idiotic miller ! Refuse a social glass ! Send for the undertaker at once . Joe . Joe Bennett Oh , he dare n't offend his intended wife ! Perhaps if you should ask permission of your respected mother-in-law , she might give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last glass  --  ( laughs )  --  or sweet Mabel might unloose her apron strings for once . Amb . Ambrose Verney Joe , you say it will be the last ? Joe Joe Bennett ( solemnly ) . The last , I swear ! Oh , but you would n't dare ,  --  he is such a good young man ! ha ! ha ! Amb . Ambrose Verney ( angrily ) . Give me the cup ! ( Joe fills it , drops in the opium .  --  Music .  --  Spirit rises from the well , comes down between them , passes Amb. as he raises the glass ,  --  he hesitates .  --  Aside ) An invisible power seems to hover near me , and bids me think of my promise . Oh !  --  pshaw ! this is weakness , and I shall become the laughing stock of others . Joe . Joe Bennett Well , do you refuse to drink success to Mabel Gray ? Bob . Bob Shakes Or Miss Shivers ? Not I , if I was forced to drain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Mabel Gray ! and may her new life be as blest as I do wish it . Joe . Joe Bennett ( aside ) . As blest as I wish it , and it will not be a happy one ( all drink ) . Amb . Ambrose Verney Give me the bottle ! It is the last shall ever cross my lips ( tries to throw away bottle ) . Bob . Bob Shakes ( seizing it ) . Madman ! what would you do ? Destroy your only friend ? ( hugging it , sings ) . Friend of my soul ! how I love to embrace thee ! ( drinks ) , and swallow thee too ! The last shall ever cross my lips from that bottle , for I 'll get a new one to-morrow ! ( Music .  --  Chimes heard ) . All the Villagers enter from house .  --  Mabel and Dorothy c.  --  Fanny goes to Bob . Mab . Mable Grey Come , Ambrose , that peal reminds me we must be off . Why ! what ails you ? your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , you 've broken your promise , and taken of the poisoned cup . Amb . Ambrose Verney But one , Mabel  --  I am unused  --  oh , fool that I was ! Why was I tempted ? Wretch ! ( music .  --  he rushes to Joe who throws him off , he falls c , unconscious .  --  Bob seizes Joe so ) . Bob . Bob Shakes Wretch ! you have blighted my young heart ! Why did you offer me brandy , when you knew my weakness was old rye ! ( Joe throws Bob off , he falls . Fan . over him l ) . Dor . D eborah My fears were true . The old , old story ! Mabel , did I not say right ? Mab . Mable Grey Oh ! mother , do not madden me ! Dor . Deborah Come away , do not disgrace yourself , by sympathising with a sot ! Mab . Mable Grey Oh ! Ambrose , is this the bow of promise that shone so brightly in our heaven ? No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's been some villany at work . Joe Bennet , I can trace your devilish hand in this ! ' t was you who tempted him ; to put a rival out of your own path . But plot on ! and if never my husband , Ambrose Verney shall , at least , have a true friend in Mabel Grey !

Spirit of Temperance Behold the effect of good intentions broken , The wish was at his heart , the words were spoken ; To leave the drunkard 's path , nor wine to sip , Nor any liquid poison touch his lip . Nor could his loved one 's smile stay his hand , The tempter 's voices sound more sweet and bland ; Now let this lesson teach all here to know , There 's but one way to avoid the dreadful blow .

My dear mother beneath the sod , and he who should be my protector wasting our little means till all is now exhausted . One by one , I have parted with our household articles , until beggary and ruin stare us in the face . Poor infant ! what a bleak and ruinous prospect is in store for you ( clock strikes one .  --  Joe , Bob , and Amb. , heard singing without , ' We wo n't go home till morning . '  --  all tipsy ) .

Mable Grey Begone ! Bob . Bob Shakes Wonder if she ai n't a little huffy ? I dare n't lick her ,  --  I 'd like to . But I can lick my own wife , that 's one comfort left me still ( exit c d ) . Joe . Joe Bennett Mrs Verney , do n't be so snappish to an old friend . Mab . Mable Grey Friend ! Oh , yes , the world is full of such friends !

He 's old enough to know when to refuse a social glass , and if he does get a little top-heavy , what 's the harm , eh ? Mab . Mable Grey This : robbing me and our child of our lawful rights ,  --  food , health , comfort . Forsaking those he has sworn to watch over for the company of low , bestial , heaven-forsaken wretches like his friend , Joe Bennett . Joe . Joe Bennett Hilloa ! Mrs Verney , no hard words , or I 'll hit back . There 's your husband , keep him to yourself ; put him under lock and key , the dear man , and see if he will rise above this low estate I 've brought him to . Mab . Mable Grey Yes , miserable cur !

Mable Grey Oh , merciful powers ! my fears were then too true . Say , man , why have you done this thing ? Why have you made this wreck ? Why have you broken my heart ? ( weeps ) . Joe . Joe Bennett Why , Mabel ? Because you chose to marry Ambrose Verney , rather than be the wife of Joe Bennett . Mab . Mable Grey As there is an All-seeing eye , this act will not go unavenged !

But you have lost all mill , land , house ,  --  and in exchange you have for a husband  --  Mab . Mable Grey A drunkard ; and you have made him so . Now , hear me , and mark well my prophecy ; that mill shall be your tomb .

Fanny Shivers Because you 've had all my money to pay your rum bills ; and , now , after I 've told you I wo n't pay any more , you 've the cheek to bring in an another . Bob .

But I 'll call on the wives of all the drunken husbands within five miles of here ( and they number about two hundred ) and will go to the gin mill of old Blear-Eye Apple-Jack , and clear it out . Yes , and we 'll go armed and equipped according to law . Bob . Bob Shakes Would you bring disgrace on your husband by such an unwomanly act ? Fan . Fanny Shivers Has n't he brought ruin and disgrace on the whole country round ? Bob . Bob Shakes ( solemnly ) . My dear , it 's not his fault ; men will drink . Fan .

Look at my cheek , all sunken ; I used to have plenty of it ( weeps ) . Fan . Fanny Shivers And have more than is good for you now . No , Bob Shakes , I shall return to the bosom of my family . Bob .

One voice said , ' The poor girl has poisoned herself ! ' With an irresistible impulse I followed . I entered a filthy hallway , and with a beating heart mounted the ricketty stair . In a wretched attic room lay a young girl , I parted the crowd and rushed in ,  --  grasping the coverlid from her face I beheld  --  my sister . I gasped for breath , my knees sank under me .
