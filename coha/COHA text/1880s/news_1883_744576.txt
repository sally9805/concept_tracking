txt The Secretary of War appears to have suddenly awakened to a perception of the fact that the West Point Academy is behind the age . He has sent out a commission , the members of which are Professors at the Academy , to visit the leading colleges of the country and to ascertain what modern improvements in education they have adopted . " It is desirable , " remarks the Secretary , " that West Point should avail itself of everything which is commended and indorsed by the ripe experience of our leading institutions of learning . " Of course it is , and we may now hope that West Point will not much longer suffer under the reproach of being old-fashioned and unworthy to be compared with modern American colleges . The most important . change which has taken place in , our leading colleges is not the adoption of new studies but . the acceptance on the part of the college authorities of the theory that an under graduate is a thoughtful , intelligent , and mature man . Thirty years ago it , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 16 or 17 was a boy . The college Faculty always assumed that a boy of 17. who was sent away from home to college , needed the guidance and restraint of his instructors . The idea that the boy knew when it was best for him to study , and when it was best for him to be idle ; that his principles were so firmly fixed that there was not the slightest danger that he would be guilty of disorderly or immoral conduct ; that his judgment .. was in all things better than that of any member of the Faculty , and that he should be permitted to do whatever he pleased , had not yet dawned upon teachers or undergraduates. , Hence , college students were made subject to rules . They were required to study , to remain in their rooms at night and to obey the college laws . In short , the theory and practice still prevailing at West Point prevailed at all American colleges a generation Sin ? . With the adoption of the new theory that the undergraduate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature man who needs no restraint , and to whom advice is usually an insult , the character of our leading colleges has greatly changed . " College boys " no longer exist . They are all " men , " and the President or Professor who ventures to treat a student as if he were not at least the equal of any of his instructors in experience and discretion is very soon made , to understand that he is unfit to deal with " men . " The student attends recitations or " cuts " them , as he thinks fit , and outside of the recitation-room he is exclusively his own master , and does what seems good in his eyes . The conversion of " college boys " into " men " is the chief of our modern improvements in education , and the West Point Commission can not fail to take notice of the fact . If , as Secretary LuccorzT says , the West Point Academy is to " keep abreast with the spirit of the age , " it must be conducted in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Attendance upon recitations should be made optional , and every Cadet should be permitted to select and pursue those studies which he regards as least disagreeable . The Cadets should be allowed to live where they please , instead of being compelled to live in barracks , and should be free to go and come without the degrading necessity of applying for leave of absence . In short , what is called discipline should be utterly abolished , and instead of regarding the Cadets as boys who need government , the West Point authorities should recognize the fact that the Cadets are men who know what is best for themselves far better than the Faculty can possibly know . The abolition of discipline will not , however , alone suffice to , keep West Point " abreast with the spirit of the age . " The Secretary of War must have noticed with shame that in the long list of intercollegiate base-ball games recently published the name of West Point does not appear . Strange as it may seem to admirers of modern improvements in education , neither base-ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The students are confined to essentially the same curriculum of mathematics and special military studies which was established at a time when the higher athletic sciences were comparatively unknown . The West Point Cadet has no boat crew on which to bet , and he is deprived of the privilege of attending an intercollegiate boat race , where he can hurrah for his own crew , and where , after the race is over , he can get drunk and make the night hideous with uproar and di order . He can not represent the Academy at a foot-ball fight , and knock down his opponents or be knocked down by them , and lie has no chance to secure the breaking of his nose and fingers while playing in a baseball match . All this must be changed and West Point must avail itself of the ripe experience of our leading institutions of learning in ball-playing and boot-racing . Let the West Point Cadet have every opportunity to study the athletic sciences and the old-fashioned theory that he should be made to study and behave himself in an orderly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " abreast with the spirit of the age .
