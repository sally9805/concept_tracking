ARTICLE VIII. - TAXATJON IN THE UNITED STATES . I. THE RiGHT OF TAxATiON . PHIr*IPrE AND Co. , manufacturers , of Geneva , Switzerland , recently sold a consignment of watches to Brown and Co. , of New York , merchants , for one thousand dollars , charges for shipment included . The goods were seized by the government upon arrival at New York , partly for verification of the accompanying invoice , partly as security for the ad valorem duty of twenty-five per centum ; that is , they were subject to a farther charge of two hundred and fifty dollars before delivery to the consignees . The full value of them having been already paid the manufacturers , what right had the government , or since the government is but the arm of the law , and the law but the articulate expression of the will of the people , what right had the people to impose the additional charge ? In other words , what exactly are the origin , nature , and limits of the right of taxation . It is clear to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all determine its moral character . The peojide is well able to will what it pleases and to express its will with all due formality , but if the thing willed is itself wrong the effect of the law is simply to generalize the wrong by extending it to include all cases of the same kind . Summumlus summa na ; the worst injustice is the literal construction and stric:t enforcement of an unj ust law . So there is really no property within its reach which the people can not most lawfully appropriate . But like other moral agents it can rightfully appropriate only what belongs to it ; a self-evident truth of ethics and in logic an identical proposition . What the people rightfully appropriates is its own ; what is not its own it can not rightfully appropriate . So in the case supposed , the government is ready if need be to enforce through its tribunals the claim of the manufacturers to the stipulated price of the watches ; put upon its defense outside of them it must be able to show that its own title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole cost of the goods to Brown and Co. , is $1,2*O , four-fifths of which are the rightful property of the manufacturers ; is the remaining fifth equally the rightful property of the government , and if it is , is it so under the same title or under a different one ? I. The earlier title of the two explains itself without difficulty . The manufacturers at Geneva have offered in the open market and subject to no constraint other than the conditions of the market itself a certain number of watches for a certain sum of money , and the merchants at New York , subject only to the same conditions , have accepted the offer ; or conversely , one party having sold the goods for the money , the other the money for the goods . Allowance made for errors of judgment and for incidental exigencies of business there has been an exchange of equivalents with the full and free consent of both parties to the exchange , a type of the legitimate transactions of commerce the world over . The result is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of the money , Philippe and Co. a corresponding title to the money on delivery of the watches ; a title issuing clear and indisputable from the transaction itself , anterior to and reaffirmed by all law , respected by the most lawless revolution . Furthermore if we excep1* the case of voluntary gift or bequest there is , in this case , no other title possible . Philippe and Co. must have acquired the money , as Brown and Co. the goods , either with the consent of the other party and in exchange for an equivalent , or without their consent and without an equivalent ; that is by force , or by fraud , which is a kind of force . To qualify the orderly exercise of public power according to law as an act of force , is so repugnant to our democratic sensibilities , and our disposition to generalize is so strong , that we have an elaborate theory which assimilates the title under which the government takes the duty upon the goods to the previous title under which the seller takes the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of equivalents with the consent of both parties to the exchange . What the government , on the one hand , supplies , is the benefits of government , the complex conditions of security to person and property which enable Brown and Co. to import watches and // keep them on sale . The commercial value of an article is the price which it will bring , and to this value the government has as distinctly contributed as the manufacturers , for in the absence of all government watches could not be made and sold at all . On their side Brown and Co. pay the stipulated price for the value contributed , purchasing protection from the government as they purchase watches from the manufacturers . But this again is only an item in a general account , an incident in a far larger transaction . We are all of us supposed to have found out by actual trial , our own or our forefathers ' , of what is called the state of nature , that the full possession of our natural rights to do what we please and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because exposed to the encroachments of other men in full possession of theirs , a condition in which life becomes a scene of incessant reprisals and society is dissolved into an intolerable chaos of conflicting elements until some stronger man or set of men arises arid enslaves the rest . For the better preservation therefore of certain most important rights we have all joined together in ceding the remainder to the State , which is made the common depositary of all the rights ceded that it may become thereby the common guardian of all the rights reserved . So created and according to the stipulations of the original compact the State is pledged to furnish protection to the subject and the subject to pay tribute and render service to th' State . All transactions between the two are henceforth the result of a negotiation and the fulfillment of a contract , an exchange of equivalents , the discharge by each of two parties of a debt incurred to the other . This is the doctrine of the cont't-at social , struck out in the first enthusiasms of the French IRevolution when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an omnipotent State and an emancipated people . It has so profoundly affected all political thinking ever since , that it is worth pointing out for the hundredth time that there are no facts in it . 1st . The State is not the creation of a compact but the product of an immemorial evolution ; and has grown not through successive accretions of rights ceded to the sovereign , but in precisely the opposite direction through successive distributions of rights conquered by the subjects , the partition having // reached its widest area and finest subdivision in the latest product of all , the republic of our day where all rights have finally passed to the people and are administered in its name by agents of its appointing . Now in this more than secular redistribution one of the notable facts is the enormous increase of the power by which the rights are maintained , the power of government . Every seeming capitulation , the accession of every new body of constituents to the sovereignty , has converted a source of obstruction and hostility into an added source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State is nothing less than the material power of the whole population fed and multiplied beyond calculation , by all the resources of modern civilization . It is idle to suppose that the sovereignty has grown more conciliatory and tractable by being popularized , that the consciousness of its rights has dwindled with the growth of its power , that it is ready to stoop even to the forms of negotiation in taking what it claims according to law . It is in fact more absolute and imperious as it is more irresistible than in any despotism the world ever saw . And as the power of the government has strengthened with the increase of the constituency , so has the scope of it widened to meet the increasing complexities of life . Measured by the multitude and persistence of the restraints put upon us and by the power back of them , we are in sober reality less free to do as we please than the subjects of any State in an earlier stage of evolution . So what we call our natural rights are purely ideal , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive savagery , nevej realized in any historical community since man first became a gregarious animal . Never having held them we have never had the opportunity of ceding them or reserving them . As a matter of fact we enter into relations with the State not by negotiation and barter but by birth , inheriting only such rights as it has itself defined beforehand , and is good enough to allow to us by virtue of having been born in it . Our inheritance once entered on , we submit to its further exactions as we submit to earthquakes , or the seasons , or any other irresistible force ; sitting on the jury , serving on the poise cornitat us , or in the conscription , paying taxes on our incomes or ( ility on our imports , however willingly , not because // we would bat because we must . So Brown and Co. have never in any way consented to the payment of the duty on their watches . They have submitted , they may approve , they may even have voted for the law requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect upon the character of the transaction , for the duty would have been none the less collected had they resisted or disapproved , or voted the other way . They have never had an option , and where there is no option there is no consent . 2d . What we call our freedom , and the improvement in our political condition , are wholly in this that we ourselves participate in the sovereignty to which we are subject , each of us contributing a distinct force which is not lost even if overpowered in the multitudinous reactions of the political organism , but issues along with them in the ultimate resultant , that will of the people which becomes the law we obey . This plainly is a dignity which would be worthless if it went alone , whose value is in the very fact that everybody else holds the like , all of us together making up a body politic protected by its bulk and complexity from the invasion of irregular and violent changes . The illusion , the caprice , the resentments , the rapacity of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation of the absolute monarchy or the oligarchy , here must propagate themselves through the entire structure , overcoming on the way the active resistance of the opposition , the good sense and equinimity of disinterested men everywhere , before they can take effect as the will of the people . Add that the enforcement of a law cljscioses for the first time its real character and so invites to interminable appeal and reconsideration . In this way out of the chaos of crude and experimental legislation which encumbers our statute books , a body of coherent law is slowly evolving by true survival of the fittest which expresses the considerate and abiding purpose of the whole people , the great conclusions on matters of public concern in which all the constituents are at one . It is clear that a law of this sort will wear a universality commensurate with its origin , will be as impersonal in its action and effects as in its source . Any law as I have said , even the edict of an arbitrary ruler , is necessarily a wide generalization , addressed // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a rule of conduct applicable to all others in the same circumstances . It is this inevitable assimilation and eq ualization of men in the act of the sovereign which makes the most capricious despotism better than unmitigated anarchy , and which has prepared the way for what I may call the universal generalizations of democratic law . For this to the extent that it really expresses the will of all must do so equally in the interest and equally at the charge of all . It can not exact from one class a tribute not rendered by the others or confer benefits cm one withheld from the others , and remain the will of the people . Any discrimination and partiality in the statute which resolves the republican identity of sovereign and subject into the hostilities of class rule must in time disappear as an intolerable anachronism on an inconsiderate experiment conflicting with the conditions of republican legislation . Thus if , as we have seen , the people brings to the government the most formidable kind of power it brings with it at the same time the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that it is the whole power of the commonwealth , but power under control , exerted only in a determinate manner and only for specific ends . If we are bound and subject so is the State . It can not withhold from any one , whether he pays his tribute or not , the protection afforded by equal laws to all alike . It may punish him-according to law-for not paying or compel him to pay , but it can not permit any one else to molest him . Brown and Co. are no more protected in consideration of the ( luty on their imports than the duty is paid in consideration of the protection afforded . As they submit whether they will or no to the irresistible power of the State , so does the State to the conditions of its action . Neither party has an option in the matter ; neither therefore consents to the exchange . 3d . It only remains to add that the things said to be exchanged are not equivalents , that is , there is really no exchange . Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State there is no proportion or relation of quantity whatsoever . They are facts of different orders , neither of which can be expressed in terms of the other or given for the other . Public peace and order , security from // aggressions on person and property , the opportunity to do one 's work and lead one 's life to the best of one 's ability , these are things in the order of natural phenomena , a part of the milieu , modifications of the common environment of man , and no more to be kept on sale in quantities to suit the purchaser than gravitation or the weather . Nevertheless if not values in themselves they are the indispensable conditions precedent of value in all other things and no sacrifice can be too great which is necessary to their continuance ; put in peril they are among the causas vivendi for which we should be ready to risk life itself . It is undeniably the State which provides them , and if the State has the right to put any price upon them at all it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth part of the value of imported merchandise then the whole value or any multiple of the whole . This is in fact the traditional plea of the oppressor from the beginning . By a fine anticipation of the contrat social the State has never failed to make the benefits it confers the pretext of its exactions , to explain its spoliations as the collection of a debt due for services rendered ; an argument of course which strengtbens with every improvement in the character of the government and the condition of the people . The more the State gives the more it is entitled to take ; the right of greatest rapacity goes to the best government . So the enormous taxation of the United States since the war of the rebellion has been boldly ordered and patiently borne in the universal conviction that no price is too great to pay for the blessings of good government . But the truth is that the bless . ings of government like the bounties of nature or providence are without money and without price ; they can only be given away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they result inevitably from the very existence of the State and the necessities of its organic action . The political title therefore under which the State takes the tax upon the property of its subjects is other than the commercial title under which the property is acquired and exchanged ; and only mischievous consequences in the practical order can follow the confounding of the two . II . The sovereign rights of the State of whatever kind are the correlative of its functions ; so far from being acquired by // the discharge of them that they are indispensable d priori to their exercise . Its specific functions are to give expression in the law and effect through the executive to the common purpose of the people united by common necessities and common dangers ; in its name and behalf to overcome the intractable and reclaim the waste forces of nature , to repel the aggression of foreign powers , to punish and put down the malefactor ; in general , to maintain throughout the realm the conditions of security and order essential to the well-being of all . If these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sufficient reason of being , in other words if the people has the right to combine and arm in self-defense , then has the State ipso facto the right to all the material necessary for the creation of State power . Whatever service of person or tribute 3f money is required for its rightful purposes belongs to it under an original , and indisputable title , and is to be taken not by negotiation and according to contract but by force and according to law . But this clearly is a title which carries its own limitation with it and the limitation is as essential to its integrity as the extension up to the li*nit . The right to the means necessary for a given end is without force and meaning or is exclusive of all right to what is not a means and not necessary . If the State taxes the subject for any purpose other than the specific purposes for which it exists , or beyond the amount requisite for those purposes , it takes what is not its own . Moreover what are thesespecific purposes for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part the protection of the property not taken . To take more than it requires is to confiscate the very properly it was set to guard , to add to the enemies of the commonwealth the most formidable and insidious of all , the power created to withstand them . Quis custodiet i*8OS custodes ? Therefore whatever is not required for the legitimate expenses of the State remains the property of the subject by a title as original and indisputable as the other ; a title which however it may be violated can not be extinguished by any utterance of law however formal or any will of the people however unanimous . TQ take a life not required for the defence of the State is murder , to take service not required for its business is slavery , and to take property not required for its // expenses is robbery ; if the taking is knowing and intentional . The two titles are co&amp;dinate , exclusive of one another , and interdependent . As neither can be defined without a defini. tion of the other , so neither can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invade the right of private property is to impair the sources of its revenue ; for the sub . ject to dispute the right of public property is to impair the only safeguard of his own ; a double result perfectly secured by the sentimental compromise of the contrat social . What rightfully belongs to the State , then , is the cost of its services and not the value of them ; so much of the wealth of the nation , and no more , as it requires to meet the liabilities incurred in the exercise of its functions . These liabilities are of two kinds . There are first the ordinary kind for the current expenses of the government , calculated in advance for the fiscal year upon the basis of previous expenditure . Like any periodically recurring disbursement they might be stated as interest on a debt capital and this capi tal as a claim on the whole capital of the nation , making the State on the one hand in the proportion of its debt so stated and the subjects on the other each in the proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , the annual product of which is distributed partly as revenue to the State for payment of its expenses , partly as the revenue of the subjects for the uses of life and the enterprises of business . The objection to this form of statement is that it is a mere fiction of finance or book-keeping but with a dangerous suggestion of socialistic communism . The simple reality without artifice is that the current expenses of the government for whatever period calculated are a periodical charge upon the wealth of the nation . Now a periodical charge upon property of any kind is properly provided for out of the product or earnings of the property . The liabilities of the extraordinary kind are those contracted in some sudden emergency of public affairs , a pestilence , or famine , or war , which precipitates the State into &amp;xpenditure beyond its immediately available resources , and are provided for by a loan bearing interest until the date fixed for payment of the principal . This is debt actually capitalized and may be // properly stated as a claim to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus according to the January statement the interest-bearing debt of the United States is something under $13,000,000,000 , and were it to mature and payment to be demanded to-morrow the government must either default or appropriate whatever amount of the capital wealth of the nation may be required to cover the deficiency of its assets . But in fact no State debt is ever so discharged or could be without ruin to the country . One of two things always happens ; either the State arranges with its creditors for the postponement of the date when the principal is due , or it applies the annual surplus of its current revenue over its current expenses to the reduction of the principal . In either case the debt figures in the estimates only as a liability of the ordinary kind , an item in the current expenditure whether as interest falling due or as surplus available for reduction of the principal . Thus along with the other current expenses it is a periodical charge upon the national wealth , not to be met by ruinous conversion of capital but by appropriating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may therefore define the property of the State to be so much of the annual product or revenue of the wealth of the nation as it requires for its legitimate annual expenses . This proportion again of the whole product of the national wealth is made up of parts in the same proportion of the revenues of all the subjects . If we suppose that the annual liabilities of the State are to the annual product of the wealth of the nation , say , in the ratio of 1 to 100 , then one per centum of the annual revenue of each subject belongs to the State ; no more and no less . No more , for to exceed the proportion of one per centum in any case is to increase the burden of one by lightening that of all the others ; no less , for to fall short of it is to diminish the burden of one by increasing that of the others ; in either case to go back on the line of political evolution to the unrighteous inequalities of class rule , to accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special sacrifices on the other . If the State in its estitnates can not exceed the sum-total required for its legitimate expenses , no more can it exceed in its taxation the uniform proportion // due by each subject without violating the right of private property and taking what is not its own . For here is the very ground and reason of our separate and independent being as a State , the specific note of our system as the latest and highest product of political evolution . We rebelled from our original allegiance , in obedience certainly to many blind and hidden forces , but upon the public pretext that we would not submit to discriminating and disproportionate burdens ; and the other day we suppressed another rebellion made to fasten the worst of such burdens on a subject race . From first to last and in every way in which a people can express its political consciousness we have declared that all usurpations of sovereign power and privilege by one man over other men , by one class over other classes , by one people over other peoples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , for the weak may deserve and require oppI*ession , but because a punishment of the innocent . We have seized the sovereignty in the name of the people to put an end to all this and that hereafter in the consciousness of the State , in the eye of the law , and in the act of the executive only two classes shall be known forevermore , the law-abiding and the lawless , the subjects for whose benefit the State exists , whose rights are one and whose responsibilities are uniform , and they for whose repression it exists , whose rights are forfeited . This is the historical doctrine to which the American people is committed before all the world , which we are here to give public effect to , namely , that no man shall suffer in person or in property more than other men suffer unless he deserves to , that the only ground known to the State for the imposition of exceptional burdens is the ground of wrong doing . Were strict justice possible in this world , government would be wholly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong-doer who should bear all the consequences of his wrong . doing . For example we were entirely right in the magnanimity which closed the war of the rebellion , but had other considerations not intervened we should have been entirely right in charging the enormous development of government which it precipitnted to the rebellious population , as Germany , granting the righteousness of her cause , was right in taking indemnity // for the past and security for the future at the close of the war with France . So the property of the individual offender rightfully belongs to the State not in the proportion of the unoffendin*r but in that of his offense . As a matter of fact he usually escapes because he has no property to forfeit . The criminal classes of any country are not an appreciable source of public revenue and so the burden of government must fall upon the well-to-do who arc not in general they who make government necessary . All the greater reason why the burden should be distributed among them impartially . No innocent subject can be rightfully afflicted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriate penalty of wrong-doing . Any system of taxation , then , must be judged , and approved or condemned , as it does or does not put the State in possession of its own , namely , a definite and uniform proportion of the revenues of its subjects . Taxation which designedly departs from this proportion for any motive whatsoever , dfortiori which does so for any motive other than that of providing for its necessary expenses , is spoliation , a usurpation condemned by our political theory and by that ideal of justice which it pretends to realize .
