txt The leading Republicans of Virginia are beginning to see the necessity of immediate action in pushing . forward the interests of their party in this State during the approaching campaign . A movement is on foot to secure a call for a State convention to nominate a full Republican State ticket to be voted at the November election . One of the foremost men in urging the importance of this movement is Major Yost , of the Staunton Valley Virginian , one or the most influential Republicans in the State . In the last issue of that journal the leading editorial urges the importance of immediate : action upon the part of the Virginia Republi- ; cans . It says : " The course of the leaders of the Readjusters for the past few months has clearly demonstrated that it is their wish and purpose to absorb the Republican Party of Virginia , blot out its distinctive political identity , and ' , create upon its ruins a **28;0;TOOLONG Party , in the interests of a few selfish leaders who care nothing for State or national interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very few Republicans will subscribe to any such destructive policy when they fully understand it . Whatever others may do , or whatever policy others may deem best , for ourselves we propose to stand by the Republican organization , adhere to and support Republican principles and poli-cy , and maintain distinct Republican recognition , now , henceforth , and forever . " All of the more influential members of the Republican Party in this State are fully in accord with the sentiments expressed in this editorial . The Mahone party is making the most desperate effort to procure even a negative support from the Administration . " If , " said a prominent Readjuster to tlay , " we can get the President to promise to give no open SUPport to any straight-out Republican ticket in this State , we will be quite content . " The idea of Mahone is that if he can get Mr. Garfield to be non-committal in the Virginia fight he can induce all the Federal office-holders to give his party their adherence for fear of his antagonism next Winter . The returns from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , indicate that the Readjusters ' strength is growing less in many places , though no real and special significance can be attached to these local elections , as party issues were involved in only a few instances .
