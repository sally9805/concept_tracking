By John F. Weir . THE term handicraft has its general and specific meanings . In a restricted sense the term is narrowed with the developments of specialism , while in a larger sense its meaning is broadened with the expansion of the idea that gave it birth . The meaning of such terms is sometimes radically changed with time , as in the use of the term " manufacture " - made by the hand-which now means a process of production by machinery as distinguished from hand-labor ; thus a manufactured article is now recognized as a thing not made by hand . Handicraft has undergone no such radical transformation ; nevertheless , in a general sense its meaning has so expanded as to include a wide range of skill . Specifically , the term marks a distinction between work that requires manual dexterity for the performance of its tasks and those forms of labor which are merely muscular or mechanicaL In a broader sense the term is applicable to any form of art wherein manual skill is a requisite in giving expression to ideas or conceptions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , though the term is usually associated with skill or dexterity as the sign of power . The distinction between skilled and unskilled labor is so marked that they may be said to have nothing in common , and it is absurd to attempt to obliterate the distinction in the interest of the lower class of work . Any form of labor that is a merely automatic exercise of muscular or mechanical force , a mere routine , requires little exercise of thought , while skill demands the constant supervision of mind ; the one class of work is mere servile toil , while the other is wholly dependent upon alertness of faculty guiding the operation throughout . Mere manual labor , therefore , requires no education for the performance of its tasks ; while handicraft is in itself a means of education , in a true sense , affording exercise for the faculties throughout all its processes , and in its higher forms it is a very effective means for disciplining mind . As education , either theoretical or practical , includes all good workmanship in any field whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to define what is here meant by this term , since it forms part of the plan of this paper to emphasize the value of practical methods in disciplining the mind . There is a narrow view of education which associates the term wholly with institutional methods , with a system of instruction embodied in text-books , with the pedagogue , or teacher , who instils into the mind of the pupil an orderly method of discipline for the faculties . A young person is usually deemed " educated " when this system has been properly applied , with corresponding results . But there is a broader view of education than this , one that comprehends all exercise of mental faculty , especially in the higher occupations of life , as educational processes that tend to form the mind and discipline character in a very effectual manner . Some such idea , doubtless , was in the mind of Solomon , when he said : " Seest thou a man diligent in his business , he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men. ** Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the discipline of experience , appears as but a dream to the reality . Principles take on a ghostly form when viewed exclusively in the abstract , as expressed in terms of speech ; but when embodied in things they have a living power , and impress themselves indelibly on the mind . Where human activities are involved , the theoretical often vanishes when the practical appears ; for there is discovered in all the activities of life , between practice and theory , a deep gulf fixed , which the schools have been unable to bridge . It is a common experience , when a youth passes from the school or college to the activities of life in the world , that there is a period of // floundering , when thereseems to be nothing solid underfoot ; for a time it is questionable whether he will sink or swim ; the air-bladders of theoretical attainment will not serve to keep him afloat . There is often discovered a lack of tangible substance in his training ; and in his efforts to sustain himself , when weaned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " new education , " conning a new alphabet of things identified with practical uses . The difficulty experienced lies in the fact that the theoretical has absorbed his attention to the exclusion of the practical , in the previous discipline of faculty , through a questionable ambition of the higher education to ignore the fact that the true ideal may only be seen through the real Thus the boy who stood at the head of his class , carrying away the highest honors in mental gymnastics , may be the last in the race of life ; for the habit of mind thus formed often leads to the substitution of scholastic attainment for honest sense , unless a corrective be applied . Attainments due , for the most part , to powers of memory or abstraction , under a too exclusively theoretical system of teaching , may have their brief triumphs in the arena of educational institutions where the standard of merit is necessarily arbitrary in accordance with a prescribed system ; but when these qualifications are tested by being brought in contact with the activities of life , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp that a realistic world demands . Too often the image has been mistaken for the reality , the shadow for the substance . Thus an education that is too exclusively theoretical ; that is concerned with terms to the exclusion of things ; that pursues truth in the abstract rather than in the concrete , and exercises the mind to the exclusion of sense , is apt to unfit one for action . While , therefore , education in some form is essential to the exercise of power and skill in the various activities of life , it is not alone by institutional methods that this end is accomplished , for a large share , perhaps the greater part , of the work of the world is done by those who have been educated in other ways ; their course of discipline lay in the tasks set before them by destiny ; their school was necessity-the mother of invention  --  and their lessons of experience were graven on their minds as with an iron stylus . They learned to think through things , and not through terms of speech ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline was attested by success-even in the highest fields of thought . Judged by artificial standards they may be deemed uneducated , but under a truer estimate they were highly educated , trained to the greatest niceties of perception and judgment ; their names endure with the most permanent in the annals of the race . The element of success lay in the fact that they became a law and a discipline to themselves , more exacting and severe than any schoolmaster ; they held themselves persistently to tasks that would have discouraged most minds ; observing closely , they perceived in things all that may be thence derived by thought-for the book of nature is the Infinite Mind bodied forth in forms , and through acute observation " man may think the thoughts of God after him. , * Handicraft deals thus with things . Before we pass on to a more specific discussion of its recent revival , I would emphasize the value of handicraft , as a means of moral and mental discipline , by one or two examples with whom all are so familiar that attention will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in mind . Palissy , the potter , affords a striking example of one raised to eminence by the humble means of his craft , for his was a mind deepened and strengthened by the very nature of his occupation and the special task set before him in discovering for himself the white enamel for earthenware . It is the story of his life that has made Palissy famous , not alone the products of his art ; for his life is an instructive drama of toil , struggle , and persistent patience in surmounting obstacles , ending in the triumphant accomplishment of his object . The products of his art are not , to my mind , objects of marked beauty , comprising as they do , in their ornamentation , the mere casts of natural objects-animal and vegetable-distributed rather formally over the surface of his earthenware ; they are more curious // than beautiful But it is not of these things we are reminded by the name of Palissy . It is the character of the man that awakens admiration ; his persistence of aim , his indomitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through endless failures , the coveted gleam of success ; his life was a drama such as the Greeks would have deemed it no unworthy thing for the gods to participate in . Every failure served but to rekindle his fires with fresh hope and renewed effort ; and on one occasion , finding his fuel gave out when apparently on the eve of success , the potter tore up the floor of his dwelling and cast it into the flames , together with every available article of furniture that was combustible . I call attention to this craftsman and his experience merely to show that the discipline of his life lay in his craft , which was , in effect , the means of educating his faculties and enlarging his sphere of knowledge ; for , one thing leading to another , as a correlative of his craft he studied chemistry , mineralogy , and botany , and the liberalizing influence of those studies led him to think deeply on religious subjects and embrace the Reformation as a result of his convictions , the free expression of his beliefs causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris , where , under royal favor , he was lodged near the Tuileries , barely escaping the massacre of St. Bartholomew . There he opened a course of lectures on physics and natural history , and was the first person in France who applied sound methods and demonstration in explaining the phenomena of nature . He published several works on scientific subjects , and died in the Bastille , where he was imprisoned for his religious convictions . " He was distinguished no less for his virtue than for his talents . " Such , in brief , are the principal events of the potter 's career ; and it is as a handicraftsman , the requirements of whose tasks proved to be an education and a discipline , that I make mention of Palissy here . For the very nature of the potter 's work , usually deemed narrow , perhaps , and circumscribed , expanded with the breadth of Palissy 's mind till it became a liberalizing means of self-culture and moral improvement ; - this is the true lesson of his life . Viewed in this light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructive ; it has a high literary value , having proved a mine of wealth for the historian of the time . Cellini was a wonderful craftsman ; he was likewise a braggart and a great stickler for the honors of his craft , compelling the acknowledgment of genius as a divine right . They who have not read his entertaining autobiography have missed one of the most extraordinary things in literature ; it throws considerable light on the nature of the mediaeval guilds as educational institutions for craftsmen - particularly the goldsmiths ' guild , a school for the sculptors of the time . Cellini 's art was but a circumstance to his character as a man of wonderful resources ; he was a close observer , a person of decided intellect and power united with extravagant weaknesses . His life reads like a romance and has undiminished interest even for those who care little for art but find in his book a vivid picture of the man and the times . Cellini possessed creative genius of a high order , united with extraordinary skill in handicraft and unfailing readiness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most remarkable example of what may be termed , in the highest sense , a " handicraftsman ; " for while the products of his art , executed with the greatest skill in various metals , were beautiful , they were , for the most part , designed for use-salvers , caskets , salt-cellars , vases , pitchers , platters , etc. , in gold , silver , and brass , exquisitely wrought . His skilful handicraft brought him in familiar relation with eminent men of his time , by whom his genius was honored ; but his education was wholly through his art . Of course it may be said that these examples were men of genius , possessing rare gifts , whose talents would have shone out under any adverse circumstances , and whose powers differentiate them from the average man under the most favorable circumstances  --  and so they do . Nevertheless , as with other men , they were under like necessities of train*. ing ; their faculties required the educa // tion that is due to persistent endeavor , close observation , and untiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not propose to dwell upon noted examples of craftsmen . These two instances are briefly mentioned merely to place a standard before the eye . The special object I have in mind in treating of handicraft is to show the connection therein manifested between the hand and the head , between the fingers and the brain . It has been well said that the hand is , in a sense , but an extension of the brain ; mind and manual skill can not be arbitrarily separated , for dexterity of manipulation is but the expression of mental operations . It is the mind that shapes a conception by the hand . In the skilful it would seem that the whole body is the brain , so instinct with intelligence is the organism when acting responsive to mind . The touch of the musician corresponds to the most evanescent shades of feeling ; emotional thought and instrumental execution are blended as one . In the presence of skill manifesting power , when of a superior order , admiration is spontaneous , homage irresistible ; the horizon of knowledge seems enlarged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems at hand . On witnessing a skilful performance of any kind , that one thing for the time seems of all others most desirable to possess the power of doing , whether it be the performance of a musician , an actor , an artist , an orator , or a mere mimic or story-teller ,  - -  so captivating is skill spontaneously manifested . There is a certain power accompanying the performance of anything that is perfect of its kind ; we spontaneously applaud a thing that is thoroughly well done . But there are all grades of skill , and I shall not dwell exclusively on the exceptional or rare ; handicraft has its commonplace aspects , its everyday phases ; it is humble in its minor walks , as it is ambitious when reaching up into the region of creative genius . It may not be generally known that we are now in the midst of a great revival of handicraft , which has assumed the character of a practical protest against the dominant influence of machine-manufacture that tends to reduce distinctions of labor to a common level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bout eighteen years ago , with a movement initiated in London by William Morris , Dante G. Rossetti , and J. E. Millais , well-known names in the world of letters and art . A fund of some few hundreds , or thousands , of pounds was subscribed by those gentlemen and their friends , and a shop opened , with the sign , " Morris , Ilossetti &amp; Co. , " for the purpose of rehabilitating handicraft and artistic design in various kinds of household art . The gentlemen named furnished the designs , and they were executed on the premises by skilled workmen , comprising various kinds of metal and cabinet work , which has since extended to a wide range of household art . The aim was to reassert the true dignity of handicraft ; and , as I say , the undertaking assumed the form of a practical protest against the levelling and often tawdry influence of machine-manufacture in many kinds of industry , which obliterates all sense of the artistic , and is destructive of skilled craftsmanship . The activity of the time is marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual , for the exclusively utilitarian aim of machine-manufacture tends to level all distinctions . The problem of the factory is to provide machinery to perform work ; to feed this uninterruptedly , so as to produce the greatest quantity of any given manufacture at a minimum of cost-taking care not to overstock the market . While in successful operation the problem of machine-manufacture is to determine the exact ratio of values between the raw material , including the cost of manufacture , and the articles produced , it is purely a matter of forces and figures ; there can be no sentiment ii the business . The economics of the system necessarily embrace as one instrumentality the metal and the flesh involved . The printed notices to be seen in some large factories indicate the character of the enterprise as organized on strictly business principles : " No talking allowed on political , religious , or labor questions . " No waste of time can be countenanced ; the " operative " must take pattern after the machine and act accordingly . It cannot be denied that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the strict military discipline of a well-organized army ; it subjects the raw material , the undisciplined mass , to a stern form of drill which induces obedience and self-controL Labor-unions are following in the same path , as a product of the system . But there is a limit to a tolerance of the system when the individual rises above it through the development of higher capacities , demanding greater freedom . For the more capable , the system is intolerable ; and yet , until recently , there has been no way of escape from it , and the result is a wide-spread feeling of discontent . For it is one thing to find happiness in labor through work that engages the faculties and fosters skill ; while it is another and distinct thing to toil merely to sustain life , standing by a machine , day by day , as a mere extension of the mechanism-an arm of flesh joined to an arm of steel . But happily a change is now being worked out for the more capable , and there is a prospect of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels for skilled labor are rapidly multiplying through an extensive revival of handicraft , and they who have watched the progress of the movement see in it something more than an ephemeral effect of present tastes . For this revival of craftsmanship , now everywhere manifest , discovers the fact that there is a large class , rapidly growing in numbers , whose taste and discretion will not accept machine-made things ; they require in everything with which they surround themselves some expression of sensibility and thought , some thoroughness as to excellence of design and workmanship ; in short , they demand that things shall be beautiful a well as useful , in imitation of that intelligence which " hath made all things beautiful in His time , " deeming it to be through some such means , or worthy ambition , that society is raised above the bare needs of physical existence to a realization of the truth that " when first wants are satisfied , then the higher wants become imperative ' * as a higher necessity of human life . The merit of machine-manufacture rests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ob tamable only by the few ; production is greater because the power of the hand is multiplied a thousand-fold . There is no denying the vast benefit that has accrued from the stupendous re-enforcement of energy by this means , and it is only with respect to certain forms of machinemanufacture that the present revival of handicraft is concerned . But on purely utilitarian grounds there is a prevalent popular fallacy about things being very much cheapened by machine-manufacture ; for , if one pair of hand-made shoes will outwear two pairs of the manufactured article , though the cost of the former be double that of the latter , the expense to the wearer is the same . And in contrasting factory-productsbedecked with superficial excrescenceswith the better and more stable furniture of our ancestors , now being recovered from the garrets , a dealer in the former article confessed that it was not made for use , but made to sell . To effect that object it must have a certain appearance of fitness and stability ; but it actually has no lasting quality when compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to characterize all kinds of machinemanufacture as of this low grade ; but the class of goods mentioned is very extensive , and its demerits are not always recognizable until a better standard is formed through skilled handicraft , which is superior to the best kind of machinework and not much more costly-this , indeed , is the discovery that is leading many to reject many kinds of machinemanufactures , giving preference to the more tasteful and stable products of handicraft . It is , therefore , not wholly a matter of sentiment , but prudence dictates the preference given to skilled handicraft ; thus there is at bottom a sensible and wise discretion , not to speak of good taste , which dictates this preference for the products of handicraft over machine-manufactures in many kinds of industry . A revival of handicraft may lead to no restriction in machine-manufactures , but it will certainly enable a large class of buyers to manifest a preference for something better . It is the boast of the time that a material civilization has never hitherto // attained the heights that recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of activity the outward conditions of life are much improved ; endless are the facilities for making things easy ; while in reality life is thereby rendered more complex , and the result is that there is no epoch in history that is more widely separated from the happiness that is born of hope than the present time . This is confessedly an age of disquiet and discontent . Wealth , wages , or material comforts , plentiful as they are , and regarded by many as the supreme end of all activity and desire , are found to breed discontent with greater energy even than poverty . These benefits appear to foster a spirit that recognizes no state of contentment while there are others enjoying greater privileges of ease and material well-being ; the strain is to live up to some arbitrary or artificial standard that is unnatural , and not warranted by circumstances , and thus the character as well as the mode of life is infected by false views . The age may be said to be overburdened with complexity ; there is no repose , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to pervade every class . And yet there never was a time in the world 's history when the comforts of life were so widely diffused among all sorts and conditions of men . This fact tends to the conviction that the higher a purely material civilization is carried , the greater is the unhappiness and discontent that ensues ; forwhile the desires are absorbed in the production and accumulation of wealth , and of the things thence derived , there are no conceivable conditions in which they can be wholly satisfied . A craving is engendered that knows no bounds to its appetites . So long as happiness is identified with outside things-with material wealth and physical comfort-it is the victim of a tyranny far worse than that of any human despot ; for the mind as well as the body is enslaved , and the nobler instincts are dominated by the lower . It is claimed by calm observers that this standard is now uppermost , or most widely diffased throughout society ; some such conviction is the refrain of Tennyson 's new poem , " Locksley Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant ambitions absorb the desires and aims , what can be more imperious than the demands that call for every sacrifice to that end ? They who seek wealth for its own sake , or for the mere ease and luxury it brings , have effectually closed their eyes to that higher destiny of the soul which unfolds its inheritance to the eye of the spirit . But this craving for ease and luxury is not peculiar to a wealthy class , as such ; for that class is in no greater degree a victim to a perverted view than is the poorest , whose aim or desire is the same . The equation is the same , whether the figures be large or small ; and in the narrowest or most circumscribed lot the same contemptible passions may be manifested , in their degree , that find larger expression with larger means . It is not reasonable , therefore , that one class should manifest hostility toward another , as a class , because among them we may see on a large scale precisely that with which we are ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity for manifesting in a similar way . But what really is needed in all classes of society is a just hostility toward those debased human traits that are manifest in the individual , whether rich or poor , in applying a pound or a peuny , and which are hateful because they are selfish , debasing , and heartless . When we would identify the ills of life with a class ; when we misinterpret " the . sheep and the goats " as referring to good and badpeople , who are to be separated at the end of the harvest , instead of the good and the bad in each one of us , the wheat and the tares in each individual soul , then we are in darkness and there is no reason , or courtesy , or judgment at the root of such estimates or hostilities . If each one will separately bend his energies to leavening himself , the whole lump will be leavened ; but reforms that merely overturn society , without changing the nature of the individual , bring up from the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple reason that it is wholly without judgment or discretion . The true seat of reforms , therefore , is in bettering the life and aims of the individual , and I think the subject I am discussing has its place in that economy . // If we contrast the operatives of the factory with the apprentices of the mediæval guilds , we do not find the lot of the former a happier one , but the contrary ; our modem " operatives " have far less liberty and variety in work , for the slavery of the machine-system is very exacting . The one who serves a machine must be as automatic as the instrument , and no less constant in the performance of his part of the labor ; for it is all estimated on a basis of exact ratios ,  --  it is purely a question of figures , not of heartbeats . There are , in effect , but two classes of mind the higher faculties of which may be said to be profitably exercised in connection with this modern means-irrespective of wages-viz. , the inventors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two classes bear , numericaly , a very small proportion to the hosts whom the system enslaves , and who are but as cogs to the wheels , or as arms to the mechanism . Of the vast majority of these it may be truly said that the machine they serve is the gauge of all their activities , both of mind and body . Doubtless the vast majority are not capable of rising above the situation , and hence the " wage question " is the only one that concerns these prisoners of toil . But for the more capable a remedy is foundnot in legislation , which some fancy is the panacea for all ills ; nor in laborunions , that substitute one class of tyranny for another ; nor yet in mere increase of wages , that can never reach the point of insuring contentment ; but in that wide diversity of handicraft , that is now rapidly springing up all about us , which insures freedom of occupation and happiness in work by multiplying the ways of earning a livelihood . It is not a new creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trades a lost power and prestige . The blacksmith , in the days when that craft was not a lost art , worked at his anvil , welding his thought into the metal , hammering out his fancies in ingenious forms ; every task was a problem , every stroke manifested skill ; he was an inventor , a producer , a craftsman in the true sense . But machinery . has supplanted all manual skill in this craft ; the artificer now does little more than weld the odds and ends together ; the master-workman has become a mere apprentice , for every article that formerly called for inventive skill in the making is now furnished the artificer by the manufacturer , ready.made . The smith is no longer a craftsman ; he is become a mere jobber . The poet sang of the blacksmith as the type of " an honest man who looks the whole world in the face " - because of the manly integrity of his work . The nature of one 's daily tasks has its influence on personal character ; Shakespeare speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works in  --  a symbol of this influence . He who is engaged in original production is dealing directly with the impersonal forces of nature ; he stands face to face with law ; there is a healthy , honest activity put forth in wrestling with his tasks  --  a manly activity both of body and mind . The profit and reWard is m the thing produced , no less than in its commercial value ; for it is a product of thought , invention , skill  --  a thing created . A principle is involved in this order of work wholly distinct from that which governs the " handling " of the products of others ' labor ; and what this handling may involve is best known to those engaged in the business , for there are temptations encountered in trade of which the original producer knows nothing . In the higher aspects of trade , in its vast combinations of commercial interests extending over wide areas of the earth 's surface , intricate problems are involved that call forth great faculties of mind ; but in its narrower fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of man from that formed by direct contact with nature 's elements and nature 's laws-for the sole end of the activities of trade is pecuniary gain . Certain forms of industry , therefore , involve greater moral strain than others , and it is a privilege , and should be so deemed , to labor in a field wherein pecuniary profit is not the sole reward sought . The economic aspects of all labor questions , in accordance with the temper of the time , place man in the midst of a vast mechanical contrivance known as law , and the problems to be solved are purely mathematical and statistical ; it // is a question of ratios , forces , profits , losses , means , and material benefit known as wealth . Whatever is not included in these elements is known as " sentimentalism , " with which science , very properly , has nothing to do . Nevertheless , sentiment will continue to assert itself as perhaps the strongest force in the universe in its ultimate effects . And what the human heart now cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , in labor , in art , in politics , in religion . Man , in his laboratory , has formed a creature that now has the mastery over him , that enslaves and uses him as a tyrant from which there is apparently no hope of escape . A machine is a working contrivance , with no msides-neither heart , lungs , nor liver . They who have fallen well in with the spirit of the age even maintain that the whole creation is just such a contrivance , without an inside , without a contriver , without heart or soul-and apparently they are pleased with the thought . But there are other philosophies and forces than the economic asserting themselves in the unrest which characterizes the times ; and this may be due , in part , to the fact that " there is a spirit in man , " a something that refuses to be absorbed in the economics of the machine , and which cries out for better privileges than mere wealth or material benefit . One of the forms of protest against this dominance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the revival of handicraft is a plea for the moral improvement of no inconsiderable portion of the people ; for if we contrast the moral effect of work sweetened by a pleasurable exercise of inventive skill with labor that is simply a monotonous toil for wages , it is apparent that there must result therefrom a marked distinction in the character that is formed under the two systems . For work that affords pleasurable exercise to the faculties in its performance tends naturally to contentment ; the very nature of the work is profitable in its mental and moral effects , and this constitutes no small part of the reward-perhaps the greater part . But work that is mere drudgery , an unending grind of toil in which mind and body are automatically engaged , is naturally productive of discontent , for there is no interest in it but the wage , and where money is the sole object of labor -notwithstanding its representative value as a commodity of exchangethere can be no contentment ; and this prevalent spirit of discontent may be said to be largely due to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a singular fact that all outward things unwittingly become , in a sense , representative of inward character through being brought in constant contact with it . The glazings and veneerings through which poverty of substance is skimmed over , in many kinds of machine-manufacture , intrudes its deceptions into the very thought of those who habituallylive under its sway , and there is developed a mental and moral habit of " putting the best goods in the window , " as the phrase is , as a mere pretence , or substitute , for merit and genuine attainment . It can not be doubted , therefore , that a revival of handicraft will tend to produce a reaction against that prevalent ffimsine*s which has so long had its day in certain classes of machine-manufacture ; as a reforming influence , therefore , this revival may prove a means for remedying some worse evils of mind and character . I have alluded to the craft of the blacksmith as a " lost art ; " it is now reviving under this renaissance , with an evidence of skill such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Antwerp , or the metal-workers of the sixteenth century . Wrought iron and hammered brass may now be seen , here and there , amid the rubbish of apprentice-work , compelling one to pause and praise the skill of a revived handicraft that will surely tend ( to brighten toil by awakening a healthy ambition to exceL And the same thing is noticeable in other trades . The carpenter is coming to life again ; it was only a few years since that every vestige of intelligence and manual dexterity had forsaken this craft . The carpenter , like the smith , got all his materials , readymade , from the mill ; he could neither devise nor execute the simplest moulding ; he was literally a mere joiner , putting together materials already formed to his hand . As to invention or design , that was wholly gauged by the patterns of the machine ; for , as we have seen , it // is the fatality of that order of supremacy that it operates on the mind as well as on the materials that come under its forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine itself , and all its products are devoid of taste . It is the very ideal of a mechanical age-if there be such a thing as an ideal under those circumstances  --  to sacrifice the individual to the mass , to reduce all things to a common level of mechanical mediocrity ; and how effectually this has been accomplished may be seen in the ignorant and unskilful character of work performed by the so-called craftsmen of the last fifty years , throughout all trades . But in more ways than one this revival of skill is now proving a benefit and a blessing . I have heard it argued with intelligence , by one extensively engaged in promoting handicraft among women , that if attention were directed to a revival of domestic industries among the Irish at home , in the making of certain fabrics that are now sought after , but which the machine long ago robbed them of , there would result therefrom no slight amelioration of the present distress of that people ; for it would bring again into Irish households a means of independent industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . Such a remark is based upon the fact that the number of those who prefer hand-made things to manufactured articles is rapidly enlarging and extending beyond the wealthy class . The importance of tasteful design in all forms of manufacture and handicraft is now fully recognized . In France a large proportion of the national wealth is directly traceable to the taste displayed in their manufactures-silks , tapestries , calicoes , carpets , wall-papers , porcelains , glass , bronzes ; everything , in short , in the making of which design fills a conspicuous place , and in the production of which taste is an important requisite . For there is a regular and progressive advance in competition in manufactures : first , competition in creating or in meeting a demand , and in controlling the production necessary to this end ; then follows competition in the mechanical excellence of manufactured goods ; and lastly , competition in the excellence and beauty of design . The ease of access and intercommunion among nations has extended competition over the globe . International exhibitions have proved a great stimulus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such close comparison , placed side by side , the merits and demerits of manufactures and of handicraft are recognized at a glance . What was effected in England by the great Exhibition of 1851 has been repeated here by the Exhibition of 1876 , the influence of which was immediately perceived throughout this country , tending to a recognition of the importance of design in manufactures . In certain domestic products , especially in silks and tapestries , and in certain kinds of porcelain , in household furniture and decorations , in stained glass , metal-work , and wood-carving , and in the work of some of our leading silversmiths , it is acknowledged that , with a revival of handicraft we are rapidly taking the first rank for thoroughness and excellence of workmanship . This is said in no vain spirit of boasting , but as the result of personal observation of what is being done on both sides of the Atlantic . There is a surprising readiness of adaptation , quickness of perception , and alertness of faculty , now apparent in all branches of American art that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent judges abroad ; and it is they who freely declare that , from present indications , the future of art is with us . But then , it may be asked , What is the nature of that future , and what are the moving propensities that will bring it about ? If the coming epoch is to rival the splendor of Venice in that palmy period of her wealth and power under the Doges , it may be even more pagan ; for , with singular fatality , the inspiration is drawn from precisely the same oriental sources , made available then , as now , by open commerce with the East . The present indications are that it is a wholly external influence given over to the charms of sense , with not the slightest recognition of an inwardimpulse such as that we find manifested in the great ages of art and faith . It is an intellectual epoch , fortified by all the wealth and appliance of a luxuriant materialism which // seems capable of producing a very rank growth ; for wealth must manifest itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been distinct from those emanating from a spiritual source . It was wealth , as distinguished from spiritual aspiration , that transformed the purer art of the earlier Venetians into a magnificent but wholly sensuous decoration ; and the leading tendencies of to-day appear to emulate that spirit . But it is not chargeable upon art that it is skilful without being sincere , or sensuous without depth , for the art of any time is but the expression of the leading tendencies of thought that characterize the aspirations and the life . It is only in a minor decorative sense that handicraft is again reviving , and its earlier stages must necessarily manifest crudeness and bad taste ; but with the development of skill and judgment it will gradually attain excellence , even as it has already in certain branches of work . The importance of tasteful design is already acknowledged , and its influence is felt in all branches of manufacture , for taste is nothing less than artistic judgment with respect to the fitness of things . In decoration it determines what is ornamentally appropriate ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how little , ornament will exhibit the forms to the best advantage , requiring , however , that this little shall be of the best , the finest in design . Without suppressing spontaneity , vivacity , or freedom , taste dominates the emotional in art , and reduces all to unity by means of harmony ; and where the sensuous indulges in riotous display , taste is driven out by vulgarity . In all the finer products of handicraft , therefore , design is the dominant quality of excellence ; and its merit includes all other values , for good taste requires that every part shall be genuine . By educating the taste , a love of the genuine is fostered , for all shams are repugnant to good taste ; thus it becomes a matter of character and principle that everything shall frankly express what it really is , and the moral effect of striving for the attainment of the beautiful in all things tends to elevate the character and the life ; they who enter into the temple of truth by " the gate that is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite and eternaL As a mere matter of discipline , when inspired by a worthy ambition to excel , all the arts are found to be educational processes , enlisting in their service the higher faculties of mind . The question has been extensively agitated of late , whether the methods now most in vogue for disciplining the faculties are not , in some respects at least , arbitrary and unnatural-contrary to the instincts of nature as manifested in the earlier years of childhood , before artificial methods are applied as a substitute . It is an effort of a more ripened culture to regain that original frankness and spontaneity which institutional methods of education often displace by a forced and arbitrary growth of mind . Emerson has somewhere remarked that great men are such simply because they look at things and speak of things with the frankness and simplicity of children . The path of discipline commonly in vogue carries the mind away from nature by substituting arbitrary methods for natural instinct , and while some few are lucky enough to find their way back to nature by a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never return . A mind formed by original observation and reflection will always secure an attentive ear , for we seem to be brought in closer contact with truth and reality by such means . It is under some such impression that recent tendencies are strongly set in the direction of remedying the defects of old methods of training by advancing new plans that are more practicaL Whatever may be the issue of these experiments , it is a clearly recognized fact that the leading achievements of the modern mind have been almost wholly due to the persistent study of things by the inductive methods of modern science , establishing truth on an empirical basis of fact . The scientist in his laboratoryis continuallyoccupied with things , and throughout his observations and experiments he is necessarily more or less occupied with certain forms of handicraft in forming the necessary appliance for his investigations-often manifesting consummate ingenuity in devising the requisite aids and instru // ments . Thus the hands and senses being constantly engaged in unison with thought and reflection , there is manifested a peculiarly vigorous exercise of faculty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deductive speculation . This employment of the senses in unison with thought , and a more strict adhesion to fact as a basis for theory , is the true safeguard against d priori tendencies in abstract speculation that have occasioned a marked reaction in the modern mind . It is a curious fact that the better order of speculative thought is often associated with some enforced occupation that engaged the senses of the greatest philosophers-as in the case of Spinoza , whose mornings were devoted to grinding lenses as a means of subsistence , while his afternoons were given to philosophical studies , resulting in his two little volumes which have moved the world . It would be of interest to know the precise relation that the remarkable clearness and precision of the philosopher 's thought bore to his manual tasks . From excessive introspective tendencies , or a habit of abstraction , the mind appears to lose its hold on outward things ; eventually , if the habit be carried to excess , the exterior world stands related to the mind only as expressed in terms of thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be practically worthless ; the avenues of sense being dulled by disuse , they fail to report things as in themselves they really are , for the faculty of original observation is as surely impaired by this means as are the muscular functions from laek of exercise . The origin of thought is in things , and it needs no argument to prove that if there were no senses there would be no thought , no activity of mind whatever ; for it is though the avenues of sense that the brain is made active-at least all initial impulses are by that means  --  and when the mind ceases to gather fresh stimulus through original observation , temperamental bias will usurp its place until the rays of truth no longer can struggle though the haze , when it becomes necessary to return again to the original sources of knowledge in order to be rid of the empty and profitless abstractions that have foisted mere aircastles on the mind . Terms and mental imagery having become a substitute for objective realities , the world of sense eventually disappears altogether  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation is concerned-and there is called up in the mind , by association of ideas , a mere ghostly mirage , without substance or reality-the haunt of pale spectres of truth . As a mere matter of mental discipline , therefore , it may be regarded as profitable to cultivate some kind of manual craft , as did the Jews of old ; not necessarily as a means of livelihood , but in order to develop skill and observation . The tendencies of reform are strongly set in this direction in the commonschools , and it can not be doubted that a corresponding benefit will ensue ; for the sphere of handicraft , when raised to its true dignity by bringing to it the educated mind , will then again become honorable and distinguished . A misdirected education-especially in a common-school system-may foster a spirit of discontent with these worthy forms of labor by inadvertently emphasizing the merely superficial attractions of professional or business pursuits , for which there may be no natural aptitude on the part of the pupil through heredity or previous condition of circumstance . When it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ingenious labor that engage the formative faculties or develop skill , then handicraft will recover its lost prestige , and it will be found to be , as in the past-as shown in the case of Palissy and Cellini  --  a means for disciplining the mind and character , opening a path to honorable fame . If the present revival of handicraft , extending as it is with great rapidity , should so multiply the channels for skilled labor as to convert the higher class of " operatives " into craftsmen , it can not fail to be a blessing by its rendering a life of toil more happy and contented : Of course , it can only affect the more intelligent , the capable , who are naturally apt and skilful ; for it is a matter of personal enterprise or individual qualification . Neither of the means upon which the hopes of many now rest-no mere legislation , or labor-unions-can transform // an " operative " into an artisan , or convert muscle into skill . This must be effected by individual effort and personal improvement of faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that the opportunities for sell-improvement are close at hand in this revival of handicraft ; hope then revives , and the day of contentment seems less distant . It is a rightful aim to seek happiness in work , to find some kind of occupation the reward of which is not wholly gauged by pecuniary profit ; the ambition to excel in some form of skill manifesting power is a worthier aim than that of accumulating money . But in order to secure happiness in work one must find an occupation that is suited to the temperament , and this is not discovered by shifting about , trying this and that , but by starting right in obeying the promptings of early instinct . If there be a strong liking for any special class of work , uniting the will and desires on some one object , it is rarely that obstacles can prevent the attainment of a reasonable ambition , unless the will is weak , and in nature there seems to be a sure economy that withholds the will where there is no capacity for achievement . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , when a man is diligent in his business , he will rise above all obstacles and mean stations by force of merit , and stand upon his feet in the presence of his peers . It is an instinct of the will to compel diligence as the ground of success . Of talent one can know nothing respecting its merit until by diligence the dormant capacities are brought to light ; then it is as much a surprise for the individual concerned as for the world at large . In time of peace , when the propensities slumber through enforced idleness , one can know nothing of the capacities that shine forth in the successful soldier who rises to his place in time of war . So is it with all capacities-there must be occasion and opportunity to call them forth . Even of genius , which is a higher order of capacity than talent , a philosopher has said that it is simply " an inordinate capacity for taking pains ; " though this is not an adequate definition , nevertheless it properly emphasizes the practical side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche awaiting it , if there be wit to find it ; and the surest means is by determining what are the strongest affections , dispositions , and the like ; by following that cue it will be found to be the surest guide to success . Better let the vocation choose the man , than think that any random choice is possible when special aptitudes are all bent in one direction . They who are successful usually owe it to their good sense that they began their vocations in the conditions in which they were placed by natural antecedents , for it is quite certain that the instinct of destiny has determined the starting-point with some care and not by any so-called accident of birth . Then it is discovered that the initial capacities are all adapted to the situation , and the individual rises by regular and progressive steps that insure a permanence to success . The startling way in which some people tumble down from story to story in the world 's tenement is due to the fact that they never properly observed the steps or stairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows or down the chimney , and groping about , blindly , without knowledge of the premises or title of proprietorship , they " fell through . " It is a common experience , and always to be expected where merit is not the sole ground of success .
