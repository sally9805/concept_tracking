Mr. Jenkins began his business career on Wall-street when a young man , and became a member of the firm of Fitzhugh &; Jenkins , which went under during the memorable panic of 1809 . Ho managed to retain his seat in the Stock Exchange , gathered together his few resources and began again with so much success that in 1879 he had accumulated a sung fortune . During one of the hottest days in the Summer of that year Mr. Jenkins , while in the Stock Exchange , was overcome by the heat . A severe illness followed this partial sunstroke , and after the broker left his sick bed ho was at infrequent intervals what his friends termed " mildly flighty . " He never did much business from that time , and in 1862 he sold his seat in the Stock Exchange and gave up all work . During the months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly from extreme depression and melancholy , which his friends attributed to the effects of the old sunstroke . Early in February he brightened up and seemed to have shaken off the indisposition under which he bad labored . On Wednesday afternoon Mr. Jenkins went with a friend to Coney Island , and to all appearances was perfectly happy and contented . Ho returned home in time for dinner , and spent the greater phrt of that evening . with some friends in the parlor . He retired soon after 10 o'clock , and arose early yesterday morning . It never had been his habit to be at all regular in going to his breakfast , often having it sent up to his room , and frequently not eating any at all ; so when at about 9 o'clock his landlady passed his door , she rapped and asked him if he intended going down stairs . Ile bad then just finished shaving and was standing neforo the mirror with the razor in his hand . He answered pleasantly that he would bo down in a few moments .

Two ladles who were sitting in tbe.nux.t room ran into the hall and saw through the na ropened door Mr. Jenkins lying upon the hour , with a stream of blood pouring from a wound in his temple . A physician was sent for , but when he arrived the unfortunate man was dead . Only one bullet had taken effect . It had entered the brain , and death resulted instantly . An oldfashioned revolver , with three chambers empty , was lying on the floor where it and fallen from the broker 's nerveless hand . Mr. Albert A. Abbott , of the firm or Abbott Brothers , the dead man 's most intimate friend , was summoned , and took charge of the arrangements which had to be made . Mr. Abbott said last night that in his opinion the deed was committed without a moment 's premeditation , while Mr. Jenkins was laboring under a temporary attack of insanity , resulting from the sunstroke .

It had been his custom for a number of years to go with me and other friends to the Adirondacks for troutfishing , and it was but a short time ago that he decided to go with me to the mountains for a week in the first part of June . We had talked it over , and though at first he objected he finally became quite elated over the idea . " He was a crack shot . " continued Mr. Abbott , " and the only way I can account for his having fired three shots and hitting himself but once is this : The weapon that he used and which ho kept loaded is an old one , and probably has not been fired for years . He knew that in all probability it was rusty and perhaps not in working order , and to test it he tired it twice in the wall , one then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple and fired the fatal shot . " The funeral of Mr. Jenkins will take place from his home to-morrow afternoon , and the body will be buried in Greenwood Cemetery , where he owned a lot . Mr. Jenkins 's only relatives are a brother , an aged father , and an invalid sister . The latter two live in this city . They were liberally provided for in a will which Mr. Jenkins drew no some months ago .
