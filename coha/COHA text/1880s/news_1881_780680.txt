txt A connany is being formed by a number of capitalists in this city to make glucose from cassava , a tuber which grows luxuriantly in the southern part of the United States . Glucose has become a very important article of commerce during the past few years , and the consumption of it has reached 200,000 tons in this country alone , and a large quantity is imported . It has been made heretofore from corn , which has advanced so much this year as to ? make this much-needed article quite expensive . Tho demand for It is very large and exceeds the supply . Heretofore the profits of manufacturing it have been very great , at the rates paid for corn during the past few years . During . the trial of a recent lawsuit In New-York it came out in evidence that the Buffalo Grape Sugar Company sold to one agency $100.000 worth of grape sugar or glucose per month . That company Is now using nearly 6.000 bushels of corn every day iu the week . A bushel of corn , weighing 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average net profit on a bushel of corn is between 9U and 50 cents , The prospectus of the company now being formed to make glucose gives some comparisons as to the cost of raising corn and cassava . The average production of corn in the States of Pennsylvania , New-York , Ohio , Michigan , and Illinois is 35 bushels to the acre . The amount of glucose produced from one bushel Is 30 ! rounds , or 1,050 tounds to the acre . Well-authenticated evidence is at hand to the effect that 20 tons of cassava to the acre is no unusual crop in Florida . This , at 55 pounds to the bushel , would give a yield of over 700 bushels per acre , or at the rate of 80 pounds of glucose per bushel , would produce over 21.000 pounds of glucose per acre . A comparison of the yield of glucose from oorn and cassava shows that 1,000 acres of corn ( yields about 500 tons of glucose ; 1 , C00 acres of cassava yields about 10,000 tons of glucose .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
