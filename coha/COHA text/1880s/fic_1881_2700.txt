Illustration : " CONNOR . " " I 'm in luck , hurrah ! " cried Connor Magan , as he threw up his brimless hat into the air -- the ringing , jubilant shout he sent after it could only spring from the reservoir of glee in the heart of a twelve-year-old boy . Giving a push to the skiff in which his father sat waiting for him , he jumped from the shore to the boat , and struck out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connor Magan , son , were central figures in a very strange picture . Let us take in the situation . It was a Western spring freshet . The Ohio was on a rampage -- a turbulent , coffee-colored stream , it had risen far beyond its usual boundaries , washed out the familiar land-marks , and , still insolent and greedy , was licking the banks , as if preparatory to swallowing up the whole country . Trees torn up by the roots , their green branches waving high above the flood , timbers from cottages , and wrecks of bridges , were floating down to the Gulf of Mexico . It was curious to watch the various things in the water as they sailed slowly along . Demijohns bobbed about . Empty store boxes mockingly labelled dry goods elbowed bales of hay . Sometimes a weak cock-a-doodle-doo from a travelling chicken-coop announced the whereabouts of a helpless though still irrepressible rooster . Back yards had been visited , and oyster-cans , ash-barrels and unsightly kitchen debris brought to light . It was a mighty revolution where the dregs of society were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top wave . " It is an idle wind which blows no one good , " and amid the general destruction the drift-wood was a God-send to the poor people , and they caught enough to supply them with fire-wood for months . Logs , fences , boards and the contents of steamboat woodyards were swept into the current . On high points of land near the shore were collected piles bristling with ragged stumps and limbs of trees . The great gnarled branches of forest trees sometimes spread over half the river , while timbers lodging among them formed a sort of raft which kept out of the water the most wonderful things -- pieces of furniture , and kitchen utensils which shone in the sun like silver . Cullum 's Ripple is a few miles below Cincinnati . Here the deep current sets close to the shore , making a wild kind of whirlpool or eddy that brings drift-wood almost to land ; the rippling water makes a sudden turn and scoops out a little cove in the sand . It is a splendid place for fishermen , but quite dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated the Magan family mansion , or shanty . The river is on one side , and two parallel railroads are on the other . On the top of the bank , and on a level with the railroads , is a piece of land not much longer or wider than a rope-walk , and on this only available scrap the Railroad Company have built a few temporary houses for their workmen . They are all alike , except that a morning-glory grows over Magan 's door . The colony is called Twinrip possibly the short of " Between Strip . " ( If the name does not mean that , will some one skilled in digging up language roots , please tell me what it does mean ? ) The atmosphere around these cabins is as filled with bustling , whistling confusion as a chimney with smoke . Besides the water highway , on the other side , just a few feet beyond the iron roads , a horse-car track and a turnpike offer additional facilities for locomotion . Birds perch on the numerous telegraph wires amid wrecks of kites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Twinrip appear just as free and safe , and seem to have as much delight in mere living as their feathered friends . The Magans were a light-hearted Irish family , whose cheerfulness seemed better than eucalyptus or sunflowers to keep off the fever and ague , and who made the most of the little bits of sunshine that came to them . Tim , a strong-armed laborer , was brakeman on the Road . His wife , a hopeful little body , a woman of expedients , was voted by her neighbors the " cheeriest , condolingest " woman in Twinrip . Good luck , according to her , was always coming to the Magans . It was good luck brought them to America -- by good luck Tim became brakeman . It was good luck that the school for Connor was free of expense , and so convenient . Her loyalty to her husband rather modified the expression of her views , yet she often expatiated to her eldest on his advantages , beginning , " There 's your father , Connor -- I hope you 'll be as good a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ould country to bother over the little black letters -- people do n't have to read there -- but you just mind your books , and some day you may come to be a conductor , and snap a punch of your own . " No doubt Connor made good resolutions , but when he sat by the window in the school-room and looked at the dimpling , sparkling river , so suggestive of fishing , or at the green trees filled with birds , he was not as devoted to literature as a free-born expectant American citizen ought to be . The teacher was somewhat strict , and it may have been in some of her passes with Connor , the " bubblingoverest " of all her youngsters , that she earned the name of a " daisy lammer . " But the boy knew some things by heart that could not be learned at school . To his ear , the steam whistle of each boat spoke its name as plainly as if it could talk . He need not look to tell whether a passing train was on the O. &; M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every fiery engine , and felt an admiration -- a real friendship for the resistless creatures . To climb a tree was as easy for him as if he were a cat ; there were rumors that he had worked himself to the top of the tall flag-staff -- which was as smooth as a greased pole -- but I will not vouch for their truth . He could swim like a duck , and paddled about on a board in the river till an ill-natured flat-boatman often snarled out that " that youngster would certain be drowned , if he was n't born to be hanged . " But the delight of Connor 's life was to " catch the first wave " from a big steamer . Dennis Maloney was his comrade in this perilous game . They rowed their egg-shell of a boat close to the wheel . Drenched with spray -- for a moment they felt the wild excitement of danger . Four alert eyes , four steady hands kept them from being sucked under -- then came the triumph of meeting the first wave that left the steamboat , and the extatic rocking motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake -- but to catch the first was the point in the frolic ! Connor was known to many of the pilots as an adept in " catching the first wave . " Sometimes he was " tipped " by an unlooked for motion of the machinery , but was as certain as an india-rubber ball to rise to the surface , and a swim to shore was but fun to the young Magan . In the house , Mother Maggie was happy when little Mike was tied in his chair , and a bar put in the doorway to keep him from crawling into the attractive water , if he should break loose ; and when the door was bolted on the railroad side , he was allowed to gaze through the window at the engines smoking and thundering by all day , and fixing each blazing red eye on him at night -- an entrancing spectacle to the child . And when the still younger Pat was tucked up in bed sucking a moist rag , with sugar tied up in it , her world was all right , and at rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as Maggie said one who knew all " the ins and the outs " to see the peculiar good luck of this day . The water was swashing round within a few feet of the door . Some of the workmen had moved their beds to the space between the tracks , which was piled up with kitchen utensils , and looked like a second-hand store . In these days of devotion to antiques , we hear dealers in such wares say that things are more valuable for being carefully used . This would not apply to Twinrip 's relics . The poor shabby furniture looked more than ever dilapidated in the open daylight . The social air of a home that was lived in , pervaded this temporary baggage-room between the tracks . One child was asleep in a cradle , others were eating their coarse food off a board . When a sprinkling of rain fell , an old grandmother under an umbrella fastened to a bed-post went on knitting , serenely . Youngsters who needed rubbers and waterproofs about as much as did Newfoundland dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tub turned upside down , was waving a small flag , a relic of the Fourth of July -- and looking as happy and independent as a king . It took all his wife 's hopeful eloquence to comfort Tim . There was no water in Tim 's cellar , because he had no cellar . The cow , their most valuable piece of property , was taken beyond the tracks up on the hillside , and fastened to a stake in a deserted vineyard . If the worst came to the worst , and they were drowned out of house and home , their neighbors were no better off , and they would all be lively together . That was the way Maggie put it . Illustration : INDEPENDENT AS A KING . " Do you moind , Tim , " she said , " when Keely O'Burke trated his new wife to a ride on a hand-car ? Soon as your eyes lighted on him you shouted like a house-a-fire , ' Number Five will be down in three minutes ! ' Did n't Keely clane lose his head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track in a jiffy . And Mrs. O'Burke 's new bonnet was all smashed in the ditch , an ' the bloody snort of Number Five knocked you senseless . Who would have thought that boost of the cow-catcher was jist clear good luck ? And you moped about with a short draw in your chist , and seemed bound to be a grouty old man in the chimney corner that could niver lift a stroke for your childer , ah ' you did n't see the good luck , you know , Tim -- but when the prisident sent the bran new cow with a card tied to one horn , an ' Connor read it when he came home from school : ' For Tim Magan , who saved the train . Good luck to him ! '  - -  was n't it all right then ? Now you are as good as new , and our mocley is quiet as a lamb , and if I was Queen Victoria hersel , she could n't give any sweeter milk for me . She 's the born beauty . " Well , Connor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of everything , and he saw several items of good luck this day . First : The river had risen so near the school-house that the desks and benches were moved up between the tracks and the school dismissed ; therefore there was perfect freedom to enjoy the excitement of the occasion . It was as good as a move or a fire . Second : There was so much danger that the track might be undermined that all trains were stopped by order of the Railroad Company ; therefore his father was at liberty . Third , and best of all : Larry O'Flaherty , who lived up Bald Face Creek , had lent him his skiff for the day . The boys had had an extatic time the evening before , hauling in drift-wood . Though the coal-barges had bright red lights at their bows , and the steamboats were ablaze with green and red signals , and blew their gruff whistles continually , yet it was hardly safe to go far from the shore at night because the Ripple was so near . When the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while falling it floated near the middle of the river . Connor could see the flood was still rising , and there were possibilities of a splendid catch , for it was daylight , and they could go where they pleased with Larry 's boat . Father and son pushed out into the river . Connor felt as if he owned the world . Short sticks and staves were put in the bottom of the boat . Both fishermen had a long pole with a sharp iron hook at the end with which , when they came close to a log , they harpooned it . Bringing it near , they drove a nail into one end , and tying a rope round the nail , they fastened their prize to the stern of the boat . They took turns rowing and spearing drift-wood ; and when the log-fleet swimming after them became large , they went to shore and secured it . When the dripping logs were long and heavy , it was the custom to fasten them with the rope close to a stake in the bank , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and dry on the sand . No other drift-wood gatherers meddled with such logs . They were considered as much private property as if already burning on the hearth . " I 'm going up the hill to feed the cow , Connor , " said his father , after a great deal of wood of every size and shape had been landed . " Mind what you are about , and take care of Larry 's gim of a boat . It was mighty neighborly to lind it for the whole day . See now , how much drift you can pick up by yourself . " Connor felt the responsibility , and worked diligently . He had twice taken a load to shore , and was quite far again in the stream , when he saw a strange sight . It was not Moses in the bulrushes , to be sure -- but a child in a wicker wagon , floating down the current amid a lot of sticks and branches . The hoarse whistle of a steamboat near meant danger ; and to the eye of Connor the baby-craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slowly sinking . Connor 's shout rang back from the Kentucky hills as if it came from the throat of an engine . No one answered . There were great logs between his skiff and the child -- logs and child were all moving together . Should he abandon Larry 's precious boat ? Connor could not consider this . He plunged into the water and swam round the logs . He never knew how he did it -- he never knew how he cut his hand -- he never felt the pounding of the logs -- he only knew that he caught the wagon , kept those black eyes above the water , and pulled the precious freight to shore . Then , while the water was streaming from him in every direction , he sprang up the few steps to his mother 's cabin , and without a word placed the child , still in the wagon , inside the door ! Running back as swiftly as his feet would carry him , Connor had the good luck to find the deserted boat close to shore , jammed in a mass of drift-wood , just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the shore , he fastened it to a fisherman 's stake just by Twinrip . Then Connor felt he had discharged his duty -- Larry O'Flaherty 's boat was safe -- high and dry out of reach of eddying logs . Now , eager , dripping , and breathless -- with eyes like stars , he flew home again . " Oh , mother , " he said , " she 's fast to the post and not a hole knocked into her , and ai n't her eyes black and soft as our mooley cow 's and I found her before the General Little ran her down -- and I 'm going to keep her always -- I found her -- is n't it lucky we have a cow ? " What the boy said was rather mixed -- you could not parse it , but you could understand it . The baby 's big black eyes looked around , and she acknowledged a cup of milk and her deliverer by a smile . It was a strange group . In the midst of a puddle of water Mother Maggie was leaning over the new comer and trying to untie the numerous knots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicker nest . Little Mike was staring open-eyed at the beads round baby 's neck , and at the coral horseshoe which hung from them . The pretty little girl seemed quite contented , and with the happy unconsciousness of infancy was evidently quite at home . " Poor baby , where did she come from ? " said Mother Maggie . " Wo n't her mother cry her eyes out when she ca n't see her ? We must advertise her in one of those big city papers . " " I found her , " said Connor , " she 's mine . " " Why , my boy , " said his mother , " she 's not a squirrel -- you ca n't keep her as you did the bunny you found in the hickory tree , and not ask any questions ! " Illustration " I wish there were no newspapers , and that people could n't read besides , " wrathfully exclaimed Connor . " Maybe , " he added , with hopeful cheerfulness , " both her father and mother are drowned . May I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and milk . " Babies were no great rarity in Twinrip , but never was there such a happy , bright-eyed little maiden as this waif proved to be . Among the children she glowed like a dandelion in the grass , and reigned like a queen among her subjects . Connor was the scholar of the family , and at length his conscience was sufficiently roused to make him indite an advertisement which did him much credit . He hoped it might be placed in some obscure corner of the paper where it would be overlooked . But next day , in a conspicuous part of the Cincinnati Commercial , with four little hands pointing to it , appeared this rather unusual notice : " Found in the Ohio river a baby in white dress with black eyes and red horseshoe round her neck , now belonging to Connor Magan . If the father and mother are not drowned they can enquire at the house of Tim Magan in Twinrip , where all is convenient for her with a cow given by the President . None others need apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ad " appeared that a wagon drove down to Twinrip , with the father and mother of the baby . Did n't they cry and kiss and hug the lost , the found child ! They lived on a farm in Palestine , a few miles up the river . A little stream ran into the Ohio close by their door , and the baby was often tied in her carriage and placed on the bridge under the charge of a faithful dog . It was a great amusement for her to watch the ducks and geese in the water . A sudden rise swept bridge and all away . Search had been made everywhere , but nothing had been heard of little Minnie . It had seemed like a return from death to read Connor 's advertisement . And was not the brave lad that saved their child a hero ! Again and again they made him tell all about the rescue . Of course they had to take their daughter home , but they made Connor promise to visit them at Palestine . Soon after the happy parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homestead , and when Connor opened the hunting-case cover , after changing its position till he could see something besides his own twisted face reflected in it , and after wiping away the spray that would come into his eyes , he read : CONNOR MAGAN . From the grateful parents of MINNIE RIVERS . Was not her name a prophecy ? At the sill of the Magan homestead the flood had stopped , hesitated , and then gone back . Maggie always said she knew it would -- they always had good luck . The little woman was happier than ever when she thought of the whole train of people that might have been thrown into the ditch -- of the cut-off legs , arms and heads , and the poor creatures without them that might have been cast bleeding on the track , if it had not been for her faithful old Tim -- and of the home with niver a baby , and of the darlint that would have been drowned in the bottom of the Ohio with her ears and eyes full of mud , if it had not been for her slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if that bright-eyed girl belonged to him , and now that he had a watch towards it , he seemed almost a ready-made Conductor . When the waters subsided and he went back to school , he studied with a will . His percentage grew higher . " Sometime , " he said to himself , " I will go to Palestine . I will be somebody -- maybe a Conductor ! And a beautiful young woman with soft black eyes will wave her handkerchief to me as I pass by in my train ! And after I make a lot of money "  - -  how full the world is of money that young people are so sure of getting --  " after I make this money I will bring Minnie back with me ! And she will live in my house with me ! And she will say , ' Conor I am so glad you fished me out of the Ohio with your drift-wood ! ' And wo n't that be good luck for Connor Magan ! " WHY MAMMY DELPHY 'S BABY WAS NAMED GRIEF . Mammy Delphy was sitting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking a chicken for dinner , and singing . And such singing ! Some of the words ran this way : " Aldo you sees me go ' long so , I has my trials here below , Sometimes I'se up , sometimes I'se down , Sometimes I'se lebel wid de groun ; Oh , git out , Satan Hallalu ! " And these words sound queer to you as you read them , perhaps , but they did not sound queer when Mammy Delphy was singing them . I do n't believe that a song out of heaven could be sweeter than this and other songs like it that dear old Mammy sings , with her turbaned head bobbing up and down and her foot softly keeping time to the melody . There is a sort of plaintive -- what shall I call it ?  - -  twist in her voice that makes you choke up about the throat , if you are a boy , and sob right out if you are a girl . And it makes you , somehow , remember , in hearing it , all the sweet , sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little baby sister who died before you were born ; or , if you have stood in a darkened room , holding fast to some tender and loving hand , and looked at a face that was dear to you lying upon its coffin pillow , you think of that strange and sad time . And with these thoughts come , as you listen , other thoughts of flying angels and shining crowns , and wide-opened gates of pearl . A sweetness mixed with pain -- that is , the feeling which Mammy Delphy 's singing brings to you , though you could not describe it , perhaps , if you tried -- at least that 's the feeling it brings to me . " I 'll take my shoes from off'n my feet , And walk into de golden street , Glory , Hallalu ! " sang Mammy . Sam and Jim and Joe came filing in . They had been -- well , where had n't they been ! They had been down to the Bayou , which ran a good quarter of a mile back of the place , " fishin for cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge in a hollow tree ; they had been out in the field , cutting open two or three half-grown watermelons to see if they were ripe ; they had been across the prairie to a mott of sweet-gum trees , where they had stuck up the cuffs and bosoms of their shirts with gum and torn their trousers in climbing a persimmon tree to peep into a bird's-nest . And they were rushing across the yard in chase of a horned-frog when they caught sight of Mammy Delphy under the kitchen shed . " Let 's go and get Mammy Delphy to give us some meat and go a crawfishin ' , boys , " suggested Sam . " And I 'm hungry , for one , " added Joe . Accordingly they filed in , as I said , and stood for a moment listening to Mammy Delphy 's song . " Give us somethin ' to eat , Mammy , please , " said Jim . " An ' some craw-fish bait and a piece of string , " put in the other two in a breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chillun , " replied Mammy Delphy , giving them a gentle push with her elbow , for they were leaning coaxingly against her shoulders , " I ai n't a gwine to do it . Yer ma 's got comp'ny for dinner and dat sassy Marthy-Ann done tuk herself to ' Mancipation-Day , an ' Jin , she totin of Mis ' May 's baby to sleep , an ' I ai n't got no time to wase on yer . Go'long ! " And as she spoke Mammy arose , chicken in hand , and went into the kitchen to get whatever the boys wanted , as they were perfectly aware she would , from the beginning . " Lawd o ' mussy ! Jest look at dat lazy nigger ! Grief ! " she exclaimed as she entered , " Grief , yer lazy good-for-nuthin ' nigger , is yer gwine ter let dem sweet-taters burn clar up ? " And seizing the collar of a negro man who sat nodding by the stove , she gave him a sound shaking . He opened his eyes , grinned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so . At that moment the woolly head of Jin , the baby 's little black nurse , was poked in at the door . " Daddy , " she cried , " Miss May say as how she want you to come an ' tie up her Malcasum rose , whar dem boys is done pull down . " And Jin bestowed a withering look upon the culprits , who were already digging their fingers into the remnants of a meat-pie , and disappeared , followed by her father . " Mammy Delphy , " said Joe , when they were out under the vines again and Mammy had recommenced her work , " what made you name Uncle Grief , Grief ? That 's a mighty funny name , ai n't it , boys ? " " Well , chillun , " said Mammy , plucking away at the chicken , " dat 's so ; it is a curus name like ; me'n de ole man -- he dead an ' gone , chillun , long fo ' you was born ;  - -  me'n de ole man ' sulted long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war goin ' on six months old fo ' we name him at all .

' An ' we name him Grief . " Mammy Delphy wiped her eyes and resumed her work . Then , looking up to the blue sky which shone between the vines , she began singing again : " Call me in de mornin ' Lord , Or call me in de night , I'se always ready Lord , Glory Hallalu ! " And the boys , subdued and silent , and for a moment forgetful of horned-frogs and crawfish , went away softly , as if leaving a grave . SAMMY SEALSKIN 'S ENEMY . " Where going , Sammy Sealskin ? " . " Down to my kayah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day ? " " A few , they say , but there is lots of seals -- plenty of ' em on the rocks in the bay . " " All right ; bring home something to your friend , Tommy . " Sammy pushed off his kayah from shore . It was a funny sort of boat , according to our notions . It was only nine inches deep , and about a foot and a half wide in the middle , tapering to a point at either end and curving upward . It was about sixteen feet long . Its frame was of very light wood , and this was covered with tanned seal-skin . Sammy 's mother was a Greenlander , and she could sew on seal-skin very handily , using sinews for thread ; and she had covered her little boy 's boat with seal-skin , leaving a hole in the centre just large enough to receive Sammy . When he had dropped into his place , he then laced the lower border of his jacket to the rim of the hole , and there he was all snug -- not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single oar , about six feet long , with a paddle at either end , and flourishing it in the water right and left , away swept the young fisherman . " I should think his craft would be top-heavy , and over he would go , " says some reader . One naturally would think his craft would be top-heavy and over he would go , as the kayah has no keel and carries no ballast , and if we should try a kayah , it would certainly be on land . But those Greenlanders learn to handle themselves so well that their kayahs will go dancing over the big billows and then fly through a ragged , dangerous surf . From their kayahs , too , they will fight the fierce white bear . Ah ! Sammy , what is the matter ? " Ugh-h-h-h ! " Sammy gives a melancholy groan . He begins to suspect that his boat is leaking . Could any one have slit the seal-skin bottom ? The kayah is really settling . Sammy feels troubled . " I must go home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful sea , tufted with cakes of ice that seem in the distance like the white , pure lilies on a glassy pond , and paddles off home with good-by to the fishing , good-by to the black-headed seals , good-by to the low islands with their gulls and mollimucks and burgomeisters and tern and kittiwakes and eider-ducks -- good-by to the long day 's fun ! " It makes me feel like a mad whale , " said Sammy , " to be cheated out of my fishing . I wonder who cut my kayah ! " Just then he looked off to the shore , and there stood Billy Blubber , an ancient enemy . " There 's the fellow , " said Sammy . " He slit my kayah , I know . If I had him , I 'd eat him quicker than a tern 's egg . Just see how he looks ! " Billy did look exasperating . He saw everything and he enjoyed everything . Plainly he was the miscreant . He was waddling round on his stout little legs , flourishing a huge jack-knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big dish of whale-fat for dinner . He looked comical enough . He was dressed in seal-skin , and was bobbing up and down in his mother 's seal-skin boots . The women 's boots are of tanned seal-skin , bleached white and then colored . The boots of Billy 's mother were very gay . They were bright red ones . When Billy from his tent-door saw Sammy coming , he crawled into the huge big boots , and bare-headed rushed -- no , waddled out , to greet the discomfited fisherman . " Billy , I 'll give it to you ? " " Will you , Sammy ? Try it , old boy . " Thereupon , he put his thumb to his nose and wriggled his finger as exasperatingly as any Yankee boy here in this enlightened land . His flat face , his black little eyes , his stubby little nose , his hair black as coal and long behind , but fashionably " banged " in front , the seal-skin suit , mother 's big red boots , and the nasal gesture made a very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy , you will catch it ! " " I should rather think you had caught it already . Did you bring any seal-fat , Sammy ? " Sammy felt mad enough and hot enough to set the water to boiling between his kayah and the shore . " You had better run , Billy . " " Plenty of time , Sammy . " Sammy 's kayah was now ashore . Sammy unlaced his jacket and let himself out of jail . Pulling his kayah high up the shore , he turned it over and let the water escape . There were two ugly gashes in the seal-skin bottom -- just as he expected . " Now where 's that Billy ? " asked Sammy at last . But mother 's red boots had prudently withdrawn . " I will give it to him , " said Sammy ; " but I will mend this first . " He took up his beloved kayah and walked to the little village . It was not very large . There were half a dozen seal-skin tents , a few houses of stone and turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government-house that proudly supported the flag of Denmark . " What do you want , Sammy ? " said his mother , as he appeared at the door of one of the seal-skin tents . She was sitting on a bed of reindeer skins . " I want needle and thread , mother . That Billy Blubber cut some holes in my kayah . " " Billy Blubber did ? " " Yes , " said Sammy , " and I would like to sew him up in a seal-skin and drop him from the top of an iceberg into the sea . " " Tut , tut , Sammy . It 's a boy 's trick . Let it go . " " There , " thought Sammy , shouldering his kayah and moving off , " that is what mother always says when Billy harms me . " " Where are you going , Sammy ? " " Off to mend my kayah , mother . " " Nonsense ! Only women can mend kayahs . I will fix it . You go off and take a walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a young seal . " A seal ! Was n't that nice ? Who would n't be a young Greenlander , own a kayah , and have seal for dinner ? The prospect before Sammy made him feel better . The world , too , looked different . " What a nice place we live in ! " thought Sammy . " I would n't live in Denmark for anything , old Denmark , where our rulers come from . " The scenery about the Greenland village was indeed interesting . There was the blue sea before it , dotted with " pond-lilies . " Off the mouth of the harbor , the icebergs went sailing by , so white , so stately , so slow , like a fleet almost becalmed . Back of the village swelled the rocky cliffs bare of snow now , and many rivulets went flashing down their sides from ponds and pools nestling in granite recesses . Away off , towered the mountains , their still snowy tops suggesting the powdered heads of grand old Titans sitting there in state . " Who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting the long , cold , dark winter . However , it was summer then . He went back of his mother 's seal-skin tent . There he could see a beautiful valley in the shadow of the cliffs . Moss and grasses thickly carpeted it . Little brooks went sparkling through it . There were flowers in bloom , poppies of gold , dandelions and buttercups , saxifrages of purple , white and yellow . " And trees were there ? " asks a reader . Do you see that shrub just before Sammy ? That is the nearest thing to a tree . It is pine . If the fat for cooking the dinner should give out , young Miss Seal may be warmed up by the help of this giant pine . As a rule , we are inclined to think that Sammy takes his seal same as folks who like " oysters on the shell "  - -  raw . " Ky-ey ! Ky-ey ! " " My ! " exclaimed Sammy . " What is that noise ? It must be a dog somewhere -- hurt ! " Sammy started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It must be a dog , " declared Sammy , and he expected to see one of those large Greenland dogs , wolf-like , with sharp , pointed nose , and ears held up stiff as if to catch every sound of danger in their dangerous travels . Sammy rushed up a little hill before him , and rushed in such a hurry that he did not think how steep the other side was . He lost his balance , and over he went , head down , seal-skin boots up , turning over like a cart-wheel . " Ky-ey ! Ky-ey ! Ah , Sammy ! Ky-ey ! Ky-ey ! Catch him ! " It was that old enemy , Billy Blubber , ky-eying in part , and laughing also as if he would split . He only expected to get Sammy to the top of the hill and there tell him he was fooled . " This though is better than a sea-lion hunt , " thought Billy , and he roared again and shook till he threatened to come in pieces like a barrel when the hoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Sammy . " Try it , " defiantly shouted Billy , wearing now his own boots , having dropped his mother 's red casings . Off went Billy . Right ahead , was a great gray ledge . There was a crack in the ledge big enough for a boy 's foot . Billy was the boy to have his foot caught in it ! He tried to pull it out , but the sudden wrench was not good for his foot , and there he stood yelling -- he was ky-eying now in good earnest . " I have a great mind , " thought Sammy , " to let you stay there . I wonder how you would like to stay and have a duck come along and nip off your nose . " It would have been a nice little nip , for Billy 's nose was quite plump . It looked like a fat plum stuck on to the side of a pumpkin . Well , how long should Sammy have kept him there ? " Till the sun went down , " says some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer goes round and round and round , never setting through June and July . Then the sun begins to dip below the horizon , going lower and lower , till at last it disappears . For one hundred and twenty-six days Sammy and Billy did not see the sun . Through that long , dark night , the stars would shine , so white and solemn , down upon the ice and snow everywhere stretching . Until the last of July would have been a long time for plum-nosed Billy to stand with his foot in that crack . Suddenly , Sammy heard a noise . " What is that ? " he asked . It was a walrus bellowing in the bay . Sammy turned toward the blue water . As he turned , he saw the minister standing near his chapel . Sammy thought of the text he preached from , the Sunday before , and he began to repeat it to himself : " Love your enemies --  " " I guess I will let Billy stay here about an hour , " said Sammy , meditating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will let Billy stay here half an hour . " " Do good to them that hate you --  " " I guess I will let Billy stay here ten minutes . " " And pray for them which despitefully use you --  " " I guess I will take Billy out now ! " And Sammy ran towards the prisoner . " Billy , are you hurt ? " Billy turned his head away , ashamed to speak . " Let me take your foot out . " Billy 's foot was about as fat as a bear 's in July , and it came hard . He shook his head . His tongue stuck to his mouth like a clam to his shell , and moved not . Neither could he step . " I will take you on my back , Billy ! " said Sammy . And that 's the way they went home . Billy in his dress generally looked like a seal standing on his hind flippers , and Sammy resembled one also -- nevertheless it was a pleasant sight . NANNETTE 'S LIVE BABY . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived a little girl , named Nannette . One summer afternoon her mother went to pay a short visit to her aunt , who lived near by , and gave her little girl permission to amuse herself on the front door-steps until her return . So Nannette , in a clean pink frock and white apron , playing and chatting with her big , wax " Didy , " which was her doll 's name , formed a pretty picture to the passers-by , some of whom walked slowly , in order to hear the child 's talk to her doll . " You'se a big , old girl , " she went on , smoothing out Didy 's petticoats , " and I 've had you for ever and ever , and I'se mos ' six . But you grow no bigger . You never , never cry , you do n't . You'se a stupid old thing , and I 'm tired of you , I am ! I b'leve you'se only a make b'leve baby , and I want a real , live baby , I do -- a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and she gave the doll 's head a whack --  " that you do n't cry ? If anybody should hit me so , I 'd squeam m-u-r-d-e-r , I would ! And then the p'lissman would come , and there would be an awful time . There , now sit up , ca n't you ? Your back is like a broken stick . Oh , hum , I 'm tired of you , Didy . " Leaving the doll leaning in a one-sided way against the door , Nannette posed her dimpled chin in her hands , and sat quietly looking into the street . Presently a woman came along with a bundle in her arms , and seeing Nannette and " Didy " in the doorway , went up the steps and asked the little girl if she would not like to have a real little live baby . " One that will cry ? " eagerly asked Nannette . " Yes , one that will cry , and laugh , too , after a bit , " answered the woman , all the time looking keenly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child if her mother was at home . " No -- she 's gone to see my auntie , shall I call her ? " replied Nannette , jumping to her feet , and clapping her hands , from a feeling as if in some way she was to have her long-wished-for live baby . " No ; do n't call her ; and if you want a baby that will cry , you must be very quiet , and listen to me . Mark me now -- have you a quarter of a dollar , to pay for a baby ? " " I guess so , " answered Nannette ; " I 've a lot of money up stairs . " And running up to her room , she climbed into a chair , took down her money box from a shelf , and emptying all her pennies and small silver coin into her apron , ran down again . " This is as much as a quarter of a dollar , is n't it ? " The woman saw at a glance that there was more than that amount , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she whispered : " Now carry the baby up-stairs and keep it in your own little bed . Be careful to make no noise , for it is sound asleep . Do n't tell anybody you have it , until it cries . Mind that . When you hear it cry , you may know it is hungry . " Then the woman went hurriedly away , and Nannette never saw her again . Nannette 's little heart was nearly breaking with delight at the thought of having a real , live baby ; and holding the bundle fast in her arms , where the woman had placed it , she began trudging up-stairs with it . Finally puffing and panting , her cheeks all aglow , she reached her little bed , and turning down the covers , she put in the bundle and covering it up carefully , she gave it some loving little pats , saying softly , " My baby , my real , little live baby that will cry ! " And then she carefully tripped out of the room and down-stairs again . Very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large apple , which drove all thoughts of the baby from her mind , and it was only when night came , and she was seated at the supper-table with her papa and mamma that she remembered her baby ; but at that time , suddenly , from somewhere that surely was in the house , came a baby 's cry ; and clapping her hands , her eyes dancing with joy , Nannette began to slide down from her chair , saying with great emphasis , " That 's my baby . " Her mother laughed . " Your baby , Nannette ? " " Yes , mamma , my baby ; do n't you hear it cry ? ' T is hungry ! " And she started to run up-stairs , but her mother called her back . " Why , Nannette , what ails you ? What do you mean about your baby ? " she asked in surprise . " Why MY BABY , mamma ! I bought it for a quarter of a dollar ! a baby that cries -- not a mis'ble make b'leve baby . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry ! " And away she darted up the stairs . Her father and mother arose from their seats in perfect amazement , and followed their little girl to her room , where , lying upon her bed , was a bundle from which came a baby 's cries . Nannette 's mother began to unfasten the wrappings , and sure enough there was a wee little girl not more than two or three weeks old looking up at them with two great wet eyes . Of course Nannette was questioned , and she related all she could remember of her talk with the woman from whom she bought the baby . Her papa said perhaps the baby had been stolen , and that something had been given to it to make it sleep . " But what shall we do with it ? " asked both the father and mother . " Do with it ? " cried Nannette . " Why , it is my baby , mamma ! I paid all my money for it . It cries , it does ! I will keep it always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , if nobody came to claim it , which nobody ever did , although Nannette 's papa put an advertisement in a newspaper about it . It would take a larger book than this one in which to tell all of Nannette 's experiences in taking care of " my baby , " as she called the little girl , whom she afterward named Victoria , in honor of the then young queen of England . Victoria is now a woman , and she lives , as does Nannette , in the city of Philadelphia . She has a little girl of her own , " mos ' six " who is named Nannette for the good little " sister-mother , " who once upon a time bought her mamma of a strange woman for a quarter of a dollar , as she thought . And this other little Nannette never tires of hearing the romantic story of the indolent " Didy " and the " real little live baby that will cry . " BROTHERS FOR SALE . Molly was six years old ; a plump , roly-poly little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She had ever so many brothers ; Fred , a year older than herself , and who went to the Kindergarten with her , was her favorite . Molly was very fond of swinging on the front-yard gate ; a forbidden pleasure , by the way . This is the preface to my story about Molly . One windy , sunny day the little girl was " riding to Boston " on the front gate ; she had swung out and let the wind blow her back again a half dozen times , and she was happy as a captain on the high seas , enjoying the swaying , dizzy motion . Every little girl -- and many a boy -- has swung on a gate , standing tip-toe on the lower bar , leaning the chin on the upper bar ; and as the gate swayed outward , watched the brick pavement rush under foot like a swift stream , all the time dreaming she was a steamboat . Illustration In some such position , with some such thoughts . I suppose , was our Molly when a strange cry reached her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Got any brothers for sale ? " " Dot a plenty , " said Molly as the gate swung plump against the oddest great man . He was very tall , wore a huge fur cap , and great coat that reached from his chin to his ankles . The pockets were evidently so full that they bulged out on all sides , and his red belt was stuck full of every odd toy imaginable . He had besides , an enormous pack on his back . Molly 's eyes , always wholly devoted to the business of seeing , observed all this . But she only remarked , " What makes your face so rusty ? " Perhaps he did n't hear her ; anyway he repeated his cry , " Brothers for sale ? Got any brothers for sale ? " and was moving on when Molly 's piping voice screamed after him , " Tell yer yes ; dot a plenty ! " This time he stood still . " Dot one , two , free -- many 's ten I fink . Tommy , he 's naughty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a drefful wicked boy ; he snaps beans at the teacher and gets a whipping every single day . " " I 'll take him , " said the big man . " How much shall I pay you -- what shall I give you for him ? " " A han'kercher with some perfoomery on it . " " Yes , yes , here you have it , " he said , and taking a great bottle from his belt , and a little blue-bordered handkerchief from one pocket , he sprinkled it profusely with some real cologne and gave it to the delighted child . " Any more brothers for sale , little girl ? I 'm in want of some boys ? " " Yes , sir ! You can have Johnny , he tears up my dolls and mamma lets him wear my bestest sash -- and the baby , he gets the coli'c and screams -- and Harry , he wo n't bring in the wood for mamma , and he eats up my candy and has cookies for supper and I do n't , and --  " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll sell Harry for a doll with truly hair and a black silk and ear-rings and some choc'late ca'mels , " said she with the air of an old trader . " What luck ! " he laughed ; and diving into another pocket , he brought forth a handful of candy and filled Molly 's apron pockets , then taking off his great cap he shook down a lovely doll , with truly hair indeed , long and curly , dressed in a black silk with train and pull-back just like mamma 's . " And what 'll you sell Jonathan for ? " " Johnny , you mean -- you can have him for a kitten sir . " In an instant the fur cap was off , and a little mewing kitten was produced , for her wondering and delighted gaze . " And the baby -- he would n't be worth much to me --  " " Well , he is to me -- but I 'll sell him for a red cardinal sash and a little sister ' bout as big as Tilly White . " " Whew ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! but here 's the sash -- a beauty , too -- I do n't happen to have any little sisters with me , " feeling of the outside of his pockets , peering into his pack , and even taking off the great cap and shaking it as if a little girl might be folded up in that . " No , really I have n't a little sister about me , but do n't you cry ; I 'll bring one round to-morrow -- and now I must be picking up these brothers -- where are they ? " " Baby Willie is in the back-yard in his carriage and Johnny and Harry are playing fooneral with him , " said she , gravely . " But that was n't all ; do n't cheat me , little girl ! " frowned the big freckled-faced man . " No ! I was n't going to -- Tommy -- he 's in the yard round the corner there with the big boys -- he 's ' leven -- he 's my greatest brother -- he 's a drefful wicked boy --  " Molly was going on with the bean-story very likely , but at that moment the funeral procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great man darted forward , seized three-year-old Johnny and Harry in his arms , stuffed one head-first , the other legs-first , into the monstrous pack . The one that went in head-first had his fat legs left dangling ; the one that went in legs-first , his head sticking out . The baby went into one of his deep pockets where his screams were stifled . This was the work of a second and the man hurried out of sight , saying cheerily over his shoulder to Molly , " I 'll bring round the little sister to-morrow . " Molly had so many things to take her attention that she had no time to be conscience-smitten . There was her odorous handkerchief ; her sash , which she hung over her arm ; her pockets full of candy ; under one arm the wonderful doll ; under the other , the live kitten . But in a half hour the doll had ceased to charm ; she could n't tie the sash herself ; the " perfoomery " had evaporated ; the kitten had scratched her hand because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few chocolate caramels were left , and , I suspect that all seemed as " vanity of vanities " to poor Molly . Just then Fred , her favorite and only remaining brother , came dancing down the path and stopped , amazed before Molly 's display of wealth . Illustration : SHE COULD N'T SPARE FREDDIE . Somehow the " choc'late ca'amels " tasted sweeter again when she shared them with Fred , and she could n't help saying , " Ai n't they boolicious , Freddie ? " She had n't time to tell Freddie how she came possessed of all her treasures , for there again appeared at the gate the same great man , with his cry , " Brother for sale ! " " No , no ! " screamed Molly , throwing her two fat arms round Fred , at the same time crying , " Run away Freddie , quick ! run away . " Now considering that Fred had the doll and the kitten in his lap , and his sister 's arms around his neck , it was n't strange that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you ten dollars for this boy , " said the great man , unwinding Molly 's arms , and picking fat Fred up , and thrusting him like a roll of cotton batting under his arm . Molly screamed and -- and -- well -- she woke . She had n't been swinging on the gate at all ; there was n't any horrid , rusty-faced man standing by her ; she had been asleep in school and dreaming . But she could n't believe it ; and with all Miss Winche 's kind coaxing , she would n't lift her face from her desk , and would only sob , " I want my Freddie ! I want my Freddie ! " The funniest part of it was , the child had n't been asleep five minutes . She had been idly listening to a spelling class , and just after the word " sail " dropped into a nap . By the way , perhaps I should not omit to mention that before she went to school that morning she had declared to her mother that boys were bothers ; no wonder ! baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into her mug , spilled the milk , and sent the mug crashing on the floor . Johnny had taken the orange out of her sacque pocket , and she had to let him have it because he was " a little fellow , " and Harry and Tommy had carried all the cookies to school in their pockets . But now -- after the dream , Molly hugged the baby ; and she said confidentially to mamma , " Is n't he sweet ?  - -  I do n't think boys are a bother , do you , mamma ? " And a little later , while rocking her old rag-doll , " mamma , " said she , " I wo n't ever swing on the front-gate again ever -- ever -- ever in my life . " A STORY OF A CLOCK . My real name was so short that I was called Nancy , " for long . " I was the fourth child in a very large family . The three elder were a brother and two sisters . The first , very quick at books and figures , finished his education at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and dignified as my father . My sisters , Sarah and Mary , were exemplary in school and out . The former , at eight , read Virgil ; painted " Our Mother 's Grave " at eleven -- 'twas an imaginary grave judging from the happy children standing by ; wrote rhymes for all the albums , printed verses on card-board and kept on living . Mary read every book she could find ; had a prize at six years of age for digesting " Rollins ' Ancient History ; " had great mathematical talent , and though she sighed in her fourteenth year that she had grown old , yet continues to add to her age , being one of the oldest professors in a flourishing college . With such precedences , it is not strange that my parents were astonished when their fourth child developed other and less exaggerated traits , with no inclination to be moulded . Within ten months of my eighth year , my teacher , who had previously dealt with Sarah and Mary with great success , made the following remark to me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy , " passing her pencil lightly over two pages in Wilkin 's Elements " before next seventh day , I 'll give thee two cents and a nice note to thy parents " ( my father was a scientific man , and my mother a prime mover in our education ) . " Two cents " did seem quite a temptation , but the lesson I concluded not to get . " I worked wiser than I knew . " I may have wanted a " two cents " many a time since , but I never was sorry about that . Spelling , arithmetic , grammar , geography , history and reading , though they were the Peter-Parley edition , seemed about enough food for a child that was hungering and thirsting for a doll like Judith Collin 's , and for capacity to outrun the neighboring boys . To be sure the recitation in concert , where the names of the asteroids , only four in number ( instead of a million and four ) were brought out by some of us , as " vesper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " serious " showed that we did not confine ourselves too closely to the book . Seventh-day afternoon was a holiday , and on one of these occasions I was sent to stay with my grandmother , as my mother , as my maiden aunt ( the latter lived with my grandmother ) were going to Polpis to a corn-pudding party . I was too troublesome to be left at home , therefore , two birds were to be killed with one stone . Now I had for a long time desired to be left alone with my lame and deaf grandmother and the Tall Clock , especially the Tall Clock . I went , therefore , to her old house on Plover street in a calm and lovely frame of mind and helped get my aunt ready for the ride . ' T was a cold day though September ; and after she took her seat in the flag-chair tied into the cart , I conceived the notion to add my grandmother 's best " heppy " to the wraps which they had already put into the calash . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above cloak , too nice to be worn , lay in the bottom underneath a mighty weight of neatly-folded articles of winter raiment . It came out with a " long pull " and many a " strong pull " and I got to the door with the head of it , while the whole length of this precious bright coating was dragging on the floor . But the cart had started , and when my aunt looked back , I was flourishing this " heppy " to see the wind fill it . I returned to the room , restored the article to the chest quite snugly , leaving one corner hanging out and that I stuffed in afterwards and jumped upon the cover of the trunk so that it shut . Very demurely I sat down before the open fire by my grandmother 's easy chair , rocking furiously , watching my own face in the bright andirons , whose convex surfaces reflected first a " small Nancy " far off , then as I rocked forward , a large and distorted figure . My rapid motions made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My grandmother , not seeing the cause of my content , decided ( as she told my mother afterwards ) , " that the child was sick , or becoming regenerated . " Happy illusion ! At last , my grandmother got to nodding and I sprang to my long-contemplated work . Putting a cricket into one of the best rush-bottom chairs , I climbed to the Clock ; took off the frame glass and all , from its head , placing it noiselessly on the floor ; opened the tall door in the body of the clock ; drew out and unhung the pendulum -- the striking weight , whose string was broken , was made all right and put for the time being on the table . Then the " moon and stars " which had been fixed for a quarter of a century , were made to spin ; the " days of the month " refused to pass in review without a squeak that must be remedied , so I flew into the closet to get some sweet oil which was goose-grease ; but shutting the closet-door I roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the bottle of goose-grease in my pocket , which I feared might melt and I should lose the material -- the bottle was already low . Fortunately my grandmother began napping again , and I resumed my task . Applying the oil with a bird 's wing was a lavish process -- the wheels moved easily ; the hands became quite slippy ; the moon " rose and set " to order ; the days of the month glided thirty times a minute , and I was just using a pin to prove the material of the dial when my grandmother turned her head , at the same time reaching for her cane ( the emergency had been foreseen and special care had I taken that the cane should not be forthcoming ) . " Nancy ! Nancy ! is thee crazy ? " Thinking to strengthen this idea , I jumped into the clock and held the door fast ; but finally thinking ' t was cowardly not to face it I jumped out again , up into the chair , saying , " I am mending this old clock ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various pieces . When I was afraid of " giving out and giving up , " I decided I would just answer her back once and say " I wont . " The wickedness would certainly discourage her beyond a hope , and then I could finish . So I put the moon on , staring full ; in putting on the hands I got , I thought , sufficiently worked up to venture my prepared reply to her repeated " get down ! " I accordingly approached my grandmother , stopping some feet from her ; bent my body half-over , my long red hair covering my eyes , and my head suiting its action to my earnestness , and in a decided rebellious tone , I spelled , " I W-O-N-T ; " but accidently giving myself a turn on my heel I fell to the floor , with the pronunciation still unexpressed . I quickly rose , though I saw stars without any " two cents , " and returned to , and finished my work . I had just put the last touch on when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance ! As she entered the door I was found " demurely rocking " to the pictures in the andirons . My aunt thought I did not seem natural , and kissed me as being " too good , perhaps , to be well . " My grandmother tried to speak , but I interrupted : " I must go home without my tea . I am not afraid of the dark , and I better go . " This was another proof of indisposition to the aunt . I left the house , kissing as I thought , my grandmother into silence ; but as I looked back I saw she could not utter a word without laughing at the aunt 's anxiety , and so had to put off the narration till after my departure . I went home about as fast as possible ; desired to go to bed immediately -- never went before without being sent , and then not in a very good mood . My mother followed me with a talk of " herb tea , " and as I thought I must have some " end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do me good . My mother consequently brought me , I do believe , a " Scripture measure " pint of bitter tea , which I hurriedly drank , as I knew my sisters had already started for my grandmother 's , to see how I had been through the afternoon . When they returned , though I heard the laughing and talking in the sitting-room below , I was , to all intents and purposes , sound asleep and snoring . No allusion was ever made to my demeanor . I went to school as usual , and told the school-girls that I had had such a good time at my aunt 's the day before that I would never go there again " as long as I lived . " My grandmother and aunt died long ago . For years I had no reason to believe that my afternoon 's tragedy was known to any one . But once , not long since , speaking of that clock , I said , " I 'm glad it did not descend to me ; " when a friend replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandmother ! " NAUGHTY ZAY . Illustration Once upon a time there was a dear little naughty girl , not bad , she would not have been so dear had she been really bad , but just naughty sometimes , and I must confess " sometimes " came pretty often . She had all sorts of loving scolding names , such as " precious torment , " " darling bother , " and she kept her poor dear grandmother on a continuous trot to see what mischief she was in , and frightened her mother ( who thought everybody must want to steal Zay ) by hiding behind the Missouri currant bush until every nook and corner had been searched ; and she made her uncle shake his head gravely because she never could get beyond the first question in the Catechism , " what is your name ? " and even then would answer Zay , although he had told her that " that was not her name at all ; she had been baptized Salome ; and Zay was a name she had no right to whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have exhausted all my strength putting her sturdy little self into the closet , and then standing first on one foot , then on the other , until I was ready to drop , listening at the keyhole for the first small sob of repentance . Things had gone wrong with our naughty little Zay this morning . Mary , the good old cook , who had been in the house years before Zay was born , had actually refused to let her make any more mud-pies on her kitchen window ; and mamma and grandma had sided with the enemy . Zay was a little dumpling of a girl , with hard round cheeks like red apples , fat dimpled arms , and such wide-open eyes , and she looked very funny now as she drew herself up to her fullest height , which was not much of a height after all , brushed off her pretty blue dress , shook down her clean ruffled apron , and addressed us all in very solemn tones : " I jes ' want to tell you , I 've been resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'll go ' way ; clear off in the woods ! And then I guess you 'll all be sorry ! Mary need never make any more scrambled eggs for breakfast , cause " ( she almost broke down at the bare thought of so direful a catastrophe ) , " cause there 'll never be any chil'en to eat ' em anymore ! And then I guess grandpa will be sorry when he comes home tired , and does n't have his s'ippers all yeddy ! " " O , " said her mamma , gravely , " you are going right off , are you , before dinner ? " " Yes , wight st'ait away , now ! I 'll go get my hat . " Down stairs the quick feet pattered to the hall-closet where the little sun hat hung , always ready for the garden . Soon she was back , and held her chin up with great composure for grandma to tie the strings . The dear grandmother quietly laid her fine sewing down beside her on the sofa . " Is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , miles and mileses ! " " And what will you do when you get hungry ? " " Why , I 'm going to take all my money , " forthwith going to a drawer in the old-fashioned book-case , and taking out a diminutive porte-monnaie , which contained her whole fortune , three silver three-cent pieces , and hanging it on her fat little hand , " and I can go to some g'ocery in the woods , and buy lots of butter crackers . " I , sitting in an easy chair , just recovered from a long illness , suggested , " But , Zay , you might want something besides crackers . I know a little girl who is very fond of ' drum-sticks ' and ' wish-bones ' ! " " I can eat bears and wolves . I can make gravy , and , " she added , " I 'm going to take grandpa 's gun wif me . " " Very well , " answered her mamma , going to grandfather 's closet and bringing out the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There she stood before us -- a little blue-eyed girl with a demure sun-hat shading a very resolute and , as yet , untroubled face , the gun held up tight against her with one fat dimpled hand , while from the other dangled the little purse . " I 'm all yeddy now , so good-bye ev'ybody , " she said at last . " Good-bye , " said gentle grandma , holding up the little face to kiss the firm red lips . " I am afraid I shall miss my little girl to-night when I want the red stand drawn out for the drop light ; and I 'm sure grandpa will need his slippers . " Zay looked somewhat irresolute ; but her mamma here spoke : " I think , " said she , " if you intend to reach the woods before dark you should start at once , for it is almost two o'clock now . " " Good-bye ev'ybody , " said Zay again . " And , " said Lita , " I 'll carry the gun down and open the front gate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , out of the front door and gate . There Lita handed her the gun ; but after trying several times to walk with it , she told Lita that she did n't know as she should care for any wolf wish-bone with her butter crackers , and asked her to take the gun back in the house , and then she banged the gate , hoping Mary saw her , with an air of importance , and pattered off on a fast little dog-trot down the street . Meanwhile we were all watching her behind the blinds . " Do n't lose sight of her , " said mamma , " but do n't let her see you ! " This is what Lita saw . A sturdy little figure walking steadily onward , never looking back . At length it stops , opens the little purse , counts its money , but never noting that in the trouble with the clasps the three little coins fall , like three silver rain drops , to the pavement . It goes on and on , till Lita fears it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " slows up " again , opens the little purse , and stops short ! Ah , the horrors of poverty ! Lita understands the poor little irresolute figure . No money means no butter crackers , and no butter crackers means despair . The little steps come homeward . The blue eyes are bent on the ground . She does not know that grandpa has come quietly up behind her , and found each little silver piece . The little rebel appeared in the hall just as dinner was carried in . There was a most savory odor of fricassee . Grandma and mamma and Lita were just entering the dining room . " Well , " Zay calmly announced , " I ' cluded not to go till after dinner . " " Is that so ? " quietly replied her mother . " But you might better have gone on . Any little girl who wants to leave a nice home because she ca n't have her own way , need n't look for any dinner here ! I expected you to dine on butter crackers and bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said proud little Zay with appealing eyes , but no tears ; " and then I lost all my pennies ! " In vain did the tender hearted grandma pull mamma 's dress ,  - -  mamma entered the dining room and shut the door ; and up came poor Zay to the room where I awaited my dinner , for she had seen a tray borne hither . But she did not know that her mamma 's parting injunction had been , " you must not give her anything ! I must -- indeed , I wish to teach my child a lesson . " Little sun-hat and empty porte-monnaie put away , quietly she seated herself on the sofa opposite me , with two little fat feet hanging dangling down . Dignity kept her silent , and amusement mingled with pity made me so . This state of things lasted for some moments , while the dainties were diminishing from my plate . Every mouthful was wistfully watched . At length with grave old-fashioned face , she asked , " Are you sorry for beggar chil'en , Aunty ? " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tremor in the voice : " Aunty , if you saw a little child in the street a starvin ' to death for some bread and butter wif jelly on it , would n't you give her some ? " I shook my head . Another pause , and then with little fat hands clasped , and voice full of sobs , poor little Zay cried out , " Oh , Aunty , if you saw a little girl starvin ' to death for sponge cake , would n't you give her some ? " " How could I , Zay , if the little girl 's mamma had forbidden it ? " All her fortitude was gone . She burst into tears . She laid her head down on the sofa and sobbed . " Oh , oh ! and they had fricasseed chicken , with Mary 's nice toast under it ; and you have sponge-cake and wine-jelly ; and I have n't nuffin ; there is n't one single butter cracker in the house ! " At this climax of misery the house resounded with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunately the dear grand-parents soon appeared to comfort their darling . And so , somehow , up on grandpa 's lap it became easier to see how naughty it was to annoy good old Mary , and how ungrateful it was to wish to run away from home . And pardons were begged and kisses were given , and the three little silver pieces crept back into the tiny porte-monnaie , and Zay had some of Mary 's nice toast with lots of gravy , and a drum-stick and a wish-bone . Zay is a young lady now , and I presume when she reads this story she will pout and blush , and the more because it is every word true . THE LEGEND OF THE SALT SEA . Once upon a time there lived by the great sea two brothers , named Klaus and Koerg ; the elder inheriting the rich estates of his ancestors ; the younger a woodchopper , and so poor that it was ofttimes a difficult task for him to provide bread for his wife and little children . Hard as life often seems it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , nigh on to one merry Christmas-tide , an accident deprived him of his strong right hand , thereby cutting off forever his slender means of livelihood . There was but one resource , and , with crushed spirit Koerg betook himself to his elder brother to crave some mercy for his starving babes . Klaus was a harsh man , with love only for his yellow gold . He frowned impatiently when Koerg interrupted his selfish dreams , and , for answer to his pitiful story , threw him a loaf of bread and a pudding , bidding him begone and be satisfied . And Koerg went forth with a heavy heart , his faint hope dead . His homeward path followed the raging sea . The night was dark and stormy , the waves bellowed and lashed at the shore like an army of infuriated beasts ; but Koerg heeded it not , only clutched his bread and pudding , and walked on with a white despairing face . Suddenly , as he emerged from a thick bit of woods , he became conscious of a strange light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , he beheld a little old man , snow-haired and bearded , standing plump in the path before him . " You seem in trouble , friend , " he ejaculated , with a chuckle . " Something twists in your world , I trow . " Koerg was not slow to recognize a geist ; his knees shook , and he dared not utter a word . The elf looked down upon him half displeased , yet chuckling merrily withal . " You have nothing to fear from me , " he continued , sweetly . " I am the guardian of the honest poor . This night I come to reveal to you a secret , which , rightly used , will bestow upon you riches , life-lasting and unlimited . " Koerg , bewildered , could not yet yield simple faith . He clutched desperately his bread and pudding . He found no joyful words . The little man frowned scathingly on the gift of Klaus , then burst into a scornful laugh . Illustration : THE WONDER-MILL GRINDS . " It is always thus , friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at the full . But , care not , since this meagre chip will prove to you a barter for millions . Follow me ! The great estates to Klaus ; the treasures of the sea Koerg shall know , to-night ! " And , with a hand-wave , the elf led the way over the rough cliffs , Koerg mutely following . Illustration : THE GEIST . He paused at the base of a hillock , shaped like a horseshoe -- a spot which Koerg knew well -- a place of rocks , reefs , and general ill-report . " The time is favorable , " muttered the little man , " my children are hungry , to-night . " And , turning to Koerg , he continued : " Take the gift of Klaus and go down into the sea . A crowd will swarm upon you , as persistent and voracious as any in this upper world . Ask for the wonder-mill , and sacrifice your treasures only in its exchange . I will await you here . " A spell immediately enwrapped the senses of Koerg . Calm and fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glittering caves from whence , exactly as the elf had depicted , swarmed forth troops of mermen and mermaids , with eyes and arms voraciously extended towards the bread and the pudding he held tightly clutched to his breast . But Koerg , spurred on by the elf , resisted them all , nor parted with a single crumb till the wonder-mill lay safe in his embrace . The little man stood waiting on the brink . " I dedicate this to the honest poor , " he said , softly . " Yes , Koerg , it is yours . Ask of it what you will , and it shall never fail you -- gold , silver , hundreds of loaves and puddings . But --  " and here the little man paused , a shudder quivered through his frame , and he continued , solemnly --  " remember , that by no hand but yours can it be controlled . Guard it carefully , for the day you part with it your portion shall be ashes , and mine annihilation . " When Koerg dared lift his eyes the elf had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping . She knew well the heart of her brother Klaus , and how vain would be Koerg 's last effort to save them from starvation . A step sounded on the path without . Rahel and the babes stopped to listen . It was not dull and heavy as they had expected , but blithe as the jingle of sleigh-bells , and , in a second , Koerg burst in upon them , dimpling all over with merry laughter . Rahel regarded him , amazed . " You bring no bread to our starving babes , and yet you laugh , " she said . " Oh , Koerg ! Koerg ! trouble has made you mad ! " Still chuckling he slipped the wonder-mill from beneath his coat and said , softly : " Hush , Rahel ! A geist has been with me to-night . I have brought endless fortune from the depths of the sea . " And , plump in the eyes of his astonished wife , he began turning out loaves and puddings with such a gusto that the room was soon filled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that night , just as the little man had said , riches unlimited came to the house of Koerg . No treasure too great for the mill to produce ; and , though the woodchopper strove hard at secrecy , its fame spread far and wide from the mountains back to the sea , and folks flocked by thousands to view the magic engine that Koerg had fished up from the the ocean 's depths . And though , always good humoredly , he tested its powers and loaded his guests with princely gifts , yet he rested night after night more uneasily upon his pillow , remembering the solemn words of the geist : " The day you part with it your portion shall be ashes , and mine annihilation . " One day , after the space of a year , there came to the woodchopper 's door a captain from far-off lands . " I am here , " he said , " to see the famous wonder-mill that blesses the house of Koerg . " There was a simplicity about the old tar that completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the mill , and displayed it , in all its phases , before his astonished guest . " It is a clever trickster , " finally he quoth . " I wonder if it could grind so common a thing as salt . " Koerg chuckled contemptuously , and speedily spurted right and left such a briny shower as made the old tar blink spasmodically and walk hurriedly away . But , alas ! that night Koerg missed the mill from his side ; and when , pale and shivering , he sought the golden treasures hid ' neath the floor , he found only an ashy heap , heard only the mournful words : " The mermen and mermaids are dead . The geists have ceased to reign . " Far out on the blue bosom of the sea the jolly captain rode , shouting uproariously over the treasure he had secured . " Precious wonder-mill , " he sang , " I will try thee in all thy ways . First salt for savor , then ducks for food , and gold to the end of my days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped his hands frantically at its ready compliance to his will . Forth poured the sparkling , crusty grain in one buzzing maze of whiteness . Thick gathered the milky drifts from bow to stern . Still shouted the captain his savage joy till -- a-sudden he paused , gazed as if spell-bound on the mill 's mad work , with a cry of terror sprang forward and grasped the check . But , in vain . There was no surcease to its labor . Higher and higher up lifted the mighty salt banks , and , in a twinkling , both destroyed and destroyer sank helpless into the depths of the sea . And , down amid the green sea-weeds , the wonder-mill still stands , pouring forth salt the whole day long -- no hand to check its raging ; for the mermen and mermaids are all dead , and the geists have ceased to reign . And this is why the sea-water is salt . Illustration THE MAN WITH THE STRAW HAT . It is nothing strange that a man should wear a straw hat ; but -- well , listen to my story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as the day was dark , I could not see every one in the car very plainly . There was a little old man near whose face I could but just see -- for he had on a small black hat , and his coat collar was turned up . Soon after I noticed him the train stopped at the station where I was to get off . The old man and five or six other persons also left the train . We all stepped into a sleigh , and were driven several miles over the snow to a hotel . " It is very cold , " said the little old man as we started . " Yes , " said one of the passengers ; " but we shall not be long going . " After a short pause , he again spoke : " It is certainly very cold . I am truly afraid I shall freeze before we get there . " " O , no ! not so very cold , " said I , drawing my fur cap tightly over my ears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little man . " My ears are freezing , now . " " Sorry I ca n't help you , " I said , with a feeling of true sympathy ; " but we have not much further to go . " Presently he growled again : " I know I shall freeze , anyhow . Can I take your muffler ? " I spared my muffler . But , pretty soon , I heard from him again : " The top of my head is very cold , and I shall have a fearful headache . " We soon reached the hotel and entered the office , where a warm fire welcomed us . The little old man undid the muffler and handed it to me . He then removed his hat , and I discovered that it was of straw , and , also , that he was very bald . My pity for the man was all gone in a moment . It could not be that he had no other hat , for he was dressed well enough to own twenty hats . I never found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter . I fell to moralizing presently ; but I will not here write down my reflections . Suffice it to say that every day in the year I meet children , and grown people too , for that matter , who are " wearing straw hats in the winter , " and suffering various dreadful things in consequence thereof . The very next time you get into trouble , before you grumble and fret , see if it is not because you are wearing a straw hat in winter . Illustration RUFFLES AND PUFFS . She stood looking down upon her neat plaid dress with a very dissatisfied face . " Mamma , " she said , " why ca n't I wear pretty clothes every day like Irene Clarke ? She always has puffs and ruffles , and her aprons are trimmed so nice . " Mamma finished buttoning the tippet and tied down the snug little hat . " Puffs and ruffles and dainty aprons are nice , " she replied gently . " Mamma likes pretty things as well as Lou , but always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not help . Little Lou went out with the same dissatisfied face . " They say mammas know best , " she spoke . " It 's funny , though . Irene 's mamma knows a different best from mine -- O , there she is ! " and Lou hurried to meet the little city girl whose puffs and ruffles had made her plaid frock seem so mean . Illustration : LOU . It chanced that Irene wore a fresh suit , one that Lou had never seen . Delightedly she spied the dainty robe . " Ai n't that sweet ! " she exclaimed , and feasted her eyes till , suddenly looking down at Irene 's gaiters , she caught a glimpse of a curious field-bug trotting along on the ground . My little lady forgot the ruffles , forgot everything but her desire for a closer view . " O , see -- see ! " she cried excitedly , half-running , half-crawling after the bug , " see this funny thing ! I ca n't catch him ! But , O my -- ai n't he cunnin ' ! Irene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step forward , then stood still . " I ca n't , " she said , " I might soil my dress . " But Lou scarcely heard . She was absorbed in the funny bug . On she went trying to catch him , till finally he slipped round a tree-root and was seen no more . Back came Lou to Irene brushing the dirt from her frock . " It 's cold standin ' here , " she said , " let 's play tag . " " I ca n't , " spoke Irene again , " I might trip and soil my dress . " Lou 's eyes went up and down the dainty robe . " It is n't much of a tag-frock , " she thought . But she was a restless maid . Between hopping and dancing she glanced up at the sky and exclaimed : " I guess it 'll snow to-night . If it does , come over to my house to-morrow and we 'll get out the sled . We can take turns bein ' horse , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to , " she replied , " but mamma wo n't let me . I have n't a dress that 's fit . " Lou 's face gleamed with surprise . " O , my ! " she said , " ca n't you ever take a hill-ride , or build a snow-man , or --  " but Irene looked so sober that Lou 's sympathies awoke . " Never mind , " she added , " you 'll come up to your grandpa 's again in the summer ; then you 'll wear do-up clothes , and we 'll have lots of fun . " " The do-up clothes are the worst , " replied Irene sadly . " Mamma do n't want them soiled . " Lou looked down at her plaid frock ; she thought of the plentiful ginghams at home . Suddenly she turned and rushed headlong back to mamma . " O my ! " she began , " Irene Clarke ca n't have no fun ! She ai n't got no slide-dresses , she ca n't soil her do-up clothes , and -- O my ! mamma -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ' em for the world ! No , I just would n't ! " Mamma could but smile . " I am glad my little girl has changed , " she said . " I feared , a while ago , that because she could not have ruffles and puffs on her dresses she was going to wear them up in her face . " The free little out-of-doors girl blushed ; and then she could have hugged her plaid frock for very joy . SUGAR RIVER . Illustration " Sugar River ! " The little cup-bearing hand stood transfixed halfway from table to lip . The silver cup tilted part way over in sheer astonishment . Drip , drip , drip , dripped the contents down into Tot 's scrap of ruffled and embroidered lap . " Bless me ! Look at that child ! " cried Tot 's papa . And Tot was looked at and hustled away , and the little silver mug tried to drown itself in a yellow stream of sunshine flowing across the table ; and , failing in that , tried to sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that , too . For that was O , very bright -- nothing was brighter than Tot 's eyes . " Well , Totchen , " said Tot 's boy-uncle Will , looking up from his book as something pierced his knee , as only Tot 's small elbow could pierce . " Well , Totchen ; what is it ? Stories ? Then jump ! " O , what happy state to sit enthroned upon a big boy-uncle 's knee , and listen , listen , listen , with eyes like the dog 's in the fairy story --  " as big as the great round tower at Copenhagen "  - -  more or less ! " What shall I tell you ? Aladdin ? Puss in Boots ? Cin --  " " Soogar Wiver " interrupted Tot , promptly . " Soogar Wiver ? Why , what a little pitcher for ears ! What do you know about Soogar Wiver ? " " Oo said , " said Tot , with decision , " that oo went fisin ' in Soogar Wiver . " " Why , so I did , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Tot . " Sweet ? " echoed the boy , taking his wicked cue and with a prolonged drawing in of the lips . " I should say so ! Why , its bed is solid sugar , with as many grades of sugar grains for sand as one finds in a grocer shop . " " Do wivers do to bed dus ' ike ' ittle dirls ? " demanded Tot , whose young existence was embittered by that seemingly needless ceremony . " You see , " said the boy , with the air of communicating much useful information , " it is even worse than that . They never get up at all . Only once in a while they get into tantrums and break loose and make every one scatter ; for a river is one of the quickest fellows at a run you ever saw . And well they might be , for they are at it all the time , asleep or awake . " " I sood ' ike to see Soogar Wiver , " said Tot . " Would n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious scruples overboard , and steered boldly out into the deep waters of wildest imagination . " You just would ! Why , as I said , the river bed is solid sugar . Think how nice to be able to turn over and take a gnaw at your bed-post when you feel hungry ! The pebbles are sugar plums , the bigger stones are broken sugar loaves , and the rocks , why , the rocks are made out of rock candy , of course . " Tot sighed , blissfully . " It is the jolliest place to go fishing . You just lie down on a rock , nibble it occasionally , chew up a few pebbles , take a bite at a stone , and if you are thirsty -- as , of course , you would be -- there is a whole river of eau sucre -- that is what the French call sweetened water -- running right by , enough to supply all France . And , all the time , you are hauling up the fish just as fast as they can bite . They are a peculiar kind of fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taffy bait will tempt them . They look like those fishes you buy at the confectioners -- penny apiece -- very high-colored , very flat , and mostly tail ; and , when cooked , they taste very much like them . " Tot still gazed up into the remorseless boy 's face in unblinking confidence . And , indeed , from one who , for the last two weeks , together with Tot , had been on the most familiar footing with giants , ogres , and hop-o-my-thumbs , and held the most sympathizing relations towards enchanted princesses and conquering knights , an account of a " Soogar Wiver , " was not to be regarded as startling . As for Will 's conscience -- well , his mission with Tot was to amuse , not instruct -- if Tot was amused the whole end and aim of his efforts was attained . " We tried having dories made of the same material of those candy marbles that nothing but time and long-enduring patience will ever make an end of . But the fellows had such a habit , as they floated down the stream , of eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Will , " said Tot 's mamma , at the open door , " are you ready ? Run away to Ellen , Tot , and be a good little girl . " Tot descended from her throne , slowly and unwillingly , and , going obediently away , never knew about the beautiful river fairy just then springing to life , like Minerva in the brain of Jove , in Will 's fancy , purposely to make Tot 's acquaintance . With glistening wonder in her eyes , in robe of trailing , snowy , sun-shot mist , with water lilies dropping from her hair , and the cave -- Will could have provided for her such a cave , the water tinkling and trickling from the walls hung with silver spray , stalactites of purest barley sugar glittering , pillars of creamiest cream candy shimmering ; and , to crown all and above all , the fairy would have had a daily diet of cream cakes and caramels . But , before all this splendor of material could be built up into words , the builder had departed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native mist , and Tot never knew . That night , Will tossed Tot flying once more into the air , rescued once more his fresh collar from her crumpling embrace , kissed her once more , good-by this time , and was off and away on the cars to school . No more stories . No more fairies . No more anything . Only a wonderful river winding and gleaming and leaping through Tot 's childish dreams -- beautiful , wonderful " Soogar Wiver , " where happy Uncle Will went fishing , lying on the bed of rock candy . One morning , all in the gray and quiet , Tot had a queer dream . She thought some one said , with a funny little catch in the voice : " Wake up , little Tot , mamma 's treasure , " and some one held her so tightly she could hardly breathe . And she opened her eyes and shut them again , quite dazzled ; but she thought she saw papa and mamma standing beside her bed , and the room was all on fire it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and papa 's voice seemed to say , a great way off : " Poor , little , sleepy Tot . " It was such a queer dream , but not half so queer as what followed ; for , after a while , she woke up and went right on dreaming just the same . That was very strange . How could it be anything else than a dream , to be taken up by gaslight and dressed all in her little street coat and hat before breakfast , to be made to drink milk and eat when she was n't hungry , to be petted and cried over and half crushed in mamma 's arms , to be taken by papa out into the cool , clear dawning , with the sky just beginning to flush like a sea shell and a waking bird or two to twitter about getting up , to be put into a coach that rolled and rumbled , to be put into something else that rolled and rumbled a thousand times worse ; nothing had ever happened anything like this in any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed up a little way into the sky , grown blue and bluer , Tot began to accept the situation a little , and lay very still in papa 's arms ( the fresh morning breeze tapping her cheek and lifting her long crimped hair with cool , gentle fingers ) , watching the fences running away like mad , the trees gliding gracefully by in long endless procession , little white cottages and funny little hovels , and pretty little villages hopping suddenly in and then as suddenly out of the scene , a glimpse into shady depths of woods , a glint of a blue , nestling , lily-pad-speckled pond , an emerald gleam of peaceful meadows , a sight at a snowy tethered goat , of dappled grazing cows , a roll and rush and roar through riven , dripping rocks . Papa told his little girl all about it . How little children in the town where Tot lived were very sick of a dangerous disease -- diptheria . And how , coming home last evening from business and learning of several fresh cases , he had become alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in frightening her so thoroughly , that she had sat up all night to get Tot 's things ready so that she might start the very next morning , on the very first early morning train , to where grandmamma lived . " And , there , " said papa , after they had ridden all the long forenoon , " there 's Sugar River , Tot , where I used to fish when I was a boy ! " " O ! " cried Tot , and then , immediately , with a roll and a pitch , they came to a little white farmhouse and stopped again , and Tot was at grandmamma 's . Tot did n't like being kissed quite so much all at a time , if it was by a grandmamma . The chickens , though , were fascinating , and as for some plushy round balls of yellow fuzz , rolling about -- little ducks just hatched -- Tot had never seen anything at all to compare with them . But there was a dreadful and discordant procession of big ducks that struck terror to Tot 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and dark crept on . The crickets and the frogs did their best , but they only made it stiller and lonelier ; and the hills gleamed against the sky , and Tot missed her mamma . But yet , Tot was very sleepy , and the next she knew it was morning and she was at grandma 's , where Uncle Will lived , and Uncle Will was coming pretty soon , and , better than that , mamma was coming , too ; and there was a little girl , a short distance up the road , whom Tot was to play with , and then there were the chickens and the ducks , and old Brindle and the pigs , and the pony and the hay cart , and -- yes , it was very delightful at grandmamma 's . Once or twice , during the next few days , Tot asked -- preserving that singular reticence regarding her illusions , so common to children -- to be taken to Sugar River ; but grandpapa was busy haying , and grandmamma said : " Will will come pretty soon and he will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Tot , in hopeless tones . One afternoon grandmamma gave Tot and Susie ( that was the name of Tot 's little playmate ) each a fat hot jumble , and left them playing happily in the yard while she went back to her sewing . Susie was seven , so very safe company for little four-year-old Tot . After a while over ran Susie 's brother , to summon her home to go with her mother to the village . Tot stood at the gate , looking down the long road . Sturdy maples threw curving , interlacing boughs across , through which the sun-light filtered and flickered . How cool and shady it was ! Tot all at once felt the little sunny yard grow hot and stupid , and then Susie 's mamma drove out of the gate and down the long shady arch over the sun-flecked road . Tot wished she was going to the village , too . Tot wished she was going to -- to -- Sugar River . Illustration : ON THE WAY TO SUGAR RIVER . " Run in to grandmamma , little Tot , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tot was tired . Tot was hot . Tot was homesick . Tot would walk down the road just a few little steps . What harm ? How delightful ! How grateful the cool green shade ! How alluring the long level stretch of road under the arching maples ! Where did it lead ? It led -- O , Tot knew -- it led to Sugar River . Step by step , a little and a little further on the tiny white figure glanced . A sense of happy freedom possessed the little girl . A cloud of golden butterflies beckoned on before . Here a dark thread of water crept down over the hills and splashed musically into the great stone trough . All the way an invisible brooklet gurgled and kept her company . Only one bird seemed to sing at a time -- first one , then another . Was n't it charming ? And at the end of it all must be -- Tot could see it now in fancy -- the fluttering blue ribbon uncurling between sunny sloping banks -- SUGAR RIVER -- fast asleep under the summer sun , on its glittering bed of rock candy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugary delights . On and on and on , with the brook and the butterflies and the welcoming bird . On , till the maples stopped and could go no further , and so she left them behind . Out into the open sun-light she came , and only the long , hot , and dazzling road stretched on before . Tot 's small feet trudged on , steadily . Just a little further on -- Tot was sure -- and then -- But how long the road grew , how deep the dust lay , how tired the little feet were getting , little feet that can trudge about all day long in play , yet drag so wearily over long straight roads . " I sood fink I would tum to Soogar Wiver pwetty soon , " she sighed . At last she came to where some cross-roads met , and looking down one she saw the cool green shade again . Not maples this time , but close and clustering shrubbery . She left the brook gurgling " go-oo-oo-d-by , " and the butterflies waving adieu with their golden wings , and went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tall grass drooped over two brown beaten paths that horses feet had worn , and a tender green light lay over all . But where was the sweet river hiding ? Another meeting of cross roads . Tot looked this way , that . Ah , there it was over the road ! Over the meadow . Gleaming , gliding , Sugar River , at last . " I fought I sood det to it pwetty soon , " murmured Tot , triumphantly . " Wo n't dwandma be glad to get some nice sugar plums ? I wis I tood det froo dis fence . " Through she got , with much squeezing and rending . Tot eyed her torn pinafore , ruefully . " I wis ' ' ittle dirl 's aprons would n't teep tearing on every single fing . " " ' Pears to me , " doubtfully , putting one little foot down on the soft marshy ground , " it is wather wet . " Rather wet ? Yes , Totchen , very wet . Too wet for such little little feet as yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting lower . Crawl back through the fence and run home . The sleepy murmuring river has nothing but trouble for you . But Tot stumbled on over the marshy ground . " I do n't ' ike to go down so far , " sighed Tot , drawing a little drenched boot up from a treacherous bog . " And my new boots is detting all wet . " But Tot had a Spartan soul ; and at last , beside the wonderful stream , on the beautiful shore she stood , and -- poor , poor little Tot ! The little pinafore torn , the pretty , trim boots soaked and soiled , all Tot 's little body dragged and weary ; yet , it is n't that that makes me say " poor little Tot ! " It is to see her standing there at the goal of her childish hopes with such happy , radiant eyes , and know how soon will come to her that " saddest pain of all -- to grasp the thing we long for and find how it can fail us . " Up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when she finds none -- the water running high and close to the grassy ground -- she stoops and , dipping her little fingers , she lifts them , wet and dripping , to her longing lips . " It is n't vewy sweet , " she said . Poor little Tot ! Down the stream she came to a ford , and the shallow water had left stones and pebbles bare . Big and little , and half size ; white and yellow , and brown and gray . Here was richness at last . All in a minute Tot 's little , nibbling , crunching teeth went on edge on a perverse , grating pebble that sternly refused to be nibbled or crunched . Another and another and another she tried . " Pwobably , " she thought , " they has to be cwacked dus ' ike nuts . " And she proceeded to crack , not the stones , but her own little , eager , blundering fingers , instead . O stony , stony-hearted stones and pebbly-hearted pebbles ! Tot 's cup of bitterness seemed to flow over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desolation oppressed her . " I wis ' I was at home wiv dwandma . I wis , ' oh , I wis ' I had n't tum ! " she sobbed . Her only thought , now , was to get home . But , first , what do you think she did ? She filled her bit of a pocket full of pebbles for grandmamma to crack ; then the little weary feet stumbled back again over the weary way . " My feet 's is detting so heavy , " she sighed , " and I fink I 's detting tired . " Tot was crying piteously now , and no one heard . All alone , mamma 's baby , who had never been alone before in all her short cherished life . All alone with the croaking frogs and lonesome crickets . Hark ! what was that ? A roll of wheels and the clatter of a horse 's hoofs . " Whoa ! " called out a boy 's shrill voice . Down to the ground dropped the owner of the voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'se been to Soogar Wiver , and I do n't know how to det home aden , I'se so vewy tired , and I tood n't cwack the candy , and I want to see dwandma , " and Tot 's words ended in a wail of inarticulate woe . " Where do you live ? " asked the boy . " A dwate , dwate ways off , " answered Tot . " What is your name ? " " Tot Lindsay . " " Lindsay ? O , I know ! All you 've got to do is to jump into this wagon and have a nice ride , and , presently , we 'll be there . " And presently , in the gloaming , they stopped before grandpapa 's house , and the boy , lifting out Tot in his arms , carried her to the door and bade her good-by , and , jumping into his wagon , rattled away . Empty and silent stood the little house , like the dwelling of the Three Talking Bears , and little Tot might have been Silver Hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no grandmamma replied . " Perhaps she has dus dorn out a minute , " thought she . " I 'll det up on dis lounge and tover dis shawl over me , and s'prise her when she tums back . " Something else besides the shawl covered Tot 's eyes . Down over the blue orbs drifted the snowy lids . Tired little Tot . Where was dwandma and the rest all this time ? In trouble and confusion . Calling and searching , searching and calling : " Tot , Tot , Tot , little Tot ! Where are you ? " Grandpapa and grandmamma , and Uncle Will and Tot 's mamma . At last , on the road running beside the river , they had found the fragment of dotted cambric , held fast by a detaining splinter ; and then Tot 's mamma had run ahead and led them across the meadow , right in the track of Tot 's little feet , straight to the river . And then grandmamma had said , quaveringly , that Tot was always asking to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great guilty throb , and sank way , way down . He knew so well why . And then Tot 's mamma had thrown up her two hands , and darted towards a little string of coral beads and picked it up . And , as they stood there , the river 's murmur seemed like the murmur of the river of death , and the white fog , beginning to rise , like the folds of a little child 's shroud ; and Tot 's mamma threw up her hands again and fell among all the unfeeling stones and pebbles . Will ran all the way home and went straight to the barn and harnessed the horse , and then went into the house and into the sitting-room and snatched a shawl from the lounge , and --  " Jerusalem Crickets ! " was all he had breath enough left to say . Tot had surprised somebody , indeed . Down by the river , in the dusk and the river damp , as they waited , came Will , striding along with what looked like a bundle of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds like the calyx of a flower , Tot 's rosy face blossomed out . " Peekabo ! " she said , with a sweet sound of laughter . " O mamma , mamma ! " It was wonderful how quickly mamma recovered ; and it was more wonderful still how ever Tot escaped sudden death , then and there , from suffocation . But , bless you ! You need not worry , it was larks to Tot . What a triumphal procession home it was . Tot , in her little night-dress sat in her mother 's lap , and told her adventures ; and Will sat in the darkest corner and said not a word , but resolved that no story more fabulous than that of George Washington and his hatchet should ever again pass his lips . His lip quivered , as much as a boy 's lip is ever allowed , when Tot said : " And I brought home a whole pottet full to cwack . " " Never mind , to-night . Wait till to-morrow , " said mamma . Tot went obediently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pillow , such lots of candy -- her Sugar River candy she thought , all cracked and ready to eat . " It tastes dus ' ike any tandy , " said Tot . They did n't tell her then , the illusion was so dear to her childish heart . But , when she was a little older , Tot laughed as long and as gleefully as anyone over the story of the little girl who went to Sugar River for sugar plums . A PIONEER " WIDE AWAKE . " One event in the life of Jacob Lohr qualified him , in my opinion , to be mustered into the army of " Wide Awakes . " Let me tell the children the incident and see if they agree with me . He was a native of the Mohawk Valley near Schenectady , New York , and when about twenty years old , with his young wife , Polly , emigrated to the wilds of Western Pennsylvania . This was more than seventy years ago , when the magnificent forests of that region afforded some of the finest hunting-grounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a log dwelling-house , planted corn and potatoes , and in a few years became a thriving pioneer . But the pride of his forest farm was his pigs . He had built a strong pen of logs , with a heavy door , in order to protect them in the night from wild animals . It stood about five rods from the house , near the brook , just across which , and not thirty feet from the sty , was the edge of the dense natural forest . During the day they were permitted to roam at large in the woods eating nuts , by which they fattened for the larder ; but when night approached , they were called and zealously secured in the pen , a practice which soon taught the pigs the habit of early retiring . Gradually , however , Mr. Lohr 's punctuality in this matter abated , until one evening it had become fairly dark ere he went to shut them in . As he walked down the beaten path , a rustling in the adjacent bushes made him think that the pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , he entered the pen and felt around , saying as he did so , " One two , three -- all here . " Then as he turned to the door , he wondered what caused the rustling across the brook . But as he stooped to go out , his wonder was threateningly answered by a low growl from a dark crouching object , only two or three steps in front of him . With swift hands he closed the door , shutting himself in ; and none too soon , for instantly a heavy animal leaped on the roof over his head and began fiercely scratching at the cover . At the same time a mewing at the door , and a snuffing at the side of the pen , showed him that he was a prisoner , with at least three panthers as his jailors . But unlike jailors generally , these were more eager to get their captive out than to keep him in ; while the prisoner , instead of wishing to " break jail , " was anxious not to do so . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were also the pigs , for the panthers were growling and screaming , scratching and digging around and upon the pen , trying to tear it to pieces and seize the occupants . Although feverishly excited , he felt quite secure , because the sty was so substantially built . Yet such lodgings and neighbors , within and without , would not tend to produce very placid slumbers , even if the walls were cannon-proof . Various plans were tried by Polly , his wife , who had become aware of the situation , to drive away the creatures , but in vain . She held a torch where it shone toward the pen ; she screamed through the narrow casement , and rattled a tin pan at the animals ; but she did not know how to load and fire the gun ; and as to going outside the door , it is doubtful if even the boldest hunter , well armed , would have dared so much at night , in the face of a whole family of hungry panthers . Meanwhile , Jacob kept up a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some of the larger cracks between the logs , until they could thrust in their noses , he peeled a piece of tough bark from the side of the pen , and began striking at them , giving them many stinging blows . And afterward , when relating the story , he would laugh heartily at remembering the sneezing , snarling and grumbling this occasioned . Although he had so much to keep him excited , the night seemed very long . At last , however , the daylight began to dawn , and he heard his jailors mewing and purring together as if in council , and then all was silent all around the pen . Half an hour later , Polly called to him that they were gone away . It was with extreme caution , however , that he opened the door a little and peered out . A panther is like a cat in slyness or cunning , watching stealthily for prey and springing upon it in the most unexpected way . And so , before he ventured out , he scanned with sharp eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not fancy being the mouse for these three great cats . Satisfying himself as well as he could , that the way was clear , he sprang forth , closed the door quickly behind him , and rushed for the house . But no panthers appeared ; they had probably retired into the deep shadows of the hemlocks . His " Wide Awake " night was ended . Upon investigating the scene of the night 's operations , he found the sty amazingly scratched and gnawed in many places , proving the strength of tooth and nail and the ferocity of his jailors . Several long deep gashes on one of the pigs showed where a panther had thrust in his paw by a crack and tried to seize a victim . But my story is only half told . * * * * * An old adage says , " It is a poor rule that wo n't work both ways ; " and so thought Jacob . He resolved in the morning , that if the creatures should come back the next night , as they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to teach them the pleasure of being imprisoned in a pig-sty . Anybody who has lived in a region infested by carnivorous animals , knows how they prowl around the settler 's cabin the night after any fat animal , cattle or swine is killed , for the meat . They snuff the blood from afar in the forest , and hasten to the place to have a tooth , or a paw , in the division of the spoils . Knowing this peculiarity of panthers , Jacob and Polly held a consultation , and as it was about time in the autumn to make pork of the pigs , they decided to perform that work during the day . The scent of blood would serve as a double inducement for his visitors to return . So , in the afternoon , the task was done , the pen and vicinity being the scene of the slaughter , and all the bloody tidbits placed inside the door . Every such thing was arranged to attract the animals into the sty if possible . The meat was placed safely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen was so constructed as to open and shut something like the lower sash of a window , by sliding up and down , a peg holding it open by day and closed by night . When the door was open , this peg had only to be pulled out , to let it shut down like a flash ; and being shut no animal could open it . Jacob went along the brook and obtained a quantity of bark from the moosewood , ( Dirca palustris , ) of which he made a strong cord , long enough to reach from the pen to the house . One end of this he tied tightly to the peg that supported the door , and the other he made fast inside the house . When night came , he was ready for visitors . Stationing themselves at the window , he and Polly watched and listened . Hardly had it become dark , when they heard the mewing of the panthers at no great distance in the forest . Persons who are familiar only with the mewing of cats , have little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ring through the woods . In a little time they distinctly heard one of them leap upon the pen and begin scratching as the night before ; and in a moment more , by the confined sound of purring and growling , it was evident they had entered the sty and were disputing over the morsels of meat . Then Jacob gave the bark cord a vigorous jerk and they heard the door drop . I suppose it would be impossible to describe the excitement of Polly and Jacob at this moment , but the girls and boys can imagine something of it . They did not dare to go out to see if they had caught the panthers , lest , having failed , the panthers might catch them . Before morning , however , they were sure enough that one or more was captured , for there was a great deal of smothered howling , just as it would sound from animals shut in a pen . Previous wakefulness made sleep necessary during most of the night , but at daybreak they were astir and at the casement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it became light enough , they discovered a huge , handsome panther stretched out on the roof of the pen , her head lying across her paws , like a cat asleep . By this they knew that others were confined inside , for whose escape this one was waiting . It was but a brief task for Jacob , who was a good marksman , to point his rifle through the window and give her its contents . Without a struggle the splendid animal straightened her powerful limbs and died . Reloading his gun , Jacob walked cautiously toward the pen , watching in every direction , lest there might be another one outside ready to spring upon him , but seeing none , he went up and peered through a crack . At once two pairs of eyes flashed at him , and fierce growls remonstrated against the state of affairs . Had Barnum flourished in those days , Jacob might have found a market for the animals alive , but as it was he regarded it safer to shoot them as quickly as possible , through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side near the house he discovered that they were mother and full-grown kittens , all very large and plump , with thick , glossy fur . I have only to add , that he was paid by the state a bounty of twenty-four dollars apiece for killing the panthers , which was quite a fortune for a pioneer in those days . Their red-brown skins , sewed together , made a larger and nicer lap-robe than the hide of any buffalo ; and years after , with Jacob 's children , I took many a sleigh-ride under this warm covering . All in favor of numbering Jacob among the " Wide Awakes , " say aye ! SURPRISED . I. " Mitz " began to cry piteously . " Mieu -- mieu -- mi-e-e , " he cried , and all little Hannah 's trotting only made him worse . At that moment " Mitz " was wrapped in a pillow-case , while his head was buried in Hannah 's little shawl . His ears were pulled down , and his promising tail was all in a heap , and his resplendent moustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howled most dolefully ? It is not necessary to say that Mitz was a kitten . Mitz 's mother was sitting in a corner of the fire-place , with tail neatly curled about her paws . Three of Mitz 's brothers and sisters were lost somewhere in the shadow about her , and two others the children had put to bed . It was a queer old room in an old German house ; a room large and dim , with two great windows full of diamond-shaped panes , and on the opposite side a huge chimney with a tall , narrow mantel-shelf and a tiled hearth , on which stood two brass griffins , shiny and ferocious . In the depths in the fire-place , behind the griffins , there Mitz was sobbing . I say sobbing because the children were playing " house , " and Mitz was supposed to be the baby . What a fine play-house this big fire-place was in summer ! It had in turn figured as Aladdin 's cave and a school-house ; a brigand ambush , and a dwelling with modern improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare room , and you had to look closely into the back of the hearth to see the two little figures -- one trotting the baby , and the other rocking the doll 's cradle in which two of Mitz 's sisters were tied with cord , for their good , of course . But Mitz 's piteous cries raised echoes . " Mieu , mieu ! " cried Mitz , trying to claw something under the pillow case . " Mieu , mieu ! " chimed in Mitz 's sisters , while little Hannah trotted desperately , and the doll 's cradle was rocked as if by a small tempest . Illustration : HE WOULD N'T EAT HIS BREAD AND MILK . " It 's no use , " said little Hannah , in great perplexity ; " all people 's children ar n't always bad ! Mitz -- you wicked Mitz ! " And she shook that badly-behaved child . " He 's been crying ever since we began to play . He would n't eat his bread and milk , though I tied on his best new bib . Oh , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Suppose , " said little Hannah , vainly endeavoring to pacify the indignant Mitz , " suppose , Mrs. Liseke , we take the children out for a walk ? " Out of the hearth crept Hannah , with Mitz hugged to her heart , and her short , round figure all the rounder for an ancient shawl and a venerable cap perched on the top of her plump , rosy face . Hannah had just passed the brass griffins , when some one burst into the room . There was a vision of two long stockings with a hole in one knee , a faded velveteen suit , a pair of brass-tipped boots , a bright patch in the seat of the short breeches , and a look of triumph on a round face with a turn-up nose , while a grin , extending from ear to ear , discovered a loss of several front teeth in the big mouth . " Max , how you frightened me ! " cried Hannah ; then , " oh , Maxy , what 's the matter ? " Mitz was forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before Hannah could prevent , had crept out of his bandages and was standing a free cat , with arched back and a defiant tail . By this time Mrs. Liseke had come out of the fire-place with her two youngest in her arms . She was elegantly dressed in a bed-sheet , which trailed behind her and was gracefully tied under her chin . Mitz 's mother followed , stretching all-fours luxuriously . No , Max would n't tell . He plunged two black hands in his breeches ' pockets and made up faces and danced a wild war dance , while Mitz and family fled into various corners . " Why do n't you slap him ? " pouted Liseke . " No , " little Hannah said , wisely . " He likes cookies . " Coaxingly : " Maxy dear , wo n't you tell ? " " No , you bet I wo n't ! you 're nothing but girls . " " Is it a surprise , Max ? " Hannah suggested , anxiously . " Wo n't tell yer , " contemplating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big cookey if you 'll tell . " " You nasty thing , I do n't want a cookey . " " Maxy : two ? **29;744;TOOLONG ! now you 'll tell ? " " Give ' em first , " said this practical boy , apparently conquered . Six noble cookies were counted into his hand . " Now I wo n't tell yer at all . It 's a surprise ! Father said I was n't to tell , " he cried , scornfully , with his mouth full . " Oh , Haneke , papa 's going to surprise us ! Now I know what it is ! " Liseke whispered excitedly " It is a piano , and perhaps -- perhaps a stool . Try and find out from Max . " " Maxy , dear , " Hannah said , imploringly , " is it covered with plush ? " " Why , how do you know ? " Max cried , unguardedly , as he was finishing his sixth cookey . " I knew it , I knew it , " Liseke gasped , wildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , if you bang on it ? " Hannah cried , with a beating heart . " Why -- why -- yes , " Max acknowledged , wrathfully , with a futile kick at Mitz 's mother , who was purring about his legs . " There , you mean thing , you 're always trying to find out something ! Just you wait till I tell yer anything more ! " he cried , and slam-banged himself out of the room , with his bosom full of suppressed injuries . " He was mad because we guessed , " Liseke cried , joyfully . " A piano ! " Hannah gasped , as the door went to with a crash . " A stool , " Liseke added ; then , " Let 's tell mamma ! " That dear , gentle mother , sitting by the dim window trying to mend by the last flicker of daylight ! She looked up lovingly as the door flew open . " Mamma , " gasped Hannah , " papa 's got a surprise for us . " " Max said so , " chimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . " " It 's a piano . " " And -- and a stool . " Illustration : MAX KNOWS OF A SURPRISE . " He said it'ud make a noise ; and was covered with plush . " " O , dear children , surely papa would n't buy you a piano . He can not afford it , " and two kind hands were stretched out to the children . " Oh , yes it is , " the two cried hopefully . " You know , mamma , papa 's always promised us a surprise , and he 's never done it yet ! " Hannah cried , and laid her round cheek against the delicate , pale face . There was no use arguing ; the children were convinced . They were sure of the piano . " There , mamma , did n't we tell you so , " they cried , as Max came in , mysterious and exasperating . " Father says the surprise will be ready for you to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock in the sitting room , " he cried , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch in the seat of his breeches . " Poor child , " thought the little mother , regretfully ; " he is all in rags -- I wish I had some money ! " with a patient sigh . " There , mamma , we told you so ! It 'll stand by the window in the corner of the sitting-room , " two excited voices cried , and the next moment the sitting-room was invaded by two small figures who looked at the empty corner by the window with delicious expectancy ; and so the day went slowly by . In another room the little mother looked at her husband wistfully . " Karl , " she began , timidly , " have you really prepared a surprise for the children ? You wo n't disappoint them ? " " Betty , do n't say a word ! Wait ! Did I ever disappoint you ? " Betty turned away with a half-suppressed sigh , while papa Karl strode up and down the room grandly , virtuously , with a good deal of injured innocence in his face . II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't slept a wink all night . Mitz and family had come purring into the room in the early morning , as usual , but had been shamefully neglected . All six sat in a row by the bedside , watching indignantly the two heads peeping out from the feathers . " To-day ! " Hannah sighed rapturously . How they got into their clothes , they never knew . As for eating ! why , they could n't touch the delicious rolls , the glasses of milk , even that delicious preserve , " Apfel-kraut . " Max alone was himself , and , in his injured way , managed to eat enough for three . Yet , he was not satisfied ; at the age of eight life had few attractions left for him . Who could believe that a September day would be so long ? Or that the old clock in the hall would go so ridiculously slow ? There was a quiet jocularity in the motion of its long pendulum , as if it were laughing bitterly that anyone could be in a hurry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , dear ! " Hannah said with a sigh , " will it never be three ? " How they kept their ears open to hear a crowd of men come stumbling up the stone steps with the weight of the piano ! " Perhaps it is already here , " Liseke said , faintly . " Perhaps it 's coming , " Hannah suggested , hopefully . " One -- two -- three --  , " the clock struck . " Come , mamma ! " the children cried ; and so they opened the sitting-room door with trembling hands . Nobody there ; nothing there . Mamma sat down in a corner and began knitting , while the children looked out of the window into the narrow street to see a wagon drive up to the house . " Perhaps they 've forgotten all about it , " Liseke was saying tremulously , when the sitting-room door burst open and there stood Max and behind him , papa Karl . " Oh , Max , Max , where 's the surprise ? " the children implored . " Why , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turning himself about disclosed his small person arrayed in a new velveteen suit brilliant with brass buttons . " Oh -- dear -- dear , " sobbed little Hannah with the tears rolling down , " we thought it was a piano ! ' " Did I say it was a piano ? " Max howled . " You said **25;775;TOOLONG with pl -- plush , " Liseke sobbed . " Well , is n't it ? " " And -- and you said it ' ud make a noise if one b -- banged on it , " Hannah cried , piteously . " Well , see if it do n't ! " Max shrieked , when papa Karl 's hand came down upon him with such superb effect there was no doubting the truth of the assertion . " Ungrateful children , you are never satisfied , " papa Karl cried majestically . " No matter what I do for you , you 're always ungrateful --  " Illustration : THE SHAMEFULLY NEGLECTED SIX . " But Karl , " mamma Betty interrupted , with quiet decision , in the midst of a storm of sobs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted because Max gets a new suit -- something necessary . " " And it 's so tight I ca n't breathe , " Max cried , goaded to frenzy by the general grief . " Ingrates ! " gasped papa Karl , and strode up and down the room , while Liseke sobbed her grief out on mamma 's shoulder , and Max hid his face in her lap , and Hannah was bravely trying to dry her brown eyes . " Karl , they are children , " mamma Betty said : softly patting Max 's head ; then lifting it up gently ; " Max , go to the confectioners . " Max sprang to his feet as a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet . " Here are ten groschens ; "  - -  mamma Betty took them out of her scanty purse with something of a sigh ;  --  " buy as much cake and whatever you like . Liseke tell Marie to make a pitcher of chocolate instantly . My little Hannah , you may set the table . " " Oh , mamma , may I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded , as Max and Liseke bounded out of the room . " Yes , but be careful , my dear . " " Chocolate ! " said papa Karl with some scorn , " bribing them for the sake of peace . " They were children , she said . Had papa Karl forgotten that he , too , had once been a child ? Papa Karl had forgotten this trifling circumstance but he magnanimously declared he forgave them all . There was a pattering of feet down the entry , and three tear-stained faces looked timidly in . " The chocolate is on the table , " Hannah said bravely , with only one tiny sob . Then the door closed and the little feet patted down the corridor . " Come Karl , and drink a cup of chocolate . You need it as much as the children , for you were disappointed also . You thought to give them a pleasure , you mistaken man , " mamma Betty said with a little smile . " I really meant to , " said Karl , quite softened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suddenly paused . " Karl , " she said quite seriously , " will you promise me one thing ? " " Yes , my dear . " " Never surprise us again ; surprises always end in disappointments . " " Well , Betty I promise , " papa Karl said hurriedly , and he kept his word . So years after , when papa Karl 's purse was a good deal fuller , and a piano did make its appearance , it was welcomed solemnly , as something long and rapturously expected .

Illustration The custom of playing a joke upon one 's neighbor upon the First of April is of very ancient origin , dating so far back in the past that we are unable to tell just when or with what nation it had its birth . There was a time , very many years ago , when the year began on the twenty-fifth of March . Then , as now , New Years ' was a great feast of the Church ; and as the First of April was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the commencement of the feast -- it has been thought that the feast which terminated upon that day closed in April-fooling . In support of this theory we find that the Catholic Church , at one time in its early history , observed an annual feast called " The Feast of the Ass . " The day upon which this feast was held answers to our sixth of January , which now is called " Twelfth-Day . " The day was devoted to merry-making , masquerading , jesting , and to fun in general . Among the Hindoos there is a feast which is still observed , called the " Huli , " which , continuing several days , terminates on the thirty-first of March . One of the distinctive features of this feast is , that every one endeavors to send his neighbor upon some errand to some imaginary person , or to persons whom he knows are not at home ; and then all enjoy a good laugh at the disappointment of the messenger . The observance of this custom by this peculiar people seems to indicate that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not impossible that the manner in which the day is observed by us may have been suggested by some pagan custom . But whatever or whenever its origin may have been , we find it so widely prevalent over the earth , and with so very near a coincidence of day , as to be proof of its great antiquity . Illustration The observance of April Fools ' Day is a very popular one in France , and we find traces of it there at a much earlier period than we do in England . It is related that Francis , Duke of Lorraine , and his wife , having been confined at Nantes as prisoners , successfully made their escape on the First of April . Taking advantage of this day , when they knew the guards would be upon the lookout lest some joke should be played upon them , they disguised themselves as peasants , the Duke carrying a hod upon his shoulder , and his wife bearing a basket of rubbish upon her back . Thus disguised , they passed through the gates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one person , however , who guessed their secret . This was a woman who was an enemy of the Duke and his wife , and she at once resolved that they should not thus escape . She therefore hastened to one of the guards and told him of the escape of the prisoners . But the soldier only regarded it as an attempt to play a joke upon him , and at once cried out " April Fool ! " to let the woman know that he had not forgotten what day it was . Hearing the soldier call out this , the rest of the guard , led by their sergeant , shouted " April Fool ! " until the woman was forced to retire without being able to accomplish her errand . When at last it was learned that she had told them the truth , it was too late , the Duke and his wife having made good their escape . In France , the person who is April-fooled is called poisson d'Avril . Upon a certain occasion a French lady stole a watch from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discovered , and the lady accused of having taken the watch , she endeavored to pass off the affair as un poisson d'Avril . Having denied that the watch was in her possession , her rooms were searched , and the missing article found upon a chimney-piece . When shown the watch the thief coolly replied : " Yes ; I think I have made the messenger a fine poisson d'Avril . " However , the magistrate ordered that she be confined in prison until the First of April following , " comme un poisson d ' Avril . " Illustration In England , the custom of April-fooling is practiced very much as it is in the United States . " A knowing boy will despatch a younger brother to see a public statue descend from its pedestal at a particular appointed hour . A crew of giggling servant-maids will get hold of some simple swain , and send him to a bookseller 's shop for the ' History of Eve 's Grandmother , ' or to a chemist 's for a pennyworth of ' pigeon 's milk , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' in which last case the messenger secures a hearty application of the strap to his shoulders , and is sent home in a state of bewilderment as to what the affair means . The urchins in the street make a sport of calling to some passing beau to look to his coat-skirts ; when he either finds them with a piece of paper pinned to them or not ; in either of which cases he is saluted as an ' April-fool ! ' " Illustration : FIRST OF APRIL DANGER . It has been said that " what compound is to simple addition , so is Scotch to English April-fooling . " The people living in Scotland are not content with making a neighbor believe some single piece of absurdity , but practice jokes upon him ad infinitum . Having found some unsuspecting person , the individual playing the joke sends him away with a letter to some friend residing two or three miles off , for the professed purpose of asking for some useful information , or requesting a loan of some article , while in reality the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of April , Hunt the gowk another mile . " The person to whom the letter is sent at once catches the idea of the person sending it , and informs the carrier with a very grave face that he is unable to grant his friend the favor asked , but if he will take a second note to Mr. So-and-so , he will get what was wanted . The obliging , yet unsuspecting carrier receives the note , and trudges off to the person designated , only to be treated by him in the same manner ; and so he goes from one to another , until some one , taking pity on him , gives him a gentle hint of the trick that has been practiced upon him . A successful affair of this kind will furnish great amusement to an entire neighborhood for a week at a time , during which time the person who has been victimized can hardly show his face . The Scotch employ the term " gowk " to express a fool in general , but more especially an April fool ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " hunting the gowk . " Sometimes the First of April has been employed by persons wishing to perpetrate an extensive joke upon society . Among those which have come to our knowledge the most remarkable one occurred in the city of London in 1860 . Towards the close of March a large number of persons received through the post-office a card upon which the following was printed : " TOWER OF LONDON . ADMIT THE BEARER AND FRIEND to view the ANNUAL CEREMONY OF WASHING THE WHITE LIONS , on SUNDAY , APRIL 1ST , 1860 . Admitted only at the White Gate. * * * * * It is particularly requested that no gratuities be given to the wardens or their assistants . " To give the card an official appearance , there was a seal placed at one corner of it , marked by an inverted sixpence . There were but few persons receiving the cards who saw through the trick , and hence it was highly successful . As soon as the first streaks of gray were seen in the east , cabs began to rattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sunday morning , vainly endeavoring to discover the " White Gate , " the joke being that there was no such gate . In the United States the greater part of the attention which is paid to April Fools ' Day comes from children . In cities , especially , it is made much of by the " street Arabs , " who watch every opportunity to play some trick upon every countryman whom they chance to see . Although we may laugh at jokes which are played upon All-Fools ' Day , yet the greater part of them are unjust and improper , and it would be much better were they left undone . While speaking of April fools we are reminded of the Wise Fools of Gotham , and are constrained to tell our young readers about them in this connection . Gotham is a village in Nottinghamshire , in England . At one time , when King John and his retinue were marching towards the village , the people learned that he intended to pass through Gotham meadow . Now the ground over which a king passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer the king to pass through their meadow the villagers saw that they would lose it . Illustration : DROWNING THE EEL . This they resolved not to do , and therefore devised a plan which caused the king to pass another way . When the king learned what had been done he was very angry , and at once sent messengers to inquire why they had been so rude , intending , no doubt , to punish them for what they had done . When the Gothamites learned of the approach of the messengers they were as anxious to escape punishment as they had been to save their meadow . They immediately came together and agreed upon a plan by which to save themselves . They at once set about carrying their plans into effect , and when the king 's messengers arrived they found some of the inhabitants endeavoring to drown an eel in a pond ; some dragging their carts and wagons to the top of a barn to shade the wood from the sun 's rays ; some tumbling cheeses down a hill in the expectation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some were employed in hedging in a cuckoo which had perched upon an old bush . Seeing men engaged in such employments as these the king 's servants were convinced that the villagers were all fools , and quite unworthy the king 's notice . The villagers , however , seeing that they had outwitted the king , considered themselves wise . To the present day a " cuckoo bush " stands upon the spot where it is said that the inhabitants of Gotham endeavored to hedge in the bird . There is another class of Fools which deserve mention . These are called Court Fools or Jesters . Until within a comparatively short time ago , every king had his Jester , whose duty it was to furnish mirth and merriment for the royal household . The real Court Fool was in reality a fool by birth , while a Jester was a pretended fool . The former was dressed in " a parti-colored dress , including a cowl , which ended in a cock's-head , and was winged with a couple of long ears ; he , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminating either in an inflated bladder or some other ludicrous object , to be employed in slapping inadvertent neighbors . " Illustration : SAVING THE SHINGLES . On the other hand , the Jester selected his clothes not only with a view to their grotesqueness but also with an eye to their richness . While the real fool " haunted the kitchen and scullery , messing almost with the dogs , and liable , when malapert , to a whipping , " the pretended fool was comparatively a companion to the sovereign who engaged his services . Berdic , the Jester of the Court of William the Conqueror , for instance , was considered of so great importance that three towns and five carucates were conferred upon him .
