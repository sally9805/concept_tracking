txt The House took up the Senate amendments to the Post Office Appropriation bill to-day , and with one or two exceptions supported the recommendations of the Appropriation Committee concerning them . The . House , therefore , refuses to allow the amendments requiring star route lettings to be advertised in Washington newspapers , raising the special fund for railroad service to $650,000 , and increasing the sums appropriated for route agents , mail route messengers , and mail messengers . It allows the amendments supplying fourth class Postmasters with scales and machines for canceling stamps , adding $150,000 to the sum appropriated for Post Office clerks , adding $500,000 to the sum appropriated for railway mail service , and affording additional protection for contractors ' hired men . It refuses to agree to the amendment which limits the power to transfer contracts to sub-contractors to contracts hereafter made , and emphatically repudiates the amendment by which the senate undertook to revive the franking privilege . The debate upon this amendment was interesting . Mr. Cannon urged the House to take such action that the sentiments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference committees . Mr. Hill , of NewJersey , said the people expected that Congress would lighten their postal burdens , instead of legislating for the benefit of members themselves . He declared that the allowance of 5125 per annum for each member for stationery was amply sufficient to supply both stationery and postage to most of the members . The people desired cheaper postage . He read from the recent report of the Sixth Auditor , showing that the department , because of economical mauagement and a great increase of business , had become self-sustaining . Mr. Robinson , of Brooklyn , condemned the existing law , which allows members to send heavy publications through the mails , free of postage , to persons who can afford to pay for them , and argued that the poor pensioner , who inclosed to him a stamp for a reply to his letter , was more deserving of the franking privilege than the rich farmer or Professor who received the documents . He favored the abolition of the privilege so far as it applied to these publications . Mr. Robeson opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Senators and members would be compelled to use penalty envelopes , but the House refused to sustain him . Mr. Cobb , of Indiana , declared that ho would not vote to increase his pay in this way . With the annual allowance of $.125 he could very nearly pay for all his stationery and stamps , and $2.5 would procure all the stationery a member could use . Mr. Updegraff , of Ohio , supported this assertion . Mr. Brown , of Indians , said that a member could send anything through the mails without postage if he could only get it into the Record . The Rouse was sending off car-loads of such matter every day . The inventor of the Record deserved to be shot , for the Record bad killed more Congressmen than the Potomac Flats . The allowance of 8/25 would pay every penny of a member 's postage , and if anything were to be done it would be better to abolish 95 per cent . of the public printing . When the first vote was taken upon the Senate amendment there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the vote taken after the bill got into the House was unanimous , so that the House members of the conference committee will have no difficulty in understanding the sentiment of the body Which they will represent in the conference . The Indians of Indian Territory found today an eloquent defender of their treaty rights in Senator Ingalls . The bill granting the right of way to the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Company across the . lands of the Choctaws and Chickasaws in Indian Territory was once more under consideration , with an amendment of:end by Mr. Ingalls pending . Mr. Hawley , in returning to the attack on the bill , said he only desired that the Indians should be allowed to say yes or no to the proposition to cut their lands . The first bill brought in had recognized some rights of the several Indian nations , for it pretended to ratify an act of the Choctaw Council . This bill pretended to do no such thing , but proposed to grant a right of way regardless of the rights of the interested tribes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do right . It was his opinion that " Uncle Sam ought to be a gentleman " in his transactions . Mr. Plumb took different ground from that occupied by his colleague . He had owned a quarter section of land 25 years ago , and when the Government desired to grant the right of way to a railroad through his property , his protests were in vain . He did not want the Indian granted privileges which white men could not enjoy , and he did not believe the Indians ought to be permitted to stand in the way of needed improvements . At this point Mr. Ingalls declared that the error of the gentlemen who opposed his amendment was in supposing that the five civilized tribes in Indian Territory occupied the same relations to the Government as the roving tribes of the plains . Having enumerated some facts to show how much more worthy of praise the civilized tribes were than their brethren , he read from the treaty of 1830 a clause stipulating that the tribes removed from Georgia to Indian Territory should hold their lands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming hack to a point touched on a few days ago , he declared that the bill was equivocal . One day its promoters had asked to have the consent of the Choctaws ratified ; the next day the bill had vanished into an abyss . One day the Seligmans wanted the right , and the next day it was discovered that Jay . Gould , the owner of the Missouri , Kansas and Texas , had secured control ; and it was now proposed to overcome competition by giving the right to a company that would never build a railroad . Mr. Plumb maintained that the treaty of 1S65 plainly contemplated the granting of right of way to railroads across the Indian Territory , and the provisions of this later treaty were still under discussion when the Senate sent the bill over for another day as the unfinished busfness and went into executive session . Under the Anthony rule the Senate occupied for the second time the greater part of the hour devoted to the consideration of business under that regulation in discussing and finally passing a bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy . About nine years ago ho was cited to appear before a board for examination on an application to be promoted . Capt . Corbin refused to submit to the examination and was retired . He now asks to be restored as Commodore , with back pay for the nine years as an officer of that rank . The Democrats supported the bill , with the help of Mr. Cameron , of Pennsylvania , and Mr. Mclli/l , of Iowa , while the Republicans opposed it , Mr. Anthony characterizing it as a bill that should be entitled " an act to reward disobedience of orders and to encourage insubordination , " . An amendment prevailed requiring Capt . Corbin to submit to an examination for promotion , but if he is promoted he will receive the full pay he would have earned if he had been promoted nine years ago . The House is always ready to assert and defend its right to originate appropriation bills and to reprove the Senate when that body rashly encroaches upon this prerogative . Some of tile Indians in the Indian Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Government wants money immediately in order to restore the ration to its original size and prevent an outbreak . The Senate passed a bill appropriating $50.000 for this purpose , and sent it to the House . The House to-day coolly rejected it upon the ground that the Senate bad no right to originate such a bill . A new bill , almost identical with the Senate bill , was then introduced and passed , and to-morrow the . Senate will be asked to concur .
