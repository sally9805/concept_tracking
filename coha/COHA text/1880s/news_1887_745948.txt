txt To the ordinary observer there is nothing encouraging to the Republicans in the present situation of the contest for United States Senator from New-Jersey . The advantages last week were all kith the Democrats . There is no denying that . The seating of both Turley and Walter , in the face of notorious facts which ought to have kept them out , has given the Democrats a lead which they will not let go . The two Labor members , who have all along aspired to hold the balance of power , threw away their chance of gaining that enviable position when they voted to seat Turley , as his vote enabled the Democrats to seat Walter , and as each will vote for the other , there is no doubt that the House will vote to sustain the favorable report which , the Committee on Elections is certain to make in their cases . There is a misapprehension in the minds of Republicans generally throughout the State regarding the status of these two men . It is asserted with confidence that the United States Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes of two men so manifestly interlopers in the Assembly . Senator Sewell understands the matter differently . He understands that when the General Assembly shall have passed upon the oases of Turley and Walter by adopting the favorable report of the Elections Committee the United States Senate will not " go back of the returns , " inasmuch as the Constitution of the State makes each house of the Legislature the judge of the election and qualifications of its own members . Ex-Gov . Abbett understands this also , and that is why he has been anxious to have the cases passed upon by the House . Of course the Republicans made a blunder in not taking up the ease of Walter first . In that case the two Labor men would have voted to order a new election . That would have kept one Democrat out , and that party would . then have been unable to have seated Turley , or to have kept him if seated . The action of the Labor men in voting for Turley , and thus voting themselves into a position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats here . Mr. Abbett has been coquetting with them ever since the election , and has offered them everything to gain their votes without securing any pledges from them . As Chairman Allan , of the Democratic State Committee , remarked to a high State official here the other night , " I have offered those Labor members everything , but they want the whole earth , and a big slice of the moon , and I wo n't give it to them . " However , inasmuch as Speaker Baird is still recalcitrant , and is almost openly hostile to Abbett , the latter is short of one vote to secure his election , assuming that all the other Democratic members will support him . So it may be , after all , that the votes of the Labor men may be worth something to him , though they can hardly be worth much to anybody else , from present appearances . Will all the other Democrats support Mr. Abbett for United States Senator 4 . That is a question that is worrying the ex-Governor not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ex-Gov . Bedle had votes among the Democratic members that might cling to him despite any caucus dictation . It is now well understood that Senator Chattle is strongly in favor of one of the ablest , purest , and most respected Governors New-Jersey ever had , a native of old Monmouth , and there is no doubt that Monmouth County will sustain her Senator if he chooses to bolt a Democratic caucus which shall attempt to send Mr. Abbett to the United States Senate in preference to her own ex-Gov . Beale . Abbett 's affiliations with Congressman Pidcock , who is notoriously a man after his own heart , and his calling upon that Congressman of unsavorary reputation to come from Washington to dragoon members into the support of Abbett , has alienated some of the more honorable men in the Senate , and it is evident that Senator , of Sussex ; Senator Moon , of Warren , and others who might be named are exceedingly loth to help Abbett to the Senate . While the Democratic newspapers of the State , inspired by Mr. Abbett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? indignation the last week over the failure of the Republican Senate to organize , and have been demanding that the nine Democratic Senators organize a little Senate of their osrn , these Senators have been regarding the matter with an indifference that must have been aggravating to the ex-Governor and his henchmen . With two or three exceptions they have just said to the Republican majority : " Gentlemen , take all the time you want to organize ; we do n't care if you - wait till next March ; only give us notice when you do propose to organize , so that we may be on hand ; but we are in no hurry whatever ; and never you mind what Mr. Abbett says . " And so the Democratic Senators quietly went home and left the Republicans in full possession of the field , with the assurance that they would be dealt with honorably and fairly . This is significant as showing how little hold the es-Governor 's canvass lias on the better class of Democrats in. the upper house . When will the Senate organize ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disposition has been to watt until the Assembly has declared itself regarding the cases of Turley and Walter . But that has been done , to all intents and purposes . The decision is as good as made , , and in favor of the sitting mem -- hers . There is no need to wait longer on that account . There have been many Republicans who have advised that the Senate shall not organize at all this year . Thatpropbeition was discussed the night before the Assembly met , when it was found that there was strong opposition to such an extreme course . It is most likelythat the Senate will organize this week . Some of the Senators favor organizing to-morrow night , in order to precipitate the Senatorial fight as soon as possible . The law says that the two houses shall vote for Senator on the second Tuesday after the organization of the Legislature . By organizing the Senate to-morrow night this would bring on the voting for Senator on one week from next Tuesday . The Senators who favor this course argue that it would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are somewhat disorganized . Others who are " hoping for something to turn up " favor postponing the organization until Tuesday , - which would defer the Senatorial contest for another week , or until two-weeks from next Tuesday . The impression is gaining ground that Mr. Abbett can not win the prize . If not , ex-Gov . Bedle is the most likely of any Democrat to succeed . His election would be regarded with great satisfaction by the best men in the State of all parties . Senator Sewell is still hopeful of a reelection , although outsiders can see no possible chance for him to win , now that the Democrats have 32 votes in the House and 9 in the Senate , with the Labor contingent to fall back upon . Some of his warmest friends and admirers confess that they can not see any way in which he can hope to win . He can not get the votes of the two Labor members ; that is about as sure as anything can be in New-Jersey politics . Then he has but 38 Republican votes to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , i which is not absolutely certain . This would necessitate his getting the help of two or three Democrhts . Such things have been attempted before , but never with success in New-Jersey . There are other Republicans in the State who could count certainly upon receiving every one of the 38 Republican votes in the Legislature and the two Labor votes besides , and who in that case would need but one Democratic vote to elect . There are Republicans who could get such Democratic support without the faintest suspicion of corruption attaching to the men who voted for them . If Senator Sewell sees that his own success is out of the question it is to be hoped that he will stand aside in time for some other more available Republican to capture the prize . There has been a good deal of quiet amusement the last week over the airy way in which Senator came on from Washington , viewed the ground over , expressed privately his surprise at the gross mismanagement of the Democratic canvass , talked with Mr. Kinney , of Sussex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had whipped that bolter back into harness , and had set everything in good trim for another Democratic victory . The real story of how Mr. Kinney was forced back , much against his . will , into the Abbett harness would not look well in print , not being exactly adapted for family reading , as the Abbett men tell the tale themselves . However , Mr. Abbett 's friends are quietly biding their time , and if their man ever gets to the Senate there will be a big fight between him and for the control of the Federal patronage of the State . Abbett thinks ho owes nothing to in this fight , and intends to get even with him when he gets the chance . Mr. , by the way , is sitting very heavily on that little deal between Secretary of State Kelsey and Chairman , of the Democratic State Committee , for the former 's reappointment . The Democrats all over the State have been given to uncle ' stand that it is in the interest of " Democratic harmony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone up a chorus from the Democratic newspapers counseling the " letting of bygones be bygones , " and the deal has been verygenerally approved since it was first announced , in THE TIMES . But Mr. is still obdurate , and Mr.Kelsey is worried .
