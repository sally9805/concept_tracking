txt Mr. SHEEHAN has discovered a mare 's nest . Mr. SHEEHAN is the young man who came all the way from Erie County to take the place of Mr. McCurmoh as Secretary of the Aqueduct Commission . His full name is JOHN C. SHEEHAN . He is a brother of Assemblyman SHEEHAN , who , by the way , is a bright and . able man and was the leader of the Democratic side in the Assembly last Winter . JOHN C. SHEEHAN , his brother , is perhaps bright and possibly able , but he is still young . He seems to lack sense . If the report which he presented to the Aqueduct Commissioners yesterday were all true and justified , and . if it bore the construction which Mr. SHEEHAN and Mai , Jr. , put upon it , it would create a sensation second only to the exposure of the work of the ring in which Fish , Jr. , played the ignoble part of aiding and abetting schemes of FLYNN and SQUIRE . In substance Mr. ShEEHAN 's report shows this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aqueduct Commissioners have thus far taken 1612 acres of land , costing $59,141 , and have paid out for the expenses of the Commissioners of Appraisal through whom this land was acquired the sum of $104,472 . This is a bad showing certainly according to Mr. SHEEHAN . But it seems , furthermore , that Mr. SHEEHAN has been burrowing among the books and papers of the Aqueduct Commission and he finds no vouchers or copies of vouchers for any of the expenditures mentioned in his startling report . Mr. SHEEHAN and . FISH , Jr. , seem to have been shocked at the absence of these vouchers . On further inquiry and reflection it may occur to Mr. SHEEHAN and to FISH , Jr. , that there is no occasion for alarm . It appears from the statement of Corporation Counsel LACOMBE , who has some knowledge of the doings of the Aqueduct Commission , that the 1612 acres of land , for which $59,141 has been paid , is only a small part of the total amount in the appraisement of which the commission expended $104,472 . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coparceners , Messrs . BARNES and RIDGWAY , can show that any part of this $104,472 was improperly or corruptly expended they should do so at once . The absence of the vouchers may be accounted for , perhaps , by the fact that under the provisions of chapter 490 of the Laws of 1883 , which is the act constituting the Aqueduct Commission , all bills and expenditures of the Commissioners of Appraisal and their reports as to the value of land to be taken for aqueduct purposes must be examined and . confirmed by the Supreme Court . And it is only after this examination and confirmation by the Supreme Court that these expenses can be paid . by the Controller of the city of New-York . As the Controller pays the bills it is somewhat natural that he and not the Aqueduct Commission should have and retain the vouchers . Nevertheless Mr. SaEr , - HAN , it appears , can obtain duplicates of the vouchers . We believe we have stated , and fairly stated , the two points made by Mr. SHEEHAN in his report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous impression that Mr. SHEEHAN ought to resign at once and go home . Erie County may need . him ; New-York does not . It also confirms our impression that Messrs . BARNES , RIDGWAY , and young FISH ought to resign and go to their respective homes . This despairing effort of theirs to discredit the work of the commission previous to its reorganization and to divert the public attention from the purposes and consequences of the conspiracy which injected . them into the commission is a dismal failure .
