ARTICLE 11. - THE AMERICAN BOARD AT NEW YORK . THE late meeting of the American Board has left on the minds of most of its members , and of the churches generally , a more favorable impression than any other meeting for several years . As time goes on , as the work of missions enlarges , as the desire for union among Christians is more deeply felt , and finds more frequent expression everywhere , all eyes turn to the oldest missionary society in this country for an example of the true spirit of brotherhood . The great respect felt for its founders , and its earlier members-with its noble line of presidents , and its missionaries renowned for scholarship as well as fervent devotion ,  --  has made the very name of the American Board dear to all Christian hearts , and a title of the highest honor both in England and America . Meeting in the city of New York , after the lapse of more than two thirds as many years as make up its whole existence , and bringing together a larger number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be hoped , that a wider view of Christian fellowship and obligation would be gained . Nor have these expectations been disappointed . While the sense of danger may have led to some hasty expressions on the one hand , or to a desire to repress discussion altogether , it begins to be felt that after all , the way of safety is the way of openness and candor . Time and truth are always in league together , and if men can speak out their full convictions , and listen with a friendly ear to others , progress will surely be made in the right way . The great gain in the meeting at New York was a belief in the possibility of union , if a fair presentation were made on both sides . Hitherto such possibility has been openly or tacitly denied . The Board through almost all its history has rnled by unanimous or almost unanimous consent . Of late it has not been so . Agreement of two thirds and one third has been impossible . This view was broken down at New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , that we could agree if difficulties were fairly met , fouud general respouse . There is then a middle way . It is possible that the hues of distiuction may be obliterated , that men may be regarded as worthy of the highest trust , who differ in many respects from the policy lately followed . Even in the Prudential Committee there should be a representation of other than a single view . Voting in the minority is not to be counted disloyalty to the American Board . This is a great point gained , and made clear by the ballot , which showed changes and freedom of action on the part of some who have been always counted as the most conservative . Within the space of two hours of kindly and earnest discussion , mingled wThh entreaty , the minds of many were changed in their views of duty and expediency . The vote by which the IRev . Charles A. Dickinson was retained as a member of the Prudential Committee was a decisive admission of a new purpose . And the still further concession of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee , showed that the time for conciliation had arrived . Even before this , there was encoura cinent in the addition to the Prudential Committee of the President and VicePresident , men who are near to the hearts of the churches , and command the respect and confidence of all . But still more hopeful was the appointment of a committee of investigation ,  - -  a request long denied , and which , with the wise selection of the President , ensures a thorough sifting of all grounds of complaint , and an inquiry into the means by which even unfounded prejudices may be considered and removed . The platform laid down by the President , in his letter of acceptance , was admitted by all , according to a fair interpretation , to be a basis of union and harmony for the ensuing year . But after all this has been joyfully and hopefully acknowledged , it still remains true that there are various elements of dissatisfaction that need to be harmonized . It is not enough that these elements be recognized , as deserving of respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority in the American Board represent , as they believe , a very general sentiment throughout all Congregational churches . The ob // jections to its management are by no means new , and are far from being confined to any point of doctrine or school of theology . Some things are conscientiously demanded which must not be withheld . The Board can not move on its way regardless of* these demands , or expect the heartiest and fullest codperation , even by the concessions already made , unless they be acted upon in the spirit of generous fellowship . It is the object of this Article to state these demands , which are not to be regarded as those of any particular party , or as offering a complete solution of the question , but an attempt at least to present those essential features , in which change is needed in order to promote true harmony . I. Perhaps the most manifest claim is that our churches may have a closer connection with the Board . For years there has been a growing feeling that the churches were treated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wonder , how are these corporate members chosen , and many have been sensitive as to the discrimination that seems to them arbitrary and unreasonable . The churches have had no voice , even by way of recommendation . The choice seems sometimes to have been personal or accidental , and again the omissions have excited wonder . Certainly the Board has given no endorsement to the doctrine of " natural selection , " or " the survival of the fittest . " It is not to be supposed that any system would secure perfection in this regard . But if each church had the right to nominate to its local conference , and each conference the right to nominate directly to the Board , according to the vacancies to be filled , there would be a very different feeling among them , and names would be proposed , which otherwise are neglected or overlooked . Of all our benevolent societies , the Board is the only one which offers to the churches no sort of representation . It has been said that the Board is responsible to its donors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . It may well be doubted whether this is altogether wise or Christian . Feeble churches may be strong in spirit . Our missionaries have often been nurtured in obscure places . To give a son or daughter to the Master 's work is more than money and brings more friends to the cause than the largest contribution . It is clear that this // appeal of the churches ought to be noticed . There may be some better way of representation than any proposed , but it should be acknowledged that the Board is now a Congregational society . It was no idle threat , nor made in an unkind spirit , when iDr . Meredith said : " If the American Board is not a Congregational Foreign Missionary Society , I am in favor of making a Congregational Foreign Missionary Society as quick as it can be done . " The churches are willing to wait patiently for overtures of union in some form or other , but they ought not to be treated with contempt . This partiality is more manifest since some of our churches have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congregationalists are not a jealous people , but they believe in the parity of the churches , and they would like to have a measure of respect shown to them all . Of late the number of corporate members has been increased , but that does not help the matter . If the directors of a bank were to double their number without consulting the stockholders , it might please some of those chosen , but would raise a rebellion among the rest . What the churches want is deference to their wishes , and a hearty sympathy manifested to them in some form or other . In fact , it is disrespectful to the churches , that while the question of representation is pending , and the committee still holds the instruction unanimously given a year ago , in this explicit form ,  --  " Resolved , That a committee of fifteen be appointed to consider the relation of the Board to the churches and individuals who make it their missionary agent , and the expediency , in view of the facts which they may ascertain , of securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the selection of corporate members ; and that this committee be instructed to report what action , if any , they may deem wise in this direction , at a subsequent annual meeting of the Board , " - it certainly has an aspect of indifference if not disrespect that the Board should proceed to elect twenty-one members , and appoint a committee to propose as many more perhaps another year . Should their number be increased tenfold , the question still returns , where is the fellowship of the churches , and the respect owed even to the least of them . // H. It is another demand of those dissatisfied with the present management of the Board that there should be more manifest sympathy towards our colleges and theological seminaries . A greater effort ought certainly to be made to promote a hearty union of feeling , and a confidence on the part of all our young men and women , in every stage of education , that the administration is doing everything that can be done to encourage their interest in the work of missions , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely there are difficulties enough , in the natural shrinking from hardship aud exile , in the surrender of plans of personal ambition and ease . Many who feel the pressure of Christ 's call to go far hence to the Gentiles find ready excuse in obstacles that present themselves , in the claims of our own country , and in the affectionate solicitation of friends . It is sad indeed that any further stumbling block should be put in their way by those whose chief object it ought to be to strengthen their resolution and relieve their doubts . It is never to be forgotten that the missionary enterprise was conceived in the hearts of young meu . It came to the birth in the college and the theological seminary . It was there throbbing with the pulse of life before it appeared among the reverend fathers of the church . It is but an old and familiar story how backward the elders were to help the ardent youth . The example ought not to be repeated now . It was not a board of experienced and aged men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great idea of converting the world . And the missionary spirit has been nursed in our colleges and seminaries ever since . Here the practical decision has been made which has resulted in such consecrated lives as those of lEli Smith , and Van Dyck , and Schanfiler , and Goodell , and Spaulding , and Judson ,  --  heroic spirits , and the whole line of witnesses , of whom the world was not worthy ! How is it now ? The flame of missionary zeal still burns in the older and younger colleges and seminaries among a host of young women as well as young men . Societies of inquiry are found among them all . We do not question that part of the resolution offered by Prof. Boardman at Springfield two years ago , which reads : // " That we consider it a reason for profound gratitude to God that so much of enthusiastic devotion to the cause of missions has been awakened among the young men and young women of our land . " But when he goes on to say , " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for funds and laborers , " we can not go with him . The " enthusiastic devotion " does not materialize . There may be various reasons for this as we have intimated , but one is a want of sympathy between the young men and the administration . It can not be denied . It is too patent for any one to question , that somehow the Board is not " en rapport " with the young men and women . Looking up at the galleries of the Tabernacle Church and seeing crowds of them eagerly present-seventy-five from one seminary alonethe question arises , " Why do they not offer themselves to the Board * " We are told they ought to have more pluck ; but when a young man has made up his mind to face all the terrors of barbarism , it is a little trying to be told that it requires more pluck to meet his Christian brethren at home . Young men want sympathy , they want freedom and consideration for their immature views . Somehow the effort should be made to make it plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apparent reason for this feeling of estrangement we will consider farther on . It is the fact with which we have now to do , and the need of a change in this respect . Within the last five years our Congregational seminaries have graduated more young men than ever before in an equal time-some of them nearly twice as many . Where are the candidates for the foreign work ? We are told to be thankful that the demand for laborers has been amply sustained . But two or one from a seminary , and none from some of them , is a poor showing . And where are our colleges which share the same enthusiastic devotion ? It is said that of all the ordained missionaries sent out by the Board this yeaIr scarcely half a dozen were graduates from any college . Again we say , in the current phrase , the enthnsiastic devotion does not seem to " materialize . " There is some obstacle that keeps back our young men . While we are glad to receive and appoint some who have not had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . We need those who , like onr early missionaries , have had the highest training in langnages and science , and in every department of good learning . There is no position on earth , as we have often been told , affording scope for higher abilities , or laying heavier tribute upon the best resources of scholarship . The translation of the Bible , the training of native preachers , the influence to be exerted on foreign residents , demand the highest and best that our schools of learning can give . Turn over the pages of the Ely volume , so carefully compiled by iDr . Thomas Laurie , and see what has been done by the power of consecrated discipline in so many fields of science and literature . We must have the hearty cooperation of the colleges and seminaries with the best they can give to the service of Christ . And we shall not have this until a warmer sympathy exists between these institutions and the management of the Board . III . It is also much to be desired that a better method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire has been expressed many times before the present controversy , and of late by many brethren whose opinion deserves attention . In almost all the reports and discussions of the Board , there is a mixture of popular appeal , not quite consistent with serious business . This arises in part from the fact , that the Board does not consider itself responsible to the public , and yet wants their approval . Bnsiness puts on the tone of popular address . Reports to the Board are given by readers , who turn their backs to those who must act upon them and who can with very great difficulty hear them . Thus the report appears to be prepared for an impression on a general audience , or for circulation among the absent , rather than for the information of those who are immediately responsible . It may be said that this arises from a laudable desire of doing good . The devotional element is called in to relieve dry statistics . Fervent gratitude and enthusiastic promises for the future are to be the outcome of such representations . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who for a long series of years have conducted these services , nor the benefit which has resulted from the meetings as a whole . But it is almost inevitable that the calm consideration , the judicial // temper , needed for important business , should sometimes be lost in the idea of popular effect , or amid the plaudits , scarcely s*ibdued , of a waiting throng . When a promiscuous audience is to be held in patient attention , the " art of putting things " is very much in request , and inconsistencies drop out of sight . There may be no misstatement of facts , no verbal inaccuracy of any sort , and yet the impression may be quite different from that made by precisely the same facts in other hands . The prosperity of the Board in funds and laborers may be made to appear greater or less than it is , by the unconscious feeling of those who marshal the facts ; and a desire in itself laudable to make the best of things , or to produce encouragement in the minds of hearers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might otherwise be depressing . To give an instance of what is meant , it is certainly true that the IReport of the Home Department gave an impression of prosperity within the last year , which seemed to many more cheering than they dared to indulge . It is not claimed that the facts were misstated , or the figures and computing of averages incorrect ; but the representation made from them was to say the least one-sided and incomplete . Such is very apt to be the case , when a report is made for effect on the general public , rather than for precise information . Note this contrast . The Corresponding Secretary read in clear tones the vote of the IBoard at Cleveland : That in the current financial year , the endeavor be to secure at least $650,000 , as its income . " A few minutes later , the report of the Home Department stated that the donations from the churches have only been $395,000 . But when the unusual amount of legacies is added , and the sums taken from trust funds , the aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the general impression is made that on the whole we are doing well ,  --  perhaps better than could have been expected ; and the appeal for a million in gifts , or a million in somebody 's will , is a thought to fill the mind with enthusiastic hope for the future . Yet here is the simple fact that the churches , in their regular contributions , have given less than $400,000 , being an average of less // 419 than $100 apiece , even when 600 of them are left out altogether . Is the American Board to be sustained on the remains of the dead , or on the free and hearty gifts of the living ? This report of the Prudential Committee seems hardly business-like for so grave and responsible a body . We will not deny that it is a well-meant presentation of the views of the committee in general , and their wish to make the facts useful by putting them in such a way as to indicate prosperity . Men always represent facts to themselves and others more or less according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have in view . But a business report should be simpler and less impressive . It should neither indulge in inferences , nor attempt to forestall a verdict on itself . The method of conducting the business of the Board leads to the making of reports largely in this line . It was distinctly avowed by one of those to whom the report of the Home Department was entrusted , that the committee felt that they had no right to go behind that report , and that they had " considered the facts which the Prudential Committee have presented vividly before us . " The trouble is these facts are presented " vividly " rather than simply . And hence the report on the report is as usual but the echo of an echo . This second report is for a promiscuous audience as well as the first , and business methods are still further lost sight of , in an effort to awaken sympathy and enthusiasm . These objections and difficulties are widely felt , apart from any disposition to find fault with those who have received their methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are manifest to men of all views , and are the subject of criticism outside of the denomination as well as in it . The following from the New York Oh8erver is a specimen of such criticism . " That a corporation to which such important duties and such large funds are committed , should transact its business in the presence of a large assembly* of interested spectators , is an anomaly which is productive of disagreeable and evil results . Debates are prolonged and speeches are made because of the enthusiasm and applause of the audience , while many matters which ought to be discussed by the corporation seem indelicate and improper to be the subjects of debate before a promiscuous assembly . // IY . But we turn to a more pressing and imperative demand , which gives emphasis to all the others , and explains more fully the reason of some of them . It is a demand for a freer and more sympathetic examination of candidates . Some have been rejected , when the reasons were not made clear or satisfactory to all ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should present themselves , and have been kept back from so doing , by reasonable or unreasonable fears . There should be a change in the method of examination for the purpose of removing such impressions . There is a way no doubt by which the youth in our seminaries can be made to feel that their application for appointment under the Board would be met with the warmest sympathy . They have heard that this examination is entrusted principally to one man , that personal creeds are sent out , and requests made for categorical answers on mooted points . They have heard that a statement is made up from their conversations , and given to the Prudential Committee in place of their own connected statement . Their case is thought to be in the hands of a single advocate , who has looked unfavorably upon some who have had high endorsement , and even upon the case of one of our most esteemed missionaries . But the fault here is , in a considerable degree , due to the system . Too heavy a responsibility is put upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as in the present . There is no man who can assume such responsibility without danger . The very man who would be chosen by some as a most affectionate and delightful examiner , would fail to secure the confidence of others . There is no charge of unkind intention . Conscientious scruples may ma1*e one a severe examiner , with the very highest motives of love and good will . It is desirable therefore that a change should be made in the method of examination . The Home Department has enough to do without this burden ; and especially as we hope for a larger number of applicants , the method of receiving them should be changed . One man is likely to have certain peculiarities or lay stress on particular things which to the mind of the Church in general are of small importance . Let the Committee of Examination // be composed of wider elements , including some known to be personally and affectionately interested in the candidate . It would be a suitable thing for his pastor to assist in the ques tioning , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no fitter member of such a committee , than some experienced missionary at home on a visit . With such persons present and taking part , no young man would have just reason to fear the result , in appearing before any number of Examiners or the whole Prudential Committee . It has been felt that this matter has been conducted too often secretly or by correspondence . It has been felt that the whole burden of responsibility has conic upon one man , or that he has assumed the direction of the whole at the desire of others . The strong feeling that a change must be made has manifested itself by the withdrawal of the votes of a third of the members present from one who has been highly esteemed as a faithful servant , and who has no doubt endeavored to discharge his duty . This has not been the result of personal feeling , or want of respect and friendliness . INo one can for a moment believe that these votes have been withheld from any such motive as that . But no other way was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system pursued . Sometimes a man is so wedded to a system , that they can not be separated . An entire change must be made , in order that the graduates of our colleges and seminaries may feel assured of perfect sympathy . That is the way " to let bygones be bygones. ** When the jj*roposition was made to the minority to vote the full list of the old officers , it was impossible to promise or command such a vote , for the simple reason that their objection is to a system , and they had no other means of expressing it . Change the system ; shift the burden from the Home Department ; let some other Examiner or Committee of Examination be tried , and a new feeling of hope will be awakened . Some thought that the minority ought to compromise on the old Board of Officers , but the vote showed that they had no compromise to offer and could make none . Their objections are of such a kind that they can not endorse the action of the past . The minority wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Board . The remedy is simple . Change the system of examination . Those who are dissatisfied do not even claim the rescinding of past votes that seem to look towards making the Board an ecclesiastical court . We are sorry for the votes . Sometime the Board will be ashamed of them . But happily they mean little . They simply guard the Board against the " approval " of a certain ' doctrine . Nobody wishes the Board to approve that doctrine , nor yet the doctrine of IMlillenarianism , nor of the annihilation of the wicked . It is not the business of the Board to approve any of these mooted points , held in the way of theory or otherwise . What the minority desire is freedom to think on the part of missionaries as well as others . We do not want thoughtless laborers in the foreign field . We shudder for those who can answer glibly , questions over which the wisest and most devout men hesitate . It is cruelty to a young man to press him to positive conclusions on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that such a course may lead to insincerity , or even to the shipwreck of Christian faith . The minority do not wish to go back on the past but rather to turn all faces and all hearts to the future . They hope to see no more votes of approval or disapproval of unsettled matters of doctrine . They want , and feel that they must have , a better system of examination , that shall heal the breach between the Board and those who yearn to go forth as soldiers of the Cross . They believe that this is not their demand only , but that of the churches , and a growing number of all who feel an interest in missions . Freedom and charity are the watchwords of the hour . Christians are not to go out on the mountains or into the wilderness , searching for some one thing in which they may possibly differ ; but rather to rejoice in the ninety and nine in which they can certainly agree . They feel that some changes must be made to bring about this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some manner that shall be satisfactory to our ardeuf youth , to our most benevolent churches , and to all true lovers of the cause of missions . While these are the demands of those who are dissatisfied with the past record of the Board , they regard the meeting at // New York as hopeful , because looking toward the answering of these demands . The signs are cheering that every one of these claims will in some way be satisfied . Especially there are signs of better feeling and kindlier sympathy between those who have opposed one another . In full confidence that these changes will be brought about , men who felt despondent have returned to their homes with the purpose of urging increased contributions , and doing all in their power to promote missionary zeal . When our students have full encouragement and sympathy , when the fire is kindled in their hearts to offer themselves to the work , and the flame brightened by friendly feeling on all hands , then the Church will arouse to new gifts , which shall be fully adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Board is full of sympathy with the churches and the schools . Let us not distrust the future , nor believe it possible that the hopes now awakened can fail of fulfillment . We may well lay to heart at the present time , the words of our late venerated President , Mark Hopkins , in his historical discourse , delivered in the year 1860 . " While fifty years have but heightened our respect for the wisdom by which this Board was founded , have they not wrought changes in public sentiment , requiring in it some modification ? If so , let it be modified . Let us have no conservatism for its own sake . When change becomes necessary to accomplish the original end of an institution , then change is conservatism . We now stand* upon a height , , where it becomes us to use every light of Scripture , and reason , and experience , and to be flexible to every indication of the will of God , in regard to the future . Now is the time to cast off hindrances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JAMEs G. VOSE.
