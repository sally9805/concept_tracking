Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE SCHOOL-MASTER 'S GUESTS . from Farm legends 1887 I. The district school-master was sitting behind his great book-laden desk , Close-watching the motions of scholars , pathetic and gay and grotesque . As whisper the half-leafless branches , when Autumn 's brisk breezes have come , His little scrub-thicket of pupils sent upward a half-smothered hum ; Like the frequent sharp bang of a wagon , when treading a forest path o'er , Resounded the feet of his pupils , whenever their heels struck the floor . There was little Tom Timms on the front seat , whose face was withstanding a drouth ; And jolly Jack Gibbs just behind him , with a rainy new moon for a mouth ; There were both of the Smith boys , as studious as if they bore names that could bloom ; And Jim Jones , a heaven-built mechanic , the slyest young knave in the room : With a countenance grave  --  as a horse 's , and his honest eyes fixed  --  on a pin , Queer-bent on a deeply laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious young novices , drilling their spelling-books into the brain , Loud-puffing each half-whispered letter , like an engine just starting a train . There was one fiercely muscular fellow , who scowled at the sums on his slate , And leered at the innocent figures a look of unspeakable hate , And set his white teeth close together , and gave his thin lips a short twist , As to say , " I could whip you , confound you ! if sums could be done with my fist ! " There were two pretty girls in the corner , each one with some cunning possessed , In a whisper discussing a problem : which one the young master liked best ! A class in the front , with their readers , were telling , with difficult pains , How perished brave Marco Bozzaris while bleeding at all of his veins ; And a boy on the floor to be punished , a statue of idleness stood , Making faces at all of the others , and enjoying the task all he could . II . Around were the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With many a break on their surface , where grinned a wood-grating of lath ; A patch of thick plaster , just over the school-master 's rickety chair , Seemed threat'ningly o'er him suspended , like Damocles ' sword , by a hair ; There were tracks on the desks where the knife-blades had wandered in search of their prey ; Their tops were as duskily spattered as if they drank ink every day ; The square stove it puffed and it thundered , and broke out in red-flaming sores , Till the great iron quadruped trembled like a dog fierce to rush out-o ' - doors ; White snow-flakes looked in at the windows ; the gale pressed its lips to the cracks ; And the children 's hot faces were streaming , the while they were freezing their backs . III . Now Marco Bozzaris had fallen , and all of his suff'rings were o'er , And the class to their seats were retreating , when footsteps were heard at the door ; And five of the good district fathers marched into the room in a row , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their white cloaks of snow ; And the spokesman , a grave squire of sixty , with countenance solemnly sad , Spoke thus , while the children all listened , with all of the ears that they had : " We 've come here , school-master , intendin ' to cast an inquirin ' eye ' round , Concarnin ' complaints that 's been entered , an ' fault that has lately been found ; To pace off the width of your doin 's , an ' witness what you 've been about ; An ' see if it 's payin ' to keep you , or whether we 'd best turn ye out . " The first thing I 'm bid for to mention is , when the class gets up to read : You give ' em too tight of a reinin ' , an ' touch ' em up more than they need ; You 're nicer than wise in the matter of holdin ' the book in one han ' , An ' you turn a stray g in their doin 's , an ' tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no great good comes of speakin ' the words so polite , as I see , Providin ' you know what the facts is , an ' tell ' em off jest as they be . An ' then there 's that readin ' in corncert , is censured from first unto last ; It kicks up a heap of a racket , when folks is a-travelin ' past . Whatever is done as to redin ' , providin ' things goes to my say , Sha' n't hang on no new-fangled hinges , but swing in the old-fashioned way . " And the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was due , And nodded obliquely , and muttered , " Them ' ere is my sentiments tew . " " Then , as to your spellin ' : I 've heern tell , by them as has looked into this , That you turn the u out o ' your labour , an ' make the word shorter than ' t is ; An ' clip the k off o ' yer musick , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells out as he used ter , you pass the word on to the next . They say there 's some new-grafted books here that do n't take them letters along ; But if it is so , just depend o n't , them new-grafted books is made wrong . You might just as well say that Jackson did n't know all there was about war , As to say that the old-fashioned teachers did n't know what them letters was for ! " And the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was due , And scratched their heads slyly and softly , and said , " Them 's my sentiments tew . " " Then , also , your ' rithmetic doin 's , as they are reported to me , Is that you have left Tare an ' Tret out , an ' also the old Rule o ' Three ; An ' likewise brought in a new study , some high-steppin ' scholars to please , With saw-bucks an ' crosses and pot-hooks , an ' w 's , x , y 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such foolin ' ; there ai n't no great good to be reached By tiptoein ' childr'n up higher than ever their fathers was teached . " And the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was due , And cocked one eye up to the ceiling , and said , " Them 's my sentiments tew . " " Another thing , I must here mention , comes into the question to-day : Concernin ' some words in the grammar you 're teachin ' our gals for to say . My gals is as steady as clock-work , an ' never give cause for much fear , But they come home from school t' other evenin ' a-talkin ' such stuff as this here : ' I love , ' an ' ' Thou lovest , ' an ' ' He loves , ' an ' ' Ye love , ' an ' ' You love , ' an ' ' They  --  ' An ' they answered my questions , ' It 's grammar '  --  ' t was all I could get ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' your duty , you 're carryin ' matters on so As to make the gals say that they love you , it 's just all that I want to know ;  --  " IV . Now Jim , the young heaven-built mechanic , in the dusk of the evening before , Had well-nigh unjointed the stove-pipe , to make it come down on the floor ; And the squire bringing smartly his foot down , as a clincher to what he had said , A joint of the pipe fell upon him , and larruped him square on the head . The soot flew in clouds all about him , and blotted with black all the place , And the squire and the other four fathers were peppered with black in the face . The school , ever sharp for amusement , laid down all their cumbersome books , And , spite of the teacher 's endeavors , laughed loud at their visitors ' looks ; And the squire , as he stalked to the doorway , swore oaths of a violet hue ; And the four district fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sentiments tew . " Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THREE LINKS OF A LIFE . from Farm legends 1887 I. A word went over the hills and plains Of the scarce-hewn fields that the Tiffin drains , Through dens of swamps and jungles of trees , As if it were borne by the buzzing bees As something sweet for the sons of men ; Or as if the blackbird and the wren Had lounged about each ragged clearing To gossip it in the settlers ' hearing ; Or the partridge drum-corps of the wood Had made the word by mortals heard , And Diana made it understood ; Or the loud-billed hawk of giant sweep Were told it as something he must keep ; As now , in the half-built city of Lane , Where the sons of the settlers strive for gain , Where the Indian trail is graded well , And the anxious ring of the engine-bell And the Samson Steam 's deep , stuttering word And the factory 's dinner-horn are heard ; Where burghers fight , in friendly guise , With spears of bargains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-road , Rides into the town his high-built load Of wood or wool , or corn or wheat , And stables his horses in the street ;  --  It seems as to each and every one A deed were known ere it well be done , As if , in spite of roads or weather , All minds were whispering together ; So over the glens and rough hill-sides Of the fruitful land where the Tiffin glides , Went the startling whisper , clear and plain , " There 's a new-born baby over at Lane ! " Now any time , from night till morn , Or morn till night , for a long time-flight , Had the patient squaws their children borne ; And many a callow , coppery wight Had oped his eyes to the tree-flecked light , And grown to the depths of the woodland dell And the hunt of the toilsome hills as well As though at his soul a bow were slung , And a war-whoop tattooed on his tongue ; But never before , in the Tiffin 's sight , Had a travail bloomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer pressed His yoke-bound steeds and his furnace fire ; And the gray-linked log-chain drooped to rest , And a hard face softened with sweet desire ; And the settler-housewife , rudely wise , With the forest 's shrewdness in her eyes , Yearned , with tenderly wondering brain , For the new-born baby over at Lane . And the mother lay in her languid bed , When the flock of visitors had fled  --  When the crowd of settlers all had gone , And left the young lioness alone With the tiny cub they had come to see In the rude-built log menagerie ; When grave Baw Beese , the Indian chief , As courtly as ever prince in his prime , Or cavalier of the olden time , Making his visit kind as brief , Had beaded the neck of the pale-face miss , And dimpled her cheek with a farewell kiss ; When the rough-clad room was still as sleek , Save the deaf old nurse 's needle-click , The beat of the grave clock in its place , With its ball-tipped tail and owl-like face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose so black and long , The mother lifted her baby 's head , And gave it a clinging kiss , and said : Why did thou come so straight to me , Thou queer one ? Thou might have gone where riches be , Thou dear one ! For when ' t was talked about in heaven , To whom the sweet soul should be given , If thou had raised thy pretty voice , God sure had given to thee a choice , My dear one , my queer one ! " Babe in the wood " thou surely art , My lone one : But thou shalt never play the part , My own one ! Thou ne'er shalt wander up and down , With none to claim thee as their own : Nor shall the Redbreast , as she grieves , Make up for thee a bed of leaves , My own one , my lone one ! Although thou be not Riches ' flower , Thou neat one , Yet thou hast come from Beauty 's bower , Thou sweet one ! Thy every smile 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ; Thy every tear 's as pure a pearl As if thy father was an earl , Thou neat one , thou sweet one ! And thou shalt have a queenly name , Thou grand one : A lassie 's christening 's half her fame , Thou bland one ! And may thou live so good and true , The honor will but be thy due ; And friends shall never be ashamed , Or when or where they hear thee named , Thou bland one , thou grand one ! E'en like the air  --  our rule and sport  --  Thou meek one , Thou art my burden and support , Thou weak one ! Like manna in the wilderness , A joy hath come to soothe and bless ; But ' t is a sorrow unto me , To love as I am loving thee , Thou weak one , thou meek one ! The scarlet-coated child-thief waits , Thou bright one , To bear thee through the sky-blue gates , Thou light one ! His feverish touch thy brow may pain , And while I to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blade may flash back to the skies , Thou light one , thou bright one ! And if thou breast the morning storm , Thou fair one , And gird a woman 's thrilling form , Thou rare one : Sly hounds of sin thy path will trace , And on thy unsuspecting face Hot lust will rest its tarnished eyes , And thou wilt need be worldly-wise , Thou rare one , thou fair one ! O that the heaven that smiles to-day , My blest one , May give thee light to see thy way , My best one ! That when around thee creeps The Gloom , The gracious God will call thee home , And then , increased a hundredfold , Thou proudly hand Him back His gold , My best one , my blest one ! II . A word went over the many miles Of the well-tilled land where the Tiffin smiles , And sought no youthful ear in vain : " There 's a wedding a-coming off at Lane ! " They stood in the shade of the western door  --  Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they oft had gazed before , At the downward glide of the western sun . The rays of his never-jealous light Made even the cloud that dimmed him bright ; And lower he bent , and kissed , as he stood , The lips of the distant blue-eyed wood . And just as the tired sun bowed his head , The sun-browned farmer sighed , and said : And so you 'll soon be goin ' away , My darling little Bess ; And you ha ' been to the store to-day , To buy your weddin ' - dress ; And so your dear good mother an ' I , Whose love you long have known , Must lay the light o ' your presence by , And walk the road alone . So come to-night , with mother and me , To the porch for an hour or two , And sit on your old father 's knee , And talk , as we used to do ; For we , who ha ' loved you many a year , And clung to you , strong and true , Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had much of you ! But lovers be lovers , while earth endures ; And once on a time , be it known , I helped a girl with eyes like yours Construct a world of our own ; And we laid it out in a garden spot , And dwelt in the midst of flowers ; Till we found that the world was a good-sized lot , And most of it was n't ours ! You 're heavier , girl , than when you come To us one cloudy day , And seemed to feel so little at home , We feared you would n't stay ; Till I knew the danger was passed , because You 'd struck so mortal a track , And got so independent an ' cross , God never would let you back ! But who would ever ha ' had the whim , When you lay in my arms an ' cried , You 'd some day sit here , pretty an ' prim , A-waitin ' to be a bride ! But lovers be lovers , while earth goes on , And marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love you 've won , Remember what you 've been taught : Look first that your wedded lives be true , With naught from the other apart ; For the flowers of true love never grew In the soil of a faithless heart . Look next that the buds of health shall rest Their blossoms upon your cheek ; For life and love are a burden at best , If the body be sick and weak . Look next that your kitchen fire be bright , And your hands be neat and skilled ; For the love of man oft takes its flight , If his stomach be not well filled ! Look next that your money is fairly earned , Ere ever it be spent ; For comfort and love , however turned , Will ne'er pay six per cent . And , next , due care and diligence keep That the mind be trained and fed ; For blessings ever look shabby and cheap , That light on an empty head . And if it shall please the gracious God That children to you belong , Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them right and wrong ; And show ' em , that though this life 's a start For the better world , no doubt , Yet earth an ' heaven ai n't so far apart As many good folks make out ! III . A word went over the broad hill-sweeps Of the listening land where the Tiffin creeps : " She married , holding on high her head ; But the groom was false as the vows he said ; With lies and crimes his days are checked ; The girl is alone , and her life is wrecked . " The midnight rested its heavy arm Upon the grief-encumbered farm ; And hoarse-voiced Sorrow wandered at will , Like a moan when the summer 's night is still , And the spotted cows , with bellies of white , And well-filled teats all crowded awry , Stood in the black stalls of the night , Nor herded nor milked , and wondered why . And the house was gloomy , still , and cold ; And the hard-palmed farmer , newly old , Sat in an unfrequented place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solemn silence rested long On all , save the cricket 's dismal song . But the mother drew the girl to her breast , And gave to her spirit words of rest : Come to my lap , my wee-grown baby ; rest you upon my knee ; You have been traveling toward the light , and drawing away from me ; You turned your face from my dark path to catch the light o ' the sun , And ' t is no more nor less , my child , than children ever have done . So you joined hands with one you loved , when we to the cross-road came , And went your way , as Heaven did say , and who but Heaven to blame ? You must not weep that he you chose was all the time untrue , Or stab with hate the man whose heart you thought was made for you . The love God holds for your bright soul is more to get and give Than all the love of all of the men while He may bid them live . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt ; For Vengeance ' blade was ever made with neither guard nor hilt ! Who will avenge you , darling ? The sun that shines on high . He will paint the picture of your wrongs before the great world 's eye . He will look upon your sweet soul , in its pure mantle of white , Till it shine upon your enemies , and dazzle all their sight . He 'll come each day to point his finger at him who played the knave ; And ' t is denied from him to hide , excepting in the grave . Who will avenge you , darling ? Your sister , the sky above . Each cloud she floats above you shall be a token of love ; She will bend o'er you at night-fall her pure broad breast of blue , And every gem that glitters there shall flash a smile to you . And all her great wide distances to your good name belong ; ' T is not so far from star to star as ' twixt the right and wrong ! Who will avenge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will whisper to each other your tale of guiltless woe ; The perfumes that do load them your innocence shall bless , And they will soothe your aching brow with pitying , kind caress . They will sweep away the black veil that hangs about your fame : There is no cloud that long can shroud a virtuous woman 's name . Who will avenge you , darling ? The one who proved untrue . His memory must undo him , whate'er his will may do ; The pitch-black night will come when he must meet Remorse alone ; He will rush at your avenging as if it were his own . His every sin is but a knot that yet shall hold him fast ; For guilty hands but twine the strands that fetter them at last . Lay thee aside thy grief , darling !  --  lay thee aside thy grief ! And Happiness will cheer thee beyond all thy belief ! As oft as winter comes summer , as sure as night comes day , And as swift as sorrow cometh , so swift it goeth away ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all who choose may count their woes upon a mother 's breast . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : ROB , THE PAUPER. from Farm legends 1887 I. Rob , the Pauper , is loose again . Through the fields and woods he races . He shuns the women , he beats the men , He kisses the children 's frightened faces . There is no mother he hath not fretted ; There is no child he hath not petted ; There is no house , by road or lane , He did not tap at the window-pane , And make more dark the dismal night , And set the faces within with white . Rob , the Pauper , is wild of eye , Wild of speech , and wild of thinking ; Over his forehead broad and high , Each with each wild locks are linking . Yet , there is something in his bearing Not quite what a pauper should be wearing : In every step is a shadow of grace ; The ghost of a beauty haunts his face ; The rags half-sheltering him to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pauper , is crazed of brain : The world is a lie to his shattered seeming . No woman is true unless insane ; No man but is full of lecherous scheming . Woe to the wretch , of whate'er calling , That crouches beneath his cudgel 's falling ! Pity the wife , howe'er high-born , Who wilts beneath his words of scorn ! But youngsters , he caresses as wild As a mother would kiss a rescued child . He hath broke him loose from his poor-house cell ; He hath dragged him clear from rope and fetter . They might have thought ; for they know full well They could keep a half-caged panther better . Few are the knots so strategy-shunning That they can escape his maniac cunning ; Many a stout bolt strives in vain To bar his brawny shoulders ' strain ; The strongest men in town agree That the Pauper is good for any three . He hath crossed the fields , the woods , the street : He hides in the swamp his wasted feature ; The frog leaps over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loud mosquito , hungry-flying , For his impoverished blood is crying ; The scornful hawk 's loud screaming sneer Falls painfully upon his ear ; And close to his unstartled eye , The rattlesnake creeps noisily by . He hath fallen into a slough of sleep ; A haze of the past bends softly o'er him ; His restless spirit a watch doth keep , As Memory 's canvas glides before him . Through slumber 's distances he travels ; The tangled skein of his mind unravels ; The bright past dawns through a cloud of dreams , And once again in his prime he seems ; For over his heart 's lips , as a kiss , Sweepeth a vision like to this : A cozy kitchen , a smooth-cut lawn , A zephyr of flowers in the bright air straying ; A graceful child , as fresh as dawn , Upon the greensward blithely playing ; Himself on the door-stone idly sitting , A blonde-haired woman about him flitting . She dreamily stands beside him there , And deftly toys with his coal-black hair , And hovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleading-wise : O Rob , why will you plague my heart ? why will you try me so ? Is she so fair , is she so sweet , that you must need desert me ? I saw you kiss her twice and thrice behind the maple row , And each caress you gave to her did like a dagger hurt me . Why should for her and for her smiles your heart a moment hunger ? What though her shape be trim as mine , her face a trifle younger ? She does not look so young to you as I when we were wed ; She can not speak more sweet to you than words that I have said ; She can not love you half so well as I , when all is done ; And she is not your wedded wife  --  the mother of your son . O Rob , you smile and toss your head ; you mock me in your soul ; You say I would be overwise  --  that I am jealous of you ; And what if my tight-bended heart should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the zeal with which I love you . Oh , we might be so peaceful here , with nothing of reproving ! Oh , we might be so happy here , with none to spoil our loving ! Why should a joy be more a joy because , forsooth , ' t is hid ? How can a kiss be more a kiss because it is forbid ? Why should the love you get from her be counted so much gain , When every smile you give to her but adds unto my pain ? O Rob , you say there is no guilt betwixt the girl and you : Do you not know how slack of vows may break the bond that 's dearest ? You twirl a plaything in your hand , not minding what you do , And first you know it flies from you , and strikes the one that 's nearest . So do not spoil so hopelessly you ne'er may cease your ruing ; The finger-post of weakened vows points only to undoing . Remember there are years to come , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the flowers of true love go ; Remember the increasing bliss of marriage undefiled ; Remember all the pride or shame that waits for yonder child ! II . Rob , the Pauper , awakes and runs ; A clamor cometh clear and clearer . They are hunting him with dogs and guns ; They are every moment pressing nearer . Through pits of stagnant pools he pushes , Through the thick sumac 's poison-bushes ; He runs and stumbles , leaps and clambers , Through the dense thicket 's breathless chambers . The swamp-slime stains at his bloody tread ; The tamarack branches rasp his head ; From bog to bog , and from slough to slough , He flees , but his foes come yelling nearer ; And ever unto his senses now , The long-drawn bay of the hounds is clearer . He is worn and worried , hot and panting ; He staggers at every footstep 's planting ; The hot blood races through his brain ; His every breath is a twinge of pain ; Black shadows dance before his eyes ; The echoes mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field ; He is falling upon their worn-out mercies . They loudly call to him to yield ; He hoarsely pays them back in curses . His blood-shot eye is wildly roaming ; His firm-set mouth with rage is foaming ; He waves his cudgel , with war-cry loud , And dares the bravest of the crowd . There springs at his throat a hungry hound ; He dashes its brains into the ground . Rob , the Pauper , is sorely pressed ; The men are crowding all around him . He crushes one to a bloody rest , And breaks again from the crowd that bound him . The crash of a pistol comes unto him  --  A well-sped ball goes crushing through him ; But still he rushes on  --  yet on  --  Until , at last , some distance won , He mounts a fence with a madman 's ease , And this is something of what he sees : A lonely cottage , some tangled grass , Thickets of thistles , dock , and mullein ; A forest of weeds he scarce can pass , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rush uncertain , The spider hanging her gauzy curtain . The Pauper falls on the dusty floor , And there rings in his failing ear once more A voice as it might be from the dead , And says , as it long ago hath said : O Rob , I have a word to say  --  a cruel word  --  to you : I can not longer live a lie  --  the truth for air is calling ! I can not keep the secret locked that long has been your due , Not if you strike me to the ground , and spurn me in my falling ! He came to me when first a cloud across your smile was creeping  --  He came to me  --  he brought to me a slighted heart for keeping ; He would not see my angry frown ; he sought me , day by day ; I flung at him hot words of scorn , I turned my face away . I bade him dread my husband 's rage when once his words were known : He smiled at me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob , his words were overtrue ! they burned into my brain ! I could not rub them out again , were I awake or sleeping ! I saw you kiss her twice and thrice  --  my chidings were in vain  --  And well I knew your wayward heart had wandered from my keeping . I counted all that was at stake  --  I bribed my pride with duty ; I knelt before your manly face , in worship of its beauty ; I painted pictures for your eyes you were too blind to see ; I worked at all the trades of love , to earn you back to me ; I threw myself upon your heart ; I pleaded long to stay ; I held my hands to you for help  --  you pushed them both away ! He came to me again ; he held his eager love to me  --  To me , whose weak and hungry heart deep desolation dreaded ! And I had learned to pity him ; but still my will was free , And once again I threatened him , and warned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see my erring fancy righted : We crept along a garden glade by moonbeams dimly lighted ; She silent sat ' mid clustering vines , though much her eyes did speak , And your black hair was tightly pressed unto her glowing cheek . ... It crazed me , but he soothed me sweet with love 's unnumbered charms ; I , desolate , turned and threw myself into his desolate arms ! O Rob , you know how little worth , when once a woman slips , May be the striking down a hand to save herself from falling ! Once more my heart groped for your heart , my tired lips sought your lips ; But ' t was too late  --  ' t was after dark  --  and you were past recalling . ' T is hard to claim what once is given ; my foe was unrelenting ; Vain were the tempests of my rage , the mists of my repenting . The night was dark , the storm had come , the fancy-stars of youth Were covered over by the thick unfading cloud of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hid its pale white face , Till all was dark , and all was drear , and all was black disgrace . O Rob , good-by ; a solemn one !  --  ' t is till the Judgment-day . You look about you for the boy ? You never more shall see him . He 's crying for his father now full many miles away ; For he is mine  --  you need not rage  --  you can not find or free him . We might have been so peaceful here , with nothing of reproving  --  We might have been so happy here , with none to spoil our loving  --  As I , a guilty one , might kiss a corpse 's waiting brow , I bend to you where you have fallen , and calmly kiss you now ; As I , a wronged and injured one , might seek escape 's glad door , I wander forth into the world , to enter here no more . III . Rob , the Pauper , is lying in state . In a box of rough-planed boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a home by human lust untainted . They are crowding round and closely peering At the face of the foe who is past their fearing ; The men lift children up to see The arms of the man who was good for three ; The women gaze and hold their breath , For the man looks kingly even in death . They have gone to their homes anear and far  --  Their joys and griefs , their loves and hating ; Some to sunder the ties that are , And some to cooing and wooing and mating . They will pet and strike , they will strive and blunder , And leer at their woes with innocent wonder ; They will swiftly sail love 's delicate bark , With never a helm , in the dangerous dark ; They will ne'er quite get it understood That the Pauper 's woes were for their good . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE THREE LOVERS . from Farm legends 1887 Here 's a precept , young man , you should follow with care . If you 're courting a girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hard-fisted farmer , Of moderate wealth , And immoderate health , Who fifty-odd years , in a stub-and-twist armor Of callus and tan , Had fought like a man His own dogged progress , through trials and cares , And log-heaps and brush-heaps and wild-cats and bears , And agues and fevers and thistles and briers , Poor kinsmen , rich foemen , false saints , and true liars ; Who oft , like the " man in our town , " overwise , Through the brambles of error had scratched out his eyes , And when the unwelcome result he had seen , Had altered his notion , Reversing the motion , And scratched them both in again , perfect and clean ; Who had weathered some storms , as a sailor might say , And tacked to the left and the right of his way , Till he found himself anchored , past tempests and breakers , Upon a good farm of a hundred-odd acres . As for ' Liakim 's wife , in four words may be told Her whole standing in life : She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was now growing old , But did , she considered , as well as one could , When HE looked on her hard work , and saw that ' t was good The family record showed only a daughter ; But she had a face , As if each fabled Grace In a burst of delight to her bosom had caught her , Or as if all the flowers in each Smith generation Had blossomed at last in one grand culmination . Style lingered unconscious in all of her dresses ; She 'd starlight for glances , and sunbeams for tresses . Wherever she went , with her right royal tread , Each youth , when he 'd passed her a bit , turned his head ; And so one might say , though the figure be strained , She had turned half the heads that the township contained . Now Bess had a lover  --  a monstrous young hulk ; A farmer by trade  --  Strong , sturdy , and staid ; A man of good parts  --  if you counted by bulk ; A man of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man of some depth  --  as was shown by his feed . His face was a fat exclamation of wonder ; His voice was not quite unsuggestive of thunder ; His laugh was a cross ' twixt a yell and a chuckle ; He 'd a number one foot , And a number ten boot , And a knock-down reserved in each separate knuckle . He 'd a heart mad in love with the girl of his choice , Who made him alternately mope and rejoice , By dealing him one day discouraging messes , And soothing him next day with smiles and caresses . Now Bess had a lover , who hoped her to wed  --  A rising young lawyer  --  more rising than read ; Whose theories all were quite startling ; and who , Like many a chap In these days of strange hap , Was living on what he expected to do ; While his landlady thought ' t would have been rather neat Could he only have learned , Till some practice was earned , To subsist upon what he expected to eat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a hundred in weight . Now Bess had a lover  --  young Patrick ; a sinner , And lad of all work , From the suburbs of Cork , Who worked for her father , and thought he could win her . And if Jacob could faithful serve fourteen years through , And still thrive and rejoice , For the girl of his choice , He thought he could play at that game one or two . Now ' Liakim Smith had a theory hid , And by egotism fed , Somewhere up in his head , That a dutiful daughter should always as bid Grow old in the service of him who begot her , Imbibe his beliefs , Have a care for his griefs , And faithfully bring him his cider and water . So , as might be expected , he turned up his nose , Also a cold shoulder , to Bessie 's two beaux ; And finally turned them away from his door , Forbidding them ever to enter it more ; And detailed young Patrick as kind of a guard , With orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat took his task , with a treacherous smile , And bullied the small one , And dodged the big tall one , And slyly made love to Miss Bess all the while . But one evening , when ' Liakim and wife crowned their labors With praise and entreating At the village prayer-meeting , And Patrick had stepped for a while to some neighbor 's , The lawyer had come , in the trimmest of dress , And , dapper and slim , And small , e'en for him , Was holding a session of court with Miss Bess . And Bess , sly love-athlete , was suited first rate At a flirtation-mill with this legal light-weight ; And was listening to him , as minutes spun on , Of pleas he could make , And of fees he would take , And of counted eight , Miss Bessie 's quick ear caught a step at the gate . " ' T is mother ! " she cried : " oh , go quick , I implore ! But father 'll drive ' round and come in the back-door ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So hide for a while  --  let me see  --  in this churn ! " The churn was quite large enough for him to turn in  --  Expanded out so , By machinery to go , ' T would have done for a dairy-man-Cyclops to churn in . ' T was fixed for attaching a pitman or lever , To go by a horse-power  --  a notion quite clever , Invented and built by the Irishman , Pat , Who pleased Mrs. ' Liakim hugely by that . The lawyer went into the case with much ease , And hugged the belief That the cause would be brief , And settled himself down with hardly a squeeze . And Bess said , " Keep still , for there 's plenty of room . " And shut down the cover , and left him in gloom . But scarcely were matters left decently so , In walked  --  not her mother , But  --  worry and bother !  --  The mammoth young farmer , whose first name was Joe . And he gleefully sung , in a heavy bass tone , Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm glad I have come , since I 've found you alone . Let 's sit here a while , by this kerosene light , An ' spark it a while now with all of our might . " And Bessie was willing ; and so they sat down , The maiden so fair and the farmer so brown . They talked of things great , and they talked of things small , Which none could condemn , And which may have pleased them , But which did not interest the lawyer at all ; And Bessie seemed giving but little concern To the feelings of him she had shut in the churn . Till Bessie just artlessly mentioned the man , And Joe with a will to abuse him began , And called him full many an ignoble name , Appertaining to " Scrubby , " And " Shorty , " and " Stubby , " And other descriptions not wide of the same ; And Bessie said naught in the lawyer 's behalf , But seconded Joe , now and then , with a laugh ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , And , somewhat abashed , And decidedly dashed , Accepted Joe 's motions sans vote or debate . And several times he , with policy stern , Repressed a desire to break out of the churn , Well knowing he thus might get savagely used , And if not quite eaten , Would likely be beaten , And probably injured as well as abused . But now came another quick step at the door , And Bessie was fearful , the same as before ; And tumbling Joe over a couple of chairs , With a general sound Of thunder all ' round , She hurried him up a short pair of back-stairs ; And close in the garret condemned him to wait Till orders from her , be it early or late . Then tripping her way down the staircase , she said . " I 'll smuggle them off when the folks get to bed . " It was not her parents ; ' t was crafty young Pat , Returned from his visit ; and straightway he sat Beside her , remarking , The chairs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and view her sweet face . So gayly they talked , as the minutes fast flew , Discussing such matters as both of them knew , While often Miss Bessie 's sweet laugh answered back , For Pat , be it known , Had some wit of his own , And in irony 's efforts was sharp as a tack . And finally Bessie his dancing tongue led , By a sly dextrous turn , To the man in the churn , And the farmer , who eagerly listened o'erhead ; Whereat the young Irishman volubly gave A short dissertation , Whose main information Was that one was a fool , and the other a knave . Slim chance there must be for the world e'er to learn How pleasant this was to the man in the churn ; Though , to borrow a figure lent by his position , He was doubtless in somewhat a worked-up condition . It ne'er may be sung , and it ne'er may be said , How well it was liked by the giant o'erhead . He lay on a joist  --  for there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And so far apart too , He could not , in comfort , preempt any more ; And he nearly had knocked through the plastering quite , And challenged young Pat to a fair and square fight ; But he dared not do elsewise than Bessie had said , For fear , as a lover , he might lose his head . But now from the meeting the old folks returned , And sat by the stove as the fire brightly burned ; And Patrick came in from the care of the team ; And since in the house there was overmuch cream , He thought that the horses their supper might earn , And leave him full way To plow early next day , By working that night for a while at the churn . The old folks consented ; and Patrick went out , Half chuckling ; for he had a shrewd Irish doubt , From various slight sounds he had chanced to discern , That Bess had a fellow shut up in that churn . The lawyer , meanwhile , in his hiding-place cooped , Low-grunted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place like a man in a dream ; And when the young Irishman went for the team , To stay or to fly , he could hardly tell which ; But hoping to get Neatly out of it yet , He concluded to hang till the very last hitch . The churn was one side of the house , recollect , So rods with the horse-power outside could connect ; And Bess stood so near that she took the lamp 's gleam in While her mother was cheerfully pouring the cream in ; Who , being near-sighted , and minding her cup , Had no notion of what she was covering up ; But the lawyer , meanwhile , had he dared to have spoke , Would have owned that he saw the whole cream of the joke . But just as the voice of young Patrick came strong And clear through the window , " All ready ! go ' long ! " And just as the dasher its motion began , Stirred up by its knocks , Like a jack-in-the-box He jumped from his damp , dripping prison  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chair , With some crisp Bible words not intended as prayer . All over the kitchen he rampaged and tore , And ran against everything there but the door ; Tipped over old ' Liakim flat on his back , And left a long trail of rich cream on his track . " Ou ! ou ! ' t is a ghost ! " quavered ' Liakim 's wife ; " A ghost , if I ever saw one in my life ! " " The devil ! " roared ' Liakim , rubbing his shin . " No ! no ! " shouted Patrick , who just then came in : " It 's only a lawyer : the devil ne'er runs  --  To bring on him a laugh  --  In the shape of a calf ; It is n't the devil ; it 's one of his sons ! If so that the spalpeen had words he could utther , He 'd swear he loved Bessie , an ' loved no one butther . " Now Joe lay full length on the scantling o'erhead , And tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list'ning to all that was done and was said ; But somehow his balance became uncontrolled , And he on the plastering heavily rolled . It yielded instanter , came down with a crash , And fell on the heads of the folks with a smash . And there his plump limbs through the orifice swung , And he caught by the arms and disgracefully hung , His ponderous body , so clumsy and thick , Wedged into that posture as tight as a brick . And ' Liakim Smith , by amazement made dumb At those legs in the air Hanging motionless there , Concluded that this time the devil had come ; And seizing a chair , he belabored them well , While the head pronounced words that no printer would spell . And there let us leave them , ' mid outcry and clatter , To come to their wits , and then settle the matter ; And take for the moral this inference fair : If you 're courting a girl , court her honest and square . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE SONG OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , my Alice , and let it be your choice , So as you pipe out plainly , and give me the sweet o ' your voice ; An ' it be not new-fashioned : the new-made tunes be cold , An ' never awake my fancy like them that 's good an ' old . Fie on your high-toned gimcracks , with rests an ' beats an ' points , Shaking with trills an ' quavers  --  creakin ' in twenty joints ! Sing me the good old tunes , girl , that roll right off the tongue , Such as your mother gave me when she an ' I was young . " So said the Farmer Thompson , smoking his pipe of clay , Close by his glowing fire-place , at close of a winter day . He was a lusty fellow , with grizzled beard unshorn , Hair half combed and flowing , clothing overworn ; Boots of mammoth pattern , with many a patch and rent ; Hands as hard as leather , body with labor bent ; Face of resolution , and lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanguards are ever doomed to bear ; While from his eyes the yearnings of unemployed desire Gleamed like the fitful embers of a half-smothered fire . Alice , the country maiden , with the sweet , loving face , Sung these words to an old air , with an unstudied grace : There 's nothing like an old tune , when friends are far apart , To ' mind them of each other , and draw them heart to heart . New strains across our senses on magic wings may fly , But there 's nothing like an old tune to make the heart beat high . The scenes we have so oft recalled when once again we view , Have lost the smile they used to wear , and seem to us untrue ; We gaze upon their faded charms with disappointed eye ; And there 's nothing like an old tune to make the heart beat high . We clasp the hands of former friends  --  we feel again their kiss  --  But something that we loved in them , in sorrow now we miss ; For women fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's nothing like an old tune to make the heart beat high . The forest where we used to roam , we find it swept away ; The cottage where we lived and loved , it moulders to decay ; And all that feeds our hungry hearts may wither , fade , and die ; And there 's nothing like an old tune to make the heart beat high . " That was well sung , my Alice , " the farmer proudly said , When the last strain was finished and the last word had fled ; " That is as true as Gospel ; and since you 've sung so well , I 'll give you a bit of a story you 've never heard me tell . " When the cry o ' the axes first through these parts was heard , I was young and happy , and chipper as a bird ; Fast as a flock o ' pigeons the days appeared to fly , With no one ' round for a six mile except your mother an ' I. Now we are rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Acres of land all ' round us , money in the bank ; But happiness do n't stick by me , an ' sunshine ai n't so true As when I was five-an ' - twenty , with twice enough to do . " As for the way your mother an ' I made livin ' go , Just some time you ask her  --  of course she ought to know . When she comes back in the morning from nursing Rogers ' wife , She 'll own she was happy in them days as ever in her life . For I was sweet on your mother ;  --  why should not I be ? She was the gal I had fought for  --  she was the world to me ; And since we 'd no relations , it never did occur To me that I was a cent less than all the world to her . " But it is often doubtful which way a tree may fall ; When you are tol'ble certain , you are not sure at all . When you are overconscious of travelin ' right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points the other way . For when you are feeling the safest , it very oft falls out You rush head-foremost into a big bull-thistle o ' doubt . " ' T was in the fall o ' ' 50 that I set out , one day , To hunt for deer an ' turkey , or what came in my way ; And wanderin ' through the forest , my home I did not seek , Until I was gone from the cabin the better part of a week . " As Saturday 's sun was creeping its western ladder down , I stopped for a bit of supper at the house of Neighbor Brown . He was no less my neighbor that he lived ten miles away ; For neighborhoods then was different from what they are to-day . " Now Mrs. Brown was clever  --  a good , well-meaning soul  --  And brought to time exactly things under her control . By very few misgoings were her perfections marred ; She meant well , with one trouble  --  she meant it ' most too hard . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed at Brown 's last jokes , Nat'rally I asked ' em if they had seen my folks . Whereat she shrugged her shoulders quite dangerously-wise , And looked as if a jury was sittin ' in her eyes ; And after a prudent silence I thought would never end , Asked if my wife had a brother , or cousin , or other friend ; For some one , passing my cabin , she 'd heard , had lately found Rather a sleek an ' han'some young fellow hanging round ; Of course it was a brother , or somethin ' of that sort ? I told her ' t was a brother , and cut my supper short . " Which same was wrong , as viewed through a strictly moral eye ; But who , to shield his wife 's name , would n't sometime tell a lie ? ' T was nothing but a lie , girl , and for a lie ' t was meant : If brothers sold at a million , she could n't ha ' raised a cent . " Home I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Home I trudged in a hurry , bound that I would see ; And when I reached my cabin I thought ' t was only fair To peep in at the window an ' find out what was there . " A nice , good-fashioned fellow as any in the land Sat by my wife quite closely , a-holdin ' of her hand , An ' whispering something into her willin ' - listenin ' ear , Which I should judge by her actions she rather liked to hear . " Now seeing such singular doin 's before my very eyes , The Devil he came upon me , and took me by surprise ; He put his hand on my mouth , girl , and never a word I said , But raised my gun an ' aimed it straight at the stranger 's head . " Lightly I touched the trigger ; I drew a good long breath  --  My heart was full o ' Satan , my aim was full o ' death ; But at that very instant they broke out , clear an ' strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That simple little song , girl , still in my ears does ring ; ' T was one I had coaxed your mother while courting her to sing ; Never a word I remember how any verses goes , But this is a little ditty that every body knows : How though about a palace you might forever hang , You 'll never feel so happy as in your own shebang . " It woke the recollections of happy days an ' years  --  I slowly dropped my rifle , an ' melted into tears . ..... " It was a neighbor 's daughter , made on the tomboy plan , Who , keeping my wife company , had dressed like a spruce young man ! An ' full of new-born praises to Him where they belong , I thanked the Lord for makin ' the man who made that good old song !

You used to know him , doctor , ere he his age did get , An ' if I ai n't mistaken , you sometimes see him yet .

The Grecians loved their soldier dead : They prized the casket , though the pearl had fled . When he who could be dangerous in the fight , Had proved his soul 's magnificence and might , But  --  his poor body vanquished  --  with a sigh Had laid him down upon the sands to die , He vaulted ' mongst the nation 's honored sons ; He was the love of all the living ones . They rallied round a chief when fallen low , To guard his numb flesh from a hostile blow . " Rescue the dead ! " was then the clarion cry ; " Rescue the dead , for we ourselves must die ! " So , oft they made , before the strife was done , A dozen corpses more , to rescue one . When that great agony of muscle , brain , Heart , soul , tumultuous joy , and frantic pain , Men call a battle , had been lost and won , And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er the brows of which exhausted band Proud Victory should press her jewelled hand , Then from the conquered to the conquering came A voice that made its way like tongues of flame , And swift and chivalrous compliance bred : " Give us a truce , that we may bury our dead ! " Six Grecian generals came from war one day , All well esteemed , for gallant men were they ; But some one , pointing grimly at them , said , " They on the field unburied left their dead . " Then popular rage rose in a fiery flood , And curled about them , and licked up their blood . Why did each one fall with dissevered head ? Because the Grecians loved their soldier dead ! A man came running from Thermopyl , And said , " ' T is done ; they all were slain but me . " Why did his fellow-Spartans sneer and hiss , Recoil from him , as from a leper 's kiss , And say , " Take back your blood , you craven drone , And leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because the unhappy man had sped Away from death , and left his comrades dead . The Grecian mother , with a tearless eye , Sent her son warward , with this mandate high : " Now be this shield your glory or your hearse ! With it you earn my blessing or my curse ! Rather your ashes flecked with sparks of fame , Than your live body clad in robes of shame ! " Oh yes , the Grecians loved their soldier dead ! Whether beneath the grass-blade 's dainty tread , Or ' mid the funeral pyre 's majestic blaze , They glowed within the living 's envied gaze ! Yet not like ours that Grecian love could be : They did not love the living as do we ! II . The Romans loved their soldier dead , And brightest , grandest honors o'er them spread . That hard , grim nation , which with fierce iron hand Clasped by the choking throat land after land , And blood of its own living freely shed , Grew strangely tender with its warrior dead . The past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in garlands on the golden name ; The magic silver of some gifted tongue Chaplets of praise above his body flung ; And words fell on the living , listening ear , The dead might well awaken but to hear . The flags that he had captured , draped in gloom , Before him waved  --  he found them at his tomb ; Sweet flowers , the freshest beauties of a day , Made a fair garden round the hero 's clay ; Great monuments wrote solemnly on high His glory o'er the blue page of the sky ; And epitaphs , beneath the sparkling name , Gave to the voiceless dead a tongue of flame . Who fell with patriotic bravery , knew , Humble or proud , his deeds would have their due ; Whoe'er with baseness threw his name away , Knew that , when fall'n , he formed the vulture 's prey . Oh yes , the Romans loved their valiant dead , The while their living were to victory led ! Swift-sighted Rome ! you knew the intense desire Of men to live when lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest breath , To make their names o'erbridge the gulf of death ; Knew the last rites to one dead hero paid Would sharpen many a living warrior 's blade ; Knew how your victory-accustomed bands Were waved along by their dead comrades ' hands !

And does Columbia love her dead ?  --  No word of praise or honor can be said , No language has been given to our race , No monument has majesty or grace , No music , filling with weird sweets the air , No maid or matron eloquently fair , Naught that can feeling to expression wed , May say how well we love our soldier dead . If in those days when self was all above , Men loved so well ere they were taught to love , What deep affection may be felt and seen From hearts taught by the love-crowned Nazarene ! The narrow Tiber creeps through Csar 's Rome , The broad Potomac laves our chieftain 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunders o'er the Western hill . So seems it , in this era of heart-lore , As if our love transcended all before . In this republic  --  Giant of Free Lands , Holding apart the oceans with strong hands  --  Has through these years in massive quiet flown A tide of tender heart-love for its own . When swirling floods rush through the meadows fair , And turn them into valleys of despair , A flood of love sweeps o'er the prosperous hills , And brings them aid to cure their sudden ills . When the red fire-king holds his crimson court , And ruins homes to sate his fiendish sport , There speeds a flame of pity through the land , Which opens wide the generous heart and hand . Love for the worthy living , our hearts ' guide ; Love for the worthy dead , his dark-veiled bride . Love for the living martyrs of the land , And garlands for the dead , go hand in hand .

Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : RIFTS IN THE CLOUD . Graduating Poem , June 17 , 1869. from Farm legends 1887 Life is a cloud  --  e'en take it as you may ; Illumine it with Pleasure 's transient ray ; Brighten its edge with Virtue ; let each fold E'en by the touch of God be flecked with gold , While angel-wings may kindly hover near , And angel-voices murmur words of cheer , Still , life 's a cloud , forever hanging nigh , Forever o'er our winding pathways spread , Ready to blacken on some saddened eye , And hurl its bolts on some defenseless head ! Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Paths that seem straight , with naught of thorn or hill The bright and glorious sun , each welcome day , Flashes upon the flowers that deck their way , And the soft zephyr sings a lullaby , ' Mid rustling trees , to please the ear and eye ; And all the darling child of fortune needs , And all his dull , half-slumbering caution heeds , While fairy eyes their watch above him keep , Is breath to live and weariness to sleep . But life 's a cloud ! and soon the smiling sky May wear the unwelcome semblance of a frown , And the fierce tempest , madly rushing by , May raise its dripping wings , and strike him down ! When helpless infancy , for love or rest , Lies nestling to a mother 's yearning breast , While she , enamored of its ways and wiles As mothers only are , looks down and smiles , And spies a thousand unsuspected charms In the sweet babe she presses in her arms , While he , the love-light kindled in his eyes , Sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine comes for each caress , From out the clear blue sky of happiness . But life 's a cloud ! and soon the smiling face The frowns and tears of childish grief may know , And the love-language of the heart give place To the wild clamor of a baby 's woe . The days of youth are joyful , in their way ; Bare feet tread lightly , and their steps are gay . Parental kindness grades the early path , And shields it from the storm-king 's dreaded wrath . But there are thorns that prick the infant flesh , And bid the youthful eyes to flow afresh , Thorns that maturer nerves would never feel , With wounds that bleed not less , that soon they heal . When we look back upon our childhood days , Look down the long and sweetly verdant ways Wherein we gayly passed the shining hours , We see the beauty of its blooming flowers , We breathe its fresh and fragrant air once more , And , counting all its many pleasures o'er , And giving them their natural place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorrows that now were light , then weighed us down , And claimed our tears for every surly frown . For life 's a cloud , e'en take it as we will , The changing wind ne'er banishes or lifts ; The pangs of grief but make it darker still , And happiness is nothing but its rifts . There is a joy in sturdy manhood still ; Bravery is joy ; and he who says , I WILL , And turns , with swelling heart , and dares the fates , While firm resolve upon his purpose waits , Is happier for the deed ; and he whose share Is honest toil , pits that against dull care . And yet , in spite of labor , faith , or prayer , Dark clouds and fearful o'er our paths are driven They take the shape of monsters in the air , And almost shut our eager gaze from heaven ! Disease is there , with slimy , loathsome touch , With hollow , blood-shot eyes and eager clutch , Longing to strike us down with pangs of pain , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there , with cunning ambush laid , Waiting some panic in the ranks of trade , Some profitless endeavor , or some trust By recreant knave abused , to snatch the crust From out the mouths of them we love the best , And bring gaunt hunger , an unwelcome guest . Disgrace is there , of honest look bereft , Truth in his right hand , falsehood in his left , Pride in his mouth , the devil in his eye , His garment truth , his cold black heart a lie , Forging the bolts to blast some honored name ; Longing to see some victim wronged or wrong ; To see him step into the pool of shame , Or soiled by loved ones that to him belong . A dark cloud hovers over every zone  --  The cloud of ignorance . The great unknown , Defying comprehension , still hangs low Above our feeble minds . When we who now Have stumbled ' neath the ever-varying load That marks the weary student 's royal road , Have hurried over verbs in headlong haste , And various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , with rueful sigh , ' Gainst figures truthful , that yet seemed to lie ; Have peeped into the Sciences , and learned How much we do not know ; have bravely turned Our guns of eloquence on forest trees , And preached grave doctrines to the wayward breeze ; When we have done all this , the foggy cloud , With scarce a rift , is still above us bowed ; And we are children , on some garden 's verge , Groping for flowers the opposing wall beneath , Who , flushed and breathless , may at last emerge , With a few scanty blossoms for a wreath . But never was a cloud so thick and black , But it might some time break , and on its track The glorious sun come streaming . Never , too , So but its threads might bleach to lighter hue , Was sorrow 's mantle of so deep a dye . And he who , peering at the troubled sky , Looks past the clouds , or looks the cloud-rifts through , Or , finding none , remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that man who Shows the completest wisdom of this earth . When one stands forth in Reasons 's glorious light , Stands in his own proud consciousness of right , Laments his faults , his virtues does not boast , Studies all creatures  --  and himself the most  --  Knowing the way wherewith his faults to meet , Or , vanquished by them , owning his defeat , He pays the penalty as should true men , And pitches battle with the foe again ; When , giving all their proper due and heed , He yet has power , when such shall be the need , To go his way , unshackled , true , and free , And bid the world go hanged , if needs must be , He strikes a rift for his unfearing eye Through the black cloud of low servility : A cloud that 's decked the Orient all these years ; ' Neath whose low-bending folds , ' mid groans and tears , Priestcraft has heaped its huge , ill-gotten gains , And tyrants forged their bloody , clanking chains ; A cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treacherous deep held proudly up , By waves that leaped and dashed each other o'er , But onward still the ark of Freedom bore , Some fair and peaceful Ararat to find , Plumed its black wings , and swept not far behind . To-day it lowers o'er this great , free land  --  O'er farms and workshops , offices and spires  --  Its baleful shadow casts on every hand , And darkens Church and State and household fires . It is a thing to pity and to blame , A useless , vile , humiliating shame , A silent slander on the Heaven-born soul , Decked with the signet of its own control , A flaw upon the image of our God , When men , obedient to some Mogul 's nod  --  When men , the sockets of whose addled brains Are blessed with some illuminate remains Wherefrom the glim of reason still is shed , Blow out the light , and send their wits to bed ; And , taking as their sole dictator , then . Some little , thundering god of speech or pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that beats them down , Or silenced by some lubricated tongue , Covered with borrowed words and neatly hung  --  They yield their judgments up to others ' wills , And take grave creeds like sugar-coated pills ; And , with their weakness tacitly confessed , Like the unfeathered fledgelings of a nest , When the old bird comes home with worms and flies  --  With half a smile and half a knowing frown , They open wide their mouths , and shut their eyes , And seem to murmur softly , " Drop it down . " He who will creep about some great man 's feet , The honeyed fragrance of his breath to meet , Or follow him about , with crafty plan , And cringe for smiles and favors , is no man .

Let us e'en strike , with courage true endowed , Straight at the centre of this murky cloud , And sweep its worthless vapor from the earth . Take sense for coin ; opinions at their worth ; Conviction at its cost ; dictation , when Our minds and souls are bankrupt  --  hardly then ! When Freedom 's sons and daughters will do this , Our land will know a day of happiness , Fit for such joy as never yet was seen , E'en when Emancipation tried her keen Bright blade upon the galling chains of steel , And stamped the action with the nation 's seal . E'en when the cable its initial spark Brought flashing through the ocean 's deep and dark ; E'en when was fixed , with far-resounding strokes , With song , and praise , and thankfulness , and mirth , The golden fastening of the chain that yokes The two great restless oceans of the earth ! But over all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death : a thunder-head , Yet ominously silent ; moving on , While from its threatening folds , so deep and dark , The forkd lightning , ever and anon , Shoots for some life , and never fails its mark .

What might have been , his early growth had shown ; What was , our love and tears for him may tell ; He lived , he toiled , he faded , and he fell . When our friend lay within that narrow room Men call a coffin  --  in its cheerless gloom Himself the only tenant , and asleep In a long slumber , terrible and deep ; When at the open door his pale , sad face Appeared to us , without a look or trace Of recognition in its ghastly hue , Soon to be hid forever from our view ; When , with his sightless eyes to heaven upturned . Wherefrom his royal soul upon them burned , He waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic patience of the dead ; When tenderly his manly form we lay In its last couch , with covering of clay ; Who in that mournful duty had a part , But felt the cloud of Death upon his heart ? But when we thought how his unfettered soul , Free from his poor sick body 's weak control , Pluming its wings at the Eternal throne , Might take through realms of space its rapid flight , And find a million joys to us unknown , The cloud was rifted by a ray of light . Old class of ' 69 ! together , still , We 've journeyed up the rough and toilsome hill ; Seeking the gems to labor ne'er denied , Plucking the fruits that deck the mountain-side .

But there are thoughts weak words will not reveal ; The rarest fruitage is the last to fall ; The strongest language hath no words at all . When first the uncouth student comes in sight  --  A sturdy plant , just struggling toward the light  --  And timidly invades his classic home , And gazes at the high-perched college dome , Striving , through eyes with a vague yearning dim , To spy some future glory there for him , A child in thought , a man in strong desire , A clod of clay , vexed by a restless fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate , He leans himself ' gainst Learning 's iron gate , While all the future frowns upon his track , And all the past conspires to pull him back ; When , with tired resolution in his looks , He bends above the cabalistic books , And strives , with knitted forehead throbbing hot , To learn what older students have forgot ; And wonders how the Romans and the Greeks Could cry aloud and spare their jaws and cheeks ; And wants the Algebraic author put On an equation , tied there , head and foot , Which then , with all Reduction 's boasted strength , May be expanded to prodigious length ; When he reflects , with rueful , pain-worn phiz , What a sad , melancholy dog he is , And how much less unhappy and forlorn Are all those students who are not yet born ; When Inexperience like a worm is twined Around the clumsy fingers of his mind , And Discipline , a stranger yet unknown , Struts grandly by and leaves him all alone ; What cheers him better than to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or the sincere advice and kindly aid Of those well versed in Study 's curious trade ? What help such solace and improvement lends As the hand-grasp of Brothers and of Friends ? When , with a wildly ominous halloo , The frisky Freshman shuffles into view , And shouts aloud the war-cry of his clan , And makes friends with the devil like a man ; When , looking upward at the other classes , He dubs them as three tandem-teams of asses , And , scarcely knowing what he does it for , Vows against them unmitigated war , And aims to show them that though they may tread In stately , grand procession o'er his head , The animated pathway that they scorn , May sometimes bristle with a hidden thorn ; When , with a vigilance that to nothing yields , He scans the fruitage of the neighboring fields , And in the solemn night-time doth entwine Affection 's fingers round the melon-vine ; When the tired wagon from its sheltering shed To strange , uncouth localities is led , And , with the night for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the hushed rooster , cheated of his cry , From his spoiled perch bids this vain world good-bye When , in the chapel , an unwilling guest , And living sacrifice , a cow doth rest ; When from the tower , the bell 's notes , pealing down , Rouse up the fireman from the sleeping town , Who , rushing to the scene , with duty fired , Finds his well-meant assistance unrequired , And , creeping homeward , steadily doth play Upon the third commandment all the way ; When are fired off , with mirth-directed aims , At the staid Alma Mater , various games , As feline juveniles themselves regale In the lithe folds of the maternal tail , And when these antics have gone far enough , Comes from her paw a well-considered cuff , What more to soothe the chastened spirit tends Than sympathy from Brothers and from Friends ?

When the spruce Junior , not disposed to shirk , Begins to get down fairly to his work , Strives to run foremost in the college race , Or at least fill a creditable place ; When he bears , o'er the rough and hard highway , The heat and burden of the college day , And hastes  --  his mental lungs all out of breath  --  As if it were a race of life and death ; When with some little doubt his brain is fraught , That he 's not quite so brilliant as he thought , And he would strengthen his lame talent still , By wrapping ' round the bandage of his will ; When , undergoing the reaction drear That follows up the Sophomoric year , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long at every phrase 's door , And pauses o'er his dull oration 's page , Then tears it into pieces in a rage ; When , had he fifty ink-stands , he could throw Each at some devil fraught with fancied woe ; And when , perchance , atop of all this gloom , In his heart 's world there 's yet sufficient room For Cupid to come blundering through the dark , And make his sensibilities a mark , And , viewing each the other from afar , Learning and Love frown dolefully , and spar ; What for his trouble-phantoms makes amends Like the support of Brothers and of Friends ? When , with a strengthened soul and chastened brain , The Senior who has labored not in vain Looks back upon the four eventful years To see if any fruitfulness appears , When he stands , somewhat shadowed by remorse , In the bright Indian Summer of the course , And muses , had each opportunity Been seized , how smooth his present path might be ; When , having blundered through each college hall , Bumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him through the window-panes , Broad Knowledge ' deep ravines and fertile plains ; When , standing at the door , with gaze of doubt , He draws on his world-wrappings , and looks out Into the chillness of the winter 's day , And almost wishes that he still might stay , What nearer to his beating heart extends , Than parting with his Brothers and his Friends ? When he at last has bid the school good-by , And finds that many matters go awry ; Finds much amid Earth 's uncongenial fog , Not mentioned in the college catalogue ; Finds that The World , in writing his name down , Forgets , somehow , to add the letters on Which serve to make his fellow-mortals see How little rests behind a big degree ; Finds , also , that it is inclined to speak Elsewise than in the Latin or the Greek ; Finds that the sharp blade of his brightened mind Gets dulled upon the pachydermal kind ; That The World by Declension understands The sliding-down of houses , stocks , and lands ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Translation from one pocket to another ; Mistrusts that if The World has , as is sung , A tail by which , perchance , it may be " slung , " The blessed place so many hands infold , He can not find whereon he may take hold ; Finds that he best makes ground o'er this world 's road , As he his college nonsense doth unload ; What sweeter sound with Life 's alarum blends Than the kind voice of Brothers and of Friends ? And so , to-day , we live our old lives o'er  --  The Freshman gay , the smiling Sophomore , The anxious Junior , and the Senior proud , The care-immersed Alumnus , sober-browed ; To shake once more the quick-responding hand , To trade in jokes no others understand ; Our fish-lines into Memory 's ponds to throw For stories which were left there long ago ( Which , like most fishy ventures , as is known , Through many changing years have bred and grown ) ; To beat the big drum of our vanity , To clash the cymbals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , To fight once more the battles of the past . Beneath the blue of this clear sunlit sky , Beneath the storm-cloud , rudely lingering nigh , From night to night  --  from changing day to day  --  Our grand Society has won its way . And as the lichen plant , when tempest-torn , And roughly from its native hill-side borne , Sucks moisture from the whirlwind 's shivering form , And grows , while yet hurled onward by the storm , And when at last its voyage well is o'er , Thrives sweeter , purer , stronger than before , Our gallant little band has ever grown Stronger for all the struggles it has known ; And , ' mid the smiles and frowns that heaven out-sends , Our hearts still beat as Brothers and as Friends . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : OUR MARCH THROUGH THE PAST . Alumni Reunion  --  1885. from Farm legends 1887 When the tints of the morning had turned into gray , And the sun of our lives fast was finding its day , When we stood on that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and womanhood scarce had begun , When the word was no longer " How happy are we ! " But " What can we suffer , and conquer , and be ? " When the prairies of youth , with fresh flowers covered o'er , And all shaded with groves , were our playgrounds no more ; And mountains stepped into the mist , from afar , And over the highest one 's top , gleamed a star , ' T was whispered to us , " If those heights you ascend , Much training its aid to your forces must lend ; Ere you in the future the conflict have won , You must know what the minds of past ages have done . " Then the old Alma Mater , with welcoming sign , Said , " That 's what I 'm for ; students , fall into line ! " And with hearts still at home , but with eyes forward cast , We started away on our march through the past . ' T was a long , weary march ! full of toil and of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain ; There were sinkings of heart , fraught with agony dire ; There were roads we must walk full of thorns and of fire . For if he who much strength with the body would gain , Must clamber his way through fatigue and through pain , Then he who would mental efficiency find , Must suffer and strive with the nerves of the mind . If we turned all these woes in the quartz-mill of truth , And crushed out the gold from the woes of our youth , If we knew that all pain , when ' t is wisely endured , Will be paid for ten times , and the wound neatly cured , Then we gathered rich profits that doubtless will last Through ages to come  --  in our march through the past . ' T was a bright , glorious march ! full of joys that were new ; Of hopes that kept budding , and friends that kept true ; And powers just awaking and op'ning their eyes , That dashed through our souls with a thrill of surprise ; Of facts ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of the fire of success . To you who now fret under college control , Keep this truth in your mind  --  let it call on your soul : You never will find , through terrestrial source , A pathway more smooth than the old college course . In spite of the foes that may lie in the way , In spite of the clouds that may blot the best day , In spite of the gibes ignoramuses throw forth , In spite of the cares of the world , flesh , etc. , There 's nothing you 'll find , tho ' you live a long while , That will show you so many sweet flowers to the mile , Though running through some woeful weeds on the way , As this same college course you are taking to-day . When , nearing Death-station , on life 's crooked track , You scan your time-table , and take a look back O'er all of the different stations you 've passed , You 'll own , as you trundle along to the last , That nothing will strike you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in the old college course ! You will find that it lighted your life , all the way , And gave you material for effort , each day ; That you traveled much freer , for the luggage amassed In the work-checkered days of your march through the past . ' T was a bonnie October , as autumn months go , From our camp on the tolerably placid St. Jo. , We shouldered our  --  books , for grim heroism 's home , For sweet , wicked , charming , licentious old Rome ! And ere the last month of our journey was through , What picturesque characters came to our view ! Came Cicero , full of extremes good and bad ; The only great orator Rome ever had ! Philosopher , statesman , attorney , he rose The higher for each of his enemies ' blows ! A lesson to halt not that foes be appeased , And not to turn back when some fools are displeased . Keep on , with what light heaven will lend to your eyes ; If fools call you fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livy , who , when we approached him , first fired A volley of Preface , that made us all tired ; Describer of Rome , both as glorious and base , With mod'rate correctness , and infinite grace ; Who told how a wolf , in her blood-spattered home , Took charge of the two city fathers of Rome ; How Remus resigned , from some reasons of weight , And Romulus seemed to endure it , " first-rate ; " How his guests from the Sabines escaped with their lives , But left all their best-looking daughters for wives ( Let this be a warning , by fathers e'er carried ; Keep daughters from school if you do n't want them married ! ) ; Yes , what characters old , and yet startlingly new , Did that same historian pilot us to ! Came Hannibal , trapper of Romans ; whose might Put even the courage of heroes to flight ! Unhelped by his own , and not conquered e'en then , Till the sun was eclipsed and made cowards his men ; Yet even , when down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and gave him respect ! Came brave , grand Horatius , who kept bridge one day , And took bloody toll from whoe'er came that way ; Then swam back in triumph  --  the pride of all nations  --  And hero of  --  several school declamations ! If we used these fierce stories our courage to feed , And learned that Resolve is the master of need , If we made up our minds that success is a prize That under the rubbish of hard labor lies , That like Rome , with its victory-banners unfurled , We would fight till we conquered our share of the world , But unlike old Rome , we would not settle down , And let Sloth and Luxury tarnish our crown , Then we gained o'er ourselves a good influence vast , From that savage old land  --  in our march through the past . What country is this , that looms brightly to me , Washed well by the waves of the gean sea ? ' T is the land where blind Homer , with harp of pure gold , Sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , keeping an unruffled face , Took his cup of cold poison , with infinite grace ; Where brave old Leonidas glory achieved , Was at home in Thermopylae 's pass , and received ; Who to eloquence threw all a hero could give , And died  --  that a thousand orations might live ! Where youthful Demosthenes , famous to be , With pebbles for troches , harangued the whole sea ; While only himself and the wild breezes heard , And the ocean , though masculine , got the last word ; How bad old Ulysses , on water and land , Showed how an old robber could even be grand ; Where grim old Diogenes comfort defied , And lived  --  a tub full of the meanest of pride ; Who flattered himself he had no one to thank , And earned  --  though received not  --  the name of a crank ; And other old worthies , and unworthies , too , Whose sorrows and joys will forever be new . If these and their motives we struggled to reach , And studied their natures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those mines of thought-silver and gold , That seldom run barren and never grow old , Took what we could carry , and held to it fast , Then a good growing time , was our march through the past ! What country is this ? where some strange-looking men Make odd-looking figures with pencil and pen ; The ghost of old Daboll stalks grimly about ; And this one is Greenleaf  --  now , Thomson steps out ; Charles Davies has come , arm-and-arm with Bourdon , While Robinson , Loomis , and others crowd on . Conundrums they offer ; strange riddles they state ; And set each poor wretch to maltreating his slate . How the hands of a clock meet at high twelve  --  and then , When will that old time-piece its fists clench again ? How two famous trav'lers , who never have met , Set out for some place ( and have not arrived yet ! ) ; How a man had three sons : to the first one he gave One-third of what he from the others could save ; The others both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a cent of their cash to this day ! ) ; How a person had four casks : the first of which , filled From the second , left four-sevenths of what was not spilled ( I always stopped right in the midst of my tasks , To guess at the taste of the stuff in those casks ) ; How a man had ten daughters : the first one 's age reckoned Three-fourths of eight-ninths of nine-tenths of the second ; Numbers 3 , 4 , and 5 , also 6 , 7 , and 8 , Used also in problems their ages to state ; The other two , being quite chickens , in fact , Dropped ciphering , and stated their ages exact . ( If you went through that long computation again , You 'd find those girls just the same age they were then . ) Then the triangles , rectangles , quadrangles too , And other sad wrangles we had to go through ; The sines and the co-sines that at us were hurled , Till we wished that there was n't such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a cold winter blast , But strengthened us much , in our march through the past . So ' mid all these countries we marched , night and day , And many the strange things that came in our way ; The reasons , that seemed from us walled , hedged , and fenced ; The roots of dead verbs , that we stumbled against ; The pitiless logic of syllogism thin , That puzzled us where to conclude or begin ; Rough notes of philosophy , harder than sweet , That pained our teeth , ere we cracked through to the meat ; Our fright when " Analogy " round us careened , And made Joseph Butler show up like a fiend ; The chemistry that in our minds somewhat sank , And showed us what queer things we ate , breathed , and drank ; Zoology , where ' t was laboriously shown That man is n't the only queer animal known ; We studied the rocks  --  rugged children of flame  --  And sweet-scented flowers , and the fields whence they came . Then our innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensiblest mirth ever met ; And most of them  --  now that vacation grows long  --  Seem rather uncalled for , if not rather wrong . The old standard jokes that young blood keeps to spare , Such as borrowing wagons to lend to the air , And sampling much fruit  --  alas ! stolen and sweet ! To learn if ' t was fit for the owner to eat ; And making strange brutes go to college by force  --  These all seem a part of the regular course . If from such foolish pranks , we have garnered the truth That blood frisks and glows , when ' t is seasoned with youth , That young nerves with life and with mischief must thrill , And youth may be gay , and have principle still , If we that experience give a kind use , And form for the faults of the young , an excuse , And not at each bubble of sport stand aghast  --  Our fun bore some fruit as we marched through the past . But memory is wide ; and remains the abode Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ! They started off with us , their hopes were as bright As any of ours  --  and their spirits as light ; Their efforts were brave , and their motives were good ; And they made the long march just as well as they could . These gold days of June , each a floral surprise , Gave a thrill to their hearts , and a gleam to their eyes ; The meadows that mantle yon valley 's cool breast , To them , as to us , were the symbols of rest ; By them as by us the fresh hill-sides were seen , When corn-fields were tossing their ribbons of green ; For them the wide grain waved its flags richly free , And promised fruition , in days soon to be ; For them faithful hands gave a clasp that was true , And proud kindred hearts kept their triumphs in view ; They marched by our side , with no burden of dread  --  They saw not the grave , just a few steps ahead ; They looked for the time , when sweet blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know ; But too weary the march , or too heavy the load ; And they laid down their armor and died on the road . Whatever the splendors and joys of to-day , Whatever the flowers that may flash in our way , Whatever our joy at assembling once more , Though God in his love grant the same o'er and o'er , We will always remember , with sweet love bestowed , The names of those comrades who fell on the road . The flags of our triumphs shall droop at half mast , For those whom the future claimed out of the past ! Not as youths now we meet , but grave women and men ; ' Mid bright summer days , we must soon part again . We know not the future , or what hands our own May clasp , when another half decade is flown ; Our efforts may yet for a season be told ( For we 're not so distressing , confoundedly old ; The crows may have stood at the edge of our eyes , And left some tracks there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our hair may be carelessly flung ; But our minds and our hearts and our souls may be young ) , Still , grass-stalks , e'en now , may have lifted their heads , That may die of the spades that will make our last beds ; But whatever our fate  --  to enjoy or endure  --  To quote from great Webster , " The past is secure ; " So I would to-night move a vote of warm thanks , To the living and dead who commanded our ranks ; To our enemies , who , in their short busy stay , Did all that they could , to encumber our way ; Who postured and crouched in their poisonous slime , Becoming step-ladders , on which we could climb ; Who told our worst faults , and then lied themselves hoarse , And spurred us along with their tongues , in our course ; Who lived  --  low-conceived , intellectual moles  --  " Next door to " our bodies  --  but not to our souls . The rattle-snake , viper , and toad have a use , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thank to the friends who looked high for our mark , And lighted the way when ' t was dreary and dark ; For he that has groped through the fog of despair , ' Till he fought his way out to the light and the air , Has one thing he never forgets , you will find ; And that 's the first help of a friend that is kind . Do you think , O true friend ! who for e'en a short while , Have helped a young student with deed , word , or smile , That his memory , howe'er distracted or vexed , Will drop out your name , in this world , or the next ? Among the good angels of earth you are classed , You who helped us along in our way through the past ! Forward march ! though that past lies in burial lands , We must toil in the future , with heads , hearts , and hands ; Forward march ! is the order that comes from on high , And rules the great college that graces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say very true ; But so , by-the-way , is Eternity , too ! No study to-day gets our effort and love , But has its completion in text-books above ; No work over which the clouds struggle and beat , But finished may be , with the clouds ' neath our feet ; Then with eyes upon Earth , but with hearts forward cast , We will thank happy Heaven for our march through the past ! Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THAT DAY WE GRADUATED . from Farm legends 1887 We 've had some first-class fruitage , boys , ' Mid all the bad pears in our baskets , And there are several jewelled toys In Memory 's queer , old-fashioned caskets ; Where silver morning bells will chime Some certain tones that ne'er were mated , From that unprecedented time  --  That grand old day , we graduated ! It was a sheaf of hopes and fears ; A fate that came , close covered , to us ; It was the last day of four years That were to build up or undo us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shrunk , for which we waited ; That inward fear and outward boast  --  That fine old day we graduated ! A thousand heads and hearts were there , With more or less discernment gifted ; Our enemies with hopeful stare , Our friends with look of kindness lifted . We saw gay chaplets , wondering whom To crown their brilliant lives were fated ; Bouquets looked puzzled ' mid their bloom , That fragrant day we graduated ! And Beauty held a precious prize Of smiles for our intense oblations , And looked from many-colored eyes Made quizzical by old flirtations ; And Learning glanced us through and through , With cold astuteness that we hated ; We knew how much we never knew , That trying day we graduated ! We rose , with super-student care , Brimful of fear and information ; We had about ten minutes there To put four years in one oration . A thousand judgments on our lives From that important hour were dated : How queer , that one of us survives That fateful day we graduated ! How all the sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In cartridges of periods cast , And fired in rounds of quick succession ! Right 's winsome look , Wrong 's loathsome shape , Were unequivocally stated ; And lucky that which could escape Us all  --  that day we graduated ! And when our guns were at full play , As o'er the creaking stage we hauled them , Some first-class words got strayed away , And would not come back when we called them ; We had to grope and stumble round , Just where our style was most inflated : Humility and nerve , we found , Were trumps , that day we graduated ! Ah me ! it all was bitter-sweet  --  That time of music , flowers , and splendor ; The future life we marched to meet , The past , with memories rich and tender . A sombre fragrance filled the air  --  A mournful joy ne'er duplicated ; Both night and morning lingered there , That changeful day we graduated ! And when " Good-bye " came , grimly sure , And handed us our hands at parting , We saw on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We who had wrangled , schemed , and fought , As dear old friends each other rated ; Love twined about us , as it ought , That solemn day we graduated ! Poems of Sorrow and Death . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE BURNING OF CHICAGO . from Farm legends 1887 I. ' T was night in the beautiful city , The famous and wonderful city , The proud and magnificent city , The Queen of the North and the West . The riches of nations were gathered in wondrous and plentiful store ; The swift-speeding bearers of Commerce were waiting on river and shore ; The great staring walls towered skyward , with visage undaunted and bold , And said , " We are ready , O Winter ! come on with your hunger and cold ! Sweep down with your storms from the northward ! come out from your ice-guarded lair ! Our larders have food for a nation ! our wardrobes have clothing to spare ! For off from the corn-bladed prairies , and out from the valleys and hills , The farmer has swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And here , in the lap of our city , the treasures of autumn shall rest , In golden-crowned , glorious Chicago , the Queen of the North and the West ! " II . ' T was night in the church-guarded city , The temple and altar-decked city , The turreted , spire-adorned city , The Queen of the North and the West . And out from the beautiful temples that wealth in its fullness had made , And out from the haunts that were humble , where Poverty peacefully prayed , Where praises and thanks had been offered to Him where they rightly belonged , In peacefulness quietly homeward the worshiping multitude thronged . The Pharisee , laden with riches and jewelry , costly and rare , Who proudly deigned thanks to Jehovah he was not as other men are ; The penitent , crushed in his weakness , and laden with pain and with sin ; The outcast who yearningly waited to hear the glad bidding , " Come in ; " And thus went they quietly homeward , with sins and omissions confessed , In spire-adorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . III . ' T was night in the sin-burdened city , The turbulent , vice-laden city , The sin-compassed , rogue-haunted city , Though Queen of the North and the West . And low in their caves of pollution great beasts of humanity growled ; And over his money-strewn table the gambler bent fiercely , and scowled ; And men with no seeming of manhood , with countenance flaming and fell , Drank deep from the fire-laden fountains that spring from the rivers of hell ; And men with no seeming of manhood , who dreaded the coming of day , Prowled , cat-like , for blood-purchased plunder from men who were better than they ; And men with no seeming of manhood , whose dearest-craved glory was shame , Whose joys were the sorrows of others , whose harvests were acres of flame , Slunk , whispering and low , in their corners , with bowie and pistol tight-pressed , In rogue-haunted , sin-cursed Chicago , though Queen of the North and the West . IV . ' T was night in the elegant city , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gay Queen of the North and the West . And childhood was placidly resting in slumber untroubled and deep ; And softly the mother was fondling her innocent baby to sleep ; And maidens were dreaming of pleasures and triumphs the future should show , And scanning the brightness and glory of joys they were never to know ; And firesides were cheerful and happy , and Comfort smiled sweetly around ; But grim Desolation and Ruin looked into the window and frowned . And pitying angels looked downward , and gazed on their loved ones below , And longed to reach forth a deliverance , and yearned to beat backward the foe ; But Pleasure and Comfort were reigning , nor danger was spoken or guessed , In beautiful , golden Chicago , gay Queen of the North and the West . V. Then up in the streets of the city , The careless and negligent city , The soon to be sacrificed city , Doomed Queen of the North and the West , Crept , softly and slyly , so tiny it hardly was worthy the name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant serpent of flame . The South-wind and West-wind came shrieking , " Rouse up in your strength and your ire ! For many a year they have chained you , and crushed you , O demon of fire ! For many a year they have bound you , and made you their servant and slave ! Now , rouse you , and dig for this city a fiery and desolate grave ! Freight heavy with grief and with wailing her world-scattered pride and renown ! Charge straight on her mansions of splendor , and battle her battlements down ! And we , the strong South-wind and West-wind , with thrice-doubled fury possessed , Will sweep with you over this city , this Queen of the North and the West ! " VI . Then straight at the great , quiet city , The strong and o'erconfident city , The ruined and tempest-tossed city , Doomed Queen of the North and the West , The Fire-devil rallied his legions , and speeded them forth on the wind , With tinder and treasures before him , with ruins and tempests behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oped wide at his knock ; And walls that had frowned him defiance , they trembled and fell with a shock ; And down on the hot , smoking house-tops came raining a deluge of fire ; And serpents of flame writhed and clambered , and twisted on steeple and spire ; And beautiful , glorious Chicago , the city of riches and fame , Was swept by a storm of destruction , was flooded by billows of flame . The Fire-king loomed high in his glory , with crimson and flame-streaming crest , And grinned his fierce scorn on Chicago , doomed Queen of the North and the West . VII . Then swiftly the quick-breathing city , The fearful and panic-struck city , The startled and fire-deluged city , Rushed back from the South and the West . And loudly the fire-bells were clanging , and ringing their funeral notes ; And loudly wild accents of terror came pealing from thousands of throats ; And loud was the wagon 's deep rumbling , and loud the wheel 's clatter and creak ; And loud was the calling for succor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the hoofs of the horses , and loud was the tramping of feet ; And loud was the gale 's ceaseless howling through fire-lighted alley and street ; But louder , yet louder , the crashing of roofs and of walls as they fell ; And louder , yet louder , the roaring that told of the coming of hell . The Fire-king threw back his black mantle from off his great blood-dappled breast , And sneered in the face of Chicago , the Queen of the North and the West . VIII . And there , in the terrible city , The panic-struck , terror-crazed city , The flying and flame-pursued city , The torch of the North and the West , A beautiful maiden lay moaning , as many a day she had lain , In fetters of wearisome weakness , and throbbings of pitiful pain . The amorous Fire-king came to her  --  he breathed his hot breath on her cheek ; She fled from his touch , but he caught her , and held her , all pulseless and weak . The Fire-king he caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wrapped her about in his vestments , he pressed his hot lips to her face ; Then , sated and palled with his triumph , he scornfully flung her away , And , blackened and crushed in the ruins , unknown and uncoffined , she lay  --  Lay , blackened and crushed by the Fire-king , in ruined and desolate rest , Like ravished and ruined Chicago , the Queen of the North and the West . IX . ' T was morn in the desolate city , The ragged and ruin-heaped city , The homeless and hot-smoking city , The grief of the North and the West . But down from the West came the bidding , " O Queen , lift in courage thy head ! Thy friends and thy neighbors awaken , and hasten , with raiment and bread . " And up from the South came the bidding , " Cheer up , fairest Queen of the Lakes ! For comfort and aid shall be coming from out our savannas and brakes ! " And down from the North came the bidding , " O city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare for thy sufferers , for all of our suffering here ! " And up from the East came the bidding , " O city , be dauntless and bold ! Look hither for food and for raiment  --  look hither for credit and gold ! " And all through the world went the bidding , " Bring hither your choicest and best , For weary and hungry Chicago , sad Queen of the North and the West ! " X. O crushed but invincible city ! O broken but fast-rising city ! O glorious and unconquered city , Still Queen of the North and the West ! The long , golden years of the future , with treasures increasing and rare , Shall glisten upon thy rich garments , shall twine in the folds of thy hair ! From out the black heaps of thy ruins new columns of beauty shall rise , And glittering domes shall fling grandly our nation 's proud flag to the skies ! From off thy wide prairies of splendor the treasures of autumn shall pour , The breezes shall sweep from the northward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look downward in mercy on those who 've passed under the rod , And happ'ly again they will prosper , and bask in the blessings of God . Once more thou shalt stand mid the cities , by prosperous breezes caressed , O grand and unconquered Chicago , still Queen of the North and the West ! Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE RAILROAD HOLOCAUST . New Hamburg , N. Y. , February , 1871. from Farm legends 1887 Over the length of the beaten track , Into the darkness deep and black , Heavy and fast As a mountain blast , With scream of whistle and clang of gong , The great train rattled and thundered along . Travelers , cushioned and sheltered , sat , Passing the time with doze and chat ; Thinking of naught With danger fraught ; Whiling the hours with whim and song , As the great train rattled and thundered along . Covered and still the sleepers lay , Lost to the dangers of the way ; Wandering back , Adown life 's track , A thousand dreamy scenes among ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of care ; Lightly slept the maiden fair ; And the mother pressed Unto her breast Her beautiful babes , with yearning strong ; And the great train rattled and thundered along . Shading his eyes with his brawny hand , Danger ahead the driver scanned ; And he turned the steam ; For the red light 's gleam Flashed warning to him there was something wrong ; But the great train rattled and thundered along . " Down the brakes ! " rang the driver 's shout : " Down the brakes ! " sang the whistle out : But the speed was high , And the danger nigh , And Death was waiting to build his pyre ; And the train dashed into a river of fire . Into the night the red flames gleamed ; High they leaped and crackled and streamed : And the great train loomed , Like a monster doomed , In the midst of the flames and their ruthless ire  --  In the murderous tide of a river of fire . Roused the sleeper within his bed : A crash , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweltering heat Of his winding-sheet Clung round his form , with an agony dire ; He moaned and died in a river of fire . And they who were spared from the fearful death , Thanked God for life , with quickened breath , And groaned that too late , From a terrible fate To rescue their comrades was their desire , Ere they sunk in a river of death and fire . Pity for them who , helpless , died , And sunk in the river 's merciless tide : And blessings infold The driver bold , Who , daring for honor , and not for hire , Went down with his train in the river of fire .

They say she 's coming in her sleep  --  a sleep they can not break ; Ay , let them call , and let them weep , in dull and droning fashion ! Her ear may hear their doleful tones an age and never wake ; But let me pour into its depth my words of burning passion ! Ay , let my hot and yearning lips , that long have yearned in vain , But press her pure and sacred cheek , and wander in her tresses And let my tears no more be lost , but on her forehead rain , And she will rise and pity me , and soothe me with caresses ; So let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wove us in one heart !

II . They brought her me  --  they brought her me  --  they bore her to my bed ; And first I marked her coffin 's form , and saw its jewels glisten .

But bear me , beat me , dash me to the land of Death , and then I 'll find the love Death stole from me , and scorn him with my wooing ! Oh , I will light his gloomy orbs with jealous , mad surprise ; Oh , I will crush his pride , e'en with the lack of my endeavor ; The while I boldly bear away , from underneath his eyes , The soul that God had made for me  --  to lose no more forever ; Ay , she will go with me .

Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE LITTLE SLEEPER . from Farm legends 1887 There is mourning in the cottage as the twilight shadows fall , For a little rose-wood coffin has been brought into the hall , And a little pallid sleeper , In a slumber colder , deeper Than the days of life could give her , in its narrow borders lies , With the sweet and changeful lustre ever faded from her eyes . Since the morning of her coming , but a score of suns had set , And the strangeness of the dawning of her life is with her yet ; And the dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smiling bears the traces of a shadow of surprise ; But the wondering mind that made it looks no more from out her eyes .

They will bury her the morrow ; they will mourn her as she died ; I will bury her the morrow , and another by her side ; For the raven hair , but started , Soon a maiden would have parted , Full of fitful joy and sorrow  --  gladly gay and sadly wise ; With a dash of worldly mischief in her deep and changeful eyes . I will bury her the morrow , and another by her side : It shall be a wife and mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , and of misgiving ; Of the joys and griefs of living ; Of the pains of others ' being , and the tears of others ' cries ; With the love of God encompassed in her smiling , weeping eyes .

I will joy for her to-morrow , as I see her compassed in ; For the lips now pure and holy might be some time stained with sin ; And the brow now white and stainless , And the heart now light and painless , Might have throbbed with guilty passion , and with sin-encumbered sighs Might have surged the sea of brightness in the sweet and changeful eyes . Let them bury her to-morrow  --  let them treasure her away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body back to clay ; Let the future grief here hidden , Let the happiness forbidden , Be for evermore forgotten , and be buried as it dies ; And an angel let us see her , with our sad and weeping eyes .

From out the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It beats against my fragile door , It creeps across my cheerless floor ; And through my pantry , void of fare , And o'er my hearth , so cold and bare , The wind is blowing ; And she who rests her weary head Upon our hard and scanty bed , Prays hopefully , but hopeless still , For bright spring days and whip-poor-will ; The damp of death is at her brow , The frost is at her feet ; and now ' T is drearily snowing . FIRST VOICE . Hurra ! ' t is snowing ! Snow on ! ye can not stop our ride , As o'er the white-paved road we glide : Past forest trees thick draped with snow , Past white-thatched houses , quaint and low ; Past rich-stored barn and stately herd , Past well-filled sleigh and kindly word , Right gayly going ! Snow on ! for when our ride is o'er , And once again we reach the door , Our well-filled larder shall provide , Our cellar-doors shall open wide ; And while without ' t is cold and drear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although ' t is snowing ! SECOND VOICE . Good God ! ' t is snowing ! Rough men now bear , with hurried tread , My pauper wife unto her bed ; And while , all crushed , but unresigned , I cringe and follow close behind , And while these scalding , bitter tears  --  The first that stain my manhood years  --  Are freely flowing , Her waiting grave is open wide , And into it the snow-flakes glide . A mattress for her couch they wreathe ; And snow above , and snow beneath , Must be the bed of her who prayed The sun might shine where she was laid ; And still ' t is snowing ! Poems of Hope . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : SOME TIME . from Farm legends 1887 O strong and terrible Ocean , O grand and glorious Ocean , O restless , stormy Ocean , a million fathoms o'er ! When never an eye was near thee to view thy turbulent glory , When never an ear to hear thee relate thy endless story , What didst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , With never a bark to fear thee , and never a soul to dare ? " Oh , I was the self-same Ocean , The same majestic Ocean , The strong and terrible Ocean , with rock-embattled shore ; I threw my fleecy blanket up over my shoulders bare , I raised my head in triumph , and tossed my grizzled hair ; For I knew that some time  --  some time  --  White-robed ships would venture from out of the placid bay , Forth to my heaving bosom , my lawful pride or prey ; I knew that some time  --  some time  --  Lordly men and maidens my servile guests would be , And hearts of sternest courage would falter and bend to me . " O deep and solemn Forest , O sadly whispering Forest , O lonely moaning Forest , that murmureth evermore ! When never a footstep wandered across thy sheltered meadows , When never a wild bird squandered his music ' mid thy shadows , What didst thou then , O Forest ? Didst robe thyself in green , And pride thyself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the self-same Forest , The same low-whispering Forest , The softly murmuring Forest , and all of my beauties wore . I dressed myself in splendor all through the lonely hours ; I twined the vines around me , and covered my lap with flowers ; For I knew that some time  --  some time  --  Birds of beautiful plumage would flit and nestle here ; Songs of marvelous sweetness would charm my listening ear ; I knew that some time  --  some time  --  Lovers would gayly wander ' neath my protecting boughs , And into the ear of my silence would whisper holy vows . " O fair and beautiful Maiden , O pure and winsome Maiden , O grand and peerless Maiden , created to adore ! When no love came to woo thee that won thy own love-treasure , When never a heart came to thee thy own heart-wealth could measure , What didst thou then , O Maiden ? Didst smile as thou smilest now , With ne'er the kiss of a lover upon thy snow-white brow ? " Oh , I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and careless Maiden , with all of my love in store . I gayly twined my tresses , and cheerfully went my way ; I took no thought of the morrow , and cared for the cares of the day ; For I knew that some time  --  some time  --  Into the path of my being the Love of my life would glide , And we by the gates of heaven would wander side by side . " Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE GOOD OF THE FUTURE . from Farm legends 1887 Why is the mire in the trodden street , And the dark stream by the sewer borne , Spurned from even under our feet , Grudged by us e'en the look of scorn ? There is fresh grass in its gloom  --  There are sweetness and bloom ; There is pulse for men to eat  --  There are golden acres of wheat . But so it is , and hath ever been : The good of the future is e'er unseen . Why is the mud of humanity spurned E'en from the tread of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare feet and the downcast eye ? There is virtue yet to spring From this poor trodden thing ; There are germs of godlike power In the trials of this hour ; But so it is , and hath ever been : The man of the future is e'er unseen . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE JOYS THAT ARE LEFT . from Farm legends 1887 If the sun have been gone while we deemed it might shine ; If the day steal away with no hope-bearing sign ; If the night , with no sight of its stars or its moon , But such clouds as it hath , closes down on our path over-dark and o'er soon ; If a voice we rejoice in its sweetness to hear , Breathe a strain for our pain that glides back to our ear ; If a friend mark the end of a page that was bright , Without pretext or need , by some reptile-like deed that coils plain in our sight ; If life 's charms in our arms grow a-tired and take wing ; If the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home sink in gloom that we labored to save , And the garden we trained , when its best bloom is gained , be enriched by a grave ; Shall we deem that life 's dream is a toil and a snare ? Shall we lie down and die on the couch of despair ? Shall we throw needless woe on our sad heart bereft ? Or , grown tearfully wise , look with pain-chastened eyes at the joys that are left ? For the tree that we see on the landscape so fair , When we his to it nigh , may be fruitless and bare ; While the vine that doth twine ' neath the blades of the grass , With sweet nourishment rife , holds the chalice of life toward our lips as we pass . So with hope let us grope for what joys we may find ; Let not fears , let not tears make us heedless or blind ; Let us think , while we drink the sweet pleasures that are , That in sea or in ground many gems may be found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have suffered in vain , There be smiles whose pure wiles may yet banish our pain ; And the heaven to us given may be found ere we die ; For God 's glory and grace , and His great holy place , are not all in the sky . Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : WHEN MY SHIP WENT DOWN . from Farm legends 1887 I. Sank a palace in the sea , When my ship went down ; Friends whose hearts were gold to me  --  Gifts that ne'er again can be  --  ' Neath the waters brown . There you lie , O Ship , to-day , In the sand-bar stiff and gray ! You who proudly sailed away From the splendid town . II . Now the ocean 's bitter cup Meets your trembling lip ; Now on deathly woes you sup ; And your humbled pride looks up From Disaster 's grip . Ruin 's nets around you weave ; But I have no time to grieve ; I will promptly , I believe , Build another ship .

That voice glides over Erie 's stormy edge  --  It climbs the Alleghanies ' rugged ledge , And tarries not for dale or mountain crest , Till it makes music in my own home-nest . It says , " We would be better , wiser , truer , Each day we live ; the best that is in us , We aim to nourish , that it may endure , And pray that God will help our striving thus . With reason-builded curiousness we yearn The depths of history 's changing tides to learn ; The weird discoveries that proud science made , And the pen 's song  --  we ask them all for aid . " The old town marches eastward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all are here ; Again its busy streets encompass me  --  Their outlines never looked so full and clear . Shop , factory , office , church and clattering mill ; The trim red school-house smiling from the hill ; The mimic river with its placid tide , The quaint old graveyard lingering by its side ; And all the home-made dramas of the past , Are acted over with a mellower grace ; The wedding-bells that rang so loud and fast  --  The sombre funeral , with its village pace ; The young full-blooded boys that roamed the street ; The old men Death was walking out to meet ; The good grandames whose gossip whipped the hours ; The girls with faces stolen from the flowers ; Those forms I knew , in reappearing hosts , Crowd every corner , as on gala days ; They throng the mind  --  these silent memory-ghosts , Then sadly smile , and vanish from the gaze . And some I loved beyond all words ' control , And some I hated with an uncurbed soul ( For he who likes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toil , and love , and fight his way ) . All this was for the best ; and now in love We look at those who once awakened ire ; If we but lift our hearts and souls above , The crushing waves will only lift us higher . Ere you once more return to shadow-land , Dead friend  --  dead foe  --  I clasp you by the hand ! It may be now that you on whom I call , Look at the earth-feuds as exceeding small ! And now there float to me some words of cheer , From yonder region where the sun goes down ; From kindred souls , whose presence would be dear  --  From the loved living of my native town ! To prove once more an old truth it may serve , That God e'er gives men more than they deserve , That ' mid the struggles of your lofty aim , You look this way and call to me by name . Ah , would that I were worthy of the task , To see that all your diamonds were saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ask  --  To give to others what himself has craved . Whoe'er can teach you life 's most brilliant art , To make the most of body , mind , and heart  --  Will feel that fact , his inmost being bless , More than the costliest jewels of success ! Sometimes there comes a blessed word of cheer From yonder region where the sun shines high ; It brings a joy , it casts out every fear ; It is the motto of th ' eternal sky ! Be true , be brave , be faithful ; let your heart With worldly joys and sorrows take their part ; While brain and soul cling to the gleaming cars Whose goal is Heaven  --  whose stations are the stars . Volume section Carleton , Will , 1845-1912 : THE SANCTUM KING . from Farm legends 1887 End note : 1Kb If one who , midst alternate joy and care , Has occupied an editorial chair , Has solved some mysteries that its methods take , And learned how easy papers are to make , Has undergone from friends much mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , Has heard from them how papers should be run , How things they never have to do , are done , Has wrestled , in a match he could not shirk , With the world , flesh , and  --  lad of general work  --  But now , grown poor , has left for some time-space , The hard , but weirdly fascinating place  --  If such an one may use , not seeming free , The editorial and fraternal " We , " And , speaking to this band without offense , May use his us-ship in the present tense , Then , let us , with your kind permission , sing A note or two about The Sanctum King . But first the question , who this king of fame ? Whence comes his power , and what may be his name ? With modesty peculiar to the race , No editor pretends to fill that place ; For editors , be rulers as they will , Are greatly ruled by their surroundings still ; All men and things , to some extent , control The journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a host ; So what we seek , is , That which rules him most ; What of all men and things that ' gainst him press , Bears most upon his failure or success ? Upon this ground , what man , or beast , or thing , Can claim the title of The Sanctum King ? Is it the Pen ? O Pen ! we hear thy praise , Wherever Mind has walked its devious ways ! Thought has been born , in every land and age Where thy thin lips have kissed the virgin page ! ' T was thee Dan Chaucer used , in time agone , To goad the Canterbury pilgrims on ; From thee Ben Jonson filled with gold the air , And made his name a jewel rich and " rare ; " Of thee The Shakespeare , in his soul sublime , Forged for himself a sceptre , for all time ; With thee bold Milton groped , his eyes thick sealed , And wrote his name on Heaven 's own battle-field ; Thee , Robert Burns , voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong ; Thee , Thomas Moore  --  his soul to music set  --  Made to an Irish harp that echoes yet ; With thee Longfellow struck a home-made lyre , And wrote " America , " in lines of fire ! Through thy sharp , quivering point , words have been given , Out of the flaming lexicons of Heaven ! O Pen ! When in the old-time school-house , we Strove , ' neath our teacher 's rod , to master thee , And , twisting down upon some sad old desk , With doleful air and attitude grotesque , And with protruding tongue and beating heart , Took our first lessons in the graphic art , And that old copy on the paper poured , Saying , " The Pen is mightier than the Sword , " And then , from sudden and dynamic stroke , The pen we leaned on , into fragments broke , Some angel told our inexperienced youth , That , after all , that copy told the truth ! O Pen ! What if thy paper purses hold Some coin that never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reams on reams Of manuscript , to trouble printers ' dreams ! What if thy cheap and easy-wielded prongs , Indite each year a hundred thousand songs , In ink of various copiousness and shade  --  On every subject Earth and Heaven have made ! What if thou shovest ' neath the printer 's nose , Cords of mis-spelled , unpunctuated prose ! What if , picked from the wing of senseless goose , Thou'rt still by that loud biped oft in use ! Thou'rt sometimes plucked from Wisdom 's glittering wing ; And yet we can not hail thee Sanctum King ! Is it The Pencil ? Sad would be the lot Of any sanctum where this help were not ! Turn , Faber , in thy half-forgotten grave , And see the branches of thy bay-tree wave ! See Dickens , still by glory 's wreaths untouched , Pencil ' twixt first and second fingers clutched , Transcribing , in his nervous , dashing way , The parliamentary rubbish of the day !

See Prentice , thorny genius , using it For the electric charges of his wit ; See Saxe from mountain eyries take his flight , His wings with editorial radiance bright ; See Whittier  --  angels spare him long to men !  --  Whose pencil served apprentice to his pen ; See Taylor , travelling many a useful mile , Grasp a reporter 's pencil all the while ; See Holland  --  sweetly noble household name  --  Lean on the pencil , on his way to fame ; See , bending the reporter 's page above , Artemus Ward  --  light laughter 's dearest love !

That statesman , who unflinching can withstand His foeman 's broadsides , with brave self-command , That lawyer , who can bully at the bar Judge , witness , jury  --  no odds who they are  --  That doctor , who has sallied forth thro ' storms , To fight with Death , in all his moods and forms , That general , who , when battle-banners wave , Can spur his foaming charger toward the grave , All these , when interviewers near them glide , Sometimes , like startled children , run and hide . Yes , Pencil , thou art potent in thy sting ! And yet we can not hail thee Sanctum King . Rise up , John Guttenberg , from lands remote , And let us hear thy guttural German throat ; Now that the harvest that thou sowedst is ripe , Make prominent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like treasures from the main , Out of the deep abysses of thy brain ! Old jeweller , Heaven grant thou knowest yet , What diamonds thine aching fingers set ! Wherever Mind once groped in halls of night , They flashed and flared their weird electric light ; Wherever Thought has lit its streaming flame , They spell the letters of thy awkward name ! When first the office boy assails the " case , " With " stick " and " rule " held awkwardly in place , When through his " copy " timidly he spells , Thrusting his fingers knee-deep in the cells , And draws the type forth , looking , when ' t is done , In each one 's face , to see if that 's the one ; When , raising them and holding them aloof , Ere putting them to most outrageous proof , He drops the whole into a shapeless " pi , " And looks at them forlornly , as they lie , Little he knows , amid his small turmoils , The nature of those things , ' mid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still he stands , He may have dropped an empire from his hands ! Yes , Type , thy voice is loud , for war or peace ; Its mighty influence nevermore may cease ; Unnumbered happenings from thy efforts spring ; And yet , we can not hail thee Sanctum King ! What then strikes most our failure or success ? Is it the strong and swiftly whirling Press ? Improved by rare Ben Franklin 's earliest art ( God bless his dear old sweet progressive heart ! The patron saint of printers let him stand , Ever  --  in every English-speaking land ! ) . Is it the Press , made multiform by Hoe , Who lives , the triumph of his brain to know , And views his monster proudly , as it drips Fresh news from off its tapering finger-tips ? Far can the Press its many mandates fling ; And yet we can not hail it Sanctum King ! Who then this Sanctum King , of mighty fame ? Is it that lad of uncelestial name , Who , like the wretch whose title he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quaffs , with surly , mock-respectful stare , The surplus blueness of the office air ? Who all our secrets in a week doth know ; Whose brain is active as his feet are slow ? Who pleads from every negligence or trick , With tongue as agile as his hands are thick ? Who creeps the editor 's seclusion near , And yells for " copy ! " in his weakest ear ? Who when on errands swiftly sent , would spurn To embarrass you by an o'er-quick return ; And creeps along his course , when under sail , Like an old fish-boat , beating ' gainst a gale ? Who some day , if his brilliant hopes be sound , May mount The Great Profession 's topmost round , But who , by undue energy uncursed , Is climbing very moderately at first ? Pity the devil ! for he much endures ! He has his griefs , as well as you have yours . If " Uncle Toby , " for his good heart famed , Pitied the one for whom the boy was named , Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poor blundering boy himself . The day may not be very far ahead , When he his genius on our craft will shed ; Will all at once develop hidden worth , And as a full-fledged editor come forth . Let us then justice to this poor boy bring , Call him  --  say  --  Sanctum Prince  --  not quite a King . Paste-pot and scissors ! raise thy sticky hands , And make on us imperial demands ! Not over-often comes the day or hour We 're not indebted to thy magic power ; To all of us the obligation clings ; Thou art our foragers  --  but not our kings ! Is it that " friend , " whom editors adore , Who calls " a minute " of three hours or more , Who occupies the easiest vacant chair , With large amounts of time and tongue to spare ? Who opens our exchanges , one by one , And reads our editorials ere they 're done ? Who gives us items , sparkling , fresh , and new , But ne'er , by any turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing makes , And tenderly announces our mistakes ? Who occupies , with sweet , unconscious air , Three-fourths of all the room we have to spare , And with a cheerful , love-begetting smile , Kills his own time , and murders us meanwhile ? Who shows us , with unnecessary pains , The sharp things that some other sheet contains ? Who hands us every word , from far and near , That he against our enterprise can hear ? Sweet are the consolations he can bring ; And yet we can not call him Sanctum King ! Who then , or what , this king of mighty fame ? Whence comes his power , and what may be his name ? May we not , with some show of truthful grace , Put The Waste Basket in that honored place ? The question ' mongst good talkers , day by day , Should be , what is it wisest not to say ? The question with good workers who 'd be true , Should be , what is it wisest not to do ? The minister his judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach ; The editor should study , without stint , What articles ' t is wisest not to print ; And so I ask , the question home to bring  --  Is The Waste Basket not The Sanctum King ? Great treasurer of literary gems ! Casket of unsuspected diadems ! Sad cemetery , where in dreamless sleep , Some millions of bright hopes lie buried deep ! Joy to the editor , who , keen of sight , Knows his Waste Basket how to use aright ; Who marks its prudent counsels , day by day , And rules himself its mandates to obey ! Prints no cheap advertisement for a song , But straight inserts them  --  where the things belong ; Kills those communications whose sour fruit Would probably have been  --  a libel suit ; Rejects that trash his desk so often finds , Unfit to set before his readers ' minds ; And sends the scum of malice , filth and spite , To be made into paper , pure and white ! Let The Waste Basket 's countless merits ring ; But still it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if none of those of which I speak , Is vested with the qualities we seek , Let us once more inquire , untouched by blame , Who is this wondrous king , of mighty fame ? List then , while plain his name to you I bring , The Public Heart ! That is The Sanctum King ! Yes , ' mid unceasing worry and turmoil , To serve that Heart , the Editor must toil ; Under Its bidding must his efforts be ; It forms part of " the editorial We . " Why do the papers gossip , would you know ? Because  --  the public ear would have it so . Our journal 's not a favorite breakfast-dish , Unless it gossips to the public wish ; And even they who call " the stuff absurd , " Will sit and groan , and  --  read it every word . Why do we thread men 's motives thro ' and thro ' ? Because our king , The Public , tells us to ! Why do we quote the wedding chimes and hues ? Because our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type on useless stories waste ? To please some portions of the public taste ! Why do we into secret haunts repair ? Because a curious public sends us there ! Why do we tell the crimes of all the lands ? Because The Public Heart their tale demands ! Why are we deep in politics immersed ? Because The Public fought and quarreled first ! Why do we toil with all that we possess ? Because The Public Brain will take no less ! Acknowledged let our proud position be : The Public Heart 's prime-ministers are we ! Men of the Press ! to us is given , indeed , To shape the growing appetites we feed ! We must from day to day and week to week , To elevate our Monarch 's motives seek , That he may , with an open , liberal hand , Higher and higher things of us demand ! So let us cut our own progressive way  --  So onward toil , through darkness and through day ; So let us in our labor persevere , Unspoiled by praise  --  untouched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patient art , The private pocket from The Public Heart ; Learn how to guide that Heart , in every choice , And give its noblest thoughts its purest voice ! Till so The Press The Public Heart may move , That day by day they mutually improve : That high and higher each the other bring , Till God Himself shall be The Sanctum King ! Stray Stanzas .
