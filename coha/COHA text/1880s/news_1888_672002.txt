txt In its article on the financial situation , the Financial Chronicle of yesterday , reviewing the prospects of the money market , remarked very tersely : " The question , therefore , reduces itself down simply to a contest between the Treasury and . the trade demand . " This is a literally true statement , and to every business man who knows how important in all calculations , not only the large ones but the small ones dependent on the large , is the comparative stability of the ' money market , . the situation must seem not merely abnormal and unhealthy , but essentially disgraceful . Whether , the course of the rate for money shall be up or down , and therefore whether immense interests affecting every part of the country shall be prosperous or not , depends not upon the energy or sagacity with which these inteiests are conducted , not upon the success with which the legitimate forces of trade are calculated , but upon the extent to which money canbe got out of the Treasury which never ought to have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remarked , partly upon the wisdom , prudence , and foresight of the Secretary , partly upon limitations : imposed on him by law , partly on the turn of bond speculation in ' which the need of bond . purchases by the Treasury is an always present element . And this monstrous situation , unlike anything that ever existed in a commercial community , is due to one thing only  --  to the obstinacy with which favored capitalists have resisted the reduction of taxation levied not for the needs of the Government , not for public use , but solely and avowedly to give these capitalists advantages in the nature of a monopoly . During the week ending with Friday the purchases of bonds by the Treasury were . as follows : The premiums paid on the 412 per cents ranged from a little under to a little over 7 per cent . and the average price may be taken at 107 . For the 4 per cents the premium was a *little under 30 per cent . The total premium was about $1,850,000 and . the total disbursement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases of $17,050,350 of 412 per cents and of $34,809,400 of 4 per cents , in round . numbers $52,000,000 , on which premiums were paid . of $11,000,000 in round numbers , making a total disbursement in five months of $63,000,000 . Fully onefourth of this has taken place in the last fortnight . There are three general causes for the demand for money for actual circulation during the Autumn , the movement of the cereal crops , the movement of the cotton crop , and the increase in ordinary trade by Fall purchases . Of these only the firsthas been developed as yet to any great extent , the second is in the near future , and the third is gradually increasing . Of currency , which in its various forms is now sound currency , there is an abundance in the country and . there is no immediate possibility apart from the wretched complication caused . by unnecessary taxation , of the creation of any serious artificial obstacle to the free circulation of this currency . It is almost inconceivable that in a professedly free country like our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enterprising commercial community , such an abuse as the forced accumulation of money in the public Treasury should be tolerated , much less that it should be defended by a great political party , under the influence of a class specially favored. by legislation . Yet this is exactly the case to-day . For the disposition of - the surplus the Republican Party has absolutely nothing to propose but - the purchase of bonds not yet due at premiums that have ' steadily advanced . under the policy of . bond purchases . For the prevention of a surplus in the future it has , through its convention , suggested . three things , extravagant expenditure , prohibitory tariff duties , and . free whisky . In other words , anything and everything rather than the reduction of taxes levied to promote monopoly for the favored classes . There is not in the civilized world a Government that would-dare to undertake such a discrimination in the use of the taxing power for the benefit of a special class : There is not an aristocracy in Europe that would dare to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowsubjects . Nowhere is there waged between rulers and , people so one-sided and so unjust a struggle as the " contest between the Treasury and the trade demand " imposed on this country by the small and compact band of capitalists who maintain the protectionist party and . the protectionist lobby .
