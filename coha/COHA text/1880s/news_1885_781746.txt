txt We are sorry to see that Mr. TILDEN 'S eloquent appeal for the old Flag and an Appropriation has been misinterpreted by an irreverent Washington editor in a way to do grievous injustice to its wise and venerable author . This scoffer thus gives vent to his unworthy suspicions : " Mr. BARNUM , of Connecticut , and some of the Democratic statesmen of the thrifty sort who have Mr. TILDEN 'S ear have got an idea that lots of money is to be made out of the construction of heavy guns and the steel for fortifications . They are said to have carefully laid their plans to rake in the millions that are to be got out of this business . Mr. RANDALL , finding out what was going on , has begun to bestir himself to see that Pennsylvania does not get left in the grand distribution of contracts . " This impertinent scrutiny of Mr. TILDEN 'S motives indicates sour distrust of human nature , which is painful , and a willingness to implicate the Sage of Greystone in a job , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were thinking , when he wrote it , of iron or steel or big guns save in a purely abstract way . We believe he respects the Monroe doctrine too much to put it forward as a cover for a fat contract . It is impossible to believe that when he wrote that " a vast supply of machinery and labor called into existence by a great vicissitude in the steel and iron industries offers itself to our service " he was thinking of Mr. BARNUM 'S iron works ; or that his allusion to " the setting in motion of important industries and the giving of employment to labor in a time of severe depression " was the fruit of consultation with Mr. RANDALL about the protected but suffering industries of Pennsylvania . This is not Mr. TILDEN 'S usual manner of approaching a subject . His mind does not work in that way . An open heart is his special vanity , and frankness is his foible . If Mr. TILDEN had been actuated by these hidden and ulterior motives in recommending the expenditure of millions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My friend Mr. BARNUM has unusual facilities for supplying heavy guns and armor of approved patterns , and I have no doubt that the Government could make satisfactory arrangements with him . " We fear that the Washington editor . who has so inconsiderately criticised this statesmanlike letter does not know Mr. TILDEN . The editor of the Sun , who knows him intimately , calls his letter " the voice of a true leader . " " How the pigmies dwindle when the giant speaks , " says the Sun , in a glow of admiration , heightened somewhat by its untempered scorn for the " pigmies " whom the foolish people put in office last year against its earnest protest . " Read Mr. TILDEN 'S letter to Speaker CARLISLE , " continues this enthusiast , " and compare its statesmanlike tone and breadth of view with the utterances of public men and political leaders now in office . " There is nothing like personal acquaintance with the author to bring out the breadth and depth and hidden beauties of a great effort . It is equally absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to tariff revision by inducing Congress to spend the surplus revenues in forts and guns . Mr. TILDEN 'S candor and unaffected honesty of mind will again serve him as a sufficient defense against this mean slur .
