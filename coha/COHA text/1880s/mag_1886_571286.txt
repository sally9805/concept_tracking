ARTICLE 111. - THE FUTURE OF REFORM . THE unexpected discovery that the vast accumulation of power lodged with a civilized government may be worked as a private enterprise is like the discovery of a new oil-field or gold-bearing territory . There is a sudden rush of adventurers of all races and religions but of one mind about staking out their claims according to the frontier doctrine that the spoils belong to the victors . This preliminary period of tumultuous invasion lasts until the riches at the surface have been exhausted and the pioneer multitude melts away , a good many rather worse off than when they came , some with a modest provision for their old age , and the bonanza-kings with the great prizes to show what an amount of luck and ability is still left in the world . Then comes the period of the cool calculators and patient waiters , the period of capital and organization and trained industry , which sink shafts or wells to the deeper deposits until these peter out or are pumped dry in turn , or perhaps until the rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work it for himself . We have now got well along into this second period of expert and orderly exploitation of the State , and since there are abundant signs that the State is nowhere near the verge of exhaustion , we are so much nearer the return of - the rightful owner . The volume of mendicancy and adventure which poured into the unappropriated territory has been dissipated in the usual way , gone heaven knows where , to farming or trading or banking or preaching or out of existence , and those who remain in the business have set up what the French call the " installation , " that is , the plant or apparatus of a regular industry . They now represent a common interest and constitute a homogeneous and thoroughly organized class , which is as distinguishable as the doctors or the clergy , and grows in the same way , by the slow addition of students and apprentices who must be trained to a difficult profession before they can practice it . There is no longer any mystery about them or the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest . We know who they are and what they want and how they expect to get it . We know , too , that like any other close corporation they must stand or fall together , so that w*ien the time comes they will have , in their own phrase , to " get out of that , " bag and baggage and take their plant with them . This is a very great gain on the inorganic disorder of twenty years ago , and if anybody says that it is mere evolution and not the work of American reason and virtue , I reply that reason and virtue are evolution too , and that the unconscious forces which have brought about this happy advance will bring about the happier consummation . This is not itself reform , any more than a quartz-mill or the Standard Oil Pipe Line is philanthropy and foreign missions , but it is the preparation and pledge of reform . There is another thing . This highly differentiated class is animated with a wondrous fellow-feeling , as any class created by a common overpowering interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture the whole prize in view it goes halves with the other in a fashion to put to shame all the churches in the land . It will " divvy up " any day and anywhere in order to conquer . Nowhere perhaps with so much fraternal effusion as in particular localities like the city of New York ; but wherever it is necessary and there is enough to go round . Un . luckily by a peculiarity of party government , the federal power of the United States , although vast enough to satisfy everybody , will hot go round at all . It must be all one thing for the time being or all the other , all Democratic or all IRepublican . It may however be first one thing and then the other , ad indefinitum , and so the coufraternity whose lineage , habits , sympathies , and ends are the same , whose natural policy is alliance against the outsiders , is divided in the middle by this indivisible object of contention , and condemned to all the horrors of fratricidal strife . Instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , there are two , one paramount in the Democratic party , one in the Republican ; both " naturally selected " and distinguishable from the mass of the community*by the hall-mark of the machine , but each compelled to make on the other the war it would be glad to // make on its natural enemy and prey . Out of these unavoidable collisions arises a great and salutary light . The particular machine which happens to be iu opposition becomes , however reluctantly , the merciless and unanswerable critic of the one in. power . It can not possibly be blinded or thrown off the scent by any wiles of the administration , for it has the penetrating intelligence of its sympathies and experience . It knows exactly what the most deceptive move on the board means , because that is precisely the move which in the same circumnstances it would have made itself . The public has thus the benefit of a luminous exposure which no simple-minded reformer-who naturally is not up to the game-could pretend to furnish ; and the political education of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a series of object-lessons carefully elucidated by masters of the art . This brings into view another factor of the situation . The time is now over forever when either machine could disguise its real purpose in office by pretending to be anything other than it is . The IRepublican leaders got all the latitude they wanted in the name of the Union they had restored and the slave they had set free , and because they were supposed to be indispensable for the complete pacification of the country . As to the virtues of administration they made no inconvenient professions and were bouTld by no specific contracts whatever ; that was not a mission which had been forced upon them or which they had gone out of their way to assume . They could do what they pleased with the offices and the treasure under cover of imposing pretexts and without violating a single recorded obligation . But the Democratic leaders who have succeeded to their places have not succeeded to their privileges . They ca n't take any liberties on the ground that they are indispensable for purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery or break up the Union , unless they want to do it themselves . These and all other the like public questions which have divided parties hitherto have now disappeared in decisive agreements of the people . The one thing which the Democrats are committed to is the one thing which the Republicans were not , the virtues of administration ; and they are irrevocably committed to that by the fact of haying // beaten the Republicans . We can not invite our neighbors to join us in " turning the rascals out " without pledging ourselves to turn out all rascality , and in particular our own . He who casts the stone says that he is without sin , or anyhow that he is going to be . He may not in the least mean it or mean to be bound by it , but the mere saying so creates a difficulty . lie must expect lapidation in turn if taken afterwards in the act himself . So , to vary the allusion , the Democrats are obliged to play their little game , if they play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors carried in their sleeves . Whatever scrap of the public trust they are caught carrying off for their own consumption must be taken openly , in the face of distinct pledges and without a rag of decent pretence to cover the obscenity of the transaction . This is not now the worst of their case . They have not only their recorded pledges to get out of their way but their own administration , which is forcing the pledges on the attention of all men by valiant efforts to make them good . They may completely paralyze the honest intentions of Mr. Cleveland by practising on his inexperience or by carrying their measures over his veto ; they may even dragoon him into submission and complicity . But what if they do ? The only effect will be to light up the secret character of the machine with the lurid glare of a scandal that has no precedent in our history . For there has never yet been a party kept alive among us without some fibre of sincerity in it and some f ragment of political principle by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere in the matter of administrative reform they are false in everything . This is their cause or they have none , and if they have none they can not endure . They must choose , and choose promptly , between Mr. Cleveland and the return of the Republicans . Will any better choice be open to the Republicans in the event of their return ? They were put out two years ago in spite of their heroic traditions ; they can not now go back again on the strength of them . No amoulit of devotion to a principlc which everybody accepts can avail them any longer . They must conquer in a cause which somebody resists and with which they have been identified in some way , directly or indirectly , // as the party of the opposition . Their ancient majority will drift back to them , as it drifted away , from discontent or listlessness provoked by the party in power ; and coming back will commit them to the pledges the Democrats had given and . violated , that is upon the very question of administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their adversaries will be upon them , only with a clearer definition and a more embarrassing accountability ; if not forced upon them by any growth of political conscience in the people , then by the unreasoning vicissitudes of a conflict which is entrapping them step by step into obligations they must discharge , or renounce with fatal effect . How long this series of alternating monopolies , each victorious in its turn in the name of good government and by virtue of the incompetence and faithlessness of its adversary , will be allowed to go on , we can not of course say . It depends on the inattention or the indifference of the masses still attached in one way or another to the fortunes of the two parties ; that is to say , of the American people as a whole . In France the same sort of thing is chronic and apparently incurable , unless some catastrophe sweeps off the impotent factions as it swept off the monarchy and the empire , and breaks up the abstention of the people by another revolution . In Turkey again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy but foreign conquest and the expulsion of the pashas . As we are hardly reduced to the extremity of Turkish impotence or Gallic unconcern , the interesting point is , that while the process lasts the real character of it is continually coming out in clearer and more convincing light . It has been easy hitherto to bewilder public opinion by letting in the side lights and distracting passions of party strife . It is not even difficult to-day ; but it will be difficult to-morrow and impossible by and bye . As the exhausted controversies and all the confusing accessories of the conflict are cleared away , the real issue will be brought out in perfect definition and forced upon the people . This is manifestly the worst that can happen in the natural and probable course of events . Setting aside the possibility of convulsion from sonic unexpected quarter , some eruption of the anarchic forces which are busy at the foundations of older // communities but which we have never taken serious account of here , we have nothing more formidable before us than the suffering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never failed , so far , to dispose uf an intolerable situation . Now it is the intelligence or instinct of this approaching and inevitable solution , wanting entirely to the listless experiment of Grant and the ostentatious reform of Hayes , which gives significance to the attempt of the present administration . Mr. Curtis , who in many interesting particulars is the Stuart Mill of our recent politics , is apparently of the opinion that Mr. Cleveland may abandon his purpose in the conviction that the country needs the Democratic party and that the party can be held together only by surrender to the machine . It is of course possible ; as I have suggested IMr . Cleveland may fail in any one of a number of ways . But I should think it hardly likely that he would fail in this particular way . He must now be as well aware as even Mr. Curtis that there is a good deal in either party not contained in the machine or governed by it , and that the American people has a corporate existence and a political capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new conception of a body politic which includes all temporary associations for specific purposes but is itself other and greater than they , is , if not the most striking , the most considerable event in our history since the suppression of the rebellion . Mr. Cleveland must be blind indeed if he does not really understand , as he seems to , that he profits by the whole force of it . He has taken his appeal distinctly and consciously to the tribunal of last resort , and must know that nothing now is to be gained , for his country , or his party , or himself , by striking the appeal from the docket . It is evidently easier and safer for him to go ahead , for whatever the immediate fate of his measures , they are the anticipation of a sure event , and what is more , of an event sure to be hastened by the anticipation . His opponents in both parties know it if he does not . This is the explanation of their waning vigor and increased noisiness . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally both exasperated and disheartened that // the Joshua of the occasion does not choose to make the sun stand still over Gibeon until they have got in their crop . But while it is true that the future is certain and that Mr. Cleveland may count upon it , and upon the fact that all mert* are coming to understand it , we must not forget the extreme originality and boldness of what he is attempting to do . This deliberate adoption of a policy which withstands the importunities and the apparent exigencies of the present in the anticipation of final settlements , is , in its kind , new to the executive power of the United States . iMore than one administration has discounted the future and sometimes with a greater audacity , but always , I think , in some sudden emergency and in the way of a surprise , by committing the people in advance of all possibility of controversy to some irrevocable act . Moreover the precedents , such as they are , are not altogether of an encouraging kind . The purchase of Louisiana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government which we now accept philosophically , and because we can not help ourselves , as a reasonable trust in the manifest destiny of the nation . But the same initiative came to grief in the matter of San Domingo , for the very good reason that manifest destiny depends very much on the conception the nation forms of it , and that the conception has changed . We have got , for the present at least , the frontiers we require , as we have the constituency and the institutions , and it will not do for any administration to risk adventure in these directions . On the whole our experience accords with our theory of the State , that the executive is only the instrument of the will of the people as already expressed in the law , and of that of the majority expressed in some proposal to modify the law . The right of innovation exists , but it belongs properly to the party which has obtained possession of the government in the regular manner for the purpose of innovation . It is not intended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of the principal , to inaugurate on his own motion a public policy which no party demands and upo*m which the people has not divided . It may be the daring of supreme intelligence and virtue , founded upon a sure provision of ultimate results , but // the effect of precipitating the issue out of its time must be to delay the decisive settlement by the people . The proclamation of Emancipation succeeded because it was well timed . It hastened the event because appropriate to the circi*mstances and backed by a sufficient public opinion . But it would have been brutum fulmen et vctnum in 1861 , and a revolution before the war . Such is the mechanism and such the processes of representative and party government . There are certain purposes of the undivided people which have authoritative expression in the constitution and laws of the State ; these it is the business of the executive to give effect to as they stand . There are certain other things still in dispute but maintained by the party as its distinctive doctrine ; these it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward by all proper means . No other way is known to the theory by which the fund of constitutional agreements can be retrenched , modified , or increased ; and for the individual who happens to be chief executive to substitute even his wisdom for the folly of the people or the party , is usurpation . Supposing then the Democratic professions in the matter of reform to be sheer hypocrisy , that the real intention is to use the State as the Republicans had done with the acquiescence of the people for twenty years , it may reasonably be asked what right Mr. Cleveland has , in his quality of Chief Executive , to be any wiser or purer than his party is . The answer brings out the peculiarity which distinguishes this issue from all others that have gone before it . The simple truth of course is that the thing ought never to have been made an issue at all . The question ought never to have been raised whether the collective power of the people should be used for the benefit of the people , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact the Republicans have prostituted the offices and the treasure of the State to partizan and personal service and if it is now the purpose of the Democrats to do the same , if this has become the standing policy of governing bodies and is supported by the parties behind them , all we can say is that this is itself an initiative of the most presumptuous and unprineipled character . No consensus of public opinion can make it anything // else than an insolent innovation . The Executive who refuses to submit to it is not guilty of a reckless initiative of his own or , in the true political meaning of the word , of any initiative whatever . It is Mr. Cleveland 's duty , ex oftiejo , not to be as good as his party or his generation , but to be absolutely good . That his administration should be perfectly virtuous is essential to the ends of administration and implied in the fact that he is chosen to administer . If he asks anybody 's permission to be faithful or is constrained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is of record in the elementary stipulations of his trust . No matter what net-work of party obligations has been thrown around him , that is what the Executive of the United States is there for , to fill the public offices and spend the public treasure and transact the public business exclusively for the benefit of the public . It is absurd to reproach him with presumption , to imagine that he is taking dangerous risks , because he abides by the constitution under which he was chosen and the bare axioms of the place he holds . It happens by shameful accidents of the time and place to be a very original and daring thing to do , instead of being commonplace and a matter of course as it ought to be ; but it is not innovation and adventure . In these considerations again is the sufficient excuse of the unusual course adopted by the Independents . They have been accused of an unprincipled readiness to support anybody , Republican or Democratic , who seemed likely to satisfy their particular demands ; nor is it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been equivocal to the last degree . Were the two political parties divided , as they alw*tys have been hitherto , upon any question of real political import , no devotion to the cause they have at heart could justify the supreme indifference to party distinctions . We can not innocently sacrifice one conviction to another ; it is our duty , sometimes a difficult one , to be on the right side of all contemporary issues . The answer of the Independents is , that the parties are now indistinguishable in character and principle and that the only question before the country is the question of administrative reform . Then , the retort is , why do you // not shake off their dust from your feet and found a party of your own , as all reformers have done before you . Instead of passing from one unprincipled host to the other according to the vicissitudes of the situation , why do you not siiow the courage of your convictions and appeal to the country to sustain them . The reason why is very obvious . It ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of this sort than on the seventh commandment or the laws of gravity or the multiplication table . It is absurd that anybody in a civilized community of our time should be called on to found a party for the purpose of binding parties to honest administration of a common trust . Parties are founded upon the opposing alternatives of some public question in controversy , to make good some doctrine which men are not yet agreed upon and may honestly withstand . But the conditions upon which the trust of public power is confided to the trustees are the same for all parties and have passed out of the region of honest or even rational controversy long ago . That a community of fifty or sixty millions should be carried through the elaborate and costly processes of a political controversy for the purpose of ascertaining and settling them is a preposterous anachronism and a reproach upon our civilization . The party in power should be peremptorily recalled to them without further ceremony or the benefit of an appeal to the constituency . And if it refuses to obey it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Independents therefore were perfectly right in attempting their reform within the precincts and by means of the Republican organization while it held the government ; when the experiment failed they were perfectly right in helping the Democrats elect Mr. Cleveland . It is now their duty to sustain him with all the resources at their command . If he fails to get the better of the factions around him , then very likely it will be their duty to bring back the Republicans . Only it must be observed that this sort of thing can not go on forever . The time will arrive when by shifting the possession of public power from one party to the other the right kind of an administration will have been secured , or the irreclaimable perversity // of both parties definitely ascertained . In the latter event the course of duty , and of necessity , will be perfectly clear . The appeal must be taken to the country by a party formed for that express purpose ; and the people must take the trouble to make* up its mind whether the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be prostituted any longer to selfish uses or not ; whether it intends to remain an honest democracy or to give itself up to corrupt and chaotic despotism .
