STUDIES OF TIlE GREAT WEST . By CIIARLES DUDLEY WARNER . 1. -A FAR AND FAIR COUNTRY . LEWIS and Clarke , sent out by Mr. Jefferson in 1804 to discover the Northwest by the route of the Missouri River , left the town of St. Charles early in the spring , sailed and poled and dragged their boats up the swift , turbulent , and treacherous stream all summer , wintered with the Mandan Indians , and reached the Great Falls of the Missouri in about a year and a quarter from the beginning of their voyage . Now , when we wish to rediscover this interesting country , which is still virgin land , we lay down a railway track in the spring and summer , and go over there in the autumn in a palace-car  --  a much more expeditious and comfortable mode of exploration . In beginning a series of observations // and comments upon Western life it is proper to say that the reader is not to expect exhaustive statistical statements of growth or development , nor descriptions , except such as will illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great West . Materialism is the most obtrusive feature of a cursory observation , but it does not interest one so much as the forces that underlie it , the enterprise and the joyousness of conquest and achievement that it stands for , or the finer processes evolved in the marvellous building up of new societies . What is the spirit . what is the civilization of the West ? I have not the presumption to expect to answer these large questions to any one 's satisfaction-least of all to my own-but if I may be permitted to talk about them familiarly , in the manner that one speaks to his friends of what interested him most in a journey , and with flexibility in passing from one topic to another , I shall hope to contribute something to a better understanding between the territories of a vast empire . How vast this republic is , no one can at all appreciate who does not actually travel over its wide areas . To many of us the West is still the West of the geographies of thirty years ago ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have any adequate conception of what lies west of Chicago and St. Louis : perhaps a hazy geographical notion of it , but not the faintest idea of its civilization and society . Now a good understanding of each other between the great sections of the republic is politically of the first importance . We shall hang together as a nation ; blood , relationship , steel rails , navigable waters , trade , absence of natural boundaries , settle that . We shall pull and push and grumble , we shall vituperate each other , parties will continue to make capital out of sectional prejudice , and wantonly inflame it ( what a pitiful sort of " politics " that is ! ) , but we shall stick together like wax . Still , anything like smooth working of our political machine depends upon good understanding between sections . And the remark applies to East and West as well as to North and South . It is a common remark at the West that " Eastern people know nothing about us ; they think us half civilized " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a waxing feeling of superiority over the East in force and power . One would not say that repose as yet goes along with this sense of great capacity and great achievement ; indeed , it is inevitable that in a condition of development and of quick growth unparalleled in the history of the world there should be abundant self-assertion and even monumental boastfulness . When the Western man goes East he carries the consciousness of playing a great part in the making of an empire his horizon is large ; but he finds himself surrounded by an atmosphere of indifference or non-comprehension of the prodigiousness of his country , of incredulity as- to the refinement and luxury of his civilization ; and self-assertion is his natural defence . This longitudinal incredulity and swagger is a curious phenomenon . London thinks New York puts on airs , New York complains of Chicago 's want of modesty , Chicago can see that Kansas City and Omaha are aggressively boastful , and these cities acknowledge the expansive self-appreciation of Denver and Helena . Does going West work a radical diffei*-ence in a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same piece of cloth . The Western man is the Eastern or the Southern man let loose , with his leadingstrings cut . But the change of situation creates immense diversity in interests and in spirit . One has but to take up any of the great newspapers , say in St. Paul or Minneapolis , to be aware that he is in another world of ideas , of news , of interests . The topics that most interest the East he does not find there , nor much of its news . Persons of whom he reads daily in the East drop out of sight , and other persons , magnates in politics , packing , railways , loom up . It takes columns to tell the daily history of places which have heretofore only caught the attention of the Eastern reader for freaks of the thermometer , and he has an opportunity to read daily pages about Dakota , concerning which a weekly paragraph has formerly satisfied his curiosity . Before he can be absorbed in these lively and intelligent newspapers he must change the whole current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , and places than those that have occupied his mind . He is in a new world . One of the most striking facts in the West is State pride , attachment to the State , the profound belief of every citizen // that his State is the best . Engendered perhaps at first by a permanent investment and the spur of self-interest , it speedily becomes a passion ; as strong in the newest State as it is in any one of the original thirteen . Rivalry between cities is sharp , and civic pride is excessive , but both are outdone by the larger devotion to the commonwealth . And this pride is developed in the inhabitants of a Territory as soon as it is organized . Montana has condensed the ordinary achievements of a century into twenty years , and loyalty to its present and expectation of its future are as strong in its citizens as is the attachment of men of Massachusetts to the Sta.te of nearly three centuries of growth . In Nebraska I was pleased with the talk of a clergyman who had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was full of his novel experiences ; he had greatly enjoyed the trip ; but he was glad to get back to Nebraska and its full , vigorous life . In England and on the Continent he had seen much to interest him ; but he could not help comparing Europe with Nebraska ; and as for him , this was the substance of it : give him Nebraska every time . What astonished him most , and wounded his feeling ( and there was a note of pathos in his statement of it ) , was the general foreign ignorance abroad about Nebraska - the utter failure in the European mind to take it in . I felt guilty , for to me it had been little more than a geographical expression , and I presume the Continent did not know whether Nebraska was a new kind of patent medicine or a new sort of religion . To the clergyman this ignorance of the central , richest , **29;150;TOOLONG of States , was simply incredible . This feeling is not only admirable in itself , but it has an incalculable political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little haze as to the limitations of Federal power , and a notion that the Constitution was swaddling-clothes for an infant , which manly limbs may need to kick off . Healthy and even assertive State pride is the only possible counterbalance in our system against that centralization which tends to corruption in the centre and weakness and discontent in the individual members . It should be added that the West , speaking of it generally , is defiantly " Amencan. ' * It wants a more vigorous and assertive foreign policy . Conscious of its power , the growing pains in the limbs of the young giant will not let it rest . That this is the most magnificent country , that we have the only government beyond criticisin , that our civilization is far and away the best , does not admit of doubt . It is refreshing to see men who believe in something heartily and without reserve , even if it is only in themselves . There is a tonic in this challenge of all time and history . A certain attitude of American assertion toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late representatives to Great Britain are said to be un-American ; " political dudes " is what the Governor of Nebraska calls them . It is his indictment against the present minister to St. James that " he is numerous in his visits to the castles of English noblemen , and profuse in his obsequiousness to British aristocrats . " And perhaps the Governor speaks for a majority of Western voters and fighters when he says that " timidity has characterized our State Department for the last twenty years . " By chance I begin these Western studies with the Northwest . Passing by for the present the intelligent and progressive State of Wisconsin , we will consider Minnesota and the vast region at present more or less tributary to it . It is necessary to remember that the State was admitted to the Union in 1858 , and that its extraordinary industrial development dates from the building of the first railway in its limits-ten miles from St. Paul to St. Anthony-in 1862 . For this road the first stake was driven and the first shovelful of earth lifted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State gridironed with railways , and whose firm constructed in 1887 over eleven hundred miles of railroad . It is unnecessary to dwell upon the familiar facts that Minnesota is a great wheat State , and that it is intersected by railways that stimulate the enormous yield and market it with facility . The discovery that the State , especially the Red River Valley , and Dakota and the country beyond , were peculiarly adapted to the production of hard spring-wheat , which is the most desirable for flour , probably gave this vast region its first immense advantage . Minnesota , a prairie country , rolling , but with no important hills , well watered , well grassed , with a repellent reputation for severe winters , not well adapted to corn , nor friendly to most fruits , attracted // nevertheless hardy and adventurous people , and proved specially inviting to the Scandinavians , who are tough and industrious , It would grow wheat without end . And wheat is the easiest crop to raise , and returns the greatest income for the least labor . In good seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Minnesota had to learn that one industry does not suffice to make a State , and that wheat-raising alone is not only unreliable , but exhaustive . The grasshopper scourge was no doubt a blessing in disguise . It helped to turn the attention of farmers to cattle and sheep , and to more varied agriculture . I shall have more to say about this in connection with certain most interesting movements in Wisconsin . The notion has prevailed that the Northwest was being absorbed by owners of immense tracts of land , great capitalists who by the aid of machinery were monopolizing the production of wheat , and crowding out small farmers . There are still vast wheat farms under one control , but I am happy to believe that the danger of this great land monopoly has reached its height , and the tendency is the other way . Small farms are on the increase , practising a more varied agriculture . The reason is this . A plantation of 5000 or 15,000 acres , with a good season , freedom from blight and insects , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor crop , with low prices , will bankrupt him . Whereas the small farmer can get a living under the most adverse circumstances , and taking one year with another , accumulate something , especially if he varies his products and feeds them to stock , thus returning the richness of his farm to itself . The skinning of the land by sending away its substance in hard wheat is an improvidence of natural resources , which belongs , like cattle-ranging , to a half-civilized era , and like cattleranging has probably seen its best days . One incident illustrates what can be done . Mr. James J. Hill , the president of the Manitoba railway system , an importer and breeder of fine cattle on his Minnesota country place , recently gave and loaned a number of blooded bulls to farmers over a wide area in Minnesota and Dakota . The result of this benefaction has been surprising in adding to the wealth of those regions and the prosperity of the farmers . It is the beginning of a varied farming and of cattle production , which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of men still in active life when the Territory of Minnesota was supposed to be beyond the pale of desirable settlement . The State , except in the northeast portion , is now well settled , and well sprinkled with thriving villages and cities . Of the latter , St. Paul and Minneapolis are still a wonder to themselves , as they are to the world . I knew that they were big cities , having each a population nearly approaching 175,000 , but I was not prepared to find them so handsome and substantial , and exhibiting such vigor and activity of movement . One of the most impressive things to an Eastern man in both of them is their public spirit , and the harmony with which business men work together for anything which will build up and beautify the city . I believe that the ruling force in Minneapolis is of New England stock , while St. Paul has a larger proportion of New York people , with a mixture of Southern ; and I have a fancy that there is a social shading that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Southerner , transplanted to Minnesota or Montana , loses the laisser faire with which he is credited at home , and becomes as active and pushing as anybody . Both cities have a very large Scandinavian population . The laborers and the domestic serv ' - ants are mostly Swedes . In forecasting what sort of a State Minnesota is to be , the Scandinavian is a largely determimiing force . It is a virile element . The traveller is impressed with the idea that the women whom lie sees at the stations in the country and in the city streets are sturdy , ruddy , and better able to endure the protracted season of cold and the highly stimulating atmosphere than the American-born women , who tend to become nervous in these climatic conditions . The Swedes are thrifty , taking eagerly to politics , and as ready to profit by them as anybody ; unreservedly American in imitention , and , on the whole , good citizens . The physical difference of the two cities is mainly one of situation . Minneapolis spreads out on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flouring mills and the canal and the Falls of St. Anthony as a centre ( the falls being , bythe-way , planked over with a wooden // apron to prevent the total wearing away of the shaly rock ) to rolling land and beautiful building sites on moderate elevations . Nature has surrounded the city with a lovely country , diversified by lakes and forests , and enterprise has developed it into one of the most inviting of summer regions . Twelve miles west of it , Lake Mm netonka , naturally surpassingly lovely , has become , by an immense expenditure of money , perhaps the most attractive summer resort in the Northwest . Each city has a hotel ( the West in Mmneapolis , the Ryan in St. Paul ) which would be distinguished monuments of cost and elegance in any city in the world , and each city has blocks of business houses , shops , and offices of solidity and architectural beauty , and each has many private residences which are palaces in size , in solidity , and interior embellishment , but they are scattered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single street equal to Summit Avenue in St. Paul . The most conspicuous of the private houses is the stone mansion of Governor Washburn , pleasing in color , harmonious in design , but so gigantic that the visitor ( who may have seen palaces abroad ) expects to find a somewhat vacant interior . He is therefore surprised that the predominating note is homelikeness and comfort , and he does not see how a family of moderate size could well get along with less than the seventy rooms ( most of them large ) which they have at their disposal . St. Paul has the advantage of picturesqueness of situation . The business part of the town lies on a spacious uneven elevation above the river , surrounded by a semicircle of bluffs averaging something and stately residences . On the north the bluffs maintain their elevation in a splendid plateau , and over this dry and healthful plain the two cities advance to meet each other , and already meet in suburbs , colleges , and various public buildings . Summit Avenue curves along the line of the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad , graded a distance of over two miles , and with a magnificent asphalt roadway for more than a mile . It is almost literally a street of palaces , for although wooden structures alternate with the varied and architecturally interesting mansions of stone and brick on both sides , each house is isolated , with a handsome lawn and ornamental trees , and the total effect is spacious and noble . This avenue commands an almost unequalled view of the sweep of bluffs round to the Indian Mounds , of the city , the winding river , and the town and heights of West St. Paul . It is hot easy to recall a street and view anywhere finer than this , and this is only one of the streets on this plateau conspicuous for handsome houses . I see no reason why St. Paul should not become , within a few years , one of the notably most beautiful cities in the world . And it is now wonderfully well advanced in that direction . Of course the reader understands that both these rapidly growing cities are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting and digging and slashing , torn-up streets , shabby structures alternating with gigantic and solid buildings , and the usual unsightliness of transition and growth . Minneapolis has the State University , St. Paul the Capitol , an ordinary building of brick , which will not long , it is safe to say , suit the needs or the pride of the State . I do not set out to describe the city , the churches , big newspaper buildings , great wholesale and ware houses handsome club-house ( the Minnesota Club ) , stately City Hall , banks , Chamber of Commerce , and so on . I was impressed with the size of the buildings needed to house the great railway offices . Nothing can give one a livelier idea of the growth and grasp of Western business than one of these plain structures , five or six stories high , devoted to the several departments of one road or system of roads , crowded with busy officials and clerks , offices of the president , vice-president , assistant of the president , secretary , treasurer , engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general tra*flc , general passenger , perhaps a land officer , and so on-affairs as complicated and vast in organization and extensive in detail as those of a State government . There are sixteen railways which run in Minnesota , having a total mileage of 5024 miles in the State . Those which have over two hundred miles of road in the State are the Chicago and Northwestern , Chicago , Milwaukee , and St. Paul , Chicago , St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Omaha , Minneapolis and St. Louis , Northern Pacific , St. Paul and Duluth , and the St. // Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba . The names of these roads give little indication of their location , as the reader knows , for many of them run all over the Northwest like spider-webs . It goes without saying that the management of these great interests-imperial , almost continental in scope-requires brains , sobriety , integrity , and one is not surprised to find that the railways command and pay liberally for the highest talent and skill . It is not merely a matter of laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might almost say creating the industries-of vast territories . These are gigantic interests , concerning which there is such sharp rivalry and competition , and as a rule it is the generous , large-minded policy that wins . Somebody has said that the railway managers and magnates ( I *do not mean those who deal in railways for the sake of gambling ) are the Uite of Western life . I am not drawing distinctions of this sort , but I will say , and it might as well be said here and simply , that next to the impression I got of the powerful hand of the railways in the making of the West , was that of the high character , the moral stamina , the ability , the devotion to something outside themselves , of the railway men I met in the Northwest . Specialists many of them are , and absorbed in special work , but I doubt if any other profession or occupation can show a proportionally larger number of broad-minded , fair-minded men , of higher integrity and less pettiness , or more inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with large concerns has lifted up the men , or the large opportunities have attracted men of high talent and character . And I sincerely believe that we should have no occasion for anxiety if the average community did not go below the standard of railway morality and honorable dealing . What is the raison d&gt;*tre of these two phenomenal cities ? why do they grow ? why are they likely to continue to grow ? I confess that this was an enigma to me until I had looked beyond to see what country was tributary to them , what a territory they have to supply . Of course the railways , the fiouring mills , the vast wholesale dry-goods and grocery houses , speak for themselves . But I had thought of these cities as on the confines of civilization . They are , however , the two posts of the gateway to an empire . In order to comprehend their future I made some little trips northeast and northwest . Duluth , though as yet with only about twenty-five to thirty thousand inhabitants , feels itself , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi . A few figures show the basis of this feeling . In 1880 the population was 3740 ; in 1886 , 25,000 . In 1880 the receipts of wheat were 1,347,679 bushels ; in 1886 , 22,425,730 bushels ; in 1880 shipments of wheat 1,453,647 bushels ; in 1886 , 17,981,965 bushels . In 1880 the shipments of flour were 551,800 bushels ; in 1886 , 1,500,000 bushels . In 1886 there were grain elevators with a capacity of 18,000,000 bushels . The tax valuation had increased from $669.012 in 1880 to $11,773,729 in 1886 . The following comparisons are made : The receipt of wheat in Chicago in 1885 was 19,266,000 bushels ; in Duluth , 14,880,000 bushels . The receipt of wheat in 1886 was at Duluth 22,425,730 bushels ; at Minneapolis , 33,394,450 ; at Chicago , 15,982,524 ; at Milwaukee , 7,930 ,  - -  102 . This shows that an increasing amount of the great volume of wheat raised in north Dakota and northwest Minnesota ( that is , largely in the Red River Valley ) is seeking market by way of Duluth and water transportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1886 , about 50,000,000 . In 1869 Dakota grew no grain at all ; in 1886 it produced about 50,000,000 bushels of wheat . To understand the amount of transportation the reader has only to look on the map and see the railway lines-the Northern Pacific , the Chicago , St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Omaha , the St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba , and other lines , running to Duluth , and sending out spurs , like the roots of an elm-tree into the wheat lands of the Northwest . Most of the route from St. Paul to Duluth is uninteresting ; there is nothing picturesque except the Dalles of the St. Louis River , and a good deal of the country passed through seems agriculturally of no value . The approaches to Duluth , both from the Wisconsin and the Minnesota side , are rough and vexatious by reason of broken , low , hummocky , and swamp land . Duluth itself , with good harbor facilities , has only a strip of level ground for a street , and inadequate room for railway tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whence there is a good view of the lake and the Wisconsin // shore , and a fair chance for both summer and winter breezes . The residence portion of the town , mainly small wooden houses , has many highly ornamental dwellings , and the long street below , following the shore , has many noble buildings of stone and brick , which would be a credit to any city . Grading and sewermaking render a large number of the streets impassable , and add to the signs of push , growth , and business excitement . For the purposes of trade , Duluth , and the towns of Superior and West Superior , in Wisconsin , may be considered one port , and while Duluth may continue to be the money and business centre , the expansion for railway terminal facilities , elevators , and manufactures is likely to be in the Wisconsin towns on the south side of the harbor . From the Great Northern Elevator in West Superior the view of the other elevators , of the immense dock room , of the harbor and lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks of the various roads , gives one an idea of gigantic commerce ; and the long freight trains laden with wheat , glutting all the roads and sidings approaching Duluth , speak of the bursting abundance of the tributary country . This Great Northern Elevator , belonging to the Manitoba system , is the largest in the world ; its dimensions are 360 feet long , 95 in width , 115 in height , with a capacity of 1,800,000 bushels , and with facilities for handling 40 car-loads an hour , or 400 cars in a day of ten hours . As I am merely illustrating the amount of the present great staple of the Northwest , I say nothing here of the mineral , stone , and lumber business of this region . Duluth has a cool , salubrious summer and a snug winter climate . I ought to add that the enterprising inhabitants attend to education as well as the elevation of grain ; the city has eight commodious school buildings . To return to the Mississippi . To understand what feeds Minneapolis and St. Paul , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the rail and penetrate the vast Northwest . The famous Park or Lake district , between St. Cloud ( 75 miles northwest of St. Paul ) and Fergus Falls , is too well known to need description . A rolling prairie , with hundreds of small lakes , tree fringed , it is a region of surpassing loveliness , and already dotted , as at Alexandria , with summer resorts . The whole region , up as far as Moorhead ( 240 miles from St. Paul ) , on the Red River , opposite Fargo , Dakota , is well settled , and full of prosperous towns . At Fargo , crossing the Northern Pacific , we ran parallel with the Red River , through a line of bursting elevators and wheat farms , down to Grand Forks , where we turned westward , and passed out of the Red River Valley , rising to the plateau at Larimore , some three hundred feet above it . The Red River , a narrow but deep and navigable stream , has from its source to Lake Winnipeg a tortuous course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 285 miles long , of which 180 miles is in the United States . This valley , which ha* astonished the world by its wheat production , is about 160 miles in breadth , and level as a floor , except that it has a northward slope of , I believe , abput five feet to the mile . The river forms the boundary between Minnesota and Dakota* the width of valley on the Dakota side varies from 50 to 100 miles . The rich soil is from two to three feet deep , underlaid with clay . Fargo , the centre of this valley , is 940 feet above the sea . The climate is one of extremes between winter and summer , but of much constancy of cold or heat according to the season . Although it is undeniable that one does not feel the severe cold there as much as in more humid atmospheres , it can not be doubted that the long continuance of extreme cold is trying to the system . And it may be said of all the Northwest , including Minnesota , that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the thermometer has less sinking power , it is not free from catarrh ( the curse of New England ) , nor from rheumatism . The climate seems to me specially stimulating , and I should say there is less excuse here for the use of stimulants ( on account of " lowness " or lassitude ) than in almost any other portion of the United States with which I am acquainted . But whatever attractions or drawbacks this territory has as a place of residence , its grain and stock growing capacity is inexhaustible , and having seen it , we begin to comprehend the vigorous activity and growth of the twin cities . And yet this is the beginning of resources ; there lies Dakota , with its 149,100 square miles // *-3 r* 0 z 0 Ag I I ii *44 0 // combined , and Montana beyond , together making a belt of hard spring-wheat land sufficient , one would think , to feed the world . When one travels over 1200 miles of it , doubt ceases . I can not better illustrate the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of the St. Paul , Miiineapolis , and Manitoba Railway ( known as the Manitoba system ) , and by telling briefly the story of one season 's work , not because this system is bigger or more enterprising or of more importance in the West than some others I might name , but because it has lately pierced a comparatively unknown region , and opened to settlement a fertile empire . The Manitoba system gridirons north Minnesota , runs to Duluth , puts two tracks down the Red River Valley ( one on each side of the river ) to the Canada line , sends out various spurs into Dakota , and operates a main line from Grand Forks westward through the whole of Dakota , and through Montana as far as the Great Falls of the Missouri , and thence through the cafion of the Missouri and the cafion of the Prickly-Pear to Helena-in all about 3000 miles of track . Its president is Mr. James J. Hill , a Canadian by birth , whose rapid career from that of a clerk on the St. Paul levee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a romance in itself , and whose character , integrity , tastes and accomplishments , and domestic life , were it proper to speak of them , would satisfactorily answer many of the questions that are asked about the materialistic West . The Manitoba line west had reached Minot , 530 miles from St. Paul , in 1886 . I shall speak of its extension in 1887 , which was intrusted to Mr. D. C. Shepard , a veteran engineer and railway builder of St. Paul , and his firm , Messrs . Shepard , Winston , and Co . Credit should be given by name to the men who conducted this Napoleonic enterprise ; for it required not only the advance of millions of money , but the foresight , energy , vigilance , and capacity that insure success in a distant military campaign . It needs to be noted that the continuation of the St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba road from Great Falls to Helena , 98 miles , is called the Montana Central . The work to be accomplished in 1887 was to grade 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bridging and mechanical structures ( by hauling all material brought up by rail ahead of the track by teams , so as not to delay the progress of the track ) on 530 miles of continuous railway , and to lay and put in good running condition 643 miles of rails continuously and from one end only . In the winter of 1886-7 the road was completed to a point five miles west of Minot , and work was done beyond which if consolidated would amount to about fifty miles of completed grading , and the mechanical structures were done for twenty miles west from Minot . On the Montana Central the grading and mechanical structures were made from Helena as a base , and completed before the track reached Great Falls . St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Duluth were the primary bases of operations , and generally speaking all materials , labor , fuel , and supplies originated at these three points ; Minot was the secondary base , and here in the winter of 1886-7 large depots of supplies and materials for coiistruction were formed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded by snow and ice in the completed cuts , and by the grading , which was heavy . The cuts were frozeii more or less up to May 15th . The forwarding of grading forces to Minot began April 6th , but it was a labor of considerable magnitude to outfit them at Miiiot and get them forward to the work ; so that it was as late as May 10th before the entire force was under employment . The average force on the grading was 3300 teams and about 8000 men . Upon the track-laying , surfacing , piling , and timber-work there were 225 teams and about 650 men . The heaviest work was encountered on the eastern end , so that the track was close upon the grading up to the 10th of June . Some of the cuttings and embankments were heavy . After the 10th of June progress upon the grading was very rapid . From the mouth of* Milk River to Great Falls ( a distance of 200 miles ) grading was done at an average rate of seven miles a day . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie and casting up this continental highway think they beheld one of the most striking achievements of civilization . I may mention that the track is all cast up ( even where the grading is easy ) to such a height as to relieve it of drifting // snow ; and to give some idea of the character of the work , it is noted that in preparing it there were moved 9,700,000 cubic yards of earth , 15,000 cubic yards of loose rock , and 17,500 cubic yards of solid rock , and that there were hauled ahead of the track and put in the work to such distance as would not obstruct the track-laying ( in some instances 30 miles ) , 9,000,000 feet ( board measure ) of timber and 390,000 lineal feet of piling . On the 5th of August the grading of the entire line to Great Falls was either finish ed or properly manned for its completion the first day of September , and on the 10th of August it became necessary to remove outfits to the east as they completed their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn between the 10th and 20th of August , and placed upon work elsewhere . The record of track laid is as follows : April 2d to 30th , 30 miles ; May , 82 miles ; June , 79.8 miles , July , 100.8 miles ; August , 115.4 miles ; September , 102.4 miles ; up to October 15th to Great Falls , 34.6 miles  --  a total to Great Falls of 545 miles . October 16th being Sunday , no track was laid . The track started from Great Falls Monday , October 17th , and reached Helena on Friday , November 18th , a distance of 98 miles , making a grand total of 643 miles , and an average rate for every working day of three and one-quarter miles . It will thus be seen that laying a good road was a much more expeditious method of reaching the Great Falls of the Missouri than that adopted by Lewis and Clarke . Some of the details of this construction and track - laying will interest railroad men . On the 16th of July 7 miles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8th of August 8 miles and 60 feet were laid , in each instance by daylight , and by the regular gang of track-layers , without any increase of their numbers whatever . The entire work was done by handling the iron on low iron cars , and depositing it on the track from the car at the front end . The method pursued was the same as when one mile of track is laid per day in the ordinary manner . The force of track-layers was maintained at the proper number for the ordinary daily work , and was never increased to obtain any special result . The result on the 11th of August was probably decreased by a quarter to a half mile by the breaking of an axle of an iron car while going to the front with its load at about 4 P.M. From six to eight iron cars were employed in doing this day 's work . The number ordinarily used was four to five . Sidings were graded at intervals of seven to eight miles , and spur tracks , laid on the natural surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for storage of materials and supplies at or near the front . As the work went on , the spur tracks in the rear were taken up . The construction train contained box cars two and three stories high , in which workmen were boarded and lodged . Supplies , as a rule , were taken by wagon trains from the spur tracks near the front to their destination , an average distance of one hundred miles and an extreme one of two hundred miles . Steam-boats were employed to a limited extent on the Missouri River in supplying such remote points as Fort Benton and the Coal Banks , but not more than fifteen per cent . of the transportation was done by steamers . A single item illustrating the magnitude of the supply transportation is that there were shipped to Minot and forwarded and consumed on the work 599,000 bushels of oats . It is believed that the work of grading 500 miles of railroad in five months , and the transportation into the country of everything consumed , grass and water excepted , and of every rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machine , man , or team employed , and laying 643 miles of track in seven and a half months , from one end , far exceeds in magnitude and rapidity of execution any similar undertaking in this or any other country . It reflects also the greatest credit on the managers of the railway transportation ( it is not invidious to mention the names of Mr. A. Manvel , general manager , and Mr. J. M. Egan , general superintendent , upon whom the working details devolved ) when it is stated that the delays for material or supplies on the entire work did not retard it in the aggregate one hour . And every hour counted in this masterly campaign . The Western people apparently think no more of throwing down a railroad , if they want to go anywhere , than a conservative Easterner does of taking an unaccustomed walk across country , and the railway constructors and managers are a little amused at the Eastern slowness and want of facility in construction and management . One hears that the East is antiquated , // and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wheelbarrows are of a past age ; the big wheel-scraper does the business . It is a common remark that a contractor accustomed to Eastern work is not desired on a Western job . On Friday afternoon , November 18th , the news was hashed that the last rail was laid , and at 6 P.M. a special train was on the way from St. Paul with a double complement of engineers and train-men . For the first 500 miles there was more or less delay in avoiding the long and frequent freight trains , but after that not much except the necessary stops for cleaning the engine . Great Falls , about 1100 miles , was reached Sunday noon , in thirtysix hours , an average of over thirty miles an hour . A part of the time the speed was as much as fifty miles an hour . The track was solid , evenly graded , heavily tied , well aligned , and the cars ran over it with no more swing and bounce than on an old road . The only exception to this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surfaced all the way . It is excellent railway construction , and it is necessary to emphasize this when we consider the rapidity with which it was built . The company has built this road without land grant or subsidy of any kind . The Montana extension , from Minot , Dakota , to Great Falls , runs mostly through Indian and military reservations , permission to pass through being given by special act of Congress , and the company buying 200 feet roadway . Little of it , therefore , is open to settlement . These reservations , naming them in order westward , are as follows : The Fort Berthold Indian reservation , Dakota , the eastern boundary of which is 27 miles west of Minot , has an area of 4550 square miles ( about as large as Connecticut ) , or 2,912 ,  - -  000 acres . The Fort Buford military reservation , lying in Dakota and Montana , has an area of 900 square miles , or 576,000 acres . The Blackfeet Indian reserve has an area of 34,000 square miles ( the State of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Assiniboin military reserve has an area of 869.82 square miles , or 556,684 acres . It is a liberal estimate that there are 6000 Indians on the Blackfeet and Fort Berthold reservations . As nearly as I could ascertain , there are not over 3500 Indians ( some of those I saw were Crees on a long visit from Canada ) on the Blackfeet reservation of about 22,000,000 acres . Some judges put the number as low as 2500 to all this territory , and estimate that there was about one Indian to ten square miles , or one Indian family to fifty square miles . We rode through 300 miles of this territory along the Milk River , nearly every acre of it good soil , with thick , abundant grass , splendid wheat land . I have no space to take up the Indian problem . But the present condition of affairs is neither fair to white settlers nor just or humane to the Indians . These big reservations are of no use to them , nor they to the reservations . The buffalo have disappeared ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground ; they use little even to pasture their ponies . They are fed and clothed by the government , and they camp about the agencies in idleness , under conditions that pauperize them , destroy their manhood , degrade them into dependent , vicious lives . The reservations ought to be sold , and the proceeds devoted to educating the Indians and setting them up in a self-sustaining existence . They should be allotted an abundance of good land , in the region to which they are acclimated , in severalty , and under su0ch restrictions that they can not alienate it at least for a generation or two . As the Indian is now , he will neither work , nor keep clean , nor live decently . Close to , the Indian is not a romantic object , and certainly no better now morally than Lewis and Clarke depicted him in 1804 . But he is a man ; he has been barbarously treated ; and it is certainly not beyond honest administration and Christian effort to better his condition . And his condition will not be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory that is reserved to him . Of this almost unknown country , pierced by the road west from Larimore , I can only make the briefest notes . I need not say that this open , unobstructed highway of arable land and habitable country , from the Red River to the Rocky Mountains , was an astonishment to me ; but it is more to the purpose to say that the fertile region was a surprise to railway men who are perfectly familiar with the West . We had passed some snow in the night , which had been very cold , but there was very little at Larimore , a considerable // town ; there was a high , raw wind during the day , and a temperature of about i0* above , which heavily frosted the car windows . At Devil 's Lake ( a body of brackish water twenty-eight miles long ) is a settlement three years old , and from this and two insignificant stations beyond were shipped , in 1887,1,500,000 bushels of wheat . The country beyond is slightly rolling , fine land , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very promising altogether . Minot , where we crossed the Mouse River the second time , is a village of 700 people , with several brick houses and plenty of saloons . Thence we ran up to a plateau some three hundred feet higher than the Mouse River Valley , and found a land more broken , and interspersed with rocky land and bowldersthe only touch of " bad lands " I recall on the route . We crossed several small streams , White Earth , Sandy , Little Muddy , and Muddy , and before reaching Williston descended into the valley of the Missouri , reached Fort Buford , where the Yell6wstone comes in , entered what is called Paradise Valley , and continued parallel with the Missouri as far as the mouth of Milk River . Before reaching this we crossed the Big Muddy and the Poplar rivers , both rising in Canada . At Poplar Station is a large Indian agency , and hundreds of Teton Sioux Indians ( I was told 1800 ) camped there in their conical tepees . I climbed the plateau above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies in blankets and buffalorobes , and suspending them aloft on crossbars supported by stakes , to keep them from the wolves . Beyond Assiniboin I saw a platform in a cottonwood-tree on which reposed the remains of a chief and his family . This country is all good , so far as I could see and learn . It gave me a sense of geographical deficiency in my education to travel three hundred miles on a river I had never heard of before . But it happened on the Milk River , a considerable but not navigable stream , although some six hundred miles long . The broad Milk River Valley is in itself an empire of excellent land , ready for the plough and the wheatsower . Judging by the grass ( which cures into the most nutritious feed as it stands ) , there had been no lack of rain during the summer ; but if there is lack of water , all the land can be irrigated by the Milk River , and it may also be said of the country beyond to Great Falls that frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should say that this would be the only question about water . Leaving the Milk River Valley , we began to curve southward , passing Fort Assiniboin on our right . In this region and beyond at Fort Benton great herds of cattle are grazed by government contractors , who supply the posts with beef . At the Big Sandy Station they were shipping cattle eastward . We crossed the Marias River ( originally named Maria 's River ) , a stream that had the respectful attention of Lewis and Clarke , and the Teton , a wilfully erratic watercourse in a narrow valley , which caused the railway constructors a good deal of trouble . We looked down , in passing , on Fort Benton , nestled in a bend of the Missouri ; a smart town , with a daily newspaper , an old trading station . Shortly after leaving Assiniboin we saw on our left the Bear Paw Mountains and the noble Highwood Mountains , fine peaks , snow-dusted , about thirty miles from us , and adjoining them the Belt Mountains . Between them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our right were the Sweet Grass Hills , on the Canada line , where gold-miners are at work . I have noted of all this country that it is agriculturally fine . After Fort Benton we had glimpses of the Rockies , off to the right ( we had seen before the Little Rockies in the south , toward Yellowstone Park ) ; then the Bird-tail Divide came in sight , and the mathematically Square Butte , sometimes called Fort Montana . At noon , November 20th , we reached Great Falls , where the Sun River , coming in from the west , joins the Missouri . The railway crosses the Sun River , and runs on up the left bank of the Missouri . Great Falls , which lies in a bend of the Missouri on the east side , was not then , but soon will be , connected with the line by a railway bridge . I wish I could convey to the reader some idea of the beauty of the view as we came out upon the Sun River Valley , or the feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place before that did not seem remote , far from home , lonesome . Here the aspect was friendly , livable , almost homelike . We seemed to have come out , after a long journey , to a place where one might be content to stay for some time-  --  to a far // but fair country , on top of the world , as it were . Not that the elevation is greatonly about 3000 feet above the sea-nor the horizon illimitable , as on the great plains ; its spaciousness is brought within human sympathy by guardian hills and distant mountain ranges . A more sweet , smiling picture than the Sun River Valley the traveller may go far to see . With an average breadth of not over two and a half to five miles , level , richly grassed , flanked by elevations that swell up to plateaus , through the valley the Sun River , clear , full to the grassy banks , comes down like a ribbon of silver , perhaps 800 feet broad before its junction . Across the far end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty , run the silver serrated peaks of the Rocky Mountains , snow-clad and sparkling in the sun . At distances of twelve and fifty miles up the valley have been for years prosperous settlements , with school-houses and churches , hitherto cut off from the world . The whole rolling , amble , though treeless country in view is beautiful , and the far prospects are magnificent . I suppose that something of the homelikeness of the region is due to the presence of the great Missouri River ( a connection with the world we know ) , which is here a rapid , clear stream , in permanent rock-laid banks . At the town a dam has been thrown across it , and the width above the darn , where we crossed it , is about 1800 feet . The day was fair and not cold , but a gale of wind from the southwest blew with such violence that the ferry-boat was unmanageable , and we went over in little skiffs , much tossed about by the white-capped waves . In June , 1886 , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The country is now taken up and dotted with claim shanties , and Great Falls is a town of over 1000 inhabitants , regularly laid out , with streets indeed extending far on to the prairie , a handsome and commodious hotel , several brick buildings , and new houses going up in all directions . Central lots , fifty feet by two hundred and fifty , are said to sell for $5000 , and I was offered a corner lot on Tenth Street , away out on the prairie , for $1500 , including the corner stake . It is difficult to write of this country without seeming exaggeration , and the habitual frontier boastfulness makes the acquisition of bottom facts difficult . It is plain to be seen that it is a good grazing country , and the experimental fields of wheat near the town show that it is equally well adapted to wheat - raising . The vegetables grown there are enormous and solid , especially potatoes and turnips ; I have the outline of a turnip which measured seventeen inches across , seven inches deep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal , good coking quality , and extensive mines are opening in the neighborhood . I have no doubt from what I saw and heard that iron of good quality ( hematite ) is abundant . It goes without saying that the Montana mountains are full of other minerals . The present advantage of Great Falls is in the possession of unlimited water-power in the Missouri River . As to rainfall and climate ? The grass shows no lack of rain , and the wheat was raised in 1887 without irrigation . But irrigation from the Missouri and Sun rivers is easy , if needed . The thermometer shows . a more temperate and less rigorous climate than Minnesota and north Dakota . Unless everybody fibs , the winters are less severe , and stock ranges and fattens all winter . Less snow falls here than farther east and south , and that which falls . does not usually remain long . The truth seems to be that the mercury occasionally goes very low , but that every few days a warm Pacific wind from the southwest , the " Chinook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature , and sweeps . off the snow in twenty-four hours . I was told that ice rarely gets more than ten inches thick , and that ploughing can be done as late as the 20th of December , and recommenced from the 1st to the 15th of March . I did not stay long enough to verify these statements . There had been a slight fall of snow in October , which speedily disappeared . November 20th was pleasant , with a strong Chinook wind . November 21st there was a driving snowstorm . The region is attractive to the sightseer . I can speak of only two things , the Springs and the Falls . There is a series of rapids and falls for twelve miles below the town ; and the river drops down rapidly into a calion which is in some places nearly 200 feet deep . The first fall is twenty-six feet high . The most beautiful is the Rainbow Fall , six miles from town . This cataract , in a wild , deepgorge , // has a width of 1400 feet , nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge of fifty feet . What makes it impressive is the immense volume of water . Dashed upon the rocks below , it sends up clouds of spray , which the sun tinges with prismatic colors the whole breadth of  --  the magnificent fall . Standing half-**ay down the precipice , another considerable and regular fall is seen above , while below are rapids and falls again at the bend , and beyond , great reaches of tumultuous river in the cation . It is altogether a wild and splendid spectacle . Six miles below , the river takes a continuous though not perpendicular plunge of ninety-six feet . One of the most exquisitely beautifiAI natural objects I know is the Spring , a mile above Rainbow Fall . Out of a rocky ledge , sloping up some ten feet above the river , burst several springs of absolutely crystal water , powerfully bubbling up like small geysers , and together forming instantly a splendid stream , which falls into the Missouri . So perfectly transparent is the water that the springs seem to have a depth of only fifteen inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiat-leaved plants of vivid green , shades from lightest to deepest emerald , and when the sunlight strikes into their depths the effect is exquisitely beautiful . Mingled with the emerald are maroon colors that heighten the effect . The vigor of the outburst , the volume of water , the transparency , the play of sunlight on the lovely colors , give one a positively new sensation . I have left no room to speak of the road of ninety-eight miles through the cation of the Missouri and the cation of the Prickly-Pear to Helena-about 1400 feet higher than Great Falls . It is a marvellously picturesque road , following the mighty river , winding through crags and precipices of trap-rock set on end in fantastic array , and wild mountain scenery . On the route are many pleasant places , openings of fine valleys , thriving ranches , considerable stock and oats , much land ploughed and cultivated . The valley broadens out before we reach Helena and enter Last Chance Gulch , now the main street of the city , out of which millions of gold have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21st was a jubilee day for the city and the whole Territory . Cannon , bells , whistles , welcomed the train and the man , and fifteen thousand people ihurrahed ; the town was gayly decorated ; there was a long procession , speeches and music in the Opera-house in the afternoon , and fireworks , illumination , and banquet in the evening . The reason of the boundless enthusiasm of Helena was in the fact that the day gave it a new competing line to the East , and opened up the coal , iron . and wheat fields of north Montana . Further comments , economic and social , upon the Northwest , including Wisconsin , must be deferred to the April number .
