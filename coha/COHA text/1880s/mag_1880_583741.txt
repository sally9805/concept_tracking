OVER THE BALKANS WITH GOURKO . WITH the fall of Plevna and the capture of Osman 's army it was thought that the backbone of the Turkish resistance was broken , but it was only a few days before every one knew that there was to be no rest in the campaign . Orders were immediately issued sending the troops who had blockaded Plevna to one or the other of the advanced guards in the Balkans , and at the end of a week they were all in motion . Every one obeyed cheerfully , nobody knowing what would come of it , but nine out of ten believing it could only result in terrible disaster , to be brought about by lack of food and extreme suffering from cold . These views were only confirmed by a change in the weather , which hitherto had been raw and wet , with occasional snows , but now suddenly changed to a temperature of about zero Fahrenheit , accompanied by a raging snow-storm of three days ' duration . Everything was frozen solid , the roads became beds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , and the men huddled together in silence , shivering in their ragged clothing which had not been renewed since summer . I left Plevna and the Grand Duke 's head-quarters on the 20th of December , two days after the departure of the ninth corps , which had been detailed to General Gourko at the Orkhanie Pass . I intended to overtake these troops on the road , and follow the campaign with General Gourko 's army . At the close of a long day 's ride the storm increased in severity , and I was preparing to leave the road and seek shelter for the night in a village bivouac , whose smoke I could see not far off when a weird picture attracted my attention just in front of me . Alone in the road , without a human being in sight , stood a company wagon heavily loaded with the men s rations ; the ground was frozen hard beneath it and covered with snow on all sides ; the snow was driving furiously through the air , and the eye could penetrate its mass but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black silhouette of the middle horse of the " troika " ; the other two lay dead and stiff at his feet on either side , and he alone was still standing , gaunt and feeble , swaying backward and forward in sad and terrible silence before the blasts VOL . XX. - 47. of the storm , and waiting , half insensible , his turn to fall . I found refuge for the night with a captain of a " park " of reserve artillery ammunition which was bivouacked in the village . He occupied one room of a little hut , the other being filled with a family of some ten or twelve Bulgarians , of both sexes and various ages . His reception was in unison with that which I invariably received from every one of his class , and the open-hearted warmth of which I was often puzzled to account for . He spoke but a few words of French and German , barely more than the few phrases of Russian which I had by that time acquired , but it was enough for him to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my disposal : my horses had the best stalls in the wretched little stable , and plenty of forage to eat ; the samovar was immediately set boiling for tea ; whatever meat he had was at once put to cooking ; his little flask of brandy was half drained to warm my chilled stomach ; his chest was opened to take out the one or two delicacies which he possessed in the way of food ; his one knife and fork were cleaned for my use ; his servant was called a fool and a blockhead for not being quicker with the supper ; his few St. Petersburg cigarettes were forced upon me ; and when it was time to go to bed he insisted long and urgently , though I would not yield , that I should sleep on his campbed while he took the mud floor . In the morning , he was equally urgent that I should take the greater part of the half-dozen cans of potted meats which he possessed , on the ground that I would need them out in the storm , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a word , everything that was possible was done to make us change places for the night ,  --  he to become the ill-provided traveler , and I the comparatively comfortable lodger in a house , such as it was . I never saw this man before nor after the one night I passed with him , yet , had I been his foster-brother and playmate from childhood , now rejoining him after a long absence , he could not have done more for me . The same thing happened to me on dozens of occasions , and as I found that more than once , when I was mistaken for an English officer or correspondent , my re // ception was very cold , I at last became convinced that all this kindness was due to my nationality . It is a fact , strange as it may appear to some people , that there exists throughout the length and breadth of Russia a sentimental attachment for Americans , of the depth of which we have very little conception at home . The policy of the rulers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been one of uniform and unbroken friendship for the United States ; this is a well-known fact in politics , and people account for it on the ground of self-interest , or of genuine admiration , according to their political opinions . But what is not generally known is the fact that this friendly feeling permeates all classes of society , and is f*ir more firmly rooted in those portions of the community which never see St. Petersburg than it is in the more cosmopolitan court circles of that capital . It is of no use to argue that the feeling is superficial , that it has no substantial foundation , that the political customs and the habits of the people of the two countries are diametrically opposed , and that they have no interests in common . The feeling does exist , and it is a very strong one . Certain reasons may be given for it , which , although at first sight they may appear insufficient and superficial , have nevertheless a great deal of force . Remoteness and the lack of clashing interests are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Russian interests do clash so constantly with those of other European nations ; in addition to this , there are elements of sympathy in the fact of mere geographical bigness , Russia and the United States standing first among civilized nations in point of continuous territory and number of inhabitants of one race ; each of us is sensitive to foreign criticism , and each , while conscious of its own strength , has felt the sneers of other countries ; but , above all , Russia has come to look upon itself as the inveterate and eternal enemy of England , and it rightly judges us to be the natural rival of England in all those elements of commercial success which have made her present greatness . Russia looks to see England decline as we advance , and this decline she considers her greatest advantage . A wide-spread illusion also exists , which I never succeeded in dispelling with any one with whom I conversed , that the minute England becomes involved in war we will destroy her commerce by precisely those means which certain Englishmen employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings and probable action in the event of England being involved in a Continental war are more correctly appreciated at St. Petersburg , but in the country at large-as represented by the army officersthe opinion is universal that we would at once send out cruisers to depredate on English commerce the moment England 's fleet was occupied elsewhere . Both being enemies , the Russians argue , of the same power , we must naturally be friends of each other . One other incident , which is almost forgotten at home , made a deep and lasting impression in Russia ; this was the mission of Mr. Fox in 1867 . The sending of a fleet of vessels , partly composed of monitors , which had proved their merit in action at home , but had never before been seen in European waters , to convey an embassador bearing a special message from the whole American people , as represented in Congress , of goodwill to the Russian people and hearty congratulations on the escape of their emperor from assassination-all this had a flavor of generous sentiment in it peculiarly acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . The fame of this mission penetrate ( I to the ends of the empire , and consolidated a friendship which has been growing for years , and the very inertness of the Russians , which prevents them from receiving a new idea every day , makes them hold very fast to those they do receive and accept . I left my generous host early the next morning , and making my way through the storm , arrived two days afterward at General Gourko 's head-quarters , on the northern slope of the Balkans , near Orkhanie . The troops destined to re-enforce his army arrived the same day , and on the next the orders were issued for the advance . The following day , Christmas morning , in intense cold and in the midst of a dense , impenetrable fog of particles of ice , we set out to cross the Balkans . The troops found almost insuperable obstacles in dragging their guns up the steep , icy slopes of the narrow road which had been made over the mountain to enable them to turn the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken apart and dragged piecemeal by ropes up the mountain , and late that evening , at the time when it was intended that more than half of the troops should have been at the southern outlets of the mountain passes , not a gun had reached the summit . The posi // tion was a precarious one ; the troops were spread out over an immense length and there was the greatest danger that the movement would be revealed to the Turks and might be wholly aborted by flank attacks as the isolated detachments should reach the southern valleys . At night-fall , General Gourko reached the summit and lay down in the snow for a little rest , thoroughly harassed by the anxieties of the moment . It was one of those critical periods when success or failure hang in the balance , and the general 's impatience knew no bounds , as successive reports came to him of the difficulties and delays which the different columns met with . After admiring the magnificent view which was disclosed from the top of the mountain , at the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in snow , but dotted here and there with the numerous dark clusters of huts and curling smoke of the villages , I declined *n invitation to pass the night on the mountain , and determined to push forward to a regiment which held the outposts in the valley below . Several hours after night-fall , when I was beginning to fear I had wholly lost my road and was wandering into the Turkish lines , as I once did at Plevna , I stumbled upon the village where the Russians were bivouacked ; applying at once at the first hut , I was received with the usual cordiality by the half-dozen officers quartered in it , and was immediately offered more than my share of whatever creature comforts they possessed . While the troops were slowly dragging themselves and their guns over the mountain range , I took advantage of the delay to pass a day or two with the brigade of Caucasian Cossacks who were employed in scouting and skirmishing with the Turks in the valley of Sophia . These men are of an entirely different type from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caucasus , not very far from that portion of the earth which is spoken of as the cradle of the human race , and they are of a remarkably pure Caucasian typeruddy complexions , dark hair and eyes , short black beards , and compact , well-knit frames ; their wild , picturesque costume consists of a black , woolly , sheep-skin hat , one or two long tunics coming to their heels , the inner one of red or black silk and the outer of brown woollen cloth , a pair of trowsers , and low boots outside of them . The tunic is gathered in at the waist by a very narrow belt of leather , ornamented with silver worked in enamel ; the scimiter-like sword is hung by a similar piece of leather passing over one shoulder , and over the other hangs the carbine , in a sheath of sheep-skin ; on each breast are half a dozen cases for cartridges . Their horses are the counterpart of themselves-short , thick-set , extremely hardy , and very intelligent . The men are wonderfully bold riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddles-have little in common with what we are accustomed to call good horsemanship . These people differ as much from the Russians in their character as in their appearance . Though among the most faithful of the Tsar 's subjects , they are all Mohammedans , understand but very little of the Russian language , are very quick-sighted and self-reliant , never at a loss to take care of themselves , and render the best service when left to their own resources . They are a species of amiable barbarians , devoted to their friends and absolutely relentless to their foes ; they talk but little among themselves , have a serious expression of countenance , rarely smile , and do not sing except when they give themselves up to a dance around a camp-fire , which bears a strong resemblance to the sun dances of our Indians , although the motions are more varied and graceful . They have little of the regular discipline of European troops , though they are by no means disorderly , and they love nothing so much as danger and wild adventure for its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little villages of the Sophia plain when I joined it , just at daylight a day or two after Christmas . The village was wrapped in snow , and showed no sign whatever of the thousand men who were hid in it , except that a good many horses were in the yards of the huts . I found the hut of the commandant , who was just rolling out of his blankets , and refreshed myself with a few glasses of the customary hot tea . Half an hour afterward we were in motion , and moved out through the deep snow toward the town of Sophia , to reconnoiter the strength of the Turks at that place . As we passed from one to another of the villages , where no Russians had previously been seen , the Bulgarians met us in large numbers at the entrance of each , usually preceded by their priests bearing a cross and the elders of the village bringing salt and bread . At our approach they bowed their heads to the ground and cried " Welcome , welcome , " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever knowledge they had concerning the Turks was cheerfully given ( though their reports were often unintelligible and contradictory ) , and their ample provisions of grain , bread , geese and poultry were freely placed at our disposal . But as they saw that we did not remain , their enthusiasm cooled most decidedly , as they remembered that to-morrow might bring a body of Turks back upon them . As we approached one village , we were received with a few shots coming from behind the hedges . The column was halted and some skirmishers thrown out , who reported a body of Turkish infantry in the village , engaged in crossing a deep little stream which was covered with a thin coating of ice , not strong enough to hear our horses . Those of the Turks who had already passed were drawn up in line on the opposite bank , and as the Cossacks could only approach the ford through a narrow street they were at a considerable disadvantage , considering that their object was merely a reconnaissance , and nothing was to be gained by losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks for half an hour , when all the latter being across the stream , they broke into a double-quick on the road to Sophia . The Cossacks put after them , but the ford was very narrow , and it was some time before they were over ; the Turks got a start of a good half-mile , and as soon as the Cossacks came near them they stopped long enough to give them a warm fire and then ran on . The Cossacks could easily have caught them on the road , which was firm and hard , but would have lost thirty or forty men in doing so , and there was no object in it , as it was only a small force of five hundred or six hundred men retreating from an outpost in the mountains . Then the Cossacks tried to go around and get ahead of them , but the deep soft snow in the fields made their progress slower than that of the Turks . So they merely kept up the chase for three or four miles , until theycame to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable stream about three miles in front of Sophia . The Turks got safely across the bridge and then we were saluted by a fine rattling fusillade extending over a length of about a quarter of a mile of the opposite bank of the stream , and we saw a regiment or more of Tcherkesses * deploy on the opposite bank . Here we were in full sight of the town , and the officers * Caucasian cavalry in the Turkish service . had a good opportunity to sketch the position of its fortifications , so the Cossacks fell back to about 1200 yards and , spreading out over a long line , kept up a good skirmish fire . A curious and very interesting incident now occurred . The Cossacks sat there exchanging shots for nearly an hour , and while with our glasses we could plainly see many a Turk knocked out of his saddle by our Berdans , not a man on the Russian side was hit , and not a bullet was heard to whistle . The Tcherkesses were armed with the Winchester repeating carbine , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wholly out of range ! A week later another skirmish took place at the same locality . This time it was the main body of Gourko 's troops forcing their way to Sophia ; they met with resistance at this same bridge , and a smart skirmish took place , lasting about an hour , and costing the Russians fifty or sixty men . On this occasion I was with General Gourko 's staff , and we stood watching the fight on a tumulus about three hundred yards in rear of the place where I had been before ; this time the bullets flew fast and thick , and a few horses in our group were wounded ; but now it was Turkish infantry opposed to us , armed with the Peabody-Martini rifle , a splendid weapon which carrie* with deadly effect to 2000 yards . As the sun began to go down the Cossacks gradually withdrew , having gained as much information as was possible with their force . Along the road were the evidences of an affair in which these same troops had been engaged a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day 's gentle skirmishing . Pieces of broken wagons , dead horses , immense stains of blood in the snow , men with their heads severed in two pieces , these were the marks of an attack on a transport train guarded by a company of infantry , every man of which had been cut down . And yet-so strange are the anomalies of semi-civilized nature-at the end of that affair , an infant , not over six months old , who had been discovered deserted among the de'bris , was picked up , wrapped in a big cloak , tenderly cared for during the night , and the next day carried back on horseback , thirty miles over the mountains , to the nearest hospital , and there delivered to the Sisters of Charity of the Red Cross , by whom it was taken in charge and sent to Russia for adoption . The picture of the rough Cossack carrying this child , laughing in his face , on the // pommel of his saddle through the snow , was a most attractive one ; and yet the same man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword and hack off the head of its wounded father , lying on the ground and begging for mercy ; and , while enjoying the zest of it at the moment , would forget all about it the next day . While this reconnaissance had been going on , the main body of the troops were still tugging painfully at their guns on the mountain range . It was six days before they had pulled them up one side , slid them down the other , and then put them together again , mounted them on their wheels , and turned them over to the horses for draught . Finally the troops were all assembled in the valleys on the southern side ; and an attack was made at Taskossen on the last day of the yearon the position which the Turks had taken up by throwing back their left flank to oppose the Russian advance against their rear . Their troops were commanded by the well-known Valentine Baker , who made a short but good defense , keeping it up until a dense fog settled just before sunset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main Turkish army and bagging it entire , as the Turkish army was bagged at Shipka . It was a pretty fight to look at . The Turks had a good position along a pass in a spur of the mountain through which the road passed . They were on high ground , and the Russians had to advance through an open valley . In front of them , directly opposite to the Turkish position and about two miles from it , was a high spur on which we were situated , and from which every movement of the battle could be seen with perfect clearness . The Turks gave way about three o'clock in the afternoon , but it was impossible to follow them for any distance at that late hour of the short winter day , as the weather was inclement and the men were exhausted . The next morning , New Year 's day , the troops were put in motion , the general and staff preceding them with a small escort . As we rode through the pass we came into a small valley not over four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Balkans , which bounded it on the north , while natural spurs encircled it on the other sides . The principal body of the Turks had been on the Balkans , and we looked eagerly to see whether they still remained there ; nothing could be discerned . But off on our right we noticed a few black dots moving toward the south over a snow-covered slope . With our glasses we thought that a large body of troops could be seen massed in and near the village at the foot of the slope , about three miles off . The leading Russian battalions and batteries were immediately hurried in that direction , and , in a few minutes afterward , an enormous black mass , like a swarm of busy ants , was seen slowly ascending the mountain . Evidently a portion of the Turks were in retreat , but we knew nothing of what had transpired at their principal position , and scanned eagerly the sides of the main range in search of further developments , while a few officers were sent forward to reconnoiter . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending the southern slope of the main range . Was it the rest of the Turks , or was it a portion of the Russians ? Officers were sent off post-haste to learn . In less than half an hour one of them came galloping back to say that it was their own men , and that the whole position on the Balkans had been abandoned during the night . The troops we saw off on our right were , therefore , a large rear-guard of the Turkish army . The general took out of his pocket a piece of chocolate ,  --  the only delicacy he had with him ,  --  and divided it with his staff in congratulation of their success ; for , in fact , the supposed impassable line of the main Balkan range had been passed in the depth of winter , and the Turks were in full retreat . Short dispatches were at once written and sent to the end of the field-telegraph on the other side of the mountains , and others , more at length , were written later in the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and deliver into the Emperor 's own hands at St. Petersburg . It was a New Year 's congratulation worth offering . Five days later the Russian troops entered the town of Sophia , which the Turks had evacuated during the preceding night . At the entrance of the town we were met by a procession of two or three thousand people , headed by a large number of priests of the orthodox church , attired in the robes of their office . Some of them bore crucifixes of silver , which were presented to the Russian commander , who devoutly uncovered his head , crossed himself three times and kissed them . Others carried a silver platter containing a loaf of bread and some saltthe ancient emblems of hospitality . Behind them was a choir of several hundred voices , that immediately began singing an anthem . // The rest of the crowd was made up of Bulgarians , who broke forth into loud cheers and shouts of welcome as we rode along past them . This town , which was founded by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital in the ninth century , conquered by the Turks in 1382 and now reconquered by Christians in 1878 , presented strange scenes-scenes which have little in common with the nineteenth century as we understand it , and are possible now in no other civilized land but Turkey . Nearly all the shops had been owned by Turks or a few Greeks . The Turkish population had either fled with the Turkish troops or had hidden out of sight , and for about eight hours-from two o'clock in the night , when the Turks left , until ten o'clock in the morning , when the Russians entered  --  the Bulgarians had been engaged in indiscriminate and ruthless pillage . Every shop in the town had been broken open , and its contents carried off or scattered about the streets . The Russians very quickly brought order out of this confusion . Their Cossack whips were freely used on the backs of the Bulgarians , and any person found with goods in the street or suspiciouslooking property in his house was required to bring it into one of the open squares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles and guarded by sentries until its ownership could be clearly proven . The only solitary instance of pillage by the troops  --  a Cossack who was found guilty of stealing a watch from a man in the street-was summarily punished by hanging within an hour from the time of the robbery . This instance of pillage by the Bulgarians was , unfortunately , not the exception ,  --  it was the common rule on similar occasions ; and as the war went on and instances of it multiplied , it sadly dampened the ardent enthusiasm with which the Russians had begun the war for the relief of their suffering co-religionists . Misgovernment extending over centuries can not be righted without the hatred which it has engendered finding vent in horrible excesses , and this war will stand out pre-eminent among those of modem times for the suffering which it inflicted upon the non-combatant population . Whenever the Russian armies approached a village , the Turkish population abandoned everything and fled before them ; when the Russians were obliged to fall back and the Turks followed in pursuit , the Bulgarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance surged forward during the winter without interruption to the gates of Constantinople , a large portion of the entire Mohammedan population left their homes and villages , and packing a few possessions and still less food in one or two bullock wagons , they formed the nucleus of caravans of refugees-one of which , receiving fresh additions at every village , finally stretched out over a length of twenty miles and contained two hundred thousand souls ! This great train became mingled with the retreating Turkish troops , and was caught between two fractions of the advancing Russians-General Gourko from Sophia and General Skobeleff from Shipka . Its escort of a few battalions foolishly made a defense against the troops of the latter general , and being beaten it took refuge in flight toward the Rhodope Mountains , followed by all the able-bodied portion of the community , who left the old , the sick and the babes to perish in the snow . The train was at once plundered of all its possessions by the Bulgarians of the neighboring villages , who mercilessly put to death all those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days we marched through the remnants of this caravan , scattered over a length of seventy miles ,  --  broken wagons , scattered contents , dead animals ; here a man and his wife , who had stretched a blanket in the snow and lain down to die side by side ; there a stately old Turk , with flowing white beard , green turban and brightly figured robe , lying by the ditch with his throat cut from ear to ear ; and again a naked little infant frozen stiff in the snow , with its eyes upturned to heaven . Our blood curdled as we saw a Bulgarian clod , grinning* and staring at us from the road-side , who answered as we asked him who murdered those two Turks lying a few feet from us : " Nashe bratte ( Our brothers , we did it ) . " In the villages which the Turks had left , their houses , land and effects were all promptly seized and used by the Bulgarians . On the other hand , in the wagons of the caravan were found silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before beginning their flight . Meanwhile , the refugees of this particular caravan eked out a precarious existence in the Rhodope Mountains until spring , when , // aided and led by one or two English adventurers , they began an insurrection against the Russian troops who had been left to guard the line of communications . When this had been subdued , some months later , the tale of their sufferings reached Constantinople , and a commission of foreign consuls was sent to investigate the matter . They reported that more than a hundred and fifty thousand homeless and starving refugees were scattered about in the villages of this inhospitable region , with no resources of food or clothing for the coming winter . Subscriptions were opened in England for their relief ; and measures were taken , the war being now over , to return them to their homes . Arriving there , they found all their property appropriated by others , and they met with a bleak reception from the Bulgarians , who imagined they had seen the last of their long-time enemies and oppressors ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , as several Russians suggested , to make them continue their flight to Asia . The caravan of which I have spoken was the largest , but it was only one of many . The migration of the others continued all the way to Constantinople , where , on our arrival , there were reported to be three hundred thousand refugees . The mosque of St. Sophia alone contained nearly three thousand of them when I first saw it . They were herded about in mosques and in open squares until the typhus fever broke out among them , when the Turkish authorities displayed unwonted energy and in a few ( lays dispersed the whole mass , sending about half of them over into Asia and the other half back toward Bulgaria . It is probably within the limit of fact to say that seven hundred thousand Mohammedans abandoned their homes and possessions during the war , and set foith on a long journey the aim and end of which they knew not , and that not one-half of them have ever returned , and a large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand Bulgarians abandoned their homes at the time of Gourko 's retreat in July . A million of people were thus wandering about during the course of the war , with only such possessions as two or three families could pack into one bullock wagon . The sufferings which they endured can never be told , much less appreciated . Even now , more than two years after the events of which I am writing , we constantly read in the papers of a new com mission being formed to make arrangements for returning the Turkish refugees to their homes . We stayed at Sophia just a week , recuperating the men and ' getting together the supplies for a further advance . Our way then lay on the ancient Roman road to Adrianople . We had to cross a second range of mountains , where the same difficulties were encountered with the guns as before , only lessened to the extent that smooth roads are less difficult than mountain paths , although both be covered with frozen , icy snow . Emerging from the mountains at last in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly up with the retreating Turks , and then for three days , marching from daylight to dark and always in sight of each other , we kept up the exciting chase , hardly stopping long enough to extinguish the blazing fires in every village which marked the line of Turkish march . On the afternoon of the third day , the advance guard , under Count Shouvaloff , with whom I was marching , were met by some cavalry which were scouting on their right , who reported that a column of Turks was moving directly toward a village just abreast of them , with the intention of crossing the Maritz* River and gaining the high road on which they were . Count Shouvaloff immediately turned his men to the right , and they plunged into the stream  --  a river more than a hundred yards wide and four feet deep , filled with cakes of floating ice which struck against the men 's breasts as they forded it . Arrived on the other side , their clothing was soon stiff with ice ; but the men pressed on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks had already seen their movements , and had turned back to the railroad along which they were marching , and continued their retreat in that direction . The rear of the column , on a good run , was over half a mile from us ; the sun was just setting , and Shouvaloff had only about 5000 men at hand . He rightly argued : If they have a large force , I am too weak for them to-day ; if a small force , I would rather they escaped than that my men should freeze to death with their icy clothes in these fields to-night . So , sending a small force of cavalry to reconnoiter their strength , he turned his men back to the village and bade them crowd twenty or thirty into each hut and dry their clothes around blazing fires . The general picked out one of the squalid little huts for himself ; and invited the two foreign officers who were present , Major von // Liegnitz and myself , as well as his chief of staff and two aids-de-camp , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We got some black bread of the peasants , and each one contributed a little tea or potted meats - whatever he had in his saddle , the wagons being all behind  --  to make a meal . Afterward we discussed the probabilities of the next day . 1'here was plainly visible from our hut a long line of fires stretching across the country , about three miles from us . Liegnitz had , as the sequel proved , the best military instinct , and argued that this was a line of bivouac fires of a large body of Turkish troops , who had selected that position to give battle ; the others inclined to the opinion that the fires were caused by burning the tops of the rice stalks which projected above the snow . In any event , the necessary orders were given by the general for the disposition of the troops for the morrow-for an attack if the Turks stood firm , or for a pursuit if they should retreat . Then we sandwiched ourselves about on the floor , and slept during the night . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast between the present squalid surroundings of Count Shouvaloff and his large estates and l*eautiful home in St. Petersburg , and his patriotism in leaving all this and asking to come to the army in an inferior position after having been passed over in the first assignment of generals ; and the other was about my own position-going again into a battle in which I might lose my life as easily as any one else , but in which I had no more direct concern than that of an observer watching the development of an interesting problem , in which if I got hit I would neither receive nor be entitled to any sympathy , and to the result of which I was incapable of contributing in any way whatever . There is a peculiar sense 01 foolishness in the feeling of being hit as a bystander in a row . But our thoughts are mastered by physical needs , and one sleeps easily after bodily exhaustion , no matter in what surroundings . We were up before daylight the next morning , and just as the sun arose  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come up during the night , and slept in the fields on the other side of the river , began crossing the stream . As they had to fight all day in the snow it was very important that their clothing should not be wet , and they were therefore ordered to strip naked , roll their clothes in a bundle and carry them on their heads . As they came out of the icy river they were as red as boiled lobsters , but made merry as they squatted about in the snow to put on their clothes . They then formed and marched through the village , where the general saluted them as usual . " Good morning , my men . " " Good morning , your Highness . " " Did you burn your feet coming over ? " " No , indeed , your Highness ! " they answered in a shout , as a broad grin stole over their good-natured faces . The troops were soon deployed in the fields outside the village , and , looking in the direction of the fires we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slight elevation rising out of the rice-fields , and at intervals along it were several batteries , and we knew very well that plenty of infantry lay either between or behind them . The advance was gradually made toward this position , and when the line of skirmishers came within about two thousand yards of it the artillery opened fire , accompanied by some straggling infantry shots . The men were ordered to advance slowly , or to lie down in the furrows of the field , as it was not intended to attack seriously from this side . The Turkish artillery kept up a good racket , and one battery in particular singled out the general 's staff and followed us closely , as we moved over the field , with its shells and shrapnel ; for the former we cared little , as they buried themselves in the ground , spattering the mud and snow over us , but the shrapnel breaking in the air just over your head , and its pieces and bullets screaming past you , has an ugly and disagreeable sound . In about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the battle was in full play . It was not an exciting spectacle . The whole plan of the fight , which lasted this day ( January i5th ) and the two following days , was to hold the Turks , with whose rear the Russians had caught up , in place , while other portions of the Russian troops should pass around their right and rear , and either capture the whole force or cut them off from their line of retreat along the high road , and drive them into the Rhodope Mountains . The part assigned to Count Shouvaloff 's troops was therefore to simply engage the Turks with sufficient energy to keep them in position . This sort of affair was entirely deficient in the dramatic grandeur of the magnificent advances in line at Plevna . The two lines now lay down , firing away // at each other with right good will , and the artillery on each side increasing the din . But on either side there was no movement visible except of couriers or generals moving along their men , or occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , a few hundred yards behind the line of skirmishers , nearly an hour , watching the monotonous progress of the fight . We were a group of perhaps twenty horsemen in all , counting the orderlies , and we were under a large branching tree , hoping that this would make us less prominent . But the singing of the bullets gradually increased in such a degree as to let us know that we were becoming a special target . Finally the well-known " s-s-s-s-stuj " of a bullet that has struck , as distinct from the " whiss-s-s-s " of one that has gone by , made us all turn , and we saw a young orderly officer in the rear of the group bending over his saddle , with his hand at his head . He fell from his horse into the arms of a couple of Cossacks who had dismounted to help him , and was laid down in the snow , while the nearest passing stretcher was called to carry him off . The bullet had passed through his forehead , and he was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his overcoat , it was then noticed that he had another bullet directly through his heart . Strange fate , that out of twenty men standing quietly under fire for an hour , but one , and he the youngest , should be hit , and with two bullets simultaneously , either one of which was certainly fatal ! This incident warned us to move away from this place , and we rode slowly across to a part of the ground where a small brook , with banks about four feet high , meandered through the field . The general peremptorily ordered his staff to dismount and sit down under the shelter of the bank , and to have their horses led behind a neighboring clump of bushes . He , Major Liegnitz and myself then walked up and down for a while , looking at the Turkish line , and talking of the probable result of the day . Presently two or three of the horses were hit , and the general then politely requested Liegnitz and myself to also shelter ourselves under the bank . He was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the picture of him , in his long overcoat , pacing up and down in the snow , the noise , but inertness of the battle , and the incessant whizzing of the bullets over our heads . Many of them , plunging just over us , traced little furrows in the snow , barely beyond our feet ; and we commented on the infinite variety which could be made in the simple sound of " whiss-s-s-s . " Two or three hours later , as no new developments were taking place here , I determined to set out to find General Gourko , the commanding general , and learn the news of the battle on the other flank . I rode back with my orderly over the field , past the reserves and back into the village . Here were some temporary hospitals in the huts , and here also were the skulkers , who are always found in the rear of every battle-field . Little groups of five or six men , who had probably got there by bringing back the wounded , were crouched against the hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating , amusing themselves in any way , in as utter disregard of the battle which was roaring in their ears , and in which the lives of their comrades were at stake , as if they had been at home in Russia . Crossing the river again , I saw considerable masses of troops in reserve lying down in the fields , and was warned by an officer that the direct road to the left of the Russian position was commanded by a very heavy fire , and that I would do well to circle around behind the troops . The river was bordered with quite a considerable growth of small trees , which shut out the Turks from direct view , but the bullets which came whistling from that direction gave very plain indication of their whereabouts . The plain was dotted here and there with ancient tumuli , about eight to ten feet high , and I rode from one to another of these in search of General Gourko . I finally saw in the distance a considerable number of horses and dismounted men behind one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his staff . He and his chief of staff were stretched flat on the top of the mound , peering over the top with their glasses , and the rest of the group were crowded together at its base . As I came up he turned around and slid down the mound for a short distance , and asked me to sit down and tell him how things were going in Count Shouvaloff 's front , and also asked if I had seen anything on my way of a certain brigade whose arrival he was awaiting with the utmost impatience , as they were to move around the flank of the enemy and block his retreat . How very prosaic a modern battle can be with its long-range mnskets , and especially in the middle of January , with the // thermometer away below freezing ! There was a deafening roar , two curving lines of black dots could just be distinguished in the snow , and the bullets were singing over our heads as we squatted behind a mound-and that was all of the picture . Yet it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to go parading up and down the field to draw the fire of sharpshooters . He was in the most central part of the field and on the greatest eminence - insignificant as it was-that the field afforded . Nevertheless , at the time I could not help thinking how tame it all was , as a mere spectacle ,  --  how little action there was in it . Yet this is the characteristic of nearly all battles now , up to the last moment of the final advance , which is decisive of victory or defeat , but which seldom lasts half an hour . The range of the infantry aim is so great ( a mile and a quarter ) that the action may become fierce , and many thousands of men can be hit without either side clearly seeing its opponents , and one must be well inside the line of infantry fire to follow the movements clearly , even with a glass . Cavalry charges can not stand under the withering fire of rapid breech-loaders , and the final advance of infantry will only be made after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dramatic features of battle have become very short-lived and infrequent . This day 's fight brought no permanent result . The brigade that was to get in rear of the Turks came too late , and the latter slipped through the gap and took up another position a few miles in rear . As night came on the firing simmered down , and the general and staff sought the nearest village for shelter . In the morning , the battle was renewed on the same principle as before-of trying to hold the Turks on one side and get around them on the other . While it was going on , the general and staff rode along the road toward the left of his position , near the large town of Philippopolis , about four miles off . This town is peculiarly situated . It was founded in the days of the conquests of Philip of Macedon , when war was made at short range , and the party who was the highest had a great advantage ; and when a town situated on an eminence , from which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good defense . For these reasons , the town was perched on the sides of three abrupt rocky eminences which rise in solitary grandeur from the midst of a plain , which is hardly broken for twenty miles in one direction and sixty in another . Its appearance is at once unique and striking . It stood boldly out against the sky as we rode toward it , and our thoughts naturally drifted back through the long series of strange scenes it has witnessed during these last three and twenty centuries . There is no bloodier cockpit in all Europe than these plains of ancient Thrace , the fertile and beautiful valley of the Maritza or Hebrus . Here the Macedonians , under Philip and Alexander , first subdued the Thracian tribes ; here the Romans , under Trajan and Adrian , passed on their conquests of the lands beyond the Danube ; here they built roads and other public works during their administration , which still exist to-day . Here the Bulgarians fought for the foundation of their kingdom out of the tottering ruins of the Roman Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts of Christians and Turks have surged back and forward for the past five centuries ; and here , finally , under the shadow of the three rocky peaks on which Philip of Macedon founded the town of his own name in the fourth century before Christ , was now being fought the last great battle of the latest war in the long series of those which have been fought on the questions of whether the Turks shall live and govern in Europe . The mind is staggered by the long retrospect of history which the associations of this place call forth , and we felt that we were now assisting at one of the not least important steps of that development of historical sequence . The advance of this Christian army and the retreat of the Mahommedan , and the still more important migration of the immense numbers of refugees in front of us , marked one of the final steps-not the last , but very near it-of that retrocession of the Turkish wave of conquest , which came into Europe only to blight every land where it penetrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and early in the next century , at the latest , will be gone forever . The battle of Philippopolis lasted throughout the r5th , *6th and 17th of January . On the afternoon of the last day , the Russians had gained positions on three sides of the Turks and cut them off from their line of retreat toward Adrianople . The latter fought with their backs to the mountains , and fought hard and well , as the Turkish rank and file always do . But , on a final advance of the Russians , they were obliged to abandon all their artillery and train , and // disperse in small bands over the Rhodope Mountains to the IEgean . Pursuit was impossible , and these scattered detachments pursued their way unmolested until , two weeks later , they reached the shores of the sea , and were picked up by ships of the Turkish navy and transported to Constantinople . The Shipka army having been captured in bulk , and Suleiman 's Sophia army having been routed and dispersed , no armed force of any magnitude lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained there four days to refit , then pressed on to Adrianople , where we found General Skobeleff 's detachment , which had arrived two days before us . From there the advance again pushed forward and came in front of the lines of Tchekmedje , the defenses of Constantinople , on the 3ist of January , just fifty-two days after the fall of Plevna . On the same day the armistice was signed which put an end to active operations . In these fifty-two days , the column which I had the honor to accompany had marched six hundred miles and had crossed two high ranges of mountains . The combined Rus sian forces had captured one army of 40,000 men , dispersed another of 50,000 men , had taken 213 pieces of artillery , over io , ooo , ooo rounds of cartridges. , 12,000,000 rations and enormous , numbers of tents , baggage , pontoons , and military supplies of every description . They had , in short , for the moment annihilated the military power of Turkey , and were only deterred from entering Constantinople by questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , and the sufferings which they endured in the snow and ice of these fifty-two days of midwinter , I have endeavored to explain elsewhere ; * their self-abnegation and cheerfulness under great physical suffering , to which their brilliant success was pre-eminently due , are excelled by nothing of which we have any record in history , and they entitle every man of those trans-Balkan columns to the lasting gratitude of their own countrymen and the friends of Christian government everywhere , no less than to the admiration of the entire world , which still appreciates the value of military heroism . @
