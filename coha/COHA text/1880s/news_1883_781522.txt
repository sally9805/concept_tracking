txt The burning of the Garden City happened at the time of day when there is the least travel over the Long ' Island City ferry . The fire broke out just as the boat had left the slip , and the pilot was a brave and competent man . Had any one of those conditions been different , it is almost certain that the fire would have involved a large loss of life . Earlier in the morning ' or later lit the day the boat would have been crowded with passengers , and had the fire occurred while the boat was in the middle of the river the result-would have been a tragedy like that of the Seawanhaka . Ferry-boats built after the American pattern , with a superstructure of light pine wood soaked with oil and turpentine , will burn , as did . the Garden City , like tinder wood whenever they take fire . ' Of course they will continue to be built in the ' same way , but there are precautions against fire which might be taken without robbing them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat-builders . The Garden City 's tiller ropes were burned just before the boat reached the slip , thus depriving the pilot of all control of her . Why wereot chains instead of ropes used ? When a boat is on fire it is of the first importance that the pilot should be able to steer her ; but where ropes are used to connect the wheel and the tiller , they are almost sure to take fire , and so render the boat ungovernable . There is on almost every ferry-boat a spare tiller , meant to be used in case the tiller ropes are broken . There was such a tiller on board the Garden City , and it was brought into use after the fire was extinguished and the wreck was about to be towed up the river . It is asserted that it took two'men with axes twelve minutes to chop away the deck planks so that this tiller could be shipped . It was therefore quite worthless as a resource in the case of a sudden emergency . It would be interesting to know if tithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than twelve minutes . If they are like that of the Garden City they might as well be left on shore . ' The fire is believed to have started near the funnel , the heat of which had baked the wood and rendered it nearly as inflammable as a sulphur match . For this there can be no excuse , for it is perfectly easy to protect the wood-work in the neighborhood of a steam-boat 's funnel from heat . It is alleged that not very long ago another ferry-boat belonging to the East River Ferry Company took fire in. the same way , and it is probable that the same carelessness which/made it possible for the Garden City to be set on . fire characterizes the management of all our ferry-boats . It should be made part of the Steam-boat ; Inspector 's duty to see that the wood-work in the neighborhood of the boiler and the funnel of every steam-boat is properly protected against heat , and until this is done , .. fires are liable to break out at any moment ' on the ferry-boats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , there was no petroleum on board the Garden- City . As Long . Island City is the head-quarters of the oil refining business , the boats of the Long Island City ferries constantly carry trucks loadeclwith crude or ' refined coal-oil . There was some excuse for this before the Brooklyn bridge was built ; but there is now none whatever . A ferry-boat loaded with inflamm.able oil is as dangerous in case of fire as a powder magazine , and it is anoutrage that boats carrying passengers should also be permitted to carry coal-oil . Some day a ferry-boat will take fire in the middle of the river when crowded-with passengers . There will be a panic , of course , and the pilot may not be a man of the heroic mold of NEIL NELso-.3 ? for the latter fairly earned the title of hero-during the Garden City fire . There will then be a tragedy which will compel people to comprehend the risks which they run on board our ferry-boats . It would be well , however , if they would comprehend this without the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be taken to render travel on board ferry-boats comparatively safe .
