OUR HUNDRED DAYS IN EUROPE. * I. I BEGIN this record with the columnar , self-reliant capital letter to signify that there is no disguise in its egoisms . If it were a chapter of autobiography , this is what the reader would look for as a matter of course . Let him consider it as being such a chapter , and its egoisms will require no apology . I have called the record our hundred days , because I was accompanied by my daughter , without the aid of whose younger eyes and livelier memory , and especially of her faithful diary , which no fatigue or indisposition was allowed to interrupt , the whole experience would have remained in my memory as a photograph out of focus . We left Boston on the 29th of April , and reached New York on the 29th of August , four months of absence in all , of which nearly three weeks were taken up by the two passages , one week was spent in Paris , and the rest of the time in England . No one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Gladstone , a strong man for his years , is reported as saying that he is too old to travel , at least to cross the ocean , and he is younger than I am , - just four months , to a day , younger . It is true that Sir Henry Holland came to this country , and travelled freely about the world , after he was eighty years old ; but his pitcher went to the well once too often , and met the usual doom of fragile articles . When my friends asked me why I did not go to Europe , I reminded them of the fate of Thomas Parr . He was only twice my age , and was getting on finely towards his two hundredth year , when the Earl of Arundel carried him up to London , and , being feasted and made a lion of , he found there a premature and early grave at the age of only one hundred and fifty-two years . He lies in Westminster Abbey , it is true , but lie would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under side of the slab which covers him . I should never have thought of such an expedition if it had not been suggested by another member of my family that I should accompany my daughter , who was meditating a trip to Europe . I remem // bered how many friends had told me I ought to go ; among the rest , Mr. Emerson , who had spoken to me repeatedly about it . I had not seen Europe for more than half a century , and I had a certain longing for one more sight of the places I remembered , and others it would be a delight to look upon . There were a few living persons whom I wished to meet . I was assured that I should be kindly received in England . All this was tempting enough , but there was an obstacle in the way which I feared , and , as it proved , not without good reason . I doubted whether I could possibly breathe in a narrow state-room . In certain localities I have found myself liable to attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , I felt sure that I could not escape it if I tried to sleep in a stateroom . I did not escape it , and I am glad to tell my story about it , because it excuses some of my involuntary social shortcomings , and enables me to thank collectively all those kind members of the profession who trained all the artillery of the pharmacopcEia upon my troublesome enemy , from bicarbonate of soda and Vichy water to arsenic and dynamite . One costly contrivance , sent me by the Reverend Mr. H , whom I have never duly thanked for it , looked more like an angelic trump for me to blow in a better world than what I believe it is , an inhaling tube intended to prolong my mortal respiration . The best thing in my experience was recommended to me by an old friend in London . It was Himrod 's asthma cure , one of the many powders , the smoke of which when burning is inhaled . It is made in Providence , Rhode Island , and I had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give at least temporary relief , but nothing enabled me to sleep in my state-room , though I had it all to myself , the upper bed being removed . After the first night and part of the second , I never lay down at all while at sea . The captain allowed me to have a candle and sit up in the saloon , where I worried through the night as I best might . How could I be in a fitting condition to accept the attention of my friends in Liverpool , after sitting up every night for more than a week ; and how could I be in a mood for the catechizing of interviewers , without having once lain down during the whole return passage ? I hope the reader will see why I mention these facts . They explain and excuse many things ; they have been alluded to , sometimes with exaggeration , in the newspapers , and I could not tell my story fairly without mentioning them . I got along well enough as soon as I landed , and have had no return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home . I will not advertise an assortment of asthma remedies for sale , but I assure my kind friends I have had no use for any one of them since I have walked the Boston pavements , drank , not the Cochituate , but the Belmont spring water , and breathed the lusty air of my native northeasters . My companion and myself required an attendant , and we found one of those useful androgynous personages known as courier-maids , who had travelled with friends of ours , and who was ready to start with us at a moment 's warning . She was of English birth , lively , shortgaited , serviceable , more especially in the first of her dual capacities . So far as my wants were concerned , I found her zealous and active in providing for my comfort . It was no sooner announced in the papers that I was going to England than I began to hear of preparations to welcome me . An invitation to a club meeting was cabled across the Atlantic . One of my countrywomen who has a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her residence . A reverend friend , who thought I had certain projects in my head , wrote to me about lecturing : where I should appear , what fees I should obtain , and such business matters . I replied that I was going to // England to spend money , not to make it ; to hear speeches , very possibly , but not to make them ; to revisit scenes I had known in my younger days ; to get a little change of my routine , which I certainly did ; and to enjoy a little rest , which I as certainly did not in London . In a word , I wished a short vacation , and had no thought of doing anything more important than rubbing a little rust off and enjoying myself , while at the same time I could make my companion 's visit somewhat pleasanter than it would be if she went without me . The visit has answered most of its purposes for both of us , and if we have saved a few recollections which our friends can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a work of supererogation . The Cephalonia was to sail at half past six in the morning , and at that early hour a company of well-wishers was gathered on the wharf at East Boston to bid us good-by . We took with us many tokens of their thoughtful kindness ; flowers and fruits from Boston and Cambridge , and a basket of champagne from a Concord friend whose company is as exhilarating as the sparkling wine he sent us . With the other gifts came a small tin box , about as big as a common round wooden match box . I supposed it to hold some pretty gimcrack , sent as a pleasant parting token of remembrance . It proved to be a most valued daily companion , useful at all times , never more so than when the winds were Aowing hard and the ship was struggling with the waves . There must have been some magic secret in it , for I am sure that I looked five years younger after closing that little box than when I opened it . Time will explain its mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-going experts we had attended to . Impermeable rugs and fleecy shawls , head-gear to defy the rudest northeasters , sea-chairs of ample dimensions , which we took care to place in as sheltered situations as we could find , - all these were a matter of course . Everybody stays on deck as much as possible , and lies wrapped up and spread out at full length on his or her sea-chair , so that the deck looks as if it had a row of mummies on exhibition . Nothing is more comfortable , nothing , I should say , more indispensable , than a hot-water bag , - or rather , two hot-water bags ; for they will burst sometimes , as we found out , and a passenger who has become intimate with one of these warm bosom friends feels its loss almost as if it were human . Passengers carry all sorts of luxuries on board , in the firm faith that they shall be able to profit by them all . Friends send them various indigestibles . To many all these well-meant preparations soon become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Sic(k) vos non vobis . The tougher neighbor is the gainer by these acts of kindness ; the generosity of a sea-sick sufferer in giving away the delicacies which seemed so desirable on starting is not ranked very high on the books of the rccording angel . With us three things were best : grapes , oranges , and especially oysters , of which we had provided a half barrel in the shell . The " butcher " of the ship opened them fresh for us every day , and they were more acceptable than anything else . Among our ship 's company were a number of family relatives and acquaintances . We formed a natural group at one of the tables , where we met in more or less complete numbers . I myself never missed ; my companion , rarely . Others were sometimes absent , and sometimes came to time when they were in a very doubtful state , looking as if they were saying to themselves , with Lear , - " Down , thou climbing sorrow , Thy element s below . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say that faces were prevailingly vacuous , their owners half hypnotized , as it seemed , by the monotonous throb and tremor of the great sea - monster on whose back we were riding . I myself had few thoughts , fancies , emotions . One , thing above all struck me as never before , - the terrible solitude of the ocean . " So lonely t was that God himself Scarce seen*d there to be . " Whole days passed without our seeing a single sail . The creatures of the deep which gather around sailing vessels are perhaps frightened off by the noise and stir of the steamship . At any rate , we saw nothing more than a few porpoises , so far as I remember . No man can find himself over the abysses , the floor of which is paved with wrecks and white with the bones of the shrieking myriads whom the waves have swallowed up , without some thought of the dread possibilities hanging over his fate . There is only one way to get rid of them ; that which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one s self under opiates until he wakes up in the harbor where he is bound . I did not take this as serious advice , but its meaning is that one who has all his senses about him can not help being anxious . My old friend , whose beard had been shaken in many a tempest , knew too well that there is cause enough for anxiety . What does the reader suppose was the source of the most ominous thought which forced itself upon my mind , as I walked the decks of the mighty vessel ? Not the sound of the rushing winds , nor the sight of the foam-crested billows ; not the sense of the awful imprisoned force which was wrestling in the depths below me . The ship is made to struggle with the elements , and the giant has been tamed to obedience , and is manacled in bonds which an earthquake would hardly rend asunder . No ! It was the sight of the boats hanging along at the sides of the deck , - the boats , always suggesting the fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in the watery Sahara , shelterless , fireless , almost foodless , with a fate before him he dares not contemplate . No doubt we should feel worse without the boats ; still they are dreadful tell-tales . To all who remember G*ricault 's Wreck of the Medusa , - and those who have seen it do not forget it , - the picture the mind draws is one it shudders at . To be sure , the poor wretches in the picture were on a raft , but to think of fifty people in one of these open boats ! Let us go down into the cabin , where at least we shall not see them . The first morning at sea revealed the mystery of the little round tin box . The process of shaving , never a delightful one , is a very unpleasant and awkward piece of business when the floor on which one stands , the glass in which he looks , and he himself are all describing those complex curves which make cycles and epicycles seem like simplicity itself . The little box contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past twenty-four hours with a thoroughness , a rapidity , a security , and a facility which were a surprise , ahuost a revelation . The idea of a guarded cutting edge is an old one ; I remember the " Plantagenet " razor , so called , with the comb-lil e row of blunt teeth , leaving just enough of the edge free to do its work . But this little affair had a blade only an inch and a half long by three quarters of an inch wide . It had a long slender handle , which took apart for packing , and was put together with the greatest ease . It was , in short , a lawn-mower for the masculine growth of which the proprietor wishes to rid his countenance . The mowing operation required no glass , could be performed with almost reckless boldness , as one can not cut himself , and in fact had become a pleasant amusement instead of an irksome task . I have never used // any other means of shaving from that day to this . I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonsors of Burlington Arcade , half afraid they would assassinate me for bringing in an innovation which bid fair to destroy their business . They probably took me for an agent of the manufacturers and so I was , but not in their pay nor with their knowledge . I determined to let other persons know what a convenience I had found the " Star Razor " of Messrs . Kampf , of Brooklyn , New York , without fear of reproach for so doing . I know my danger , - does not Lord Byron say , " I have even been accused of writing puffs for Warren 's blacking " ? I was once offered pay for a poem in praise of a certain stove-polish , but I declined . It is pure good-will to my race which leads me to commend the Star Razor to all who travel by land or by sea , as well as to all who stay at home . With the first sight of land many a passenger draws a long sigh of relief . Yet everybody knows that the worst ( lancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the shore , for there are several ways of landing , not all of which are equally desirable . On Saturday , May 8th , we first caught a glimpse of the Irish coast , and at half past four in the afternoon we reached the harbor of Queenstown . A tug came off , bringing newspapers , letters , and so forth , among the rest some thirty letters and telegrams for me . This did not look much like rest , but this was only a slight prelude to what was to follow . I was in no condition to go on shore for sightseeing , as some of the passengers did . We made our way through the fog towards Liverpool* and arrived at 1.30 on Sunday , May 9th . A special tug came to take us off : on it were the American consul , Mr. Russell , the viceconsul , Mr. Sewall , Dr. N , and Mr. R- , who came on behalf of our as yet unseen friend , Mr. W , of Brigh ton , England . Our Liverpool friends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , we were equal to supporting . They very kindly , however , acquiesced in our wishes , which were for as much rest as we could possibly get before any attempt to busy ourselves with social engagements . So they convoyed us to the Grand Hotel for a short time , and then saw us safely off to the station to take the train for Chester , where we arrived in due season , and soon found ourselves comfortably established at the Grosvenor Arms Hotel . A large basket of Surrey primroses was brought by Mr. R to my companion . I had set before me at the hotel a very handsome floral harp , which my friend 's friend had offered me as a tribute . It made melody in my ears as sweet as those hyacinths of Shelley 's , the music of whose bells was so " delicate , soft , and inten. e , It was felt like an odor within the sense . " At Chester we had the blissful security of being unknown , and were left to ourselves . Americans know Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they so frequently stop there awhile on their way from Liverpool to London . It has a mouldy old cathedral , an old wall , partly Roman , strange old houses with overhanging upper floors , which make sheltered sidewalks and dark basements . When one sees an old house in New England with the second floor projecting a foot or two beyond the wall of the ground floor , the country boy will tell him that " them haouses was built so th't th ' folks up-stairs could shoot the Injins when they was tryin to git threew th ' door or int ' th ' winder . " There are plenty of such houses all over England , where there are no " Injins " to shoot . But the story adds interest to the lean traditions of our somewhat dreary past , and it is hardly worth while to disturb it . I always heard it iii my boyhood . Perhaps it is true ; certainly it was a very convenient arrangement for discouraging // an untimely visit . The porches with oval lookouts , common in Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walk round the old wall of Chester is wonderfully interesting and beautiful . At one part it overlooks a wide level field , over which the annual races are run . I noticed that here as elsewhere the short grass was starred with daisies . They are not considered in place in a wellkept lawn . But remembering the cuckoo song in Love 's Labour Lost , " When daisies pied . . . do paint the meadows with delight , " it was hard to look at them as intruders . The old cathedral seemed to me particularly mouldy , and in fact too highflavored with antiquity . I could not help comparing some of the ancient cathedrals and abbey churches to so many old cheeses . They have a tough gray rind and a rich interior , which find food and lodging for numerous tenants , who live and die under their shelter or their shadow , lowly servitors some of them , portly dignitaries others , humble , holy ministers of religion many , I doubt not , - larvae of angels , who will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the comparison so far , but I can not help it ; for Cheshire cheeses are among the first things we think of as we enter that section of the country , and this venerable cathedral is the first that greets the eyes of great numbers of Americans . We drove out to Eaton Hall , the seat of the Duke of Westminster , the manymillioned lord of a good part of London . It is a palace , high-roofed , marblecolumned , vast , magnificent , everything but homelike , and perhaps homelike to persons born and bred in such edifices . A painter like Paul Veronese finds a palace like this not too grand for his banqueting scencs . But to those who live , as most of us do , in houses of moderate dimensions , snug , comfortable , which the owner 's presence fills sufficiently , leaving room for a few visitors , a vast marble palace is disheartening and uninviting . I never get into a very large and lofty saloon without feeling as if I were a weak solution of myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space about me . The wigwam is more homelike than the cavern . Our wooden houses are a better kind of wigwam ; the marble palaces are artificial caverns , vast , resonant , chilling , good to visit , not desirable to live in , for most of us . One 's individuality should betray itself in all that surrounds him ; he should secrete his shell , like a mollusk ; if he can sprinkle a few pearls through it , so much the better . The moral is that one should avoid being a duke and living in a palace , unless he is born to it , which he had perhaps better not be , - that is , if he has his choice in the robing chamber where souls are fitted with their earthly garments . One of the most interesting parts of my visit to Eaton Hall was my tour through the stables . The Duke is a famous breeder and lover of the turf . Mr. R and myself soon made the acquaintance of the chief of the stable department . Readers of Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an epithet applied as a chief honor to the most illustrious heroes . It is the last word of the last line of the Ilind , and fitly closes the account of the funei al pageant of Hector , the tamer of horses . We Americans are a little shy of confessing that any title or conventional grandeur makes an impression upon us . If at home we wince before any official with a sense of blighted inferiority , it is by general confession the clerk at the hotel office . There is an excuse for this , inasmuch as he holds our destinies in his hands , and decides whether , in case of accident , we shall have to jump from the third or the sixth story window . Lesser grandeurs do not find us very impressible . There is , however , something about the man who deals in horses which takes down the spirit , however proud . of him who is un // skilled in equestrian matters and unused to the horse-lover 's vocabulary . We followed the master of the stables , meekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fall back on my reserves , and summoned up memories half a century old to gain the respect and win the confidence of the great horse-subduer . He showed us various fine animals , some in their stalls , some outside of them . Chief of all was the renowned Bend Or , a Derby winner , a noble and beautiful bay , destined in a few weeks to gain new honors on the same turf in the triumph of his offspring Ormonde , whose acquaintance we shall make by and by . The next day , Tuesday , May 11th , at 4.25 , we took the train for London . We had a saloon car , which had been thoughtfully secured for us through unseen , not unsuspected , agencies , which had also beautified the compartment with flowers . Here are soryie of my first impressions of England as seen from the carriage and from the cars . - How very English ! I recall Birket Foster 's Pictures of English Landscape , - a beautiful , poetical series of views , but hardly more poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our New England out - of - doors landscape often looks as if it had just got out of bed , and had not finished its toilet . The glowing green of everything strikes me : green hedges in place of our rail-fences , always ugly , and our rude stone-walls , which are not wanting in a certain look of fitness approaching to comeliness , and are really picturesque when lichen-coated , but poor features of landscape as compared to these universal hedges . I am disappointed in the trees , so far ; I have not seen one large tree as yet . Most of the trees are of very moderate dimensions , feathered all the way up their long slender trunks , with a lopsided mop of leaves at the top , like a wig which has slipped awry . I trust that I am not finding everything couleur de rose ; but I certainly do find the cheeks of children and young persons of such brilliant rosy hue as I do not remember that I have ever seen before . I am almost ready to think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink saucer . If the Saxon youth exposed for sale at Rome , in the days of Pope Gregory the Great , had complexions like these children , no wonder that the pontiff exclaimed , Not Angli , but angeli ! All this may sound a little extravagant , but I am giving my impressions without any intentional exaggeration . How far these first impressions may be modified by after-experiences there will be time enough to find out and to tell . It is better to set them down at once just as they are . A first impression is one never to be repeated ; the second look will see much that was not noticed , but it will not reproduce the sharp lines of the first proof , which is always interesting , no matter what the eye or the mind fixes upon . " I see men as trees walking . " That first experience could not be mended . When Dickens landed in Boston , he was struck with the brightness of all the objects he saw , - buildings , signs , and so forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very dingy , very massive , in the streets I drove through . So in London , but in a week it all seemed natural enough . We got to the hotel where we had engaged quarters , at eleven o'clock in the evening of Wednesday , the 12th of May . Everything was ready for us , - a bright fire blazing and supper waiting . When we came to look at the accommodations , we found they were not at all adapted to our needs . It was impossible to stay there another night . So early the next morning we sent out our courier maid , a dove from the ark , to find us a place where we could rest the soles of our feet . London is a nation of something like four millions of inhabitants , and one does not feel easy without he has an assured place // of shelter . The dove flew all over the habitable districts of the city , - inquired at as many as twenty houses . No roosting-place for our little flock of three . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape or another , pointed the wanderer to a place which corresponded with all our requirements and wishes . This was at No. 17 Dover Street , Mackellar 's Hotel , where we found ourselves comfortably lodged and well cared for during the whole time we were in London . It was close to Piccadilly , and closer still to Bond Street . Near us , in the same range , were Browns ' Hotel and Batt 's Hotel , both widely known to the temporary residents of London . We were but partially recovered from the fatigues and trials of the voyage when our arrival pulled the string of the social shower-bath , and the invitations began pouring down upon us so fast that we caught our breath , and felt as if we should be smothered . The first evening saw us at a great dinner-party at our well-remembered friend Lady H s . Twenty guests , celebrities and agreeable persons , with or without titles . The tables were radiant with silver , glistening with choice porcelain , blazing with a grand show of tulips . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lasts through the London season . After dinner came a grand reception , most interesting but fatiguing to persons hardly as yet in good condition for social service . We lived through it , however , and enjoyed meeting so many friends , known and unknown , who were very cor ( hal and pleasant in their way of receiving us . It was plain that we could not pretend to answer all the invitations which flooded our tables . If we had attempted it , we should have found no time for anything else . A secretary was evidently a matter of immediate necessity . Through the kindness of Mrs. P , we found a young lady who was exactly fitted for Mareb , the place . She was installed in the little room intended for her , and began the work of accepting with pleasure and regretting our inability , of acknowledging the receipt of books , flowers , and other objects , and being very sorry that we could not subscribe to this good object and attend that meeting in behalf of a deserving charity , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I can warrant were always genuine . The poor young lady was almost tired out sometimes , having to stay at her table , on one occasion , so late as eleven in the evening , to get through her day 's work . I simplified matters for her by giviiig her a set of formulae as a base to start from , and she proved very apt at the task of modifying each particular letter to suit its purpose . From this time forward continued a perpetual round of social engagements . Breakfasts , lunches , dinners , teas , receptioiis with spread tables , two , thr*e , and four deep of an evening , with receiving company at our own rooms , took up the day , so that we had very little time for common sight-seeing . Of these kinds of entertainment , the breakfast , though pleasant enough when the company is agreeable , as I always found it , is the least convenient of all times and modes of visiting . You have already interviewed one breakfast , and are expecting soon to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many stomachs as a ruminant , he would not mind three or four serious meals a day , not counting the tea as one of them . The luncheon is a very convenient affair : it does not require special dress it is informal ; it is soon over , and may be made light or heavy , as one chooses . The afternoon tea is almost a necessity in London life . It is considered useful as " a pick me up , " and it serves an admirable purpose in the social system . It costs the household hardly any trouble or expense . It brings people together in the easiest possible way , for ten mm // utes or an hour , just as their engagements or fancies may settle it . A cup of tea at the right moment does for the virtuous reveller all that Falstaff claims for a good sherris-sack , or at least the first half of its " twofold operation " It ascends me into the brain ; dries me there all the foolish and dull and cindy vapors which environ it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nimble , fiery and delectable shapes , which delivered over to the voice , the tongue , which is the birth , becomes excellent wit . " But it must have the right brain to work upon , and I doubt if there is any brain to which it is so congenial and from which it brings so much as that of a first-rate London old lady . I came away from the great city with the feelins ' that this most complex product of civilization was nowhere else developed to such perfection . The octogenarian Londoness has been in society - let us say the highest society - all her days . She is as tough as an old macaw , or she would not have lasted so long . She has seen and talked with all the celebrities of three generations , all the beauties of at least half a dozen decades . Her wits have been kept bright by constant use , and as she is free of speech it requires some courage to face her . Yet nobody can be more agreeable , even to young persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great beauty is almost certainly thinking how she looks while one is talking with her ; an authoress is waiting to have one praise her book ; but a grand old lady , who loves London society , who lives in it , who understands young people and all sorts of people , with her high-colored recollections of the past and her grand-maternal interests in the new generation , is the best of companions , especially over a cup of tea just strong enough to stir up her talking ganglions . A breakfast , a lunch , a tea , is a circumstance , an occurrence , in social life , but a dinner is an event . It is the fullblown flower of that cultivated growth of which those lesser products are the buds . I will not try to enumerate , still less to describe , the various entertainments to which we were invited , and many of which we attended . Among the professional friends I found or made during this visit to London , none were more kindly attentive than Dr. Priestley , who , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took more pains to carry out our wishes than we could have asked or hoped for . At his house I first met Sir James Paget and Sir William Gull , long well known to me , as to the medical profession everywhere , as prominent in their several departments . If I were an interviewer or a newspaper reporter , I should be tempted to give the impression which the men and women of distinction I met made upon me ; but where all were cordial , where all made me feel as nearly as they could that I belonged where I found myself , whether the ceiling were a low or a lofty one , I do not care to differentiate my hosts and my other friends . Fortemque Gyan fortemque Cloant hum , - I left my microscope and my test-papers at home . Our friends , several of them , had a pleasant way of sending their carriages to give us a drive in the Park , where , except in certain permitted regions , the common hired vehicles are not allowed to enter . Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's , Mrs. M s , where we had a pleasant little " tea , " and met one of the most agreeable and remarkable of those London old ladies I have spoken of . English people have queer notions about iced-water and ice-cream . " You will surely die , eating such cold stuff , " said a lady to my companion . " No , " she answered , " but I should certainly die were I to drink your two cups of strong tea . " I approved of this " counter " on the teacup , but I did not think either of them was in much danger . // Mrs. B. M sent her carriage for us to take us to a lunch at her house , where we met Mr. Browning , Oscar Wilde and his handsome wife , and other well-known guests . After lunch , recitations , songs , etc . House full of pretty things . Among other curiosities a portfolio of drawings illustrating Keeley 's motor , which , up to this time , has manifested a remarkably powerful vis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand reception at Lady G s , beginning ( for us , at least ) at eleven o'clock . The house a palace , and A thinks there were a thousand people there . We made the tour of the rooms , saw many great personages , had to wait for our carriage a long time , but got home at one o'clock . The next day Rev. Mr. H sent his carriage , and we drove in the Park . In the afternoon we went to our minister 's to see the American ladies who had been presented at the drawing-room . After this both of us were glad to pass a day or two in comparative quiet , except that we had a room full of visitors . So many persons expressed a desire to make our acquaintance that we thought it would be acceptable to them if we would give a reception ourselves . We were thinking how we could manage it with our rooms at the hotel , which were not arranged so that they could be thrown together . Still , we were planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priestley suggested that we should receive company at their house . This was a surprise , and a most welcome one , and A and her kind friend busied themselves at once about the arrangements . We went to a luncheon at LHouse , not far from our residence . My companion tells a little incident which may please an American six-year-old : " The eldest of the four children , Sibyl , a pretty , bright child of six , told me that she wrote a letter to the Queen . I said , Did you begin , Dear Queen ? ' No , ' she answered , I began , Your Majesty , and signed myself , Your little servant , Sibyl . ' " A very cordial and homelike reception at this great house , where a couple of hours were passed most agreeably . On the following Sunday I went to Westminster Abbey to hear a sermon from Canon Harford on A Cheerful Life . A lively , wholesome , and encouraging discourse , such as it would do many a forlorn New England congregation good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abbey . Met our Beverly neighbor , Mrs. V , and adopted her as one of our party . The seats we were to have were full , and we had to be stowed where there was any place that would hold us . I was smuggled into a stall , going through long and narrow passages , between crowded roxvs of people , and found myself at last with a big book before me and a set of official personages around me , whose duties I did not clearly understand . I thought they might be mimutes , or something of that sort , salaried to look grave and keep quiet . After service we took tea with Dean Bradley , and after tea we visited the Jerusalem Chamber . I had been twice invited to weddings in that famous room : once to the marriage of my friend Motley 's daughter , then to that of Mr. Frederick Locker 's daughter to Lionel Tennyson , whose recent death has been so deeply mourned . I never expected to see that Jerusalem , in which Harry the Fourth died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber , with all its associations . The older memories came up but vaguely ; an American finds it as hard to call back anything over two or three centuries old as a suckingpump to draw up water from a depth of over thirty-three feet and a fraction . Af ter this A went to a musical party , dined with the V s , and had a good time among American friends . The next evening we went to the Lyceum Theatre to see Mr. Irving . He had placed the Royal box at our disposal , so we invited our friends the P s to go // with us , and we all enjoyed the evening mightily . Between the scenes we went behind the curtain , and saw the very curious and admirable machinery of the dramatic spectacle . We made the ac ( luaintance of several imps and demons , who were got up wonderfully well . Ellen Terry was as fascinating as ever . I reinembered that once before I had met her and Mr. Irving behind the scenes . It was at the Boston Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy 1 ) iece of scenery came crashing down , and filled the whole place with dust . It was but a short distance from where we were standing , and I could not help thinking how near our several life-dramas came to a simultaneous exeunt omtnes . A long visit from a polite interviewer , shopping , driving , calling , arranging about the people to be invited to our reception , and an agreeable dinner at Chelsea with my American friend , Mrs. Al , filled up this day full enough , and left us in good condition for the next , which was to be a very busy one . In the brief account of my first visit to England , more than half a century ago , I mentioned the fact that I went to the famous Derby race at Epsom . I determined , if possible , to see the Derby of 1886 , as I had seen that of 1834 . I must have spoken of this intention to some interviewer , for I find the following paragraph in an English sporting newspaper , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derby has always been the one event in the racing year which statesmen , philosophers , poets , essayists , and litte'rateurs desire to see once in their lives . A few years since Air . Gladstone was induced by Lord Granville and Lord Wolverton to run down to Epsom on the Derby day . The impression produced upon the Prime Minister 's sensitive and emotional mind was that the mirth and hilarity displayed by his compatriots upon Epsom race-course was Italian rather than English in its character . On the other hand , Gustave Dor6 , who also saw the Derby for the first and only time in his life , exclaimed , as he gazed with horror upon the faces below him , Queue se*ne brutale / We wonder to which of these two impressions Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes inclined , if he went last Wednesday to Epsom ! Probably the well-known , etc. , etc. , Of one thing Dr. Holmes may rest finally satisfied : the Derby of 1886 may possibly have seemed to him far less exciting than that of 1834 ; but neither in 1834 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by a better sportsman or more honorable man than the Duke of Westminster . " My desire to see the Derby of this year was of the same origin and character as that which led me to revisit many scenes which I remembered . I cared quite as much about renewing old impressions as about getting new ones . I enjoyed everything which I had once seen all the more from the blending of my recollections with the present as it was before me . The Derby day of 1834 was exceedingly windy and dusty . Our party , riding on the outside of the coach , was half smothered with the dust , and arrived in a very deteriorated condition , but recompensed for it by the extraordinary sights we had witnessed . There was no train in those days , and the whole road between London and Epsom was choked with vehicles of all kinds , from four-in-hands to donkeycarts and wheelbarrows . My friends and I mingled freely in the crowds , and saw all the " humors " of the occasion . The thimble-riggers were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cups or thimbles , and the " little jokers , " and the coachman , the sham gentleman , the country greenhorn , all properly got np and gathered about the table . I think we had " Aunt Sally , " too , - the figure with a pipe in her mouth , which one might shy a stick at for a penny or two and win something , I // forget what . The clearing the course of stragglers , and the chasing about of the frightened little dog who had got in between the thick ranks of spectators , reminded me of what I used to see on old " artillery election " days . It was no common race that I went to see in 1834 . " It is asserted in the columns of a contemporary that Plenipotentiary was absolutely the best horse of the century . " This was the winner of the race I saw so long ago . Herring 's colored portrait , which I have always kept , shows him as a great , powerful chestnut horse , well deserving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jockeys applied to him . " Rumor credits Dr. Holmes , " so The Field says , " with desiring mentally to compare his two Derbies with each other . " I was most fortunate in my objects of comparison . The horse I was about to see win was not unworthy of being named with the renowned champion of my earlier day . I quote from a writer in the London Morning Post , whose words , it will be seen , carry authority with them - " Deep as has hitherto been my reverence for Plenipotentiary , Bay Middleton , and Queen of Trumps from hearsay , and for Don John , Crucifix , etc. , etc. , from my own personal knowledge , I am inclined to award the palm to Ormonde as the best three-year-old I have ever seen during close upon half a century 's connection with the turf . " Ormonde , the Duke of Westminster 's horse , was the son of that other winner of the Derby , Bend Or , whom I saw at Eaton Hall . Perhaps some coeval of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the race . I can not help that . I was off on my first long vacation for half a century , and had a right to my whims and fancies . But it was one thing to go in with a vast crowd at five and twenty , and another thing to run the risks of the excursion at more than thrice ' that age . I looked about me for means of going safely , and could think of nothing better than to ask one of the pleasantest and kindest of gentlemen , to whom I had a letter from Mr. Winthrop , at whose house I had had the pleasure of making his acquaintance . Lord R suggested that the best way would be for me to go in the special train which was to carry the Prince of Wales . First , then , I was to be introduced to his Royal Highness , which office was kindly undertaken by our very obliging and courteous Minister , Mr. Phelps . After this all was easily arranged , and I was cared for as well as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand I found myself in the midst of the great people , who were all very natural , and as much at their ease as the rest of the world . The Prince is of a lively temperament and a very cheerful aspect , - a young girl would call him " jolly " as well as " nice . " I could not help thinking of the story of " Mr. Pope " and his Prince of Wales , as told by Horace Walpole : " Mr. Pope , you do n't love princes . " " Sir , I beg your pardon . " " Well , you do n't love kings , then . " " Sir , I own I love the lion best before his claws are grown . " Certainly , nothing in Prince Albert Edward suggests any aggressive weapons or tendencies . The lovely , youthful-looking , gracious Alexandra , tile always affable and amiable Princess Louise , the tall youth who sees the crown and sceptre afar off in his dreams , the slips of girls so like many school misses we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on exhibition , but off enjoying themselves , just as I was and as other people were , seemed very much like their fellow-mortals . It is really easier to feel at home with the highest people in the land than with the awkward commoner who was knighted yesterday . When " My Lord and Sir Paul " came into the Club which Goldsmith tells us of , the hilarity of the evening was instantly checked . The entrance of a dignitary like the present Prince of Wales would not have // spoiled the fun of the evening . If there is any one accomplishment specially belonging to princes , it is that of making the persons they meet feel at ease . The grand stand to which I was admitted was a little privileged republic . I could not help remembering Thackeray 's story of his asking some simple question of a royal or semi-royal personage whom he met in the courtyard of an hotel , which question his Highness did not answer , but called a subordinate to answer for him . I had been talking some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nobleman to whom I had been introduced . Something led me to think I was mistaken in the identity of this gentleman . I asked him , at last , if he were not So and So . " No , " he said , " I am Prince Christian . " You are a Christian prince , anyhow , I said to myself , if I may judge by your manners . I once made a similar mistake in addressing a young fellow-citizen of some social pretensions . I apologized for my error . " No offence , " he answered . Offence indeed ! I should hope not . But he had not the " mani*re de prince , " or he would never have used that word . I must say something about the race I had taken so much pains to see . There was a preliminary race , which excited comparatively little interest . After this the horses were shown in the paddock , and many of our privileged party went down from the stand to look at them . Then they were brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit-stirring to look upon , - most beautiful of all the bay horse Ormonde , who could hardly be restrained , such was his eagerness for action . The horses disappear in the distance . - They are off , - not yet distinguishable , at least to me . A little waiting time , and they swim into our ken , but in what order of precedence it is as yet not easy to say . Here they come ! Two horses have emerged from the xuck , and are sweeping , rushing , storming , towards us , almost side by side . One slides by the other , half a length , a length , a length and a half . Those are Archer 's colors , and the beautiful bay Ormonde flashes by the line , winner of the Derby of 1886 . " The Bard " has made a good fight for the first place , and comes in second . Poor Archer , the king of the jockeys ! He will bestride no more Derby winners . A few weeks later he died by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yells of the betting crowd beneath us were incessant . It must have been the frantic cries and movements of these people that caused Gustave Dor* to characterize it as a brutal scene . The vast mob which thronged the wide space beyond the shouting circle just round us was much like that of any other fair , so far as I could see from my royal perch . The most conspicuous object was a man *n an immensely tall pair of stilts , stalking about among the crowd . I think it probable that I had as much enjoyment in forming one of the great mob in 1834 as I did among the grandeurs in 1886 , but the last is pleasanter to remember and especially to tell of . After the race we had a luncheon served us , a comfortable and substantial one , which was very far from unwelcome . I did not go to the Derby to bet on the winner . But as I went in to luncheon , I passed a gentleman standing in custody of a plate half covered with sovereigns . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a heap there was lying by the plate , and add a sovereign to the collection already there . I did so , and , unfolding my paper , found it was a blank , and passed on . The pool , as I afterwards learned , fell to the lot of the Turkish Ambassador . I found it very windy and uncomfortable on the more exposed parts of the grand stand , and was glad that I had taken a shawl with me , in which I wrapped myself as // if I had been on shipboard . This , I told my English friends , was the more civilized form of the Indian 's blanket . My report of the weather does not say much for the English May , but it was generally agreed upon that this was a backward and unpleasant spring . After my return from the race we went to a large dinner at Mr. Phelps 's house , where we met Mr. Browning again , and the Lord Chancellor Herschel , among others . Then to Mrs. C. F s , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lady R s , another of the private palaces , with ceilings lofty as firmaments , and walls that might have been copied from the New Jerusalem . There was still another great and splendid reception at Lady G s , and a party at Mrs. S s , but we were both tired enough to be willing to go home after what may be called a pretty good day 's work at enjoying ourselves . We had been a fortiiight in London , and were now inextricably entangled in the meshes of the golden web of London social life . Oliver Wendell Holmes .
