txt This Fall the voters of Brooklyn will have to elect a Mayor for the third time under the system of concentrated power and concentrated responsibility in the incumbent of the office . Under Mr. Low , both in the first and in the second of the terms for which he was chosen , the system has been amply vindicated . During his first term Mr. Low showed that by the substantial control given him in municipal matters a faithful and capable man could secure honest and economical government . He has proved this even more clearly during his second term , while his re-election two years ago was evidence that the system enabled the voters to know their own interests . and that when they knew them they would protect them . They have now had for four years a municipal administration as nearly perfect as it is possible to secure by any method of election yet tried in the United States . It has been careful , energetic , systematic , intelligent , and for the first time in the history of the city has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and in accordance with business principles and methods . Its chief merit has been its absolute independence and freedom from partisan influences . Not only has Mayor Low himself protected all his actions from any suspicion of such influences , but before it was required by the State law he and the heads of departments adopted and put in practice a system of selection for all subordinate places under the Government which rigidly excluded party politics and opened these places to free competition on the basis of proved superior fitness . This of itself was an enormous gain over anything that had ever been known in city ' administration in Brooklyn or elsewherd . That it was an immense advantage to the service no one familiar With the facts will deny . It was an equal advantage , as far as its influence has been felt , with regard to the political action of the people . So far as it was felt to be permanent it withdrew the patronage of the City Government as a corrupting force from the elections and left the voters free to ohoose their nominees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the minor offices , but according to their fitness . And this is the point that is most important with regard to the coming election . The politicians , by which term we mean the men who follow politics as a regu/ar occupation for their own gain , understand the working of the system originally adopted by Mayor Low , and now required by the State law , perfectly well . They know that it takes from them a large number of the prizes for which they contend . They would like to abolish or cripple that system . They would like the patronage of the City Government to be again made dependent on the results of elections . They are laying their plans to bring this about . They do not expect to get the law repealed by anything they can do this Fall , but they hope to get its application into the hands of those in. sympathy with themselves . They want a ' , Mayor who will work the law , not as Mr. Low has worked it , with the purpose of getting the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of rewarding the politicians . This desire is not confined to either party . It is the fstrongest among the Democrats , for they have the best chance of success , and the spoils-seeking element is relatively greater among them than among the Republicans . But the feeling exists in the Republican ranks also . It will be for the independent citizens of both parties to say whether this purpose shall succeed , or whether the admirable system now in force shall be maintained in the hands of a man who will be faithful to it . If Mr. Low would consent to continue the trust , should it be confided to him , he would be beyond all comparison the man to whom it should be given . If he will not , some man of like character should be chosen . Other things being equal there are reasons why such a man should now be chosen from among those connected in national or State politics with the Democratic Party , since it would strengthen the system practically to have it shown that it could be administered equally well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , politics should have but a very minor influence in the selection . and the voters should make it plain to the managers on both sides that only a capable man , loyal to the present system , will be tolerated , no matter what political claims may be presented .
