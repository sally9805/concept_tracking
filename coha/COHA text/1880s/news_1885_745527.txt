txt The experience of Mr. AQUILLA . JONES , lespite the easy manner in which he es ; apes from the inquiry of the Civil Service commission , marks a very interesting tage in the reform movement . Mr. JONES s a politician of the Indiana type . He is L representative of the class of which Vice-President HENDRICKS is the most onspicuous leader , and was appointed on , he latter 's urgent solicitation , quite re ; ardless of the . motives that have generilly determined appointments under Mr. JLEVELAND . He may indeed be said to ; tend as a specimen of the spoils system , Ls opposed to the system which retards public office as a public trust . Be went into the Post Office at Indianapolis with the avowed intention working it for all it was worth under the old methods , and had no idea that the new-fangled civil service rules would be any serious obstacle in his path . The investigators who have just reported say that " the evidence shows that the Postmaster in conversation declared a purpose to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite repugnant to the spirit and letter of the rules . " He is reported not to have carried out his " theory " in any case governed by the rules , but to have been very much astonished when he found what the rules really were , that they would be enforced , and that very serious consequences Would a-violation of them . This shows that the civil service law , within ' its very narrow limits , does exactly the work it was intended to do , and affords the best possible reason for extending its operation . It shows that an inveterate , unscrupulous , avowed spoilsman , backed by the sentiment of the majority party in his own city and sustained by the second highest officer in the Government , is absolutely powerless , within the range of the law , to prostitute his power of appointment to partisan or personal ends . It shows that the law , so far as it extends , protects the rights of the public , secures the best service obtainable for their money , opens employment under the Government on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , strips from politicians the power to bribe or coerce a public servant to do their dirty work , and makes the civil service an honorable career . Mr. AQUILLA JONES comes squarely up to the spoilsmongers ' standard . Their zealous organ , the New-York Sun , fervently prays , " Would there were more like him I " and suggests that he would be a good candidate for an elective office in Indiana . Yet Mr. JONES is as meek as a sucking dove when brought face to face with the civil service law and made to understand that its enforcement is in honest hands . So far as the law goes , this admirable spoilsman is as helpless to carry out the Sun 's idea of patronage and politics as if he were a conscientious civil service reformer . We desire to call the attention of the careless people who think that the essence of civil service reform is a life tenure , and also the attention of the designing editors who , with knowledge of its falsehood , try to extend this impression , that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules had nothing to do with his removals . He has made some very shameful ones , and when he made them the had a notion that he could fill the vacancies as contemptibly as he had made them . The civil service law did not prevent the removals . Save in a very limited way he rules do not restrain removals . They only declare that no one shall be threatened with removal to coerce his political action , or shall be removed for refusing political contributions or political service . Even these restrictions are practically of no avail if the officer violating them keep his motives to himself . And the law does not , nor do the rules , provide any punishment for an officer who makes arbitrary removals not coming under these narrow restrictions . But the law and the rules prescribe how vacancies coming within the system shall be filled , and it was the revelation of this fact that sicklied o'er Mr. JONES 'S native hue of resolution with the pale cast of thought . He found that the virtue of the law was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of these his sanguine plans of personal and political advancement through the " patronage " of his office were , within the scope of the law , utterly vain . And what the modest , restricted , tentative reform system that we now have has done with " Dlr . HENDRICKS 'S man " in Mr. HENDRICKS 'S Post Office the same system would do just as perfectly and easily , and even more so , if it were extended to the other parts of the service . It is the plain , practical , tested remedy for the corruption . of the civil service throughout its length and breadth by the politicians . It will do , wherever it is applied , exactly what it has done where it has been applied . This the people are gradually but surely learning , and the experience with the doughty and bragging Postmaster of the Vice-President will go a great way toward increasing their understanding of the matter . If there are any more of the spoilsmen who want to try conclusions with the reform system we trust they will promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best possible means of extending the reform , and we shall take care that it is fully and accurately related .
