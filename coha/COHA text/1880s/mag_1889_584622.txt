LEAVES FROM AN OLD JOURNAL . By Grace H. Peirce . I. IN the summer of 1817 I made an extraordinary acquaintance in Switzerland . On a certain July day I found myself at Grindelwald , and soon set out from the hotel , intending to take a stroll of about an hour , and with no other object in view than to get as near the glacier as possible . I mounted continually , and at last reached a narrow path on the rock where I was high above the glacier , with a wall of granite on the one hand and a sheer precipice of some hundred feet on the other . I had just made the reflection that a misstep might have serious consequences , when I slipped , grasped at the rock as I fell , and the next instant hung by my hands over the precipice . To raise myself was impossible , the rock sloped inward , and in that most horrible position I remained for a time which was long enough for the suffering of a hundred deaths in anticipation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anyone hearing me in that lonely place , but soon gave that up and simply clung in an agony , awaiting the terrible moment when I could cling no longer . Already my senses had nearly left me , when I was suddenly brought back to life by hearing a human voice singing , and that not far away . I called once more , then , with all the strength I could muster , and , a moment later , saw - for my head was just on a level with the path , as I held with one hand to a projection in the middle of it and to the edge of the rock with the other-I saw a man rush up , who , as he got to me , threw himself on the path and reaching down seized me below the arms . But now , whether I had held on so long that I could not let go or whether I dared not , he , at any rate , had all the difficulty in the world to induce me to loose my gripe on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he lifted me a little by main force ; I grasped him then , felt my knee against something , struggled , and the next thing of which I was conscious was of lying at full length on the path while my preserver bent over me and talked solicitously . It is singular how distinctly I can recall the sensations of that moment . I felt as I should suppose an infant must feel when people talk to it . Gradually , however , I began to derive some ideas from what he was saying , and found that he proposed to make me as comfortable as the circumstances permitted and then go in search of help . But while he divested himself of his coat and folded it together to put under my head , I found my voice and began to thank him feeblyfor his blessed intervention to save me from an awful death . He disclaimed at once any especial credit in the matter , declaring that while he was rejoiced to have been at hand , yet as what he had done had been without risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . With regard to the risk , I was not so sure of there being none when once I had clutched him , and , in any case , I was bound to have my say out . I have not yet mentioned that my preserver spoke French , and never in my life was I more glad than then of such knowledge as I possess of that language . For certainly it would be more endurable to be silent at a dinner-party or even in a bevy of pretty girls , than to be reduced to dumb-show with a man who has just saved your life . I said , therefore , as best I was able , what I felt on that subject and then begged him not to think of going for help , inasmuch as I had sustained no injury whatever beyond a few scratches and bruises , so that I should presently be able to get back to the hotel with no other aid than his , if I might venture to claim it . In this , // seeing that I was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to lie quietly for some time yet and make no effort to speak . So I watched him silently as he stood leaning against the rocky wall and looking at the wild scene about us or turning to me with , as I thought in my gratitude , the sweetest smile and the most amiable expression of countenance I had ever beheld . He was a fine , tall , broad-shouldered fellow , of a stronger build  --  to my good fortune-than one often sees among his countrymen ; very young-I decided at once that he must be two or three years my junior  --  and with a face which , if not actually handsome , was , by reason of a fresh complexion , dark eyes , and curling brown hair extremely taking and agreeable . I observed further that his clothing was fashionably made and his linen fine and delicate . Before long I was able to get up and then to walk ; so we set off , he a step in advance , I with my hand on his shoulder and keeping as far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were past that ticklish place and stopped awhile for me to rest , I bethought myself that it was time we knew what to call each other , and accordingly took out my card . He followed suit with his , and , smiling at the absurdity of such civilized compliments amid the wilds of nature , but both of us doubtless glad to find out whom we had there , we exchanged . On the card I received was , ilL Henri Nasson . After this little interlude we went on steadily , for I was quite recovered . Dwelling , however , all the while , on what I had gone through , I asked him how he happened to be there just in the nick of time . He said there was a fine view of the glacier not far from the scene of my accident , and he had started for that point , having visited it already the day before and been much struck with the grandeur of the spot . " Indeed ! " said I. " Then let us go there together ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation in his manner , as if this proposal took him by surprise , but when he said merely that he had arranged to leave Grindeiwald the next day , I thought no more of it . By the time we got back t*'the hotel the hour for the table-d'h6te was long past , and I asked my companion to give me the honor and pleasure of his company at dinner . That seemed to me the merest matter of course , but again there was a decided hesitancy . I might have taken it ill , only that I conceived his backwardness in accepting was due to a certain reserve , a sort of shyness which I began to notice in him . Altogether , he was not just what I had thought at first ; flushed then with the pleasure of having rendered such timely service there was a brightness about him which faded afterward ; I was quite surprised to discover in the course of our walk that his expression was naturally grave , almost sad ; that made him look older . However , as before said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might still be feeling the effects of my accident too much to desire his society ; I only insisted that his society was precisely what I desired . I would take no denial , and he yielded . We passed a pleasant evening together , though all I now remember of our conversation is an amiable diversity of opinion as to the merits of Mlle. Georges and Mile . Duchenois ; I thought the laP ter the better actress , while he was all for Georges . Naturally we were of one mind about Mlle. Mars and Talma . But it is not surprising that I recall so little of what he said , for he was no talker ; on the other hand , the most flattering listener I ever met in my life . I can see him now , his dark eyes fixed attentively , his serious face relaxing into a smile in the right places , always ready with whatever sentiment was called for-wonder , indignation , sympathy , or with the question that helps the story on . And this quite simply and unfeignedly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did say , however ; he told where he was going next , namely , straight to Geneva and thence home to Paris , and upon that there passed a momentary shadow over our harmony . It happened that I also was going to Geneva , for my aunt , who had been taking the waters ' at Aix-les-bains , had arranged to join me there , with my sister Frances , in order that they might visit Chamouni under my escort , and now , hearing // of Nasson 's plans , it instantly occurred to me that I should do well to go with him rather than stay a few days longer around Interlaken and Thun , as I had proposed . I was not quite sure , either , just when my aunt meant to reach Geneva , and it was advisable that I should be on hand to receive her ; also it would lessen my expenses considerably to take a carriage with Nasson , but my chief reason was for the companionship 's sake . There are times enough when one must be alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is agreeable , as his had been thus far . So I was now really annoyed to find him once more apparently taken aback by my advances . After all that . evening together ! After he had shared my bread and salt , so to speak , and when he seemed to find pleasure in my society ! I could not understand it , and let him see that I did not . It was my turn to be stiff But he flushed up then , and was so evidently concerned at my thinking his mauner ungracious , that he said something about having been , by force of circumstances , all his life much alone , which made him awkward in responding to friendly advances , and assured me so earnestly that indeed my company would be most welcome and agreeable to him if his were to me , and so on , that I soon relented , and it was settled we should travel together . When we parted for the night I remember it came over me again , in full force , how I owed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , instead of lying out there shattered on the rocks , I had a good many years of life before me that , God willing , I meant to make something of . That all came over me , with a warm feeling around the heart , and I suppose if I had been a Frenchman I should have embraced him , but he was not demonstrative , either , and I think he knew what I meant when I held his hands hard , for there was something at the same time in my eyes that I was a little bit ashamed of-though I verily believe there was in his , too  --  and so we said good-night . One little incident only of the journey I will recall . There was often a motley company of beggars collected around the inn where we dined or slept , to see the strangers off and scramb* for such small cash as they had to distribute . It was a nuisance , at least I thought so , but Nasson really laid in a stock of coms , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delight of those who got them . What I started to tell was a pretty kindness of his to one peculiarly wretched old woman . She was so decrepit as to have no chance at all among the swarming children ; every time she hobbled to pick up something , one of them got ahead of her , and made off with it . But when Nasson saw that , he was indignant . " For shame ! " he cried , " for shame ! Have none of you a grandmother ? Stand out of the way and let that old woman come up here ! " She came , and he slipped his fingers into another pocket , and leaning well forward so that I should not see , dropped something into her hand . She had barely time to look at it and burst into blessings on " his lordship " when we were off , but her shrill voice quavered after us , wishing him " a long life and a happy one ! " I glanced at him just then , and such a grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of days was a deplorable prospect . Then suddenly it flashed upon me what might be the matter with him . For when a man is young and has plenty of money what on earth should make him look solemn unless the one he loves is wedded to another ? That was precisely what I wanted , to explain his pensive airs . And I knew all about it myself , having been through the agony before I was out of my teens , although now I was heartless enough to mingle amusement with my silent sympathy . All the same , I felt not a little interest in his loveaffairs , even to reflecting that his afihiction , if such he had , might be due to cruel parents rather than a rival ; possibly she was not rich enough or grand enough ; or perhaps he had aspired too high . Had he been only half as expansive as some of his country-people , I should have known all about it long before the journey 's end ; but no ! he was as mum as to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us alL // The same day that we reached Geneva , my aunt and sister arrived there ; and , of course , the first thing to tell them was my adventure , and they were all eagerness to see and thank my new friend . He was not aware that they had come , for , feeling too much fatigued to appear in public , they had been served in the pretty suite of apartments which I had chosen for them , so that after dinner I was able to take him to their room as if it had been mine and introduce him to the ladies before he knew where he was . It was a necessary ruse , for he was so shy that he might not have gone at all had I explained beforehand . His confusion was extreme , but he made a good impression in spite of that ; indeed his blushes were becoming . Meanwhile , my aunt , long accustomed to French society , expressed very elegantly her sense of obligation to him as the preserver of my life , and Fanny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was nothing , but still looking pleased and happy , as well he might . And when that was all over , I was quite surprised to see how they drew him out and discovered gifts and graces in him which had remained unknown to me . He could sing , for instance , and he could sketch . Frances of course did both , just released from school as she was and expecting to be launched in society in Paris the next winter , under my aunt 's protection . Fanny sang first to the piano , but when Nasson modestly said that he could only accompany himself on the guitar , the ladies were charmed with the idea of hearing him sing to that instrument , and insisted that he must fetch it , which he finally did and gave us some old French chansons . They were the only things he knew , he said . And he probably sang them well , for my aunt and sister were much pleased with the performance . There was now nothing more said about an immediate return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next two or three days Nasson walked with us , drove with us , and sat with us quite as a matter of course , and sketched with Fanny from the balcony or at the places of interest which we visited . I was rather surprised there*iore when my aunt asked me one day abruptly and , I thought , even a little severely : " Robert , who is this Monsieur Nas-son " Why , aunt , " I began , " he is a man who saved my- " " Yes , " said she , " and very much obliged to him we all are , but who is he ? What are his connections ? Where does he live ? Who are his parents ? " And at that I could only look blank . Being something of a talker myself , I dare say I had given him a pretty good account of my life-past , present , and even future , so far as I could forecast it , in that I was to follow the law , as my father and grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anything I really could not remember . No , certainly he had never said a word about what he meant to do-leaving his father and grandfather quite out of the question . Upon a little reflection , however , I thought he must expect to be a gentleman of leisure , for the few remarks of his that I could recall which bore in any way upon himself went to prove that he had considerable spare time on his hands . With regard to music and drawing , for instance , he declared that he had no pretensions to excel , but having received some instruction in those accomplishments as a child , had kept them up merely to pass the time . And again , a fancy of his which he mentioned for taking long walks in Paris and finding out old streets , and curious landmarks , he had pronounced to be another excellent way of passing time . Also , he had read a good deal , not very profitably , as he said , but for the same cogent reason-pour passer le temps . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear very well satisfied . The cause for her disquietude was naturally not far to seek , but it seemed to me ridiculous . Little Fanny ! And if I understood anything of such matters , there was no sign of danger . While my aunt and I wrote letters at the centretable and they two , on the balcony , were sketching a view of the lake  --  the boats with their graceful lateen sails and the Jura in the distance-it was just as quiet outside as in . And when the works of art were finished , and Fanny 's left something // to be desired , he would point out her errors as seriously as any old drawing-master ; she looking down on her paper and making little idle flourishes with her pencil , and he-looking at her , to be sure . But what of that ? Who would not look at a pretty young girl ? In the hope of easing my aunt 's mind a little , I imparted to her my suspicions that Nasson had had a disappointment , but she only replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see that she grew more and more dissatisfied with the existing state of things ; she never was content when they were on the balcony until she had discovered that it was damp and Fauny must come in . Then she , herself , would take the chief part in the conversation with Nasson , and I used to admire the cleverness with which she led up to this or that opportanity for his giving some account of himself . But he never did . He simply listened to her accounts with just that charmingly interested mauner which I have already described . However , in spite of his reserve , we were destined to get a glimpse of one of his ancestors ; which happened on this wise : He had brought his portfolio , at Fanny 's request , to show his entire collection of drawings , and in the course of turning them over there was discovered among them a picture in pastel of a child . Nasson uttered a slight exclamation at the sight of it , and murmured that he had not known it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very well done , a little boy in a brilliant old-time costume of black and scarlet , while for a background there was an indication of wainscoting and portraits on the walls which gave the impression of a fine room in an antique mansion . " This looks as if it might be a family portrait , " remarked Fanny . " It is , " he said briefly , and then added , after a moment , " it is from a picture of my great-grandfather at the age of seven . I found it a good subject to copy . " So there was something we knew of him , at last ! He had a great-grandfather . And I passed that little gentleman over to my aunt , feeling that he could hardly fail to produce an agreeable impression upon her . As I held the pict ure in my hand , however , an*looked at it closely , I happened to notice that two or three words had been written under it and erased . She also noticed that and said to me afterward : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very easy to claim a great-grandfather in pasteL That looked to me as if it had had a title written and carefully rubbed out . " I refused with some warmth to think so ill of him , and declared that there was nothing about him which suggested an adventurer . She admitted that he was not exactly her idea of an adventurer , but added that as she had not often been in a position to meet such gentry , she of course could not judge . I felt the reproach in that , and she presently continued : " Besides , my dear Robert , your Monsieur Nasson has really very peculiar ways . I can not at this moment instance anything in particular , and you men never observe such things ; bat I assure you , he does not make the impression on me of having been used to such society as ours . Not that he is not courteous , for he is-very , but in a fashion of his own , not like other people . " " Ah well , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself once of having lived much alone . " " But why ? " inquired my aunt . And that , to be sure , I did not know . I fancied I saw what she meant , though , by his " ways. ** He had not perhaps the very latest fashion in saying and doing certain little things ; it was possible that he did not enter and leave a room in just the style affected by the exquisites of the diplomatic circle in Paris . But if he was courteous , was not that enough ? For my part , I was glad that , as my aunt said , we men did not notice such trifles . Since he was " my " Monsieur Nasson , however , it plainly behooved me to take care of him , and this I resolved to do . Our departure for ( Jhamouni was fixed for the day after the next , and I thought it would be a pity if , during the short interval , I could not keep him out of the way , and by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the fact that he was not precisely a persona grata to my aunt . // And still , what she had said did make a certain impression on me . I found myself thinking afterward how very reticent he had indeed been , and that it was singular I should not have the slightest idea even of where he lived in Paris . But it appeared as if he must soon reveal as much as that , for knowing that I should be in Paris before I went home , he could hardly fail to say that he hoped to see me , which would necessitate his giving some address . As for my aunt , it was plain that she intended to pass no compliments , and I wondered how she would get over the leave-taking without asking him to call . But that she would be equal to the occasion I had no manner of doubt ; it was I who did not expect to be equal to it , picturing to myself beforehand poor Nasson 's mortification . Altogether , I felt quite guilty when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , and rather relieved that he should be out , probably taking a stroll by himself-pour passer le temps . It must have been rather a long one , for he did not appear at all until the close of the day , when he presented himself in the dining-room looking very lowspirited . I had registered a vow that if the town of Geneva afforded any public entertainment that evening , of no matter what description , I would carry him off to it , and as soon as we rose from the table I went to consult with our host on the subject , and then to my aunt 's room to inform her that she was not to have the delight of our society . It was all in vain ! Not only Nasson had stolen a march on me and was established there - as he certainly had a right to be , when I had taken him with me so often  --  but Mr. and Mrs. C L , who had but just heard of our being in Geneva , had come with their two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thought of . Poor Nasson was much out of place among us all , talking eagerly as we were of home and things and people unknown to him , though to be sure , as we spoke English , which he did not understand , the subject of our conversation was neither here nor there so far as he was concerned . I really quite forgot him until I heard Fanny trying to make him talk , and noticed Miss Caroline Lturning her bright eyes in that direction . Quick-witted and good-natured as she is , she soon saw what was the matter , and declared that we younger members of the company must have a game ; that would bring us all together , she said . So we were presently seated around the table , and she indoctrinating us into the mysteries of Lyrics , as she called it . Each person wrote a word on a slip of paper , then doubled it out of sight , and changing the order of the letters that composed it , wrote them at the head of the slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew one and made of the letters some word or words which must be incorporated in a rhyme . If you could guess the original word it was so much the better , but anything that made sense , or , more properly speaking , nonsense , would answer . Here , also , there was the difficulty of two languages , which we had heedlessly taken no account of at first , but it was finally pronounced that Fanny , just out of a French boarding-school , and I with my " known proficiency** ought to be able to support the French end of the table with M. Nasson , who , the L s declared , would lose nothing by not understanding their English rhymes , while they could perfectly appreciate the French poems which we should be sure to produce . So we played one round pretty successfully , except that the person for whom all this had been set on foot took it as seriously as if he had never " assisted " at a game before in his life , and seemed bewildered by the laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Caroline L addressed him in her English-French , which from her lips sounded so excessively pretty , he answered in monosyllables and looked no more animated than a tombstone . It was only when Fanny spoke , whether in French or English , to him or to anyone else , that his interest was aroused . I could not help seeing this , and it was from some rather serious reflections on the subject that I suddenly woke to find everyone waiting for me to write my word for the second round . And I // could think of nothing at all ! My mind seemed absolutely vacant . The situation was fast becoming ridiculous , and they all laughing , so in desperation I hastily scribbled Nasson . The next instant I could have found fifty words instead , and would have given a good deal to get my slip back again , but it was too late . I knew what a mistake it was to introduce a chance for personalities , and presently , as ill-luck would have it , I recognized , from the manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of seeing at once , however , what the two n 's , two s 's , an a and an o stood for , I found to my surprise that she had made something else out of it , for I heard her say to Nasson , in a low voice : " Aidez-moi , monsieur ! Who was Sanson ? I connect him disagreeably with your Revolution , but I ca n't remember what he did . " He looked at her and was so slow in answering that it was I who said : " He chopped heads off . " " Oh , yes , the executioner ! " She reflected a few moments and then began to write . I was a good deal relieved , thinking no harm could come of that , at all events , and when it was her turn she read , " Ii y a du bourreau , 0 Sanson , Jusqu'en ton ibm ; Car ii s'y trouve vraiment Un son de sang . " Then turning the paper , she exclaimed , with an air of disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had guessed it ! It is your name , monsieur . " I was just preparing to criticise her poetical effort and ask what sort of a sound she conceived blood to have , when Nasson suddenly pushed back his chair with more noise than was at all customary to his movements , started up , and rushed rather than walked out of the room , leaving amazement and consternation behind him . Everybody began to exclaim , What could be the matter ! and then to declare that he had been taken very illthat he had looked terribly pale-that he was faint . Fanny spoke last and , I thought , was probably right when she said she feared it was her rhyme that had been taken ill , that it was very thoughtless in her , and she ought to have known it might be a painful subject , for he had perhaps lost all his family and friends in that dreadful time . There seemed a sort of light to dawn on me with that-it would explain so much  --  and even my aunt , who at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I interpreted to mean that any kind of disturbance might be expected from " my " M. Nasson , looked now a little interested . But if this conjecture was correct and he was not ill , there seemed to be no necessity for hurrying after him immediately . The excitement had broken up our party , the L s began to take leave , and I offered myself as a supplementary escort to the young ladies , and was accepted . It was just as well to give Nasson an opportunity to compose himself before I went to express our regrets that so unfortunate a topic should have been touched upon . It was some little time , therefore , before I stopped at his room on the way to my own . I knocked very gently , on the just possible chance that he was ill and had gone to bed ; then , as I seemed to hear " Entrez I " I opened the door . But I was mistaken , the room was dark , or rather there was only the moonlight that fell across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture looming up dimly around the walls ; it was a large chamber and , at first , I did not see Nasson at the further end of it , kneeling at a window , with his head on his arms and the moonlight streaming over him . I went out and closed the door softly , feeling shocked at my intrusion . I kept thinking of him while I lay awake . He was too young to have known anything himself of the Revolution , but it might easily have altered the whole course of his life and left him alone in the world . I do n't know why , seeing that the victims of that insane fury were of every class , it should just then suddenly have came into my head that perhaps he was not what he appeared to be . I remembered that pretty little great-grandfather with his lordly posture and picturesque costume , and it occurred to me that if my aunt thought // Nasson unused to such society as ours , there might be more ways than one of accounting for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lowly ? What if his odd , simple name covered a distinguished incognito ? What if he were But that thought never took any actual shape in my mind . I suppose I was asleep the next moment . Ii I AM an early riser and often take a walk before breakfast , so the following morning I was up while the house was yet quiet , except for some preparations for departure-persons moving cautiously about and the porter carrying luggage down-stairs . Later , the French diligence came jingling along and stopped before the hotel to pick up a passenger , as it often did . I was dressed by that time and went to the window , but all I saw was our host making his bow on the sidewalk , and the coach rattled off again . He and a number of the servants were still standing about when I went downstairs , the latter with the satisfied air of those who have just received ample proof that their services are appreciated ; but our host advanced to meet me with an expression of condolence on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come but a few moments sooner ! Your friend is gone ! He received news last night which must have called him immediately to Paris , and he asked me to give you this , " handing me a letter he held . " I told him you were often up early and offered to send to your room , but he would not have you disturbed . " I took my letter and walked away with it toward the lake-shore , where I generally went of a morning . I was in no haste to open it . It was sealed with a coat-of-arms , which confirmed my suspicions that he was something other than he appeared , and my first feeling was that the termination of the masquerade was not precisely flattering to me . For it amounted to this : So long as he could pass himself off as Nasson , I was good enough for him , but in his proper person , the acquaintance would apparently be troublesome , wherefore he took French leave and our pretty little friendship was over . Nevertheless , curiosity soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had told the whole story now , at all events-*  --  and coming to a bench beside the lake , I sat down , broke the broad seal and proceeded to read , in indescribable bewilderment , what follows . " MoNsIEuR : What shall I say ? My conduct of this evening will have explained itself , you know all , and I am only too well aware that you will consider excuses impossible . Yet I can not help but write , not to defend the tacit deception I have practised , but at Least to show how strong the temptation was to which I yielded . And I even believe if you could know how little I have gamed by my stolen pleasure , how inexpressibly bitter the ending of it is , you would hardly grudge it to me . Those lines-all the more cruel that the intention was so iunocent ! And then , when my guilty looks betrayed me , the sudden , terrible suspicion , the change on every face as I glanced around-these are things , monsieur , which will be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , lest you should think me more culpable even than I am , and suppose me pretending to an ease of circumstances impossible for a family so situated as mine , let me say that my father has a sufficient private fortune to enable him to give his only son any advantage which it is possible for him to enjoy . In this I am no cheat , I have a right to travel on the footing you have seen me assume . Indeed , had it been my intention to deceive and give myself importance , I might have taken quite another name . It is a well authenticated tradition in our family that the first of our race to devote himself to the office which has since descended among us from father to son was a nobleman of the name of De Longval , whose coat-ofarms we still possess . I will not trouble you with the story of how he fell from his estate to the position his descendants have since occupied ; my only reason for mentioning this factwith regard to my origin is in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , I might have been to a certain extent justified // // in assuming a title , even though the only one my father can now claim is that of Monsieur de Paris . " " Gracious powers ! " I exclaimed to myself aloud , and the letter sank in my hand . For until I saw it in black and white I had not been able to believe it , I had hoped there was some mistake . And then it came to me in a sudden flash of recollection that I had seen his father ! It was only a few months before that I was riding out to St. Denis with a young nobleman who , including me in his admiration for everything American , had undertaken to show me the sights of Paris and the environs . It was the first spring day of the season , one of those lovely mornings full of promise , when the sky is blue and the air soft and everything is fresh , after a long rain . In a narrow street of the Faubourg St. Denis we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather imposing houses that are found in all the older parts of Paris , imposing because very little is seen of the house itself ; it stands back from the street in aristocratic seclusion , with a courtyard in front and a glimpse of garden behindperhaps some blossoming trees looking over a wall ; so it was in this instance as I glanced in at the open gate . My companion uttered an impatient exclamation , touched up his horse and sprang ahead , while I , on the contrary , with the curiosity of a stranger , reined in a little to see what was coming . Directly , there rolled out of the courtyard a large , old-fashioned coach , in which sat a man bolt upright in the middle of the back seat , with his arms folded and looking straight before him with a singularly impassive expression of countenance . On the opposite seat were two other men , evidently satellites of this dignitary . As the coach turned into the street , the rough-looking assemblage of men , women , and children parted to let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were from lip to lip , like a prolonged ahl It was plainly not an expression of good-will . When I rejoined my companion , he looked hall-annoyed and hall-amused at my delay . " That was the executioner ! " he ex* claimed with an emphasis of contempt . " I called to you to come on , but you did not hear . He is going to the Con* ciergerie for some poor wretch . " * And then he added that that man 's father had beheaded Louis XVI. , and that his ancestors had done the hanging and burning and torturing and breaking on the wheel in Paris and the surrounding district for years and years back , until the family of Sanson had become a species of aristocrats among hangmen . Once involved in the infamy , they had clung to it , so that when one of them died leaving a son only seven years old , the mother solicited his father 's place and emoluments for him and had her prayer granted , and though the child could not perform the functions of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaffold . In those bygone days the dishonor was , at all events , well paid . The executioner lived in a certain style , and even practised the amusements of a gentleman in his leisure hours . For there was a story of his hunting one day and seeking shelter from a storm , at a chateau where he was taken for a man of quality and invited to sit down to . supper with the host and his friends . He , nothing loath after a long day 's hunting , shook the rain from his feathered hat and went bravely in to the feast , and it was , " A couvert for monsieur ! " and they filled his glass . But in the end somebody recognized him , and then they shattered at his feet the glass he had drunk from , and he fled from their scorn out again into the night and storm . All this came back to me as I sat there holding the letter . The executioner did not hunt any more nor swagger about in a plumed hat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar and singing songs and sitting on the balcony with my sister ! When I thought of that I was ready to tear the letter to bits and toss it into the lake . For the fellow had deceived me vilely ! Did he think , perhaps , that Americans would take up with a man whom the very ragamuffins of Paris scorned ? He had talked more than once about " the beauty of republican simplicity . " But // qwq tion in our quarter , the principal of which was an enlightened , kind-hearted man , who made no objection to receiving me . Of course , both he and my father hoped that my identity would remain unknown , and this seemed possible since the school was at some little distance from our house , and the children who attended it were unlikely to have any thought of the executioner or to be acquainted with his name . " I went to school , then , and was supremely happy . For I must take back what I said just now-that until I saw you , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walked armin-arm with a boy friend , I should not have known how to feel it when you pressed my hand or leaned upon my shoulder . It would have been too late - as would to God it had been . " The boy who became my inseparable companion lived in the next street to ours and I used to call for him daily and leave him at his door when we returned from school Once , however , when we had been dismissed earlier than usual , I invited him to go home with me . I had told my mother of him and she had asked if he was a good boy ; I wanted her to see what a nice boy he was . I was very proud of my friend . Judge of my dismay , therefore , when he was received with the greatest coldness . I supposed my parents were ill-pleased that I had brought him , especially as , when dinner was put on the table they did not even ask him to sit down . Poor X went away surprised at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . " The meal that followed was so silent and constrained that I could remember nothing like it since my grandfather died , and I fell to fancying some one must be dead ; perhaps the old man who had been a contemporary of my grandfather and who still came sometimes-our only visitor  --  to pass an evening with my parents . I have thought since that there really was some one dead , and that was a little happy boy , though he did not yet suspect it . " After dinner my mother took me aside and told me it was not best to bring my friends home , that grandmother was old and did not like strange VOL . V.-64 faces about her or company at the table . That was explanation enough for me , and I went to school next day prepared to tell X. how it happened that he had not been more kindly treated . But he would not speak to me or even look at me , and moreover the other boys were evidently bent on avoiding me . Pride came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither would I. I endured this state of things for a day or two , but my heart was very sore all the while at my friend 's unkindness , and at the more and more openly displayed intention of the boys to slight me , and at last , when I could bear it no longer , I went to X. in recreation-time , made my poor little excuse for my family 's inhospitable behavior and told him I was sorry . Still he did not speak ! I implored him to say if I had done anything to offend him . He only turned his head away and began to draw on a bit of paper . I grew angry and declared that he should speak . He simply finished his drawing and put it in my hand without a word . " It was a rude sketch of two upright beams with a great knife between them and a man bound to a plank . Underneath was written : Tuus pater earn fex . " I had never seen the guillotine , but I was long past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt op a childish face . With the paper in my hand I ran through the streets , straight home , never stopping till I sank down at my mother 's feet in such a passion of tears and sobs as brought the whole house in alarm . I gave her the crumpled sketch , she smoothed it on her knee and I remember yet her startled look ; then she , too , was in tears , heart-broken with compassion . " When I grew calmer , my father requested my mother and grandmother to leave me to him , and he told me everything-who we were and how people regarded us . But he said there must be an executioner and our family had furnished that officer of the state since 1688 ; we must think of that , and do our duty , and let people behave to us as they would . And then he said that as he had stood by his father , so he hoped that I should stand by him . " I promised . Little I knew what I was // promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such importance and my father talking to me as if I were a man . And who knows ? perhaps I felt a pride that our family had furnished that officer of state for so many years ! But chiefly , I promised because it was my father , the man whom I loved best and the man who loved me best , who set the case before me , and those are reasons that hold good when one has come to think differently about all the rest . " So my fate was fixed . I never went back to school . The teacher informed my father that he had talked seriously with the boys and believed I should have no further trouble ; but when it was left to me to decide , I instinctively knew that it could not be the same to go back on sufferance and as an object of compassion . Pride and defiance were astir in me , and I continued my education on a plan of my own , in my father 's library , amongst novels and travels and whatever else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet I had had a taste of something that I often missed and never could enjoy again ; and now , when I went out with my mother , I used to think if people knew who she was they would not be so courteous to her. - Everything was changed . It was a turning-point in my life . The happy child that I had been was dead . " But in all this I am not blaming my father . He was right when he said that in Paris or in France the only position open to me was his . For if , in spite of every difficulty , he had bred me to the law , would anyone have intrusted his case to the executioner 's son ? The Parisians would have made a bon mot on my pretensions ; they would have said , if the son did not succeed with his client , the father would , no doubt-it was all in the family . And that would have been the end of my career . Such a plan could only have been carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and under another name . And it is not for me to wonder that they could not do that with their only child . One other chance , indeed , might be open to us all ; with such private means as we possess , and glad as I should be to do my part toward increasing our resources , if this were necessary , we might make ourselves a place in a new country ; but my father is too fixed in his habits and has too little energy for that . The mere thought of it disturbs the repose and equanimity he has cultivated . For he , too , had his season of revolt , as he has told me. - Perhaps I shall have mine of resignation or indifference ! " At all events , while my father and mother are left to me , my place is with them . It would be sad , indeed , if , when everyone turns from us , we were not united among ourselves ; if , at least , so far as love and duty go , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have written an immeasurably long letter and have no right to expect that you will find in it any excuse for the advantage I have taken of your amiable character and kindly disposition . All I dare to hope is that some little lingering of the friendly sentiments you professed for the man you thought I was , will have enabled you to read it with patience and then-since our ways have parted and we shall never meet againwill help you to forget , without ran cor , HENRI SAIsoN . " I gave this letter to my aunt to read , saying only that it contained something which would shock her . I do n't doubt there were things in it that touched her , too , as they had me , in spite of the fact that when she gave it back her chief preoccupation seemed to be as to my intentions . She did not reproach me , the denouement was altogether too terrible for that , but she thought the letter needed no reply and that he expected none . And she earnestly begged me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For her own part , she must say , she had not come abroad to associate with the hangman , but that was of little consequence ; it was my sister who was to be considered . If this story became known she could not be responsible for Fanny 's success in society . It was quite true that the Parisians delighted in bons mots , the more malicious the better ; and anything ridiculous would be fatal ! Besides which , I must be aware that in this adventure there was far more than the ridiculous for us ; she was sure I felt all // the unseemliness in my sister 's having been brought , even by chance , into contact with such a personage . And she was right I did feel it . Nevertheless , the letter gave me no peace till I sat down and tried to answer it . And that was as difficult a composition as I ever attempted . I could not tell him that his " tacit deception " was of no consequence , and thus imply that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complication there - on his part-which it was impossible to think of without indignation . And what was the use of writing if it was only to agree with him that his conduct had been unpardonable ? One thing I was thankful for-he had not attempted even to mention the ladies . Indeed , I could not help thinking that in that world of his own which he lived in , he was a man corn-me ii faut . Ah , if the matter had been only between him and me , there would have been no difficulty . I could even fancy myself , in that case , going under cover of night to make a mysterious visit at the house of the executioner of Paris ! As it was , I wrote ; and trust I wrote in such a way as to give him no pain . All I said was that while he had anticip ated some of the sentiments that his letter might call forth , there was one of which he had seemed to feel some doubt , it was the only one of which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had my heartfelt sympathy , and that though , as he said , our ways had parted , yet I should never forget what I owed him and if , at any future time , I could do him a service , not in return for his to me but as from one man to another , he would find me ready . How Fanny might be affected by all this , I did not know until she asked me , the first time we were alone together , if I had answered " that unfortunate man 's " letter . " Why , what was there in it to answer ? " I said , just to try her . " You might , at least , tell him you are sorry for him ! " she exclaimed , indignantly . And then I was glad to say I had told him just that , and still more glad to perceive that she spoke without the least embarrassment . He was simply that unfortunate man , for her . But she was anxious to respect him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen was really of one of his ancestors . Whereupon I related the story of the little executioner , for I have no doubt that was he . His fond mother probably wanted her young headsman painted in his official dress ! And I can even imagine how poor Nasson-for so I still call him-might have written under his copy , in a moment of bitterness , Le petit Bourreau , and then - effaced it afterward with a sort of pity for the pretty child . If we had had our wits about us though , we must have reflected that that was no Louis XV . or Louis XIV . costume , such as his great-grandfather might have worn , but a survival from an earlier period  --  the slashed doublet , the long , red hose , and pointed shoes . Fanny has had a great success in Paris this past winter , and has been la jolie Arnericaine everywhere . No one of the thousand possible chances has ever brought him before her eyes again . In writing to me they have never mentioned him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , the first allusion there has ever been to his existence fluttered out of a letter from my aunt to me . It was a little slip cut from a newspaper and enclosed , without a word of comment , a brief notice of an execution which had taken place in Paris . The concluding paragraph was as follows : " A notable feature of the occasion was that Monsieur de Paris , prevented by illness from performing his office , was represented by his son and associate , a young man of apparently not much over twenty years of age , who was observed to be as pale as the patient and considerably more agitated . " That was the last-an uulooked-for ending to my strange acquaintance . Will the finer or the coarser part of him prevail ? As memory pictures him through all the various circumstances of our intercourse , down to the last time I saw him - kneeling there in the moonlight-I hope the best . It is true , he may not be in the least a devout man ; that was perhaps only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think otherwise , and to believe that for his probably long and certainly lonely life , he has already begun to seek the consolations of religion .
