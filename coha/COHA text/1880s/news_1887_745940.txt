txt August Spies , the condemned Anarchist , who is to be married next week to Miss Nina Van Zandt , is very happy , notwithstanding his unpleasant surroundings and the uncertain future . He was writing , as usual , when a reporter saw him , to-day and inquired if ho wished to say anything more about his coming marriage , he having been somewhat reticent on the subject last night . " I was unwilling to say anything more when you were here yesterday , " he replied , " because I did n't know whether Miss Van Zandt would like to have the facts published . We had agreed to keep our engagement a secret , but it got out and there was no use in denying it . I did n't know , however , whether she wished anything else said . So I wrote her a note asking her about it , and she replied that she had no objections . I can add very little to what has been published . " " When will the ceremony take place 4 " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has been stated . " " What day 1 " " I am not sure ; probably Thursday . " " In the morning or afternoon 1 " " No arrangement has been made about the time . " " Have you selected a minister I " " A minister will not marry us . She is an atheist and so am I. She belongs to the materialistic , idealist school that I belong to , and that is one reason why we should be happy . A Justice of the Peace or a Judge will perform the ceremony , and Capt . Black will look after him . " Speaking of Miss Van Zandt , Spies said : " She is a lady of a very pronounced character  --  a remarkable woman . Some of the papers are trying to make it appear that she is a romantic sort of a girl . That is not so . She is quite a conversationalist and can talk on almost any subject . " " May I ask where you did your courting 1 " " In the jail . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we talked through the wire netting . " " You look stouter than you used to . " " Yes . When I came to this cell I was suffering from insomnia , but I have gained 20 pounds and recovered my health . It is n't agreeable , though , to remain here . " " You expect a new trial 1 " " I do n't care to speculate about it , though , of course we expect it . We can expect any ; thing after our experience in the lower court . " Spies denies that he ever saw Miss Van Zandt till after the trial , and says that he has no recollection of her having called at the .41-beiter Zeitung office to advertise for a lost poodle . All their love-making was done through the bars of the cage at the county jail in which prisoners are permitted to see their friends . The engagement dates from last week . It is probable that the marriage ceremony will take place in the private office of Jailer Folse . The Van Zandts are respectable people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the firm of James S. Kirk &; Co . Both he and his wife are members of the Fourth Presbyterian Church . Miss Van Zandt is an intelligent , well read young woman  --  too well read , her friends think . Mr. Van Zandt says he offers no objection to the marriage because his daughter is bent upon it , and he desires nothing so much as to make her happy , and that , though he abhors the principles of the Anarchists , he likes Spies personally .
