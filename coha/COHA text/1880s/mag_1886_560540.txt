NATIONAL legislation in respect to the railways of the country must necessarily affect , either for good or for evil , the administration of 128,967 miles of railway , a property represented by *7,842,633,179 of capital ( *3,765,727,066 of funded indebtedness , and *3,817,697,832 of share capital ) ; that in 1884 earned *772,568,833 ; that paid upward* of *400,000,000 for labor to nearly 800,000 employees , and divided , among the holders of its share capital and indebtedness , *350,064,252 . In formulating legislation affecting interests of such magnitude , care should be taken not to unnecessarily interfere with commercial customs and trade laws , nor with the administration and use of the railway properties and the police arrangements necessary for their safe and economical management , nor with the rights of individual owners of such property ; for railway property has an individual ownership , and is entitled to protection in like manner and to the same extent as other private property . The traffic transported on the railways of the country is of two kinds : I. Interstate traffic ; the trade or traffic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefrom , into or through one or more other States or Territories . This is by far the larger class . It includes coal , iron , and other minerals ; provisions , live stock , wool , grain , cotton , tobacco , and other agricultural products ; manufactures and the raw materials used , and the larger portion of all foreign and coastwise imports and exports ; and its volume is estimated at not less than eighty per cent . of the entire traffic of the railways of the country . Congress alone can legislate in respect to interstate traffic , as the Constitution vests in that body the sole power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States , " and " to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing power. ** // THE . ? iTQRTH A3IEFJc2ADT RETTIEW . JJ . State traffic ; or the domestic trade and traffic that originates in one State or Territory , and is confined within its territorial limits . With such traffic Congress has nothing to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , within its own limits , all such traffic . It follows , therefore , that railway transportation can be properly " regulated " only under national laws , supplemented by State laws , as in no other way can uniform legislation be obtained to cover all classes of traffic . Last year the railways moved 351,427,088 passengers , and 437,040,099 tons of freight . It is important , therefore , in discussing proposed legislation affecting such important commercial interests , to ascertain what public and private rights and interests require legislative protection . N The public desire that all persons and all localities shall be placed upon an equality in respect to rates and facilities for doing business ; and that extortionate charges , and unreasonable and unjust discrimination of every kind , shall be absolutely prohibited . This is just and proper , so long as it is not expected that the railway companies shall , at their own cost , equalize advantages in location of one town or section of country over other towns and localities . If the rule is enforced that all individual shippers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there can be *io just cause for complaint . The public interests require that legislation in respect to common carriers shall be uniform in all the States and Territories ; that it shall be such as will secure prompt shipment of traffic , without preference ; the protection of property of railway companies , and of all persons and property in transit ; the prompt and safe delivery of trains at destination , and the protection of the officers and employees of the railways while in the discharge of their duties . To provide for intelligent supplemental legislation , officers of the General and State governments should have access to and knowledge of the charter papers of railroad corporations , and current information as to the charges for transportation on different roads , the character and volume of traffic carried , the earnings from each class-State and Interstate  --  the results from operating the several roads , and the financial condition of each transportation company , as shown by its books . What legislation will best secure these desired results ? // Legislation , to be of practical benefit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prompt redress under the law . The Federal Judiciary are appointed for life ; they are men generally outside of politics , whose ambition is to be preferred in the line of their profession ; and they almost universally command the confidence and respect of the public . It is believed that all differences between railway companies and the public can be more satisfactorily adjusted through the Federal Courts than in any other manner . The common-carrier laws of the country are the result of the wisdom and experience of generations . They prohibit extortionate charges and unjust and unreasonable discrimination of every kind , and are based on the principle that every person and every locality , alike situated , must be treated alike . If all railway companies carrying interstate traffic shall be brought directly under these laws , with a provision for their enforcement through the Federal Courts , very little additional legislation will be required . Railway companies are private corporations with special powers and privileges derived from State and congressional legislation ; but , as the public is dependent upon them for transportation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their powers , without cost to the individual injured . To do this , a law should be passed , providing that complaints against carrying companies may be lodged with a United States District Attorney , whose duty it shall be to investigate them , and when , in his opinion , there is reasonable ground for complaint that injustice has been done and the law violated , if the company shall refuse , on his request or demand , to make proper reparation , it should be his duty to bring a suit in the United States District or Circuit Court having jurisdiction , in name of the United States against the offending company , for violation of law , and for damages to the party or parties injured ; all such suits to have precedence on the calendar . Prompt action can so be obtained , and the party injured put to no expense other than that incident to his becoming a witness for the prosecution . In suits of such a character , involving private rights , no intelligent manager of a railway will ever stand a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in the justice of his defense . Federal decisions in such cases will have the effect of additional legislation by becoming recognized law , and they will necessarily // cover similar complaints against railways in other sections of the country . One great difficulty in formulating legislation in respect to railways arises from a want of information as to the nature and character of the wrongs to be righted ; and , as a general law applicable to the older and more densely-populated States will often be found to work inequitably in the States and Territories more sparsely settled , it is believed that the plan of making United States District Attorneys and the Federal Courts a medium for adjusting differences between individuals and transportation companies will enable the Government to obtain , through the Attorney-General 's office , full and complete information from all sections of the country , from which to formulate such supplemental legislation as experience may determine to be necessary to complete a national system of supervision and regulation of interstate railways . Disagreements among railway managers often result in " railway wars , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cause a greater loss and injury to the public , than arise from individual cases of injustice from the wrongful acts of railway companies . What the public wants is that transportation rates shall be fair and reasonable at all times , and not subject to frequent and sudden changes ; as fluctuations seriously affect values , and work an injury to all classes of traffic in the territory tributary to such transportation lines . Unreasonably low rates always have the effect of discrimination against localities ; and by unsettling values , merchants and manufacturers are placed at a disadvantage with each other , from shippers at " war** rates being able to undersell their neighbors in the same or adjoining towns . To correct this evil the law should . provide that when the managers of any two or more railway corporations shall fail to agree as to a connection of their roads for interchange of business , or on proper rates for competitive traffic ; or if from any cause a " cut " or unreasonable reduction in rates shall be made , so much below the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service ; on complaint , with a sworn statement of facts , filed with the United States District Attorney by the president and vice-president , or by two directors of any corporations unfavorably affected by such disagreement or reduction of rates ; or , on like complaint and statement made by any shareholder // or other person interested , that such reduction in rates is working an injury to the party complainant , to a corporation in which he may be interested , or to any locality ; a suit shall at once be brought in name of the United States against such compaty or companies ; and on application of the prosecuting officer the judge of any United States District or Circuit Court having jurisdiction , or any Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , shall appoint three disinterested persons to act as a special Board of Commissioners ; one , a civil engineer , familiar with railway construction , one with experience in the operative management of railways , and one with a knowledge of traffic management and rates . Such Board of Commissioners should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ; they should keep a record of their proceedings , and be vested with power to send for persons and papers , and to examine under oath all persons having knowledge of the matters to be investigated . After a full investigation and hearing of parties desiring to be heard , a report should be made in writing , setting forth the facts , with such suggestions and recommendations as , in the opinion of the commissioners , will adjust the differences on an equitable basis . Such report , with the record of evidence taken , should then be presented to the court , notice being given to the proper officers of the disagreeing lines , to be present by counsel or otherwise . After reading the report , and hearir*g such arguments and statements as the parties in interest may desire to make , the court should issue an order or decree in respect to the matters of difference , to be immediately effective and binding upon the several railway and transportation lines and other parties interested . This would secure the immediate restoration of rates , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parties , would be contempt of court that would be summarily dealt with . The effect of such legislation would be to force railway managers to settle their company differences , without indulging in a war of rates that is certain to injure the property in their charge , and , by unsettling values , is equally certain to injuriously affect local merchants and manufacturing interests , and the traffic of the country tributary to such railroads , and all connecting lines . Such Federal decisions , with the testimony and other record evidence in respect to disagreements between transportation companies , would be of public record , and useful in all similar cases of // difference . They would be accessible to Government officials , and to the public , through the office of the Attorney-General of the United States ; and the decisions would have the effect of supplemental legislation in respect to common-carrier laws , by adapting them to exceptional cases , and to current changes in commercial customs , and trade laws that govern commercial intercourse between different sections of our country . The property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection as similar property in transit on the water . Our present common-carrier laws require that all traffic shall be shipped without preference , as nearly as possible in the order of its delivery ; and they should also provide that all officers , managers , and employ*s in every department of railway service shall , so far as their duty and power lies , be responsible , personally and officially , for the prompt shipment of traffic offered ; that the rates charged are just and equitable ; for the prompt movement of trains carrying interstate traffic and the United States mails ; and for the protection and safe delivery at destination of all such trains and property in their charge and keeping . They should also provide that any person or persons who shall willfully obstruct or delay the movement of such railway trains ; or any officer , agent , or other employe in charge , who shall desert a train en route , or refuse to take it through to destination , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor , and on conviction shall be subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both actual and exemplary damages . If a bale of goods is shipped from New York by steamer to New Orleans , once started , it is protected through to destination under United States laws ; and if any officer or man in charge , or any other person , shall willfully or maliciously damage goods so shipped , or prevent their safe carriage , or delivery at destination , he commits an offense that subjects him to punishment under a United States statute , that can be enforced in a Federal Court whose criminal jurisdiction is not limited by State or municipal boundary lines . There is no reason why the Federal Courts shall not afford like protection to a bale of goods shipped by railway , that must pass through nine intervening States that lie between New York and New Orleans . Primarily , in the interest of the Government , for the purpose of procuring information needed to formulate intelligent supplemental legislation , there should be established in the Interior IDepartment // an " Interstate Transportation Bureau , " to be in charge of a chief commissioner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transportation should be in charge of such bureau . It should be the duty of such commis* sioner to see that the provisions and requirements of the commoncarrier laws , and of all other laws relating to transportation between States , are strictly complied with and carried into practical effect . He should have authority , under direction of the Secretary of the Interior , to examine the books and records of every such corporation , and to examine under oath the officers , agents , and servants of such company in respect to the rights , powers , and duties of the corporation , and as to any other matter proper to be known for the due regulation of interstate commerce . Every interstate railway corporation should be required to furnish the Interior Department with copies of all charter and other papers relating to its organization and powers , and of all leases , contracts , and agreements by which the property and rights of other corporations are controlled and operated . They should file copies of all yearly reports , with current statements ( on blanks furnished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company , the amount and character of its liabilities , with copies of its mortgage and guaranty obligations ; the tonnage of interstate and State traffic transported ; the gross receipts from interstate and State traffic , and from other sources ; its working expenses ; its fixed charges for interest and rental ; and its current expenditures charged to construction , betterment , and improvement accounts . Uniform statements of this character will be of great service to the Government , and they will enable comparisons to be made , in respect to the administration and management of different railway properties , that will greatly benefit the public , especially shippers , and all share and bond holders , and others interested in the management of railway companies . National legislation in the direction indicated will , if enforced , amply protect the public , without interfering with the rights of individuals or of corporations ; and , what is of equal importance , will not be liable to interfere with the trade laws and customs that control the commerce of the country . It will require no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , perhaps , to enlarge the powers and extend the jurisdiction of the present Pacific Railroad // Bureau of the Department of the Interior ; and it will not only provide for a prompt adjustment of differences between the public and carrying companies , but it will secure full invcstigation , locally , by officers of the Federal Courts resident in the district where the offense is committed  --  the most intelligent and dis- interested tribunal that it is possible to have adjudicate in such cases . State traffic will not , of course , be covered by national laws , but it can be as well protected by the passage of State laws in harmony with national laws , and supplementing them . As it is now , every State has its own distinct code of laws relating to railway transportation , that can be enforced only within State boundary lines . The effect of a recognized national code of laws , relating to interstate traffic , will be certain to secure corresponding State legislation , applicable to State or domestic traffic . This , of itself , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway companies . Such a plan for adjusting complaints of the public against transportation lines , and differences between railway companies , will secure redress more promptly and effectively than can be done through a National Board of Railway Commissioners , however intelligent and experienced they may he ; as it will be impossible for members of a commission , acting either separately or as a body , to properly investigate the complaints of shippers and others interested in transportation over 129,000 miles of railway that extend through forty-five States and Territories of our country . It would be physically impossible for a commission to act as promptly and intelligently as officials of the Federal Courts resident in the judicial districts ; and it is prompt redress of injury that is required by the public . The tendency of both national and State legislation has always been in the direction of " controlling " instead of " regulating " railways and railway transportation . It is properly within the province of legislation to regulate railways ; as , for instance , by requiring that automatic brakes and other safety appliances be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running through towns ; by designating the number of employees to be in charge of trains : but it certainly is not within the province of Congress to undertake to control the railways of the country by arbitrarily fixing the number of trains to be run daily on railroads , and the hours for their departure and arrival ; or by // requiring that trains shall always consist of the same number and kind of cars ; or that they shall be run at the same rate of speed between all stations ; or that they shall be hauled over the entire length of each road , in order that the people at all stations may have the same accommodations and facilities in their use . And yet such legislation would be no more unwise than , for a similar reason , to enact laws that will restrict the free movement of traffic - such as is proposed by bills that prohibit pooling arrangements ; that fix rigid and inflexible rates for transportation ; that provide severe penalties for changes in rates by rebates , allowances , or commissions ; laws that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pooling is a system of federation for railway companies , for the purpose of securing what the public need-stability in rates , and uniformity in other matters connected with transportation . Such organizations correspond in many respects to the Chambers of Commerce and Boards of Trade that are established by merchants ; and in both cases they furnish the best-known methods for securing reliable commercial statistics and records in respect to the traffic of the country , and uniformity in the quotation of rates and prices . They generally secure , under their own rules and regulations , the prompt adjustment of differences that arise from commercial transactions , which is so necessary when parties are engaged in the same kind of business ; and the public is greatly benefited by such organizations . To arbitrarily prohibit rebates , allowances , and commissions would be unwise , as it is not the proper use of such methods in making temporary changes in rates , but their abuse , that works injury to the public . Enforcement of the common-carrier laws through the Federal Courts will always protect the public against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by rebates , allowances , or commissions . Recognized commercial rules and customs form a code of unwritten laws recognized among merchants and traders everywhere , and while they are not the same in all localities , the same fundamental principles govern , the changes being only such as are found necessary to adapt them to different trade centers . As such changes are always adjusted by the parties directly interested , there should be as little legislation in respect to them as possible ; // only such as may be necessary to prevent injustice and wrongdoing . Legislation that restricts the action of these trade laws and customs in any other way , will be found to act as impediments to commerce . If our law-makers will recognize this selfevident fact , there will be much less general and State legislation in respect to railways and railway transportation , but what laws are enacted will be of a more practical character .
