txt There are some circumstances attending the killing of Tom Davis , the gambler and sharper , which are worthy the serious consideration of . Inspector MURRAY and the Police Department generally . It is undisputed that the rascal kept several headquarters in this city entirely devoted to swindling . His general scheme was quite an old one , and it was persisted in without a variation as to detail . Therewas no novelty attempted . He pretended to sell counterfeit money , and when his dupes caught at the specious bait set out by him they were ticked into taking packages of brown paper skillfully substituted for the " green goods " they thought they were buying . DAVIS 'S circulars have been for years passing through the mails , and numbers of them were sent to Police Headquarters by persons out of town who had received them . Still no decided effort seems to have been made by the police authorities to put a stop to the business . ANTHONY COMSTOCK and Chief DRUMMOND , of the Secret Service , now and then caught a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . But this method of procedure is wholly inadequate to deal with the evil . The rascals who plied their vocation of pretending to sell counterfeit money were obliged to make appointments at certain places in this city , and could easily be reached by the ordinary detective methods if a real intent were shown to bring them to justice . For a long time the police affected to set great store by the fact that the . " sawdust swindlers , " as this kind of criminals is called in professional parlance , never in their circulars announced in so many words an intention of supplying counterfeit money . They made themselves understood without actually using any phrase which by itself indicated a trade in such stuff . There was also this fact , that they did not really sell any counterfeit money . Then , again , if it were sought to capture the rascals as simple swindlers it was difficult to get a bona fide complainant to appear . This arose from the simple circumstance that in order to be a complainant a man must acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These objections have had no weight , however , since the passage of the Penal Code , which provides an adequate remedy for reaching the swindlers . The provision , on this subject-contained in section 527 is most thorough . It declares that a person who , with intent to defraud , prints , circulates , or distributes any kind of written or printed matter , offering , " or purporting to offer for sale , exchange , or as a gift counterfeit coin or paper money , " or giving , or purporting to give , information where such stuff may be procured , " is punishable by imprisonment not more than five years or by a fine not exceeding $500 , or by both such fine and imprison-. ment . " With so drastic an enactment as this , it surely can not be laid to the fault of the law that the swindlers are not promptly dealt with . And , to procure a conviction under the section in question , the proof is easily obtainable by any who are in earnest . How many Tom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the police will be spurred up to the point of taking proper preventive measures ?
