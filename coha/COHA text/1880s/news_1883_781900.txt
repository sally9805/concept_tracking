txt One would hardly imagine the existence of spirit in a man addicted to playing croquet , but from the recent tragedy in Woodbury , N. J. , we may fairly infer that a spirited male croquet player is possible , or that , at all events , the male croquet player is capable of turning ' when too severely trodden upon . Last Sunday two men and two women were playing croquet at Woodbury . Of this revolting fact there is no question , and of the moral character of people capable of breaking the Sabbath by playing croquet when they might have played lawn tennis there can be but one opinion . As to what lea to the tragedy which closed the game there are two different stories . One is that one of the women , indignant at being beaten , tripped up her male adversary  --  doubtless by hitting him on the head with a mal let  --  whereupon he retaliated by kicking her . The other report asserts that no preliminary tripping up with the mallet was done by the woman , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind by kicking his fair conqueror to death . In either case there is an agreement as to the fact that the male croquet player , who has hitherto submitted meekly to the cruelty of the other sex and has smilingly received blows all over his person from flying mallets recklessly thrown away by defeated and maddened female players , has sufficient spirit to turn on the oppressor . No one can defend a man  --  or even a , croquet player ? in killing a woman , but that he should have spirit enough to do anything is a fact not only interesting but important to the scientific investigator.
