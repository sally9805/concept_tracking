txt There was the wildest kind of ice-boating by yachts of the Hudson River Club over the six-mile course at Hyde Park to-day , the sailing being fast and - very exciting : The wind blew a gale from the northwest , and the big yachts car-ried close-reefed mainsails rind jibs , but the smaller ones reefed mainsails only . The surface of the ice was as smooth as a mirror . At the start E. P. Rogers 's St. Nicho-las and Arcby Rogers 's Jack Frost were sent over the course to test the ice . The St. Nicho-las made the six miles in six minutes , and Jack Frost had a part of her mainsail carded away , coming home under her jib . At this time the wind bad increased to a hurricane , and the races were put off till 3 P. M. The first was between the St. Nicholas and Jack Frost over a distance of 12 miles , the latter winning in 24 minutes , the St. Nicholas coming home 10 seconds later . After the race a howling squall struck the Frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he caught the end of her boom , and was dragged over the ice a mile a minute for a long distance till the boat suddenly wheeled around like lightning , breaking his hold , and he rolled over and over far away from her . Then occurred one of the wildest scenes ever witnessed in ice boating . Again the wind struck the Frost 's mainsail heavily , and , as it was close trimmed , she started off once more with tremendous speed and without a helmsman . The ice was dotted with skaters . Three ice yachts lay off the clubhouse . Guests of the club , including ladies , were standing on the low bank of the river , and as the runaway ice yacht sped along with the fury of the gale there were many blanched faces , as it was almost certain that one or more would be killed . She was going straight for the clubhouse at the rate of a mile a minute . The skaters scattered in every direction , and there were shouts and screams from the shore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of one skater , who in the excitement had fallen . The yachts St. Nicholas and Snowflake were standing heads to the wind 50 feet apart , and Frost dashed between them and ran with terrific speed head on into Bard 's Rock . Every part of her was smashed into kindling wood . As soon as it was seen that she was wrecked , and that all danger was over the relief was great . The next race was between Bard Rogers 's Snowflake , N. P. Rogers 's Bessie , and P. C. Rogers 's Snowball , over the six-mile course , the Bessie winning in 7 minutes 55 seconds , beating the Snowball 35 seconds . The third race was between the Snowflake and Snowball , the latter winning in 8 minutes . The fourth was between the Bessie and Snowball , the Bessie winning in I 'M minutes . These two boats were so closely matched that they were sent off again . This time the Snowball beat the Bessie 15 seconds . winning the six-mile contest in 73 minutes . Mr. David Paton , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with colors presented by Judge Gildersleeve , will be sailed for on Monday , wind and ice permitting .
