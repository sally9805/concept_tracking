BEFORE THE WAR . " POETRY , " Mr. Whipple finely says , " is the protest of genius against the unreality of actual life . " This statement seems , rn a measure , to be true of the best prose fiction : for the finest standard of emotion is hardly to be found actually embodied in any single person ; it is a creation of the mind , an ideal , for which human life suggests the material ,  - -  a beautiful image to which we cling with all our secret forces ,  --  not within the actual , nor yet wholly beyond the j5ossili/e . American fiction has passed through many stages since Charles Brockden Brown laid the foundation in 1798 . In the early half of the present century the novelist was left free to range to the utmost verge of the possible : for the national sentiment welcomed anything in romance that gave evidence of imagination , paying for it any price in public esteem . The romancer found little competition at home , and had free range of the prizes , while abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he grumbled , as he often did , it was , for th' most part , the result of inordinate greediness engendered by unearned successes . The invention of our early writers was quite equal to that of their English brothers , but in the choice and artistic disposition of material they were not held to so high a standard . Indeed , until the time of Hawthorne , it is difficult to find any rigidly conscientious work done in the department of fiction ; and the magnificent success of novelists like Cooper seems due to their wealth of new matter , and to a certain breadth rather than delicacy of treatment  --  a gift of nature and not of art . To-day , the competition is great , and , by a process of critical selection , the artistic side of novel-writing has been developed , without , it would seem , any corresponding accession of imaginative power ; so that the highest places are held by literary men who have but little creative force ,  - -  men who can strike an average , classify characters , and give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vitalize them with anything like spiritual vitality . The atmosphere of criticism is so largely tinctured with scholarship that fine writing is often credited with the essentials of fine imagination , and fine imagination , without the graces of style , has a hard time in getting a hearing . This is a natural reaction from the old excesses , where imagination was rank and art was slighted . The poverty of exacting criticism was lamentable . But the new process may well have its own excesses , and produce in time a new reaction . Let us trace , as well as we can , the history of these changes in our fiction , and note the growth in it of a native as well as an artistic element . It was in Philadelphia that our first novelist was born . The third was from a remote corner of New England ; but it is a little remarkable that both came of Quaker stock , and that each , by natural processes , ejected himself from the old faith . The second and fourth-if we pass by Irving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her suitors - were of Dutch and English extraction of the New York or New Jersey quality . The fifth and sixth , both women , were from Massachusetts . These six , in their order , were Charles Brockden Brown , James K. Paulding , John Neal , J. Fenimore Cooper , Miss Catherine M. Sedgwick , and Mrs. Lydia Maria Child . Mrs. Child 's venture was a small one , confined to two meager volumes , published in 1824-25 ; while the other five writers held the entire ground of important novelistic literature for thirty-three years . Brown was sole occupant from 1798 to 1812 , when Paulding - who , with Irving , had been skirmishing in " Salmagundi " - published " John Bull and Brother Jonathan . " Five years later , John Neal rushed in with his first romantic venture , " Swingeing the scaly horror of his folded tail . " Cooper 's " Precaution " followed in 1821 ; and in the next two years , " The Spy , " " The Pioneers , " and " The Pilot . " Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two , sometimes three volumes a year , the best of which were translated into nearly every modern language in- Europe . Charles Brockden Brown , as we have said , was a mild Quaker , but the " Quaker " in him was thrust out by a severe attack of infidelity . Later in life came a more religious mood , and he died , says his biographer , a good Christian . John Neal , less fortunate , remained in the Quaker fold until his twentyfifth year , when he knocked a man " head over heels , " as it is phrased , and was turned out of meeting . Brown gravitated from Phila // deiphia to New York ; Neal from Portland to Baltimore - thus preserving to New England her sober gravity , undisturbed by the school of fiction , until that gentle and delightful form of it introduced by Miss Sedgwick came to the Berkshire Hills . Brown 's early life was unmistakably gloomy . From a temperament delicate and fine , but morbid ,  --  in which the intellectual overbalanced the physical forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulated from across the water , was wholly within the range of his mood and spirit . It contained , however , not a hint of the new American life , not a spark of that humor which afterward flashed freely in American literature . Except for an awful sense of solitude ,  --  the gloom of primeval nature ,  --  there was scarcely a touch of our glorious scenery . No social element is represented , such as Paulding afterward found in Philadelphia and New York , the centers of social activity between which Brown all his life oscillated . It was his peculiar gift to paint the night side of human experience . In " Wieland , " his first novel , the story , though not wholly a tragedy , is so overwhelmingly black with . the tragic element that the reader never for a moment emerges . In " Edgar Huntly , " Clithero , the somnambulist , and Huntly himself , rest throughout under an incubus of horrors - fire , starvation , grave-haunting , sleepwalking , murder , wild beasts , and a nightmare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of Arthur Mervyn , who plunges from the couch of the plague to the cellar of the murderer , and only escapes to walk the hospitals . The power possessed by this rare genius , of throwing gloomy characteristics into his theme , was equaled by no other American writer . In the matter of morbid analysis , Poe , in comparison with Brown , was superficial , Hawthorne was cheerful , and the modern school of French writers are feeble . With Poe , we can see that the gloom came by an effort of a spurred imagination ; with Hawthorne , that it was the work of an artistic sense ; but with Brown , it seems to have been constitutional  --  the gift at once of temperament and circumstances . He was possessed by it : his early solitariness , his later experience in the two plague-stricken cities , combined with a most brooding and vivid imagination , had worked into the blood , so that we may reasonably believe that , substantially , Henry and Clara Wieland , Arthur Mervyn , Edgar Huntly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's own mental experiences . But Brown s novel-writing ended with his thirty-third year , and he died at thirty-nine . His six stories , compressed within seven years of his VOL . XXVI. - 28. working life , were all the product of one mood in that period of life which , in such a man , lies between soul-experience and human action ,  --  when the soul flowers , but has not reached a mellow fruitage ; when imagination is boldest , and reason least assertive . It was a long step from Brown 's work to Paulding 's first novelistic , or , rather , allegorical venture- " John Bull and Brother Jonathan . " This tale is amateurish , but presents the first touches , in romance form , of that rich , broad humor which Paulding and Irving together introduced  --  the rollicking Dutch element , jovial and healthy , with no deep senousness in it , and yet a manly fun half way between the grim playfulness of the south-west and the devout humor of the New Englander , who curtsied to the Almighty before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front in Paulding 's " Merry Tales , " reaches its highest development in " The Dutchman 's Fireside , " published in 1831 . The author 's first four or five volumes mark a growing American sentiment in literature , a rasping sense of individual hostility to foreigners ,  --  which was both social and political ,  --  an almost ludicrous determination to show that the Declaration of Independence included a clause on literary independence . But beyond this , the work is loosely constructed , weak in dramatic interest , and ot no credit whatever to American workmanship . Between the best of it and " The Dutchman 's Fireside , " which is mature work and of national value , the gulf is great . But before this novel was written , Irving had made a way for American invention , Cooper was full-fledged and delighting the world , Miss Sedgwick was charming the youth of New England and being reprinted abroad , and John Neal from Baltimore was plunging and caracoling in every field of literature . " The Dutchman 's Fireside " presented enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heart of Knickerbocker social life . The atmosphere was large and sunny , full of the grace of gentle culture and hearty manners , as well as of good living , - rich in the customs of colonial life , brilliant and warm with the golden foliage of American scenery . Paulding could tell a story charmingly . The action , at times , hurries along with rapidity , being full of incident ,  --  natural , sympathetic , with the very cream of life in it . Again , the author will sink the novelist in the raconteur , and address a coterie . Presently , forgetting that he is not a preacher , he will give us a touch from the last pulpit . Anon he will be Addison , and the man about town . But one finds him oftenest following in the footsteps of Irving ,  --  much inferior in the // graces of style ,  --  uneven , inartistic , now edging himself among his characters , now changing natures with them ,  --  so that we can hardly tell when we have Paulding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable also in John Neal , whose " Keep Cool " followed five years after the " John Bull , " and preceded Cooper 's " Precaution " by four years . The three were " first " books , and represent merely the promise of their authors . Neal wrote from the surface of his mind , which was frothy . His life was mixed , and his novels were equally so . The very plot is erratic , sometimes intensely , almost luridly , dramatic , sometimes weak and attenuated beyond any reader 's patience . As he had been shop-boy , dry-goods merchant , lawyer , poet , and essayist , as well as novelist , he considered himself qualified to lecture on all subjects . Now it is on the Yankee dialect , which he thinks no one understands so well as he . To illustrate his knowledge , he drags into " The Down-Easters , " his cleverest book , two of the rankest of Yankees , and sets them to floundering in the plot . When they have ruined that to the extent of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest of horrors - dirking , drowning , seduction , desertion , adultery , poisoning . The whole is loosejointed and extravagant , the dialogue spun out interminably , and amounting to nothing . So , also , in " Errata " we get relays of argument on Quaker customs , law , motherhood , the management of children , dueling , and murder . In " True Womanhood , " written in his later years , and published in 1859 , all his early buds are in over-ripe blossom . His own personality is pushed headlong into the text . He is gossippy , old-womanish . The style is slipshod , a perfect storm of words to the square inch of ideas , a huddle of incident and characters , with scarcely a clew to his purpose with them . Of the artistic element there is none whatever , no sense of proportion , no patient study of persons , no arrangement , no aim , and no fulfillment . There is only one character that clings to the mind , and that is John Neal-the universal Yankee , whittling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a robust genius for nothing ,  --  everything in the egg , and not a chick fully developed . With the appearance of Cooper we began to hold up our heads among the romancers of the world . In literary form and workmanship he was far inferior to his great contemporaries abroad . He was utterly deficient in psychological analysis . Of broad humor he had only enough to hold his own in the second rank of his native State . Though he could draw very well a sailor 's sweetheart , like Mary Pratt , or a soldier 's daughter , like Mabel Dunham , yet of fine women he had only a chivalrous notion , and painted them from a respectful distance . They were delicate creatures , to be handled like porcelain . Dressed out and beautified , they were to be protected and worshiped . They walk through the halls of his heroes , and take seats at the upper end to distribute the prizes after the tournament . But in Paulding 's Catalina there is more of the sprightly , lovely , living woman than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gertrude Greysons of Cooper 's entire catalogue . The novelist 's six years in the navy had made him a complete Jack Tar . He learned there to handle not only the ropes but the " yarn , " and whatever he told , he told as " to the marines " ; but he told it . with such incredible confidence , and , withal , in such a chivalrous spirit , that he made us shut the eye of criticism and open the ear of faith . He never hesitated for a trick . On a pinch , he could extricate a hero or a heroine twenty times a day , each time by a different device . His drama/is j5ersonce were as extravagant in their heroism or in their devotion as Dickens 's persons were in their eccentricities . Yet , with all these limitations , he possessed a fine , robust sympathy and manliness , and a creative power equal to the best of the men abroad . Easily superior to all our novelists in seatales , which required technical knowledge , and on the frontier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delineation of the passions probably surpassed by Simms . There is a delightful transmissibility of blood in all his heroes . For instance , though there is no Long Tom Coffin anywhere else so admirably set forth as in " The Pilot , " yet we have him cut up into parcels and distributed everywhere , under a white and under a black skin . He is at once the protector and servant of his master , delicate in his sensibilities and rough in his fists , quite competent to carry a cannon unde1r his arm or a maiden on his shoulder- the ideal sailor , in short , combining strength , dogged faithfulness , and noble self-sacrifice with the most rugged and sometimes deformed exterior . Two other persons , Chingachcook and the Pathfinder , Cooper created outright . The former , with Uncas to supplement him , is the ideal Indian - grave , silent , acute , self-contained , sufficiently lofty-minded to take in the greatness of the Indian 's past , and sufficiently far-sighted to see the hopelessness of his future ,  --  with nobility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with inherited wildness enough to keep him true to the instincts of his own race . Probably at his first appearance , in " The Pioneers , " this hero was a study from life . Afterward , when Cooper began to // present him in youth and manhood , the character was idealized ; but the ideal is a noble one , worthy to stand for the heights of the savage nature  --  a god-send to the later romancers , who have never been able to escape from him . Chingachcook appears at his best , perhaps , but under another name , in " The Last of the Mohicans " ; Natty Bumpo , in " The Pathfinder , " where , with all his excellence as a representative frontiersman and scout , he unites in a most delicious and manly way the tender qualities of a lover . The scenes with Mabel Dunham , where he finally merges the lover in the paternal element , present the best range of sentiment that Cooper attained . In the sea-tales , what strikes us as best is the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover " may do for the " marines " ; the " Sea Lions " may come closer home to a sailor 's experience and please us with its homespun and sensible Mary and its vigorously drawn Vineyard skipper , but the interplay of manly affection in the two admirals , and their reciprocity of self-sacrifice , indicate the largeness of Cooper 's nature ; while the handling of the two fleets , whatever the nautical critic may say of it , holds the interest of the landsman best . Again , Harvey Birch , in " The Spy , " is perhaps a new creation from the actual ; but the combination of the spy and the gentleman is so rare , and is put together in so dry an atmosphere of other incident , that it fails to satisfy . The social life in the old mansion of the Whartons is bare beside the social life which Mrs. Stowe , for example , depicts ; while the autumnal glow of the Hudson River scenery never reaches the mellow beauty of autumn days on that noble stream , as painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , is indefinite , though often large and effective . Less real in " The Spy , " he is marvelously successful in " The Prairie " and " The Pathfinder " in producing a sense of the primeval prairie and forest grandeur . Cooper did not , " In years that bring the philosophic mind , " become a philosopher , and one hardly likes to follow him through those rasping times when the spirit of patriotism led him to back up his countrymen abroad , only to back down upon them at home . There is no irritation so uncertain in its results as that of patriotism acting on a thin skin . The patriot who is without a cool philosophy becomes a public scold-abroad , for his country , and against her at home . Yet , however much the critical literary or patriotic spirit may attack Cooper for short-comings , he deepened the sentiment for America among the middle classes of the Old World , and created a genial atmosphere for us there , in which we may thriftily sun ourselves . Following Cooper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " A New England Tale , " struck a new vein , and was welcomed earnestly . In " Redwood , " two years later , and afterward in " Hope Leslie , " " Clarence , " " The Linwoods , " etc. , she took strong hold on the hearts of the New England youth . She was , with Mrs. Child , among the first to re-awaken the Puritan echoes and to paint that mildly wicked life around the " Boston Bay . " She touched the Shaker craze at Lebanon , but in a constrained manner , as if it were too near home . It forms an episode , but not well incorporated , in her novel of " Redwood , " whose Debby , however , must have been a study from life , and is racily rural and fairly comparable to Mrs. Stowe 's New England women . Most of Miss Sedgwick 's women , indeed , whatever be the formality and stiffness of their borrowed language , are delineated with spirit and interior knowledge , and though they share the romantic spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualities familiar to our experience . The author , like Paulding , was doing something to emancipate the American mind from foreign types - being in this original , and superior to Cooper , as she was truer to life than John Neal . In painting the scenery of Western Massachusetts , she is more successful in details than Cooper in like scenery , more nice and discriminating than Paulding , and has a charm of her own in simple , outlying country life . She is everywhere fertile in small devices , which will not always bear inspection ,  --  changes the scene as often as she chooses , and scatters her dead along the line of march , gaining thereby in realism , but losing in intensity . She everywhere interests , but nowhere thoroughly absorbs the reader . Yet she was a worthy progenitress of a long line of most charming women novelists . Mrs. Lydia Maria Child began her literary career with two novels ,  --  " Hobomok , " in 1824 , and " The Rebels , " a year later . The former burrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian and Puritan customs ; the latter deals with Revolutionary history . Both are local , and show a mind tinged by colonial studies and steeped in the Puritan atmosphere . So far they are native work , but no stronger as stories than one would expect from a young woman of twenty-two . It is curious that , thirteen years after Mrs. Child , John Lothrop Motley , beginning in his twentyfifth year , worked the same field-pursuing , in " Morton 's Hope , " the golden dream of youth // during the Revolutionary period about Boston , but losing himself anon in the note-books of a Gdttingen student ; later , in " Merry Mount , " making a fair historical study of Thomas Morton and the Puritans , but with a dramatic interest only sufficient to indicate the strain he was to follow in his magnificent story of " The Dutch Republic . " While Mrs. Child and Miss Sedgwick were developing the early New England interest , William Leggett in New York was working the western mine , printing his " Rebels " with much success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of Richard P. Smith , who published " The Forsaken " in *83i ,  --  Cooper , Neal , Paulding , and Miss Sedgwick held the entire field , publishing rapidly . New York , New England , and the " marines " got their fill of romance . In the next five years there was an influx of fiction , most of it obscure , a little of it promising . Hawthorne wrote " Fanshawe , " which he would gladly have had forgotten , and produced several of the short " Tales , " afterward republished in England . John P. Kennedy appeared with " Swallow Barn , " " Rob of the Bowl , " and " Horse-Shoe Robinson , " the latter his high-water mark . William Gilmore Simms brought out " Guy Rivers , " " The Yemassee , " and " The Partisan " ; James Hall appeared with " Legends of the West " ; Theodore S. Fay , with " Norman Leslie . " Edgar A. Poe contributed many curious tales , all the work of the " Angel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and casks , and poured out wine and hellebore until the sweet Maid of Fiction became a iBacchante . Richard Montgomery Bird came out with " Calavar " and " The Infidel " ; James Lawson , with " Tales and Sketches by a Cosmopolite " ; Hannah F. Lee , with " Grace Seymour " ; and F. W. Thomas , with " Clinton Bradshaw " - a pretty prolific quinquennium altogether . Three of these new writers-Kennedy , Simms , and Poe-were of the South , and introduced the lurid element . James Lawson brought a Scotchman 's reminiscences to the wilds of the West . Fay had a mania for reform , and wrote cleverly for the young , but dismally for the grown-up reader . It is noticeable that the wickedness of " Gotham " was beginning to transpire about this period , and that it was mostly traceable to foreign counts and adventurers . There was a native innocence in the New York youth of both sexes that was pleasing to our pride . Fay thought it useful , however , to saturate his patient reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through a full course of lectures on dueling , drinking , gambling , etc . The interest of the story slips away as the lecture lengthens . Thomas was more successful as a story-teller , and depicted New York social life in the early quarter of the century with considerable unction . His young people are interesting , and his c6nduct of the trial scene in " Clinton Bradshaw " is clever . But he , too , dabbles in politics , law reform , debating societies , and other public themes , until the work of the novelist is forgotten in that of the moralist . James Hall introduced his reader to the gentler side of the Indian character ; and Montgomery Bird , who was in all respects extravagant , but exciting , reached his height in " Nick of the Woods , or the Jibbenainosay , "  --  a book which , intended to show the savageness of the savage , succeeds mainly in displaying the intense cruelty possible in the white man . Every type of character is strained to the utmost ,  --  Roaring Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes to his bosom ; Parson Dodge , the Yankee peddler ; and Peter , the " Jib , " who has Quaker antecedents with a Pawnee outcome . Art is at its lowest ebb , artifice at its highest reach , and Cooper , at last , is outdone in his own province of rank invention . Meanwhile , in the Green Mountain State , Daniel P. Thompson presented some vivid pictures of the Revolutionary struggle , and , later on , in the " Green Mountain Boys , " held the attention well to pioneer methods of fighting the Indians . Of characteristic New England life he gives us a view in " Locke Amsden , " drawn evidently from his own experience . This book is stronger in story than Eggleston 's " Hoosier Schoolmaster , " and truer to the general spirit of the times , though the latter writer sketches better , and has a broader sense of humor . Thompson , however , had an educational motive in this work , and drowned his persons in his theories . Hannah F. Lee also wrote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for novels all over New England . They must be made , in some way , to supplement the pulpit and school-house , or there was no raison d't*tre . Kennedy and Simms were of the school of Cooper , yet each had a vein and strength of his own . The former , whose " Quodlihet , " " Swallow Barn , " and " Rob of the Bowl " are mostly trash , with but little truth or dramatic power or home growth about them , reaches a national value in " Horse-Shoe Robinson . " This person , though perhaps a genuine character , drawn in part from life , would probably never have existed but for " The Pathfinder . " He is a delightful corn- // bination of a good heart , a homely understanding , shrewd fighting qualities , a chivalrous devotion to the duties of friendship , and unprecedented felicity in outriding the Angel of Death , even when the latter is mounted on his fleetest steed ; but , withal , he is an admirably characteristic specimen of American serious humor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest absurdity of the plot of the book and its otherwise alien elements of character , this single creation lifts the work of Kennedy into national importance . Simms , with a downward proclivity toward the Newgate Calendar , began , in 1833 , to flood the country with every style of fiction . There was no generation of Southern life which he did not touch upon , and no phase of romantic murder which he did not illustrate . With a feeling for reality , which was unknown to Cooper and Kennedy , a certain cleverness of invention and strong sense of subordination which kept him from the obvious artifices of both these writers , he was a superior student of human nature in the peculiar line which he took , and held his characters more rigidly to the sequence of cause and effect . He reaches the depth of cold horror in " Beauchampe , " while in " The Partisan " and " Mellichampe " he is at his best as an historical novelist ,  --  making the swamps and swamp-gloom real , and the play of passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wpmen are something like realities , and act an important part in the drama . The romance is made to seem so much like reality , that one is inclined to accept Simms 's pictures as justly characterizing the times . They are pictures of action and the external results of passions , rather than studies in the development of character . If they are not pleasing to the fastidious , yet they have undoubtedly tinted the clear stream of history to the unrefined for a long generation . Beverly Tucker followed in the Simms school , in " The Partisan Ranger , " the value of which lies solely in its showing the spirit of certain sections of Southern political thought . Fenno Hoffman 's " Greyslaer , " published in 1840 , was more in the Cooper vein , but intenser , although the dramatic interest , which opens well , fades away early . Taking thus a hasty survey of the fiction of the first forty years of the century , it is interesting to note how little art there was and what a supply of romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how unscrupulous . There was great justice in the twofold attitude of Europe toward it : for abroad the public read with avidity , while scholars criticised with asperity . The new field of pioneer life which we had opened was wide and varied , displaying every form of action , every strong play of passion , every deep contrast of character . It abounded in the mysterious , the extraordinary , the marvelous , as well as in rich and glorious scenery . Pioneers from every people on the globe met - in the somber primeval forests , on* the boundless prairies , by slow and magnificent streams , where they came face to face ' with the most peculiar , the most picturesquethe most mysterious people on the face of the earth , developing by the meeting both the strongest contrasts of character and the most vivid incidents known even to fiction . It was difficult , in the matter of incident , for invention to outrun reality . Europe , as we said , was eager to read and to swallow whatever came ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of all this vast material ,  --  and well it might be . Looking back upon it now , in the light of more exacting literary art , we can see the early weaknesses , and must acknowledge the justice , even while we lament the spirit , of the severest things that were said against us . We squandered our riches , until it came to be a question whether we should not have to go into bankruptcy . We gave the world a generous feast , but so ill-cooked that only large appetites could partake with impunity . It was left to us , however , in literature , as it was in the industries , to show that we not only had the raw material , but could give the world a lesson in the use of it . In Hawthorne , whose faculty was developed among scholars and with the finest additaments of scholarship , we have our first true artist in literary expression , as well as the most completely equipped genius of romance . His subtle insight into the elements of character was marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even , in his cast of thought and in all the internal and external conditions of his creation . But art is of no country . All ages temper the steel of the fine workman ; all literatures whet the edge of his tools . In his sense of the controlling influence of powers beyond the individual 's grasp , Hawthorne was Grecian . " The Scarlet Letter " and " The Blithedale Romance " are as fierce , unrelenting tragedy- controlling not , only the actors but the writeras anything in Al*schylus . But Hawthorne 's Fate came in the more modern form of " heredity . " There were no angry gods ; the " Sisters Three " had their origin in the ancestral stock a few generations back . His sense of their power , however , was intense , and was deeply based in the constitution of his own mind . He was too sane a man , of course , // to yield credence to the Puritan suspicion of demonic influences , yet he was too much of a seer not to have discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are demons which are the projections of our own minds ; and the struggle of his art was so to materialize these projections as to give them , not the reality which Cotton Mather insisted upon , but a spiritualized reality equally potent over the actions of men . Mr. Henry James , Jr. , has pointed out-very justly , it would seem- a use made of the " scarlet letter " wherein Hawthorne overreached himself ,  - -  where the spiritual projection becomes labored and artificial . As far as Hawthorne attempts to make this image a potent force in Arthur Dimmesdale 's mind , his instinct is unerring ; but when he tries to make it visible to little Pearl and Roger Chillingworth , he passes from art into artifice . There is , perhaps , no natural person in " The Scarlet Letter , " just as there is no natural Hamlet in life ; but we must accept Arthur Dimmesdale as a marvelous embodiment of the Puritan conscience acting upon the finest human clay ,  --  a clay made sensitive to every emotion , quickened by every intellectual force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of the " *IIEdipus Tyrannus . " So , too , in " The House of Seven Gables , " Judge Pyncheon is equally an embodiment of the granitic forces of the Puritan temperament , inheriting , not its finer conscience , but its untempered rigidity as acted upon by the forces of life . The man breaks at last , but he never bends . In the same way each character in Hawthorne 's small list is a finished study , at once local in its surroundings and general in its psychological elements . It is a study of man in his special environment ,  --  more scientific than the science of to-day , because it does what science fails to do ; it tries to settle the spiritual element in its true place as a factor in man 's life . Others have surpassed Hawthorne in the management of external conduct , of dialogue , of home life , of local scenery ; but none have reached the depth to which he penetrated in the scudy of the human heart as the creature of its own creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily excels . His style is masterly in ease , grace , clearness ,  --  the winning , absorbing , entrancing quality . His skill in hinting in ideal and spiritual elements is the most perfect in our day . His mastery of light and shade  --  the power of deepening gloom by sunshine and intensifying sunshine by means of darkness-is of the finest order , at once the gift of original perception and the result of most assiduous practice . Probably few writers ever made so many successes that were failures , or so many failures that were successes ; that is , few ever did so much that was to others artistically perfect in order that they might do something artistically perfect to themselves . Mr. James marvels at the existence of the " Note-Books " ; yet their publication has thrown a flood of light not only upon the workings of Hawthorne 's mind but on the sources of his artistic effects . They supplement with a sunny external quality the gloom of his psychology . They show us in his own nature a capacity for beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for morbid analysis ; that is , they furnish the biography of the sympathetic side of his mind , while the novels represent what was equally real to his emotional nature . No doubt , while his actual life was simple and pure-minded , capable of absorbing beauty and interest , he had , in imagination , lived through the tortures of the damned . He had given to Hester and Dimmesdale no exaltation or despair of which he was not himself capable , and probably none which he had not , by sheer force of imagination , without any adequate external cause , passed through . Others have been capable of such moods  --  the moods of " angels and ministers of grace " as well as of demons - without being either sinners or angels ; but few have obtained the power of expressing them as he did . He spiritualized everything he touched , with a quality which is felt but can not be analyzed ,  --  which eludes every attempt to fix it . Little Pearl , standing in front of Governor Bellingham ' s mansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to caper and dance , and imperatively required that 4ie whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front and given her to play with . " It was no harder to strip off that sunshine for little Pearl than it is to detach and handle the spiritual quality of these romances . We had never , reached such insight , or such grace of style , before Hawthorne , and we have never reached it since . As a writer , he was long in obscurity and had little influence on other authors . Emerging into something like local note when the first series of " Twice-Told Tales " was published , in 1837 , he dawned upon a wider field , in 1842 , with the addition of the " Second Series . " The intensity of his gloom was lightened in the " Mosses from an Old Manse " in 1846 , and he then reached a larger circle of readers . In i8*o , 51 , and 52 , he became national in fame , and soon reached the height . Meanwhile , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of new names we find Cornelius Mathews , who tried , unsuccessfully , in " Behemoth , " to re-people the West with the " Mound-Builders , " and , // later , gave us some fair bits of local coloring in the " Career of Puffer Hopkins " and " Moneypenny " ; but , as stories , these were cheap and flashy . We find , also , Charles F. Briggs 's " First of the Knickerbockers , " which has a flavor-merely a flavor-of old Dutch times and of the spirit of New Amsterdam , but no good dramatic action or story . There was some humor and satire , and some local value also , in his later novels- the " Adventures of Harry Franco , " the " Haunted Merchant , " etc . Caroline M. Kirkland appeared with her " New Home , " " Forest Life , " and " Western Clearings , " which , with but the slightest thread of narrative , and no dramatic power whatever , were good as realistic pictures of Western settlements . It was just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field : Motley , with " Morton 's Hope " ; Ware , with " The Simple Cobbler of Aggawam " ; Longfellow , with " Hyperion " ; 0 . A. Brownson , with his religious tract , " Charles Elwood , " which had but the faintest apology for the story form ; Allston , with " Monaldi . " None of these works made any distinct flutter as fiction , or left any impress as pictures of manners and character . D. Carruthers , in the South , and P. Hamilton Myers , who belonged to New York , did a little for local illustration , but no more . Maria J. McIntosh kindled a youthful interest , and got republished abroad . C. W. Webber illustrated South-western life . Herman Melville gave some realistic pictures in " Typee " and " Omoo , " and in the seatales , in which , however , he fell short of Cooper . *Miss Emily Chubbuck ( afterward Mrs. Judson ) was getting closer home to the girl-life of New England in " Alderbrook . " The Warner sisters had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of the adult generation , coming closer home to the outdoor life of the northern rural districts than to any serious realities . George W. Curtis was dreaming through the East with the " Howadji , " and emptying his delicious " Nile Notes " into the lap of Fiction ; but the sweet maid was just then looking too fixedly on Hawthorne to discover that she was even addressed . She would , by and by , smile more kindly on " The Potiphar Papers " and on " Trumps . " While the field was thus invaded by many who failed to establish a solid footing , two peculiarly characteristic and most promising men , in opposite schools , and with most opposite spirit and tendency , had come and gone , each leaving a vivid trace , yet each failing of the best ,  --  Sylvester Judd and Edgar A. Poe . Poe 's first prose tale appeared in Baltimore in 1833 . For ten years he worked that unsunned mine of his , producing shapes grotesque and horrible , in an atmosphere whose murkiness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projections of a weird , fantastic imagination , beaten into form most laboriously , and everywhere showing the stress of the workmanship , but unillumined by any beam of beauty , uninspired with a single spiritual or divine force . Unlike Dante and Hugo , Poe , in his flights of imagination , never went parallel with any movement of the human heart . His stories were exercises of a marvelous ingenuity , and , for the most part , belonged to the domain of nightmares . In 1845 these tales were all before the world . Hawthorne 's second series of " TwiceTold Tales " was read throughout New England . Cooper was still in the field . With three such powerful imaginations , America was well equipped in the field of romance ; but she still needed a realistic painter . Cooper grasped the pioneer spirit in its largest range ; Hawthorne was most fully possessed of the Puritan spiritual and demonic forces ,  --  each being in himself representative ,  --  while Poe was representative of himself alone , soaring or plunging in a world of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unpictured until Sylvester Judd , who was then thirty-two years old , published " Margaret " in 1845 . By gift of nature Judd had a wide range : for he possessed the keen sensibility of Brown and Hawthorne to external impressions and to internal convulsions . He had been visited by all the religious emotions , and was played upon by every Puritan element . He had , moreover , become a cyclopedia of idioms , dialects , and rural technicalities . He possessed the dramatic faculty , and could reproduce as well as Hogarth the tragedy of low life . We have in the campmeeting , the small-pox visitation , the murder at the dance , and a score of others , scenes as lurid with moral depravity as Hogarth 's best . But , unlike that artist , Judd had a delicate purity of mind which made him extremely felicitous in reproducing the simplicity of child-life and moral innocence . Margaret 's pathway , amid hideous shapes of depravity in her family associations , is as redolent of innocence as the pathway of Una and her lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to and from church , her spiritual experiences in the evening on the hills , the sweetness that radiates like moonlight from her pure soul , are singularly childlike . She walks in a tainted atmosphere , but the miasma has failed to strike in . Chilion with his violin , and Obed with his herbs and idiotic obliquity , are originals . The book is // saturated with genuine aboriginal Yankee humor , which depends much less on dialect than on quaint phrases and turns of thought . There is every variety of this , from the raw Yankee of Obed to the semi-educated homespun of Deacon Ramsdell . " Good tew chaw , " " orful burnin ' , " " Luddy mussy ! " Marcy me ! " " arrants , " " chores , " " Goll darn it ! " " run of an idee , " " sozzled her feet in water , " " put some kindlers under the pot , " " would n't fetch a bungtown copper , " " gallows " for " braces , " " glairy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good as nut-cakes , " " jerked up his trowsers , " " nuzzles about in the grass , " " Oh , dear me , suz ! " " lam the brats , " " J snore " for " I declare , " " lollopping on the steps , " " begrutch me , " " kneehigh to a toad , " " clear the coop , " " doused into each other , " - these are but a few of the phrases which every one acquainted with the rural life of thirty or forty years ago will recognize , not as exceptional , but as a part of the common vocabulary . John Neal 's Yankees are caricatures ; Paulding 's are borrowings ; but Judd 's are indigenous to the New England soil . They had deep religious natures , and when they were sweet they were racy and rich ; when they turned sour they were tart ; but there was a basis of natural vigor in both their sin and their suffering for which only the granitic life of New England would account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been grafted less of the moral reformer , he would have been a great novelist in the modern sense : since he was quite as realistic as any in the modern school , and , moreover , was safe from the novelistic sin of pessimism ; for , with a wealth of external fact , he was rich , also , in facts of spiritual significance . But the intense element of moral reform carries him away . He must have his sermon , however much the story suffer . He mounts not only the pulpit , but the platform , and preaches with camp-meeting energy the speedy coming of his new millennium . Margaret and Richard Edney are dragged into all conceivable associations-first , that we may be sure of seeing every form of New England life , from " intery , mintery , cutery , corn " down to murder trials and jail-yard executions ; and , next , that we may take our share in every reform , from the slavery agitation to the lazar-house visitation . There is in " Margaret " the making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery , but all undigested . There are scenes of most powerful dramatic energy ; but the story , as a whole , is sacrificed to the sermon . The book was welcomed by the best men in New England as of the highest novelistic promise , but it contained all the elements that would ultimately throttle the fulfillment . The next decade , 1850-60 , brought in three strong writers ,  --  all New Englanders , and two of them women . Of writers of lower rank , Richard B. Kimball opened with " St. Leger , " John Esten Cooke with " Leatherstocking and Silk , " giving , later , " Dr. Vandyke , " " Hilt to Hilt , " etc. ,  --  all abounding in blood and passion . Neither writer had any strength in characterization , and though both were prolific and exciting as story-tellers , they found a wide rather than a discriminating audience . Alice Cary was delightfully discursive in sketches of Western life ; J. T. Trowbridge , in the home element of northern New York and of New England ; H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " marines " ; N. P. Willis , like most of our traveled scholars , was interested in foreign life , and , among the artists of Italy , gave us almost our first sight of the American girl abroad . Sophia Firkin , in the studio of Paul Fane , determined to have her " bust taken from the life , " is rather Bohemian and coarsely drawn ; but she is suggestive of our more recent peripatetic heroines . J. G. Holland made his first venture on the field of romance , allured , like Motley , Mrs. Child , and Miss Sedgwick , by early local traditions . The mixed colonial life of interior Massachusetts , with a spice of the witches , bigots , and other sinners , and a yeasty handful of virtue in Mary Holyoke and of justice in William Pynchon , makes the staple of the story , which marks that wide human sympathy . and careful balancing of the good and evil moral forces in common life that mad*i Dr. Holland so popular in after years . But as a story this early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Career , " later on , he struck a deeper vein , working out two spirited characters ,  - -  Mrs . Ruggles and the energetic , bustling Dr. Theophilus Gilbert . Miss Cummings , in " Mabel Vaughn , " " The Lamp-lighter , " etc. , added something to the delineation of girl-nature and home-life , working that common but fascinating vein in which our women-writers have shown themselves most at home . Some of these story-tellers were clever , and had a wide audience , but all were greatly over-shadowed by Mrs. Stowe , whose " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " in 1852 , " Dred " ( or " Nina Gordon " ) , in 1856 , and " The Minister 's Wooing , " in 1859 , marked a new era in American novel-writing . Here we had the genuine novel ,  --  no mere romance , or allegory , or evolution from the inner consciousness , but a work saturated with American life ,  --  not local , but spanning the whole arch of the States . Mrs. Stowe was brought up amidst the // THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and was as much the product of its clerical faculty as any divinity student . Both her associations and her sympathies sent her to the front of the antislavery agitation ; while her social advantages and her early migration to the West gave her an opportunity of studying our society in its widest range . Thus she had in her the Puritan in its loftiest reach  --  the New England clergyman . She was in the forefront of the broadest Puritanic movement - the antislavery reform . She developed amid the finest culture , and ripened in mind when the times were ripest for action . These were her opportunities . Her gifts from nature were of the Walter Scott pattern . Her mind was masculine in its perception of humor , in its broad , healthy common sense . She absorbed , like Scott , everything that goes to the fullest expression of human action-incident , gesture , dialect , feature , tone , inflection - both the peculiar and the general . She could generalize and individualize-her individuals being both types and distinct personageswarm , full-blooded , alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large intellectual endowment that she could give a fair fund of mind to each of her creations ; such a wealth of humor and bonhomie that she could warm the coldest blood ; such a wide possibility of the sinner and saint in her nature that she could endow a double-headed procession to march with Eva heavenward , or with Legree in the other direction . In " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " she was lavish . This book contains her whole range of characters , and everything combined to make it her great work . " Dred " is but a sober variation on the anti-slavery theme ; " The Minister 's Wooing " is but a study in early New England life . " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " alone places her with Walter Scott . It is more intense and morally fierce than anything of Scott , and more dramatic . The background , though not so historically full as Scott 's backgrounds , is nearly as rich . Except in the negro element , there is no distinctly humorous character in its pages , but a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Phineas Fletcher , or Topsy , but more from the author 's management of incident , and binding every person into the human family . Humor is the sunshine which warms everything into life . While Mrs. Stowe was still overtopping New England , Mrs. Spofford opened a new mine in ghostly romance . " Sir Rohan 's Ghost , " " Azarian , " and " A Thief in the Night " were somber unrealities . They were projections of the imagination , like Poe 's , but with a suffusion of soul and an intensity of feeling to which Poe was a stranger . " A Thief in the Night , " in particular , was a work of high art . The awful mystery of that chamber of deathinto which we are introduced at the opening takes possession of the mind . We stand there over the ghastly corpse , and wait with white faces while the narrator goes back to trace the dark approaches of the grim vengeance to the threshold . We feel as if fixed by the " glittering eye " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American fiction ,  --  none in which the whole atmosphere is so penetrated with a terrible sense of blood . Poe 's tales , in comparison , were aggregations of horror ; this was a vital presence . The writer had given her soul to it , and was absorbed out of sight , - a thing which could never happen to Poe . Another book of the period , showing much originality , but of a sunnier sort , was " The New Priest of Conception Bay . " In this the Rev. R. T. S. Lowell did for the comparatively unknown region of Newfoundland what Judd had done for New England ; portraying , in the sunniest colors , the simple , rural life of Conception Bay , and making real to the mind those rugged shores , with the barrenness creeping up the sands and rocks , and spreading over the hills and over the life of the people . He did for our north-east coast what Scott , in " The Pirate , " had done for the borders of Scotland ,  --  painted the amphibious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the winds in stormy weather , and were permeated with the glow of the brilliant sunshine in summer . All passions there were mild and comparatively innocuous , yet all existed in the egg . Inability to do anything very bad seemed to be an effect of the climate . The very villains were imported , and their villainy faded out . While the story spreads over a large surface , and is often at loose ends , lacking concentration , the concomitants bear every sign of being true to the life and spirit of those shores . The dialects are delicately discriminated . Like Judd , the author had poured the accumulated riches of years into his one book , and it was easy to see that there would be no worthy successor . This keenness of observation often showed itself in our story-writers of the next ten years . Men of large culture and fine sagacity entered the field merely as foragers , not equipped either with the artistic sense or the high genius of the true novelist , but of shrewd and penetrative critical powers . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elsie Venner " and " The Guardian Angel " overflowed with wit and fun and with rare character sketching . One of the best studies in the scholastic life we have ever seen was old Byles Gridley , from whose paternal heart // to his professorial eye was a long stretch , but a straight road . He combined in his person the village patriarch with a whole parietal faculty , and the vigilant patrol which he kept up over the village literature and love shows with what a keen sense Holmes had studied life at the neighboring university . Beecher , in " Norwood , " and Higginson , in " Malbone , " contributed some character sketches and some of the frame-work of New England life , charming in wit and humor and rich in descriptive passages ,  --  full of local life . With Miss Louisa Alcott came a spicier child-life , and with Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney a more natural girlhood than had existed before among writers of either sex . We were getting , in fact , from romance to realism ; and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and best , though finding but few readers , was Mrs. Elizabeth B. Stoddard , whose " Morgesons " was a work of genius , showing the keenest observation of local customs and of character , and adding to Charlotte Bront* 's skillful minuteness a caustic humor which made a new field in novel-writing . The delineation of a kind of life not yet by any means gone from New England , was , indeed , to Mrs. Stoddard , almost too fascinating ; and the story is sometimes heavy with a redundancy of spice and plums . The dialogue is crisp , and concentrates action without elucidating it sufficiently . In the paucity of those finger-posts which the more generous novelists set up to indicate the road , the reader must go slowly or lose his way ; but with patience comes an abundant reward . The war period was ushered in with a greater concentration of attention on our native resources in social life. * But the war soon scattered all forces in fiction to center them in action . Pen and tongue and hand , heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intellectual life of the nation , like an electric spark , flashed at the point of the bayonet ; and with the end of the fight all literary energy seemed spent . There were but few worthy novels written * This period , with that subsequent to the war , will be considered in a second essay , to appear soon in THE CENTURY . for the eight years following i86i . The old writers were silenced , struck down , like Winthrop , at the front , or , like Hawthorne , by the breath of the cannon-ball as it were . Those who held over this period of strain , surviving in the magazines , lived an attenuated life . The magazines , indeed , almost alone preserved to our fiction the breath of life , and out of them and their monthly demand grew both the new taste and the new supply : for they lived close to the railroad centers , near the great arteries , and felt the pulse of our new , hurrying life . The war had disturbed the old monotony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood into new channels ; and out of the change and ferment was to come a more vigorous and much more original novelistic growth . When it was ready , it came in a burst from all parts of the country . The wheels of time had got a fresh jog , and were rolling on a little faster than usual . The magazines had caught the cue , and were demanding rapidity of action . " He who reads must run , " they said : " therefore write so that he who runs may read . " The rich , old , delightful backgrounds of gossip and scenery began to drop out . Walter Scott and Thackeray seems likely to be left to the old folks . Even Dickens , who gave an impulse to much of the new work , used too large a canvas to suit the new taste . Our writers had begun to travel , and felt the keen artistic sense of European criticism on their style . Unfortunately , also , they felt the sneer which pervades a certain small corner-far from the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fain to suppress the higher idealizing faculty rightfully due to the best imaginations ,  --  " the vision and the faculty divine , " which preserves our sanity and has " power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal silence , " to give us sight of those " truths that wake To perish never ; Which neither listlessness , nor mad endeavor , Nor man , nor boy , Nor all that is at enmity with joy , Can utterly abolish or destroy .
