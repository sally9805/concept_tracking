INTRODUCTION ACROSS THE CONTINENT , or Scenes from New York life and the Pacific railroad The highly sensational and widely popular melodrama , Across the Continent , was originally written by the actor , manager , and author , James McCloskey ; but , according to Arthur Byron , the version here reproduced is largely the work of Byron 's father , Oliver Doud Byron . I am indebted to Arthur Byron for the following account of Across the Continent . This account aids in clearing up questions of authorship and original production . Mr. Byron became a star and his repertoire consisted of Don Caesar de Bazan , Ruy Blas and Richard the Third . While on tour in those plays , Across the Continent by J. J. McCloskey was produced in New York and was a failure . Later on McCloskey offered the play to Mr. Byron for a cash transaction ; to do with as he saw fit . Mr. Byron read the play and told McCloskey he would rewrite it , and bought the play . In its original form Mr. Byron played it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By that time the season was over and Mr. Byron went to Long Branch , N.J. , for the summer vacation . He rewrote Across the Continent , produced it in September , and it was an instant success . He played it for ten consecutive seasons . According to Odell ( Annals of the New York Stage , Vol . IX , p. 101 ) the first metropolitan production of the play occurred at Mrs. Conway 's Park Theatre on November 28 , 1870 , with the following cast : Joe Ferris O. D. Byron John Adderly J. W. Carroll George Constant Mark Bates Thomas Goodwin F. Chippendale Dennis O'Dwyer W. Lamb Master Adderly Willie Shepperd Ambrose Walsh J. W. Shannon James Sallin Mark Hughes Thomas Goodwin , Jr . Mark Bates Giovanni W. H. Cooper Caesar Augustus A. Queen Black Cloud W. J. Ferguson John O'Dwyer E.

For the following facts concerning the life of Oliver Doud Byron I am again indebted to his son , Arthur Byron . Oliver Doud was born in Fredericksburg , Md. , in 1843 . He made his first stage appearance at the age of fourteen at the Holliday Street Theatre in Baltimore . Then began an association with the Booth family , especially with Edwin and John Wilkes Booth , that lasted throughout their lives . Byron was associated with his best friend , John Wilkes Booth , in the Stock Company of Richmond during the season of 1859-1860 and during later seasons . His acceptance of an engagement in Pittsburgh , Pa. , finally terminated his association with John Wilkes Booth . In Pittsburgh , Byron became leading man of the company . From Pittsburgh he went to New Orleans . At a later date he played with Wallack 's Stock Company in New York . During the long course of his career he acted with Adah Isaacs Menken and played Iago to Edwin Booth 's Othello . These actors frequently alternated the rles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1869 , Byron married an actress , Kate Crehan , whose sister , Ada Rehan , eventually became one of America 's greatest actresses . Mrs. Byron 's stage name was Kate O'Neil . Ada Rehan made her first appearance in Across the Continent ! with Mr. and Mrs. Byron . William Gillette and Arthur Byron , Oliver Doud Byron 's only son , also made their first stage appearances in that play . In addition to the ten years ' run of Across the Continent ! , Byron produced with his company many other successful plays . He revived Across the Continent ! around 1888 , and continued to play it until about 1895 . He discontinued his own company shortly after the successful organization of the Theatrical Syndicate . He retired from the stage in 1912 and died October 22 , 1920 The manuscript from which this version of Across the Continent ! is taken was owned by the actor and agent Royal S. Stout . He permitted Mr. Clark to transcribe his copy for inclusion in this volume . CAST OF CHARACTERS John Adderly , who keeps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon Thos . Goodwin , Sr. , merchant prince Thos .

Five years ago I left him in undisturbed possession of a house that had stood the shocks of thirty years . Young in years but old in mercantile experience . During the panic of ' 73 , while other houses were tottering and falling about us , ours alone stood  --  like the giant oak , it defied the storm . And now , what do I hear ?

Joe Ferris Let it suffice for the moment that I am here as your best friend , and Heaven helping me , I 'll prove myself one by thwarting yonder devil . Let us call him by his right name for once . DEVIL , did I not tell you that you should feel the weight of my arm  --  while you rioted at your ease on the ill-gotten gains wrung by the father from the poor starving wretches of Five Points ?

Thos . Goodwin Sr. No , impossible ! Joe . Joe Ferris Through his hellish machinations and perjury , too , he confines me to the loathsome cells of the State 's prison , but I have a paper signed by his confederate , and attested to by the judge of the court before which I was tried , proving that I was innocent and he the guilty one . And he must take my place in that same prison . That is your doom , John Adderly . Ell . Ell No  --  no  --  Joe  --  stop . Do n't say that . Good . Thos .

I heard a cry of distress , and following the sound I found a woman in distress . Aye , dying in the streets . I afterwards learned she had gone to him , asking for a mere pittance . Bread enough to keep herself and two children from starving , after her husband had been ruined by rum , and she thrown from his door and left to die in the street . Those two children are now mine , by adoption , and living under this roof . Joe . Joe Ferris To Ellerton Oh , villain , pray that it may not fall and crush you ! Ell .

Why , the coal only exists on the char that he carries in his pocket . Why , he 's the whole coal company ; transacts all the business . In his pocket , are all the stealings , rolled up in a little bit of a lump . Give it a toss and away it goes . Indicates tossing a ball away Ell . Ell But I never forged my father 's name . Good .

You instigated the Italian to strike the cowardly blow that your arm failed to strike . ARREST that man ! Ell . Ell Crossing to Goodwin , Sr. But you yourself saw him destroy the proof against your son ! Joe . Joe Ferris A father will not convict a son . Ell . Ell But my oath will . Joe . Joe Ferris But you are a criminal , and your oath will not be taken seriously . Women come down and congratulate Joe , as Policeman goes down and puts handcuffs on Ellerton , who stands amazed .

But as Joe calls Johnnie , and ladies stop Johnnie , you escort the ladies over to the ranch , and you 'd better stop on your way back , and tell the Chief to send me a few of his braves . Black Cloud and his band are reported at Station 42 , and it is possible they may come here . I do n't want them to catch us without a guard , as it might invite attack . John . John Adderly All right , Joe . Catch on , girls ! Offers arms , which two girls take and they exit , followed by other girl and Chinaman , off R.1.E .

Thos . Goodwin Jr . What in the world brought you out here ? Joe . Joe Ferris Oh , Tom , do n't ask me . How could I stay in New York after what happened in your house ? Tom . Thos . Goodwin Jr . How can I ever repay you for what you did ? In a moment of madness I forged my father 's name , and you saved me from disgrace and ruin . Joe . Joe Ferris It was a terrible sacrifice , for in doing so I forfeited the good opinion of your family , by revealing the name and conditions of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I investigated , and found you innocent of any crime . Joe . Joe Ferris But I was a gambler , and my associates were men of the lowest stamp . But , remember , I was left alone when a mere boy . I found myself in the streets one night , with clothing scarcely sufficient to protect me from the cold , while vice rolled by me , wrapped in furs . I resolved I would lead such a life no longer , and I became a gambler . My wits were as sharp as theirs . They did n't thrust me aside , but even then , the money wrung from my dupes seems to melt in my hands . So , after passing through an eventful life I have at last settled down as station master at 47th U. P. Railway . By the way , Tom , what ever became of Adderly ? You know , he was sentenced for five years for that affair with the Italian . I suppose he is still serving the State ? Tom . Thos . Goodwin Jr . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after killing one guard and nearly killing another he escaped by jumping into the river .

That man bears me no good will . Tom . Thos . Goodwin Jr . Yes . They never succeeded in capturing him . But tell me , do you feel contented out here ? Joe . Joe Ferris How could I be contented ?

But tell me , how is it that we find you here ? Joe . Joe Ferris I have learned that an honest day 's work is the best nurse for a good night 's sleep . Chinaman has been trying to pull ribbons off Aunt Susannah 's hat , she turns , frightened Aunt S. Aunty Susannah Goodwin What in the world is that ? Joe .

Louise Why did you leave New York so suddenly , without a word of farewell ? Joe . Joe Ferris I loved one far above me . Do you remember , when I sat in the witness box giving evidence against that man , and every word I spoke was carrying me further and further away from her , until I had revealed myself a gambler and the accomplice of this unprincipled man ?

Louise You were wrong not to disclose your love , for had she been a true woman , she never would have refused such a noble heart as yours . Joe . Joe Ferris Had you been that woman , would you then have spoken thus ? Lou . Louise I would , indeed . Joe . Joe Ferris Then , ' t is you I love .

And now , more of the white race turn their faces to the west . Where can the Red Man go ? What spot can he call his own ? None  --  but his Mother Earth , to sleep his last sleep . Behold , there is another reason why we must fight . The Iron Horse comes thundering across our plains . Our warriors look aghast , and in vain does Black Cloud tell them that these were the hunting grounds of their fathers , and belong to them . They are filled with fear . And what has the white man given us for all this ? Ugh  --  his fire-water . It steals away the brains of my people and excites them to deeds of violence . The Red Man 's hours are numbered .

Fire the station  --  stampede the horses , and when the sun rises , not one of their cursed tribe shall be left alive . Chief . Chief Black Cloud When does the Iron Horse come back ? Add . John Adderly At this time tomorrow , and they must find naught here but smouldering ashes . Chief . Chief Black Cloud White man is black . But they are our enemies and must perish .
