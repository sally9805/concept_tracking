txt The recent cases of failure complicated by embezzlement and other crimes have had a curiously uniform development . A person who has been regarded as entirely solvent is suddenly caught in some unexpected turn of the stock market . His creditors institute inquiries which show that he has been for a long time time obtaining money under false pretenses and living not so much by his own wits as by the lack of wit among those with whom he has been transacting business , if their account of the matter is to be taken . They are unanimously of the opinion that he is a bad man and that an example should be made of him . Through their urgency the bad man is converted into a scapegoat , and is laden with all the liabilities of the firm for the ostensible behoof of which he has been defiling his individual soul with rascalities . Sometimes he is sent off into a wilderness from which no scapegoat is extraditable . Sometimes he is less fortunate and abides in Ludlow-Street Jail , partaking of worldly amusements , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In either case the men who are loudest in denouncing him are the men without whose assistance , collusive or negligent , he could not have succeeded in swindling the public . A remarkable circumstance in these transactions is that the scapegoat carries only the liabilities of his associates . It never appears that he carries off the assets , or what may be described as the swag . In some cases he is induced , as a condition precedent to being allowed to depart , to make over to the more importunate of his creditors what can be identified as his property , an . arrangement which the law unamiably defines as the compounding of a felony . Sometimes it does not appear what has become of the assets . There must be a certain nucleus of soap for a bubble , but it often .. happens in Wallstreet that the largest and most iridescent bubbles , when punctured , collapse utterly without leaving the smallest trace of anything said . The latest scapegoat is SCOVIL , and Scovil seems to have accepted his destiny as a scapegoat with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by.riever. emerging from the wilderness to undergo crossexamination it is becoming increasingly evident that several persons and institutions ought , to be much obliged to him . A clerk even in a highly respectable law office has been known to encounter difficulties in securing a loan of much less than $50,000 on his individual responsibility . A commonplace law clerk would be deterred from applying to an institution for a loan by the fact that one of his employers was a Director in the institution . This circumstance seems actually to have encouraged SCOVIL , who , indeed , seems to have been at all times quite above concealment . He pretended to be speculating in the interest of his employer , although his employer never speculated , and it never occurred to anybody to ascertain how far his agency as a managing - clerk in a law firm entitled him to gamble on the credit of an employer who did not gamble . So brazen was he that the brokers ' accounts for the operations which he pretended to be carrying on for his employer , and was carrying on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office of the employers whose confidence he was daily abusing , and to whom he must have been , as a managing clerk , of very slight utility . It is curious to reflect that if he had continued to gamble with luck on his side the brokers through whom he gambled would never have suspected that he was not authorized , as he pretended to be , to pledge the credit of his employer , and they would have gone on supposing that Mr. DAY was responsible for his clerk 's gambling debts . When we consider Scovu , we are depressed by the spectacle of so much depravity . But our confidence in human nature revives when we consider the guilelessness of everybody else connected with his proceedings . The childlike confidence with which he was treated by his employers , and by the brokers and the officers who took his word that ' he was dealing with them on behalf of his employer is even more remarkable than the baseness with which he abused that confidence .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
