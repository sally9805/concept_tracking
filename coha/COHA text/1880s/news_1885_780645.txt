txt Secretary manning has asked for and received the resignation of Mr. Henry B. James . Chief of the Customs Division of the Treasury Department . The namo of the successor to Mr. James has not yet been announced . The suggestion is made in the department that it should be given to Mr. B. T , Saunders , Deputy Commissioner of Naviga ? tion . Assistant Secretary Fairchild has had an opportunity to become somewhat acquainted with the business of this division , as he is neceso sexily brought into daily relations with it . The chief of the Customs Division considers all questions involving decisions upon disputed assessments by Collectors , and for some reason it has been seen fit to make it one of the most mysterious branches of the Treasury . There has been some talk here at times that has led mere outsiders to suppose that decisions by the Treasury often reached Custom House brokers quietly before they were known by the general public . The intimacy of a Custom House broker with a man in a position to know these decisions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion made in the newspapers some time ago that a well-known Custom House broker in New-York enjoyed special advantages in get- , ting valuable information about decisions , led to the publication of a synopsis of decisions weekly , instead of monthly , aS had been the practice . In justice to all merchants and importers it will be of the first importance to secure a man of integrity for Chief of the Customs Division . The criticism nas been made that there has been a lack of system in the division , and that rulings upon the same subject have been made over and over again , and not always consistently . Mr. Fairchild will undoubtedly ' look out for a man who does not care so much for red tape as he does about the disposition of business . The removal of Mr. James gives great satisfaction to many persons who have believed that a change in the head of the Customs Division could have been made with advantage several years ago .                @ @ @ @ @
