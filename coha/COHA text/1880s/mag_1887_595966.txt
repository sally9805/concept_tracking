now attached to them , were and Mind Cure , in the sense * unknown ; to-day in the * w press , in conversation , in * literature , and especially in discussions relating to health and disease , and to the more occult phenomena of human nature , they frequently occur . To many they have no definite meaning , and long conversations are carried on concerning them in which the most diverse views are maintained , ending in confusion and contradiction , because those who converse have not a uniform conception of the signification of the terms . Some declare Christian Science and Mind Cure to be the same ; others stoutly deny this , and seek to establish a radical distinction . Some represent Christian Science as a great advance upon ordinary Christianity ; others denounce it as but refined Pantheism ; while many more brand both Christian Science and Mind Cure as delusion , a reaction from ' the uncompromising materialism of the age . Mrs. Mary Baker Glover Eddy , President of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College , claims to have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was in Massachusetts , in the year i866 , that I discovered the Science of Metaphysical Healing , which I afterwards named Christian Science . The discovery came to pass in this way . During twenty years prior to my discovery I had been trying to trace all physical effects to a mental cause ; and in the January of a866 I gained the scientific certainty that all causation was Mind , and every effect a mental phenomenon . " Mrs. Eddy further states that about the year 1862 her health was failing rapidly , and she " employed a distinguished mesmerist , Mr. P. P. Quimby -  --  a sensible , elderly gentleman , with some advanced views about healing . There were no Metaphysical Healers then . The Science of Mental Healing had not been discovered . " Whether or not Mrs. Eddy is indebted for her ideas to Mr. Quimby has since been the subject of heated discussion ; for the short time which has elapsed since the " discovery " has been long enough for the development of several rival schools , which have engendered toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fizeologicum and odium medici*m combined . Speaking of her rivals , Mrs. Eddy modestly observes , " Some silly publications , whose only correct or salient points are borrowed , without credit , from Science and Health , ' would set the world right on Metaphysical Healing , like children thrumming a piano and pretending to teach music or criticise Mozart . " The history of the discovery is of sufficient importance to be given . " The cowardly claim that I am not the originator of my own writings , but that one P. P. Quimby is , has been legally met and punished . . . . Mr. Quimby died in 1865 , and my first knowledge of Christian Science , or Metaphysical Healing , was gained in i866 . . . . When he doctored mel was ignorant of the nature of mesmerism , but subsequent knowledge has convinced me that he practiced it . " Mrs. Eddy says that after having been for many years a sufferer from chronic diseases , she met with an accident which produced , according to physicians , a fatal injory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would not live till noon . She replied that she would be well at that time . Her pastor called after service and found her busy about the house . One of her assistants says that " while she knew that she was healed by the direct and gracious exercise of the divine power , she was indisposed to make an old-time miracle of it . " After three years ' meditation she concluded that her recovery was in accordance with general spiritual laws , capable of being known and clearly stated . She then began to teach and write ; though prior to the expiration of the three years , namely , in 1867 , she taught a purely metaphysical system of healing to , as she says , " the very first student who was ever so instructed since the days of the Apostles and the primitive Church . " Her essays were circulated among her students privately . In 1870 she copyrighted her first pamphlet , but did not publish it till six years afterwards . In 1876 she organized the Christian Scientist Association , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized a Church , " a Mind Healing Church , without creeds , called the Church of Christ . " To the pastorate of this she accepted a call , and was ordained A. D. i88i . The college flourishes , the church has an assistant pastor , and Mrs. Eddy receives so much patronage as a teacher as to compel the publication of the following : " The authoress takes no patients , and has no time for medical consultation . " * See this magazine for June , i886 , and March , 1887. // Practitioners , who of course are not obliged to waste much time upon such sordid things as anatomy , physiology , or materia medica , are prepared with great rapidity . The primary class in Christian Science Mind Heaing includes twelve lessons . In the first week six of these are given . The term continues only about three weeks , and the charge for tuition is $300 . The normal class requires six lectures . Graduates from the primary class are advised to practice at least one year before entering this class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a class of Metaphysical Obstetrics which requires only six lectures , for which $ioo must be paid . In addition to these there is a class in Theology , including six lectures on the Scriptures , for which $200 must be paid . The largest discount to an *ndigent student is $ioo on the first course . Husbands and wives , if they enter together the primary class , may pay $300 ; but , entering at different times , must pay the regular price , and must do that for all other courses , payment being made strictly in advance . It is obvious , therefore , that the benefits of the Mind Cure can not be applied to commercial transactions ; and that 8oo material dollars , exclusive of board , are required to master the Science of 1*vI etaphysical Healing ,  --  unless one were to say that the national bank notes are merely material symbols of an immaterial and impalpable essence . Considering the short time that has elapsed since the " discovery , " the number of practitioners , as advertised in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and twentynine men ; and all but five of the men appear to be associated with their wives in the practice of the profession . There are also Christian Science institutes and colleges advertised ; two in New York , four in Chicago , one in Milwaukee , one in Brooklyn , and one in Colorado . The other institutions do not charge so large a sum as Mrs. Eddy . Some of them agree to give sufficient instruction for *25 to justify the would-be practitioner in beginning . Others communicate all they know , with the privilege of meeting for conversation once a month for a year , on payment of $*oo . They give diplomas , valued according to the standing of the respective schools . Impostors also have arisen , so that Mrs. Eddy has notified the public that all persons claiming to have been her pupils , who can not show diplomas legally certifying to that effect , are preferring false claims . THEORY . By a careful examination of the works of those who have written upon this subject , including Evans , Grimk6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazzard , Nichols , Marston , etc. , and by conversation with Mental Healers , Christian Scientists , and their patients , I have ascertained that most of them concur with Mrs. Eddy in the fundamental principles of the system , and that where they diverge it is upon minor points . Her hypothesis is that " the only realities are the Divine Mind and its ideas . . . . That erring mortal views , misnamed mind , produce all the organic and animal action of the mortal body . . . . Rightly understood , instead of possessing sentient matter , we have sensationless bodies . . . . Whence came to me this conviction in antagonism to the testimony of the human senses ? From the self-evident fact that matter has no sensation ; from the common human experience of the falsity of all material things ; from the obvious fact that mortal mind is what suffers , feels , sees ; since matter can not suffer . " The method of Mrs. Eddy 's reasoning may be seen in the following extracts : " The ineradicable belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , when really the sensation is believed to be in the nerves , is an added proof of the unreliability of physical testimony . . . . Electricity is not a vital fluid , but an element of mortal mind ,  --  the thought-essence that forms the link between what is termed matter and mortal mind . Both are different strata of human belief . The grosser substratum is named mailer . The more ethereal is called human mind , which is the nearer counterfeit of the Immortal Mind , and hence the more accountable and sinful belief . . . . You say , Toil fatigues me . ' But what is this you or me ? Is it muscle or mind ? Which one is tired and so speaks ? Without mind , could the muscles be tired ? Do the muscles talk , or do you talk for them ? Matter is non-intelligent . Mortal mind does the talking , and that which affirms it to he tired first made it so . " Having adopted a theory , she does not shrink from its logical sequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigued ; and yet the body is just as material as the wheel . Setting aside what the human mind says of the body , it would never be weary any more than the inanimate wheel . Understanding this great fact rests you more than hours of repose . " Her most frequently repeated assertions are sucn as these : " God is supreme ; is mind ; is principle , not person ; includes all and is reflected by all that is real and eternal ; is Spirit , and Spirit is infinite ; is the only substance ; is the only life . Man was and is the idea of God ; therefore mind can never be in man . Divine Science shows that matter and mortal body are the illusions of human belief , which seem to appear and disappear to mortal sense alone . When this belief changes , as in dreams , the material body changes with it , going wherever we wish , and becoming whatsoever belief may decree . Human mortality proves that error has been engrafted into both the dreams and conclusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles , and all will disappear . " As these doctrines are unquestionably in substance such as have been held by certain // metaphysicians in past ages , Mrs. Eddy feels called upon to answer those who make that charge : " Those who formerly sneered at it as foolish and eccentric now declare Bishop Berkeley , David Hume , Ralph Waldo Emerson , certain German philosophers , or some unlearned mesmerist , to have been the real originators of Mind Healing . Emerson 's ethics are models of their kind ; but even that good man and genial philosopher partially lost his mental faculties before his death , showing that he did not understand the Science of Mind Healing , as elaborated in my Science and Health ' ; nor did he pretend to do so . " Sickness , then , is a dream of falsity , to be antagonized by the metaphysical healer , mentally , and audibly when it may be necessary . Mrs. Eddy 's theories are her religion , and her Science - so called - is based upon the religious principles which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Arens , for whom she entertains a strong sptritual antipathy , has published a volume called " Old Theology in its Application to the Healing of the Sick . " In the introduction he writes : " It will be unnecessary to ask the reader for charitable criticism when I say that I make no claims to being a ripe scholar , and that my knowledge of the English language is very imperfect . The truths set forth in this volume have been expressed as clearly as possible , considering the disadvantages under which I have labored , one of which is the poverty of words in the English language to express spiritual thoughts . It has been ' found necessary to employ close punctuation , and in some instances to disregard some rules of grammar and rhetoric , in order to give the requisite shade of thought . " The mental difficulty in understanding him arises from his incompetency as a writer . His reflection upon the poverty of the English language is another form of confessing his ignorance of it ; and his disregard of the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving shades of thought , but from his lack of knowledge of the language . Mrs. Eddy thus described him in 1883 : " When he entered the class of my husband , the late Asa G. Eddy , in 1879 , he had no knowledge whatever , and claimed none , as can be shown under his own signature , of Metaphysics or Christian Science . While teaching him my system of Mental Healing , his motives and aims and the general constitution of his mind ware found so remote from the requirements of Christian Science , that his teacher despaired of imparting to him a due understanding of the subject . Perhaps it was to meet this great want without remedying it , and cover his lack of learning , that he committed to memory many paragraphs from my works , and is in the habit of repeating them in his attempts to lecture . He , who now proclaims himself a professor in the solcmn department that he assumes as a jay in borrowed plumes , was the most ignorant and empty-minded scholar I ever remember of examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from Mrs. Eddy 's writings , and that it is as a whole in every respect inferior to them , is the sim pie statement of a fact . He has , however , acquired considerable reputation , and has a constituency . Before advancing the fundamental principles of his system , he attempts to show the inconsistencies of medical science in the following passage : " Materia medica teaches that mercury cures , also that mercury kills ; that ipecac causes vomiting , and that an overdose checks it , etc. ; these are contradictions in themselves . A rule that can be contradicted is not demonstrable , and therefore not truth . If one aud one made two only occasionally , and at other times made three or more , it would be no fact or rule , because not demonstrable , and no dependence could be placed upon it . If from a science ( truth ) it is found that mercury cures , it would be found that the more of that so-called necessary quality taken into the aystem , the better it would be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect rule or from truth . " 1-lere is an example of his style : " Suppose I should be walking past a house , and a pane of glass should fall from an upper window cutting me and causing my death ; the glass was made and placed by life , and life broke it and caused it to fall . My life brought me here from Prussia and carried me by the house at the time that happened ; therefore life was the cause of my death , and , strange as it may seem , is the cause of all action . " From this profound ( ? ) reasoning he con-cludes : " If life is the cause of all action it must be the cause of sickness . . . - Thought is the first product of life , and as the thought is so will the action be . Life can not act contrary to the thoughts which are become beliefs or opinions , that is , which have taken root or are become attached to it , urdess it acts unconsciously . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got judgment against him , so that he was compelled to destroy a large edition of one of his pamphlets . Dr. Arens has established a university in the city of Boston , incorporated a year or two ago , called the " University of the Science of Spirit . " It confers the following degrees : " F. D. , " Defender of the Faith , and " S. S. D. , " Doctor of the Science of Spirit . The charge for instruction in the general course is one hundred dollars . These courses are somewhat pretentious . The first treats the " Scientific Basis of Theology , " " the Difference between God and the Universe , " etc. , and , proceeding through twenty-one theological points , concludes by setting forth " the First Step in Immortality , " and " How to Destroy Sickness . " The second course discusses " Theos , Chaos , and Cosmos " ; gives a theory of the creation of the universe down to the creation of the " first material human body , " which it treats under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the first consciousness of existence ; the separation of male and female ; the origin of self-will and its results . " And finally , " the beginning of sickness and trouble . " Dr. Marston treats " God , Man , Matter , 420 // Disease , Sin and Death , Healing , Treatment , and Universal Truth . " In his book he states that " the mental healer does not care by what medical name the distress is known ; it may be nervousness , dyspepsia , asthma , fever ,  --  words all alike to him , since the effects they denote are simply reflections or registers of wrong thinking . " In illustrating this he says " A case may be cited to illustrate the meaning : A middle-aged man who has suffered many years with chronic rheumatism , until it is torture for hhTn to move , has also an excitable temper , a despotic will , and is so intolerant that he can not abide opposition , hut flies into a towering rage if be is crossed . He has had many physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improper secretion of uric acid ; and his nervousness and irritability are easily accounted for by the prolonged suffering he has endured . This case presents the same conditions to the mental healer , but his conclusions are different . To him the bodily trouble is a reflection or effect of lack of mental ease ; and the unamiable nature results from a dominant feeling that other people are enemies seeking to oppose the poor man s wishes and thwart his plans . in treating the case , the doctor addresses remedies to the disturbed secretions which are an effect , while the mental healer directs his to the primary cause , which is fear . " His cure is reduced to its simplest form as follows : " The senses say matter can suffer pain ; God says matter is insensible . The senses declare a man sick ; God says the real man knows nothing of disease . " Under the head of Sin and Death he says : " Scientific Christianity does not recognize the definition of theology , but holds that , strictly speaking , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A mental cure is the discovery made by a sick person that he is well . " W. F. Evans , a voluminous writer , formerly an evangelical minister , then a Swedenborgian , and now a mental healer , remarks : " The process is essentially a spiritual work ; it is held that there is a port of us that is never sick , and this part is mentally worked upon so as to control the sick person s consciousness , this destroys the sickness , for mind cures matter . A disciple of this school is sick - no , he is not sick , for that is something which he will not admit ; he has a belief that he is sick ; he then says mentally to the rebellious body , What are you ? You have no power over me ; you are merely the covering given to me for present purposes ; it is an error to sup pose that I am sick ; I recognize the great truth that 1 myself , my individuality , my personality , my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the image of God ; when I recognize the existence of that truth there is no room left for the existence of error ; two things can not occupy one and the same place ; error can not exist in the same place with truth , therefore error is not in existence ; hence I am not sick . ' " Mrs. Grimk* , the author of " Personified Unthinkables , " says : " Now , rheumatism or pneumonia , etc. , are verbal expressions for unthinkables , just as 2+2*5 is a verbal expression for a lie . By means of the picturing faculty , both of the individual and of those about him , the outward manifestation of the unthinkable will express itself upon the body just as surely as the magic-lantern will reflect the picture inserted between the light and the lenses when the proper conditions are met . The problem of Health , then , would be how to cultivate and keep clean and healthy pictures in the mind . Health would then be an essential part of the ego . 1ian would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Body , and Morals . And the absolutely necessary postulates of this Unity would be Infinite Mind , Freedom , and Eternal Life . " There are those who in their own opinion have reached a greater elevation than either the Christian Scientists or the Mind Curers , " and profess to heal by the transfer of psychic energy . " The chief practitioner in this sphere informed me that the relative rank of these sciences is , i . The lower grade  --  the mere physical system . 2 . What is called animal magnetism. 3 . The mind cure . 4 . The spirits ( when they are good spirits ) . * . Including all that is good in the others , he places in the suJernal . He claimed that there has been in all ages an order called the In*pirati , who practiced this method , and offered to make me a Knight of that order . This will suffice until it fails to attract patients , when , no doubt , a sixth order , that of the Eu*yrean , will be devised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical language , which , when translated , shows that they attach a much importance to learned terms as does any form of the material science that they denounce .

" Most of these terms appear to have had an ortental origin , and are as valuable in affecting the ordinary mind as chloride of sodium for salt , capsicum for pepper , and 1120 for water . They serve also to make it appear that the Science is difficult , and that large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain forms of expression which savor more strongly of cant than any phrases that have ever been used by religious sects . They use the word " belief " in speaking of a disease , or even of a defect of character . A lady , talking with a practitioner of this school of a mutual acquaintance , said she thought her selfish . " Yes , " replied the Christian Scientist , " I believe she has a strong belief in selfishness . " // To a patient who had every symptom of a torpid liver another healer of the school said , " It is unfortunate that you have such a belief in bile . " To which the astonished patient , new to the Science , replied that he thought any one would have the same belief who had the same kind of liver . PRACTICE . THE manner in which Christian Science antagonizes dreams of falsity is interesting , whether the theories be accepted or not . First . Both the patient and the metaphysical healer must be taught that " Anatomy , Physiology , Treatises on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the husbandmen of sickness and disease . It is proverbial that as long as you read medical works you will he sick . Clairvoyants and medical charlatans are the prolific sources of sickness . . . . They first help to form the image of illness in mortal minds , by telling patients that they have a disease ; and then they go to work to destroy that disease . They unweave their own webs hen there were fewer doctors , and less thought was given to sanitary subjects , there were better constitutions and less disease . " Second . Diet is a matter of no importance . " We are told that the simple food our forefathers ate assisted to make them healthy ; hut that is a mistake . Their diet would not cure dyspepsia at this period . With rules of health in the head , and the most digestible food in the stomach , there would still he dyspeptics . " Tkird . Exercise is of no importance . " Because the musclcs of the blacksmith 's arm are strongly developed , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less used must he fragile . If matter were the cause of action , and muscles , without the codperation of mortal mind , could lift the hammer and smite the nail , it might he thought true that hammering enlarges the muscles . But the trip-hammer is not increased in size by exercise . Why not , since muscles are as material as wood and iron ? " Four/k . A proper view of Mrs. Eddy 's publications is , however , of great importance . " My publications alone heal more sickness than an unconscientious student can begin to reach . If patients seem the worse for reading my book , this change may either arise from the frightened mind of the physician , or mark the crisis of the disease . Perseverance in its perusal would heal them completely . " Fzftk . " Never tell the sick they have more courage than strength . Tell them rather that their strength is in proportion to their courage . . . . Instruct the sick that they are not helpless victims ; but that , if they only know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as positively as they can a temptation to sin . " Six/k . In preparing to treat patients the healer must strengthen and steady his own mind . " Be firm in your understanding that Mind governs the body . Have no foolish fears that matter governs , and can ache , swell , and be inflamed from a law of its own ; when it is self-evident that matter can have no pain or inflammation . . . . If you believe in inflamed or weak nerves , you are liable to an attack from that source . You will call it neuralgia , but I call it Illusion . When treating the sick , first make your mental plea in behalf of harmony , . . . then realize the absence of disease . . . - Use such powerful eloquence as a Congressman would employ to defeat the passage of an inhuman law .. " Seven/k . You are fortunate if your patient knows little or nothing , for " a patient thoroughly booked in medical theories has less sense of the divine power , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aboriginal Indian who never bowed the knee to the Baal of civilization . " Eigk/k . See that the " minds which surround your patient do not act against your influence by continually expressing such opinions as may alarm or discourage . . . . You should seek to be alone with the sick while treating thens . " Nm/k . Bathing and rubbing are of no use . " Bathing and rubbing to alter the secretions , or remove unhealthy exhalations from the cuticle , receive a useful rebuke from Christian Healing . . . . John Quincy Adams presents an instance of firm health and an adherence to hygienic rules , but there arc few others . " Ten/k . What if the patient grow worse ? " Suppose the patient should appear to grow worse . This I term cltemicatization . It is the upheaval produced when Immortal Truth is destroying erroneous and mortal belief . Chemicalization brings sin and sickness to the surface , as in a fermenting fluid , allowing - impurities to pass away . Patients unfamiliar with the cause of this commotion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed . If such is the case , explain to them the law of this action . " Eleven/k . Subtle mental practices are recommended . " I will here state a phenomenon which I have observed . If you call mentally and silently the disease by name , as you argue against it , as a general rule the body will respond more quickly ; just as a person replies more readily when his name is spoken ; but this is because you are not perfectly attuned to Divine Science , and need the arguments of truth for reminders . To let Spirit bear witness without words is the more scientific way . " This is further modified : " You may call the disease by name when you address it mentally ; but by naming it audizly , you are liable to impress it upon the mind . The Silence of Science is eloquent and powerful to unclasp the hand of disease and reduce it to nothingness . " Twelf/k . Some of the things that are not to be done : " A Christian Scientist never gives medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to focus mind . ' He never places patient and practitioner hack to hack , ' never consults spirits , ' nor requires the life history of his patient . Above all , he can not trespass on the rights of Mind through animal magnetism . " The foregoing rules for practice are taken from Mrs. Eddy 's different works . The difference between the views of Mrs. Eddy and those who diverge from her is superficial , though neither she nor they will 422 // in Godhood , " referring to Mrs. Eddy 's large work , says : " It can be read with profit by any who are seeking truth with sincerity , and with no tendency to become biased . " She also says that she was formerly a member of the Christian Science Association , and " learned that limitations are not conducive to growth , and that , as Emerson truly says , ' God always disappoints monopolies , ' " and frankly gives her opinion of those denounced by her former preceptor . " Thc so-called mal-practitioners and mesmerists therein mentioned , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comnany with others who seek to be liberal-minded and to give Truth its due wherever it exists ,  --  I find to be simply those who have separated themselves from the Association , that they might pursue their own convictions of right , and step out of the regular ranks of stereotyped terms to let their thoughts find expression in their own words . " The chief point of departure in Mrs. Taylor 's theories from those of Mrs. Eddy is in the value attached to a knowledge of the preceding life of the patient . Physical disease has many different causes . The physician treating a patient is often narrowed in his efforts to do good , because of some hidden moral or mental cause , some underlying fear , some sorrow , some inherited proclivity , some wrong unforgiven , some trait of character , some past occurrence which has tinged , perhaps almost unconsciously , the whole tenor of a life . It is not necessary that a person s innermost sacred thoughts and life be unveiled , as the physician does not expect , neither does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are given voluntarily with a feeling of trust . Some word or hint , though , to the physician would often aid materially .... The treatment consists in a vigorous holding of the patient to his right of soul-growth , unobstructed and retarded by physical defects . . . . In answer to the question , Is it prayer ? ' I would first quote Victor Hugo 's definition of prayer ,  --  ' Every thought is a prayer ; there are moments when , whatever be the attitude of the body , the soul is on its knees , ' - and then answer , Yes , it is prayer . Prayer with the old interprehtion begs the Father to change the unchangeable , while prayer with the new interpretation lifts the beggar to a comprehension that he himself has omitted to take the gifts already prepared for him from the foundation of the world . " She gives this advice to the sick : " Eradicate all thoughts of physiology , drugs , laws of health , sickness , and pain , and know that God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seek the help of a Christian Healer . . . . Judge him not unjustly , . . . neither be in opposition , for his is a good motive . . . . While under his treatment obey any natural impulse , without fear of consequence . Remember ! without fear . This does not mean to i ) C foolhardy in the beginning ,  --  unless the cure should be almost instantaneous ,  --  but advance gradually . . . . If you have a time during the treatment when you should feel worse , do not he discouraged . . . . Look forward . One little secret it is well to know . . . . Deny every thought of sickness every time it enters your mind . Never use will-power , mistaking it for divine Truth .

MENTAL treatment is that which the metaphysical healer is supposed to be giving the patient when she sits silently before him for a period longer or shorter according to her judgment of the necessities of the case .

To this treatment I shall refer in elucidating the causes of the phenomena . Dr. Evans controverts some of Mrs. Eddy 's theories : " To modify a patient 's thinking in regard to himself and his disease , we employ the principle of suggestion or positive affirmation - not mental argument , as it is sometimes called , for argument creates doubt and reaction . No sick man was ever cured by reasoning with him , mentally or verbally . It is the husiness of the man who huows the truth , not to argue , but to affirm . No intelligent practitioner of the mind cure will ignore wholly all medical science . . . . The phrcnopathic system is not necessarily antagonistic to other methods of cure , as the various hygienic regulations , and even the use of the harmless specific remedies .

As an example of Christian Science superstition exceeding anything attempted by the most ignorant advocates of patent Faith Healing , read the following , taken verbatim , italics , small caps , etc. , from a text-book on Mind Cure , issued by the President of the " New York School of Primitive and Practical Christian Science , " who states that his school will be free from " eccentricity , pretension , and fanaticism " !

Heavenly , Holy Reality , we will try not to be such hypocrites and infidels , as every day of our lives to affirm our faith in Thee and then immediately begin to tell how sick we are , forgetting that Thou art everything and that Thou art not sick , and therefore that nothing in this universe was ever sick , is now sick , or can he sick . Forgive us our sins in that we have this day talked about our backaches , that we have told our neighbors that our food hurts us , that we mentioned to a visitor that there was a lump in our stomach , that we have wasted our valuable time which should have been spent in Thy service , in worrying for fear that our stomach would grow worse , in that we have disobeyed Thy blessed law in thinking that some kind of medicine would help us . We know , Father and Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing as a really diseased stomach , that the disease is the Carnal Mortal Mind given over to the World , the Flesh , and the Devil ; that the mortal mind is a twist , a distortion , a false attitude , the HARMATIA of Thought . Shining and Glorious Verity , we recognize the great and splendid FACT that the moment we really believe the Truth , Disease ceases to trouble us , that the Truth is that there is no Disease in either real Body or Mind ; that in the Mind what seems to be a disease is a False Belief , a Parasite , a hateful Excrescence , and that what happens in the Body is the shadow of the LIE in the Soul . Lord , help us to believe that ALL Evil is Utterly Unreal ; that it is silly to be sick , absurd to be ailing , wicked to be wailing , atheism and denial of God to say I am sick .

Amen . " - HAZZARD . It is claimed by all the Christian Science and Mind Cure practitioners that they can operate upon patients at a distance . " There is no space nor time to mind . A person in St. Louis may be near to me while I am in New York . A person in the same room may be very distant . Sit down and think about the person you wish to affect . Think long enough and strong enough and you are sure to reach him . " - HAZZARD . " The following is a case of heart disease which I cured without having seen the patient . Please find enclosed a check for five hundred dollars , in reward for your services that can never be repaid . The day you received my husbands letter I became conscious for the first time in forty-eight hours . My servant brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . . . . The enlargement of my left side is all gone , and the doctors pronounce me rid of heart disease . I had been afflicted with it from infancy . It became organic enlargement of the heart and dropsy of the chest . I was only waiting and almost longing to die , but you have healed me . How wonderful to think of it , when you and I have never seen each other . ' " - EDDY . One of them says : " Remember that every thought that you think will be transferred to the persons thought of if you think long enough and strong enough . " - HAzEARD . This of course surpasses the love powders that are sold among the colored people and the ignorant , as it is necessary to purchase and administer them , which is sometimes considerable trouble . The practical directions to attain this power are as follows : " How to concentrate . ' i . Look at an object on the ceiling ten minutes ; think of that object alone . 2 . Write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reality . ' Think it for ten minutes with your eyes fixed upon the paper . 3 .

' Forget yourself , forget the world , forget you have a body , forget you have any business or friends . Empty your mind of its contents . Be a man of one idea . Get out of yourself . " - HAZZARD . The rules for absent treatment are : " i . Seat yourself alone . Let the room be silent , 2 . Subjugate your senses to all else but your thought . 3 . Fix your thought upon the patient . 4 . Picture him in your mind . 5 . Go through the treatment . " - HAZZARD . " The patient may be in three different ways . He may be sympathetic ; that will help you greatly . He may be apathetic ; that is not so good , but better than the next . He anay be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but silently give it to him ' till he becomes less cantankerous ' and more Christlike. " - HAZZARD MIND CURERS versus FAITH HEALERS , MESMERISTS , ETC . MRS . EDDY speaks of Mesmerism in this way : " Mortal mind , acting from the basis of sensuous belief in matter , is animal magnetism . . . . In proportion as you understand Christian Science you lose animal magnetism . . . . Its basis being a belief and this belief an error , animal magnetism , or mesmerism , is a mere negation , possessing neither intelligence nor power . . . . An evil mind at work mesmerically is an engine of mischief little understood . . . . Animal magnetism , clairvoyance , mediumship , and mesmerism are antagonistic to this Science , and would prevent the demonstration thereof . . . . The Mesmeriser produces pain by making his subjects believe that he feels it ; here pain is proved to be a belief without any adequate cause . That social curse , the mesmerist , by making his victims believe they can not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so until their beiief or understanding masters his . " Of Spiritualism : " Spiritualism with its material accompaniments would destroy the supremacy of Spirit . " And of Clairvoyance specifically : " Clairvoyance investigates and influences mortal thought only . . . . Clairvoyance can do evil , can accuse wrongfully , and err in every direction . " Of Faith Cure : " It is asked , Why are faith cures sometimes more speedy than some of the cures wrought through Christian Scientists ? Because faith is belief , and not understanding ; and it is easier to believe than to understand Spiritual Truth . It demands less cross-bearing , self-renunciation , and Divine Science , to admit the claims of the personal senses , and appeal for relief to a humanized God , than to deny those claims and learn the divine way , drinking his cup , being baptized with his baptism , gaining the end through persecution and purity . Millions are believing in God , or Good , without sharing the fruits of goodness , not having reached its Science . Belief is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can not say with the Apostle , I know in whom I have believed . ' There is even danger in the mental state called belief , for if Truth is admitted but not understood , error may enter through this same channel of ignorance . The Faith cure has devout followers , whose Christian practice is far in advance of mere theory . " Marston , speaking of change in the inverted thought of the sick person , says : " Since a change of the inverted thought of the sick person is all that can be produced by extraneous influence , the treatment of a professional Healer is not the only means of securing it . While a majority of cases are affected in that way , there are well-attested instances to show that anything that will enable the sick person to change his thought may put him in a condition to receive spiritual healing . A text from Scripture or some other writings may be brought to his mind with such force as to do this , or some sudden event may startle him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can account for cures that seem to result from prayer , a resort to relics , charms , and other things believed to possess peculiar virtue . This is why good results follow any one of the thousand absurd acts , by the performance of which superstitious and credulous people seek to he restored to health . " Mrs. Kate Taylor remarks : " The question is often asked , In what does the Christian Science healing differ from the faith cure ? In the faith cure the patient must have faith ; in Christian Science that is not necessary ; patients have frequently been helped or entirely cured , without knowing they were being treated . . . . No great faith is necessary on the part of the patient ; but it will expedite his recovery if he take interest enough in the method by which he is being healed to read suitable books on the subject , and converse profitably with the healer . . . . Prayer to a personal God affects the sick like a drug that has no efficacy of its own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drug does nothing because it has no intelligence . " TESTS OF THE THEORY . First Test . If their principles be true , food should not be necessary . Mrs. Eddy affirms this : VOL . XXXIV. - 59 . " Gustatory pleasure is a sensuous illusion , an illusion that diminishes as we understand our spiritual being and ascend the ladder of Life . This woman learned that food neither strengthens nor weakens the body ,  --  that mind alone does this . . . . Teach them that their bodies are nourished more by Truth than by food . " Then , finding herself unable to silence the testimony of the senses , she endeavors to circumvent it thus : " Admitting the common hypothesis , that food is requisite to sustain human life , there follows the necessity for another admission , in the opposite direction ,  - -  namely , that food has power to destroy life , through its deficiency or excess , in quality or quantity . This is a specimen of the ambiguous character of all material health-theories . They are self-contradictory and self-destructive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desolation . ' If food preserves life , it can not destroy it . The truth is , food does not affect the life of man ; and this becomes self-evident when we learn that God is our only life . Because sin and sickness are not qualities of Soul or Life , we have hope in immortality ; but it would be foolish to venture beyond our present understanding , foolish to stop eating , until we gain more goodness and a clearer comprehension of the living God . In that perfect day of understanding , we shall neither eat to live , nor live to eat . " When they dispense with food because mortal mind is under the influence of an illusion concerning it ,  --  absurdly supposing " that food supports life , " - and continue to live with the accidents of the human body sustained entirely by the divine substance of which they speak , they will furnish a demonstration which will utterly destroy every remaining illusion of mortal mind . But so long as they eat , they are either voluntarily perpetuating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions . If they are in such a low stage as to be compelled to eat when it would not be necessary if they were in a higher plane , they may , for the same reason , be compelled to use drugs . Second Test . They deny that drugs , per se , as taken into the human system , have any power . " Christian Science divests material drugs of their imaginary power . . . . The uselessness of drugs , the emptiness of knowledge , the nothingness of matter and its imaginary laws , are apparent as we rise from the rubbish of belief to the acquisition and demonstration of spiritual understanding . . . . When the sick recover by the use of drugs , it is the law of a general belief culminating in individual faith that heals , and according to this faith will the effect be . " - Enny . Surely the mind needs healing that could invent the following absurdity : " The not uncommon notion that drugs possess absolute , inherent curative virtues of their own involves an error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects ascribed to them except by imputed virtue . Men think they will act thus on the physical system , consequently they do . The property of alcohol is to intoxicate ; but if the common thought had endowed it simply with a nourishing quality like milk , it would 425 // produce a similar effect . A curious question arises about the origin of healing virtues , if it be admitted that all drugs were originally destitute of them . We can conceive of a time in the mental history of the race when no therapeutic value was assigned to certain drugs , when , in fact , it was not known that they possessed any . How did it come to pass that common thought , or any thought , endowed them with healing virtue , in the first place ? Simply in this way : Man finding himself unprotected , and liable to he hurt by the elements in the midst of which he lived , forgot the true source of healing , and began to seek earnestly for material remedies for disease and wounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial there was associated the hope that the means applied would prove efficacious . Then what was at first an earnest hope came at length to be a belief ; and thus , by gradual steps , a belief in the contents of the entire pharmacopceia was established . " - MARsToN . It is true that in many cases the effect of a medicine is to be attributed entirely to the imagination , or to the belief that it will have such and such effects ; but the statement of such extreme positions as these shows the irrationality of the theories upon which they are based . According to the above , if it were generally believed that alcohol were unintoxicating and nourishing and bland , as milk , it would be an excellent article with which to nourish infants ; and , on the other hand , if it were generally believed that milk were intoxicating , all the influences of alcohol would beproduced upon those who drank it . If the public could only be educated to believe alcohol to be nourishing , the entire mammalian genus might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No insane asylum can furnish a more transparent delusion . That drugs produce effects upon animals has been demonstrated beyond the possibility of contradiction , and that , too , when the animals did not know that they were taking drugs ; and small doses have produced not the slightest effect , while large doses - the animals in each case not knowing that they were taking medicines - have produced great effect , and do so with uniformity . Also the effect of medicines upon idiots and unconscious infants is capable of exact demonstration . Allied to the effect of drugs is that of poisons , almost every drug having the effect of a poison if taken in excess . Some poisons , however , are of such a character that the smallest possible dose may be attended with fatal results . In the case of animals , poisons introduced into the system without the knowledge of the animals do their work effectually . Strychnine carefully introduced into a piece of meat so small that a cat will swallow it whole , will in a very short time show its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection if there be the slightest possibility of perceiving it ; but if sufficient means be taken to keep the animal from knowing that it is taking anything except meat , it will swallow the meat , and the poison will do its work . These facts are admitted by the advocates of Christian Science and Mind Cure , and the absolute lunacy of their theories is seen in the manner in which they attempt to account for the effects . " If a dose of poison is swallowed through mistake , the patient dies , while physician and patient are expecting favorable results . Did belief cause this death ? Even so , and as directly as if the poison had been intentionally taken . . . . The few who think a drugharmless , where a mistake has been made in the prescription , are unequal to the many who have named it poison , and so the majority opinion governs the result . " - Ennv . " It is said that arsenic kills ; but it would be very difficult for any one to prove how it kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoning without having taken any arsenic ; and again , persons have taken arsenic and did not die . . . . Suppose you take a child that knows nothing about arsenic , and administer the usual dose , the child will probably die , but I will show you that the arsenic was not the cause of the death . . . . Here you may say , What had the life of the child to do with the action , the child not knowing anything about arsenic ? ' We will admit that the child was ignorant of the nature of the poison , but all who are educated in physiology and materia medica know that it kills , therefore the thought , although unconscious to the child , was hereditary in its life . It is , indeed , a universal thought admitted as a fact in every life or soul . A thought is a product of life and is action , and this thought , produced and accepted by life , acts upon the life of the child and produces unconsciously a confusion therein . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life heats the blood and causes the first conscious action . " - AaENs . " The effects of various experiments , with chemicals and medicine , upon cats and dogs , are studied most minutely by distinguished scientific men , and the results witnessed published to the world with a presumption of wisdom and profundity of learning that carry the conviction to most minds that the properties of such drugs , and their effects upon the hu ; nan system , have been forever established . And Materia Medica falls back upon these so-called demonstrations of Science as absolutely indisputable proofs of its Theories . Now it never seems to have occurred to them that all the effects witnessed of such experimenting might be accounted for *n the basis of Thought , and with the view of investigating the subject to establish a totally opposite explanation ; and to show that Mind acting on Matter could account for all their facts , the following experiments have been recently made : The object of the experiments was a dog , a noble thoroughbred , of great sagacity and intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Not a word was spohen , but his mistress would say to him mentally ,  --  Carlo , come here , ' or Carlo , lie down , ' and although the thought might have to be repeated mentally a number of times , yet it would reach him , and sometimes he would respond almost immediately . Second experiment : One day his master discovered an appearance to which he gave the name Mange . All the dogs around were having it . It was catching ,  --  Dr. So-and-So had pronounced it mange , and prescribed a mixture of Sulphur and Castor Oil , etc. , which was to be applied externally in such a way that Carlo , in attempting to remove the preparation with his tongue , would get a dose into his system . But here the mistress interposed , and insisted that Carlo should be subjected wholly to mental treatment . The result was entirely satisfactory . The appearance vanished as it came . Again the experiment of placing Carlo entirely under the intelligence of his master 's // mind and thoughts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of leaving him wholly under his mistress 's mind . In the former case he soon exhibited every symptom of dyspepsia and indigestion in every form to which the master was subject , and in a very marked degree . But under the thought of the mistress , every symptom and appearance vanished at once . He soon attained a perfection of physical condition which constantly attracted the notice of every one . Experiments of this kind were carried much further , and can be by any one who wishes to test the matter for themselves . In all the instances just mentioned , the physical condition of the dog responded to the mind under whose influence it chanced to be . Love and Fear ( especiallyfear ) are the most marked characteristics of the animal mind . The instances are innumerable where the instinct of the animal surpasses the reason of man in detecting the kindly thought , or the thought of karm , toward itself . When a scientific experimenter gives a drug to a dog , it is done with a perfect certainty in his mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some form or another , are sure to follow . A fear corresponding to the thought of the man instantly seizes upon the dog , and various results do follow . The experimenter notes them down and then proceeds to try his drug on dog number 2 , all the while holding in his mind an image of the results of experiment number i , expecting to see similar results . In all probability he sees them . " STUART . * Third Test . Extraordinary accidents to the body . Whatever may be said of the power of thought in the production of ordinary disease , the effects of accidents to persons who are entirely unconscious when they occur , as the sleeping victims of railroad disasters , are facts which , if they do not terminate human life at once , require the aid of surgery . Mrs. Eddy says : " The fear of dissevered bodily members , or a belief in such a possibility , is reflected on the body , in the shape of headache , fractured bones , dislocated joints , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush rising to the cheek . This human error about physical wounds and colics is part and parcel of the delusion that matter can feel and see , having sensation and substance . " It is confessed , however , that very little progress has been made in this department : " Christian Science is always the most skillful surgeon , but surgery is the branch of its healing that will be last demonstrated . However , it is but just to say that I have already in my possession well-authenticated records of the cure , by mental surgery alone , of dislocated hip-joints and spinal vertehrte . " But records , to be well authenticated , require more than an assertion . And the records may be authentic , and what they contain may never have been thoroughly tested . As they affirm that " bones have only the substance of thought , they are only an appearance to mortal mind " ; and if their theories be true at all , they should be able to rectify every result of accident to * Mrs. Stuart in the foregoing passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The preference of mortal mind for any method creates a demand for it , and the body seems to require it . von can even educate a healthy horse so far in physiology that he will take cold without his blanket ; whereas the wild animal , left to his instincts , sniffs the wind with delight . " The connection of this the body as readily and speedily as diseases originating within the system . Fourth Test . Insanity . It is a well-established fact that blows upon the head produce insanity . It is equally well established that surgery in many cases is able to remove the difficulty by an obviously physical readjustment , where the surgeon himself can not be positive what the effect will be until after the experiment , and the victim has no knowledge whatever upon the subject . During the late war , a negro was wounded in the head by the explosion of a shell . He wandered about for several years , to all appearance a driveling idiot , when certain surgeons took an interest in his case , and concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been driven in and pressed upon the brain , might restore his reason . Knowing that no damage could be done to his mind by the operation , they performed it , and were almost appalled when , after the lapse of so many years , as they lifted the piece of skull and removed the pressure upon the brain , the light of intelligence returned to the eye of the man , who said , " We were at Manassas yesterday ; where are we to-day ? " A similar case , where there had been delirium alternating with coma for a week , occurred in March last . The transient effect of stimulants upon persons who have been in a state of dementia apparently for a long tinle , is also well known . Mrs. Eddy upon this subject directs practitioners to tell the moderately sick man , " that he suffers only as the insane suffer , from a mere belief . The only difference is that insanity implies belief in a diseased brain , while physical ailments ( so called ) arise from belief that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire mortal body is evolved from mortal mind . A bunion would produce insanity as perceptible as that produced by congestion of the brain , were it not that mortal mind calls the bunion an unconscious portion of the body . Reverse this belief , and the results would be different . " It may be readily admitted that if a man believed his mind was in his foot , and believed it was out of order , he might be crazy . But in selecting the bunion for an illustration , Mrs. Eddy was not so wide of the mark as she might have been . Nearly twenty years ago , while listening to the lectures of Dr. C. E. Brown-S6quard , before the physicians of Brooklyn , I heard him give the following case : A youth ( fourteen years old ) went to bed perfectly sane , nor had he ever had a symptom of insanity . The next morning when he arose and stepped upon the floor he became a maniac . With great difficulty he was replaced quotation with what goes before shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Eddy , because , having been accustomed . to the blanket , his system is so weakened that he will take cold without it ; but because the training of the said horse has been such that he is led to believe that if the blanket is not on he will take cold ! // upon the bed , and the moment he touched it he was sane . During the morning he made several attempts to rise , always with the same result . A physician was called , who in his account of the case says : " When sitting up in his bed he drew on his stockings ; but on putting his feet on the floor and standing up , his countenance instantly changed , the /aw became violently convulsed ; " etc . He was pushed back on the bed , was at once calm , looked surprised , and asked what was the matter . Inquiry showed that he had been fishing the preceding day , but had met with no accident . His legs were examined minutely , but nothing unusual was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up the right great toe with my finger and thumb to examine the sole of that foot , the leg was drawn up and the muscles of the laws were suddenly convulsed , and on releasing the toe these effects instantly ceased . " After further experiment , an irritated point , so small as to be scarcely visible , was taken away by the cutting of a piece of skin , and " the strange sensation was gone and never returned . " * Post-mortem examinations which exhibit the degeneration of the brain structure are of no importance in the eyes of these professors of dreams . Ffth Test . The perpetuation of youth and the abolition of death should also be within the range of these magicians . Baldwin , of Chicago , says : " Man should grow younger as he grows older ; the principle is simple . As we think so are we'is stereotyped . Thoughts and ideas are ever striving for external expression . By keeping the mind young we have a perfect guarantee for continued youthfulness of body . Thought will externalize itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reliance on drugs makes the mind , consequently the body , prematurely old . This new system will make us younger at seventy . than at seventeen , for then we will have more of genuine philosophy . " Mrs. Eddy meets this matter in the style of Jules Verne : " The error of thinking that we are growing old , and the benefits of destroying that illusion , are illustrated in a sketch from the history of an English lady , published in the London ' Lancet . ' Disappointed in love in early years , she became insane . She lost all calculation of time . Believing that she still lived in the same hour that parted her from her lover , she took no note of years , but daily stood before the window , watching for his coming . In this mental state she remained young . Having no appearance of age , she literally grew no older . Some American travelers saw her when she was seventy-four , and supposed her a young lady . Not a wrinkle or gray hair appeared , hut youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( No. 44 ) in " Lectures on the Physiology and Pathology of the Central Nervous System , " by Brown-S*quard ; published , i86o , in Philadelphia . Also in Holmes 's " Annals of Surgery , " vol. 3 , p. 330 . A similar account can be found on insanity produced and brow . Asked to judge her age , and being unacquainted with her history , each visitor conjectured that she must be under twenty . " That the above should be adduced as proof of anything would be wonderful if the person adducing it had not previously adopted a theory which supersedes the necessity of all demonstration . It is important to notice that if the belief had anything to do with it , this amazing result grew from the belief in a falsehood . She did not live in the same hour that parted her from her lover ; she believed that she did , and , according to Mrs. Eddy , this belief of a falsehood counteracted all the ordinary consequences of the flight of time . But the delusion among the insane that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of this world , is very common ; and the most painfully paradoxical sights that I have ever witnessed have been men and women , toothless , denuded of hair , and with all the signs of age ,  --  " sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything , " - some of them declaring that they were young girls and engaged to be married to presidents and kings and even to divine beings . These delusions in some instances have been fixed for many years . Having had an official connection with an insane asylum for two years , I had more opportunities than were desired for conversing with persons of this class . In the case adduced by Mrs. Eddy , granting it to be true , and admitting that the state of the mind may have had some effect , it is of no scientific importance ; for the number who show no signs of age until fifty , sixty , or even seventy years have passed , is by no means small in the aggregate ; we meet them everywhere . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician , solemnly warned a gentleman that if he continued to sleep only four hours out of twenty-four , he would die before he was fifty years of age . " What do you suppose my age to be now ? " said the gentleman . " Thirty , " said the physician . " I am sixty-nine , " was the reply , which proved to be the fact . Mrs. Eddy , not content with this case , continues : " I have seen age regain two of the elements it had lost , sight and teeth . A lady of eighty-five whom I knew had a return of sight . Another lady at ninety had new teeth ,  - -  incisors , cuspids , bicuspids , and one molar . " Such instances as these are not uncommon , but are generally a great surprise to the persons four years after a boy trod on a piece of glass , which was entirely relieved by removing from a point near the ball of the big toe a trifling piece of glass . What is called the nervous temperament or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any delusion as to the flight of time . They are simply freaks of nature . There is a flattening of the eye which comes on with advancing years , and necessitates the use of glasses . Many persons who have few signs of age , retain the color of the cheek , have lost no teeth , and whose natural force is not abated , find that their eyes are dim . Accordingtothese metaphysical healers this is not necessary , but I have observed that a number of them say nothing about being themselves compelled to use glasses . Much is made of one case of a metaphysical healer , who , after using glasses fifteen years , threw them away , and can now read even in the railroad cars without them . Such cases of second sight have occurred at intervals always , and under all systems , and sometimes when the progress of old age had been so great that the persons had suffered many infirmities , and had but a few months left in which to " see as well as ever they did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the use of pigments , dyes , or paints , and notwithstanding the irregular hours and other accidents of their professional life , have maintained an astonishing youthfulness of appearance down to nearly three-score years and ten . John Wesley at seventy-five , according to testimony indubitable and from a variety of sources , not only presented the appearance of a man not yet past the prime of life , but , what is more remarkable , had the undiminished energy , vivacity , melody and strength of voice which accompany youth . Nor at eighty-five had he exhibited much change . In the city of Chicago there resides a professional man nearly seventy years of age , whose teeth , complexion , color , hair , voice , and mind show no signs of his being over forty-five years of age . Henry Ward Beecher , the January before his death , could write to his oldest brother that he had no rheumatism , neuralgia , sleeplessness , or deafness , was not bald , and did not need spectacles . Meanwhile it is impossible not to suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated . That some Americans who saw her at the age of seventy-four supposed her to be under twenty , is to be taken " curn grano salis . " As for death , if the theories of these romantic philosophers be true , it should give way ; if not in every case , at least in some . It is said that there are hundreds of persons in Boston who believe that Mrs. Eddy will never die . Joanna Southcott , who arose in England in 1792 , made many disciples , by some estimated at one hundred thousand , who believed that she would never die ; but unfortunately for their credulity she succumbed to the inevitable decree . Sixth Test . It might be easily shown , also , that if these theories are true , clothes , so far as sustaining warmth and life are concerned , are superfluous , and that fire itself is unnecessary . cONcLUsION . IN endeavoring to ascertain the causes of the recoveries which undoubtedly occur when the patient is under the supervision of Christian Scientists and Mind Curers , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddy as to her experiments with homeopathy . She says that she has attenuated common table salt until there was not a single saline property left ; and yet with one drop of that in a goblet of water , and a teaspoonful administered every three hours , she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever . Describing a case of dropsy given up by the faculty , she says that after giving some medicines of high attenuation , she gave the patient unmedicated pellets for a while , and found that she continued to improve . Finally she induced the patient to give up her medicine for one day , and risk the effects . After trying this , she informed Mrs. Eddy that she could get along two days without the globules ; but on the third day had to take them . She went on in this way , taking unmedicated pellets , with occasional visits from Mrs. Eddy , and employing no other means was cured . Thus Mrs. Eddy says she discovered that mind was potent over matter and that drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the above that homeopathic remedies , which have been modified by the discoveries made and the experience attained since the time of Hahnemann , are generally powerless . That question is not essential to this inquiry . But the confession of Mrs. Eddy that her experiments were the means of teaching her that mind and not matter effects the cure , will be regarded by all who do not accept her theories as containing the principal key to the problem . She made the common error of generalizing from a few particulars , and ever since has endeavored to test facts by theory instead of making facts the test . Because she found a supposed mental cause adequate to a cure in a few cases , she leaped to the wild conclusion that all causes are mental . Yet it would be an error to lose sight of the specific elements in the practice of Christian Science and the various forms of Mind Cure as a profession . The patients who are treated by these practitioners have , to begin with , the vis medicatrix na/urce , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be such by the // leaders of the medical profession for a long period of time . Sir John Forbes , M. D. , one of the most eminent regular physicians of England , says of the regular practice in his famous article on homeopathy : " First , that in a large proportion of the cases treated by allopathic physicians , the disease is cured by nature , and not by them . Second , that in a lesser but still not a small proportion* the disease is cured by nature in spite of them ; in other words , their interference retarding instead of assisting the cure . Third , that in , consequently , a considerable proportion of diseases it would fare as well or better with patients if all remedies - at least all active remedies , especially drugs - were abandoned . Even so long ago as Sydenham 's time , he said , " I often think more could be left to Nature than we are in the habit of leaving to her ; to imagine that she always wants the help of art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Marshall , F. R. S. , in opening the session of the London University Medical School in 1865 , said , " The vis medicairix naturcv is the agent to employ in the healing of an ulcer , or the union of a broken hone ; and it is equally true that the physician or surgeon never cured a disease ; be only assists the natural processes of cure performed by the intrinsic conservative energy of the frame , and this is but the extension of the force imparted at the origination of the individual being . " Under the Mind Cure this force of nature is still at work , and in the great number of self-limited diseases which tend to recovery , it is left free from all error of practitioners . If it loses any advantages which the introduction of the proper drugs might give , it is saved from the consequences of the administration of the wrong ones . The number of instances in which the prescriptions interfere with nature is so great that Dr. Paris wrote , many years ago , " The file of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients of the prescription were fighting together in the dark . " This is especially true of the diseases of children . The late Dr. Marshall Hall said , " Of the whole number of fatal cases of diseases in infancy , a great proportion occur from the inappropriate or undue application of exhausting remedies . " Further , those who are treated by the Mind Curers in many cases derive benefit from the freedom of diet , air , and exercise allowed . They are told to pay no attention to symptoms , think nothing whatever about their diseases , and not talk about them ; to eat , sleep , drink , and act as nearly as possible as if they were well ; and in a large majority of chronic diseases , this is all that is needed to produce a return to health . They have also the benefits of faith and imagination ; as they are taught to imagine healthy , vigorous organs , and their whole bodies in the condition of health , and with such mental pictures to drive away all consciousness of symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all influences , a calm and fearless mind . The presence of the practitioner and her methods greatly contribute to this calming influence . " She enters with a cheerful air and , without taking your hand or approaching your bed , seats herself and asks you to tell her all your symptoms . She may , however , belong to the class which will not allow any description of symptoms . She receives your budget of ailments calmly , without one expression of sympathy , for she has none , considering all your maladies as an illusion or dream from which it is her divine mission to awaken you . You are made to feel , immediately , that there is little of consequence in all that you have been telling her . She then relapses into a silence of ten or fifteen minutes , in which her kind face wears a resolute expression , makingit almost stern . . . . After this silent treatment she speaks to you in the most encouraging manner , endeavoring to call you axvay from yourself to the contemplation of spiritual truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind Curers is worthy of observation . The Faith Healers require the patient to have faith ; the Mind Curers make a boast of the fact that faith is not necessary . A close analysis , however , shows that this boast isvain . Before they are sentforthere is usually some faith , and often nauch. combined with a distrust of other systenis . This was , as some of their authorities affirm , the case when they began . Sufficient time has elapsed to develop a constituency who employ no other methods . If there were no faith , there must be a distrust of other forms of practice , or there would be no reason for turning to the new . Where there is no faith on the part of the patient , usually his friends believe , and have induced him to make the experiment . Thus he is surrounded by an atmosphere of faith which is so important that all tlle writers attach great weight to it . " Friends and attendants who are believers in Mental cure , and know what sort of a menial atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the metaphysician in his work . But , unfortunately , this is seldom the case ; and the friends are usually ignorant on the subject , and innocently burdening the invalid with just that kind of hurtful sympathy which keeps him under a cloud of depression . When such is the case , their absence is more helpful than their presence , and it is desirable to be alone with the patient while treating him . " - MAasToN . Some go even so far as to say that they should be , if possible , removed from the society of those who do not believe . But a favorable atmosphere exists to some extent among those who have induced an unbelieving invalid to send for a mental healer . Assuming that the healer has arrived , it is easy to see how faith is engendered . She takes her seat , and after a few unimportant questions becomes silent . The thoughts that wander " CHRISTIAN SCIENCE " AND " MIND CURE . " // a patient of thorough intelligence , an alumnus of one of the first universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can there be anything in this ? I do n't believe there is , and yet a great many people are believing in it , and some most wonderful cures have taken place . There is Mrs. . I k ; ww that she was given up to die by our best physicians , and I knozu that she is well . " Then the eye will wanderto the face of the metaphysician , who seems looking at far-off things and wrestling with some problem not yet solved , but of the certainty of the solution of which she has no doubt . Sometimes the practitioners cover their eyes , and this in many temperaments would add to the effect . The fifteen minutes pass and leave the unbeliever passive , as a quotation in a former part of the article describes it , " less cantankerous . " The encouraging words of the healer on departing are not without effect , differing as they do from the uncertain or the preternaturally solemn forthgivings , or the ill-concealed misgivings , of many ordinary physicians . There are no medicines to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recovery to be dwelt upon . Whatever the appetite calls for is to be eaten without anxiety as to the consequences , and if there be no appetite there is to be no eating and no anxiety as to the result of abstinence . The effect of the treatment havingbeen pleasant , the patient rather longs than otherwise for the next day to come , and the next . If the disease be one that under ordinary circumstances would require an operation , the dreadful image of the surgeon 's knife no longer appalls the patient 's mind . The invalid discovers that he does not die , that he sleeps a little better ; certainly he is not aroused to take medicine , and there is no fear that he will take cold ; he feels decidedly better at the next visit , and now faith is not only born , but turned into sight . His friends assure him that he is better , and he tells them that he is so . Perhaps the most potent cause in awakening faith is the sublime audacity displayed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene , prayer , and religious ceremony . That spectacle would infallibly produce either such opposition and contempt as would result in the termination of the experiment , or faith . It is impossible to be in a negative position in its presence , where the responsibilities of life and death are assumed . As for " absent treatments , " these are based on the theory that to think of another entirely and abstractedly occasions a spiritual presence of that other . " Distance is annihilated , and his living image and inner personality seem to 43 ' stand before us , and what we say to it we say to him . " These persons catch up and incorporate with their theories the as yet immature investigations of the Society for Psychical Research , in which it is claimed that a sensitive subject can form in the mind a distinct mental picture or idea of words and letters which had been in the mind of an agent . Healers endeavor to extend those phenomena so as to make them annihilate space ; and , according to them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of Africa by a mental influence , as in the same room . " Here they affiliate with the whole mass of superstitions which accumulated in the early history of the human race , and reappear in certain temperaments in each generation . Whether such a thing as thought-transference exists , there is not space here to inquire ; nor is it necessary , for the effects of the " absent treatment , " so called , can all be accounted for without any such assumption . The patients thus treated know or they do not know that they are being treated . When they know , there is nothing to explain , for it is the same as if the patient and practitioner were in each other 's presence . All the , mental operations , as well as the original force of nature , proceed under the conviction that they are being treated by a mental healer . If they do not know , the entire field of coincidence and the vis medicatrix na/urw remain inviolate ; and to determine that there is any connection between the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would require a vast number of cases and detailed coincidence of time and symptom , for which these practitioners do not display ability , and for which , on their own testimony , they have had no opportunity . Indeed , their theories are such as to make all investigation superfluous and tedious . The case upon which Mrs. Eddy appears to rely is described thus : " The day you received my husband 's letter I became conscious for the first time in forty-eight hours . " What can this prove ? What evidence is there that she would not have become conscious if the letter had never been written ? If she were ever to come out of an unconscious state and recover , it must be at some time . The coincidence of Mrs. Eddy 's receiving a letter from the husband does not show any connection between the two facts , for such letters have been sent and the patients have died . To my personal knowledge her treatments have failed , and her predictions have not been fulfilled , the patient dying in excruciating agony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time , of the attempted absent treatment of persons who never existed , are numerous ; for " CHRISTIAN SCiENCE " AND " MIND CURE . " // there is not one of this class of healers that can not be so imposed upon . This is sufficient to raise a powerful presumption that the spiritual presence which they evoke , and to which they speak , is " such stuff as dreams are made of . " It is not to be denied that they make many cures , more than any bungler or extremist of any school using drugs would expect . But their failures are numerous , and , like the faith healers , they never publish Ikese . Compelled , however , to admit this , the chancellor of the University of the Science of Spirit says : " Our inability to heal instantaneously as they ( Jesus and the Apostles ) are recorded to have done , is attributable to our deficiency in the realization of the doctrine . While we claim that our theory of healing is applicable to all diseases , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time to heal all diseases instantaneously , neither would we now guarantee to cure certain diseases , such as cancer or consumption in the last stages . Of one thing , however , we are confident , i. e. , that we can do more good in all cases of illness than can be done with any other theory , or with materia medica. " - ARENs . They are rather more successful than the faith healers for this reason : with the faith healers it is generally either an instantaneous cui'e , or none at all . And an instantaneous cure can not be made to apply to a great many cases , and what is supposed to be such is very frequently a delusion followed by a complete relapse . The Christian Scientists , however , and their congeners make many visits and give nature a much better opportunity without the destruction of the patient 's faith in them by a failure at a critical juncture ; thus it happens that the proportion of recoveries is more numerous . The principal practical element has been more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the whole history of medical practice , as well as by quacks and superstitious pagan priests . " The History of Medical Economy during the Middle Ages , " by George F. Fort , contains numerous illustrations of this subject , though adduced for another purpose , and , unlike many other treatises , giving the authorities with the most painstaking accuracy . Dr. Rush , of whom Dr. Tuke says that few physicians have had more practical experience of disease , says : " I have frequently prescribed remedies of doubtful efficacy in the critical stage of acute diseases , but never till I had worked up my patients into a confidence bordering upon certainty of their probable good effects . The success of this measure has much oftener answered than disappointed my expectations . " The " British and Foreign Medical Review " for January , 1846 , whose editor was Sir John Forbes , contained an article written by himself which encourages " the administration of simple , feeble , and altogether powerless , nonperturbing medicines , in all cases in which drugs are prescribed pro forma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not with the view of producing any direct remedial effect . " " Physic and Physicians , " published in 1839 , speaking of the celebrated and extraordinarily successful Dr. Radcliffe , who died in 1714 , and was the founder of the Radcliffe Library at Oxford University , says that he paid particular attention to the mind of the patient under his care , and had been heard to say that he attributed much of his success and eminence to this circumstance . There is a very good anecdote illustrating his views upon this subject : " A lady of rank consulted Radcliffe in great distress about her daughter , and the doctor began the investigation of the case by asking , Why , what ails her ? Alas doctor , ' replied the mother , I can not tell ; but she has lost her humor , her looks , her stomach ; her strength consumes every day , and we are apprehensive that she can not live . ' Why do you not marry her ? said Radcliffe . Alas ! doctor , that we would fain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever she could expect . ' Is there no other that you think she would be content to marry ? Ah , doctor , that is that troubles us ; for there is a young gentleman we doubt she loves , that her father and I can never consent to . ' Why , look you , madam , ' replied Radcliffe gravely , then the case is this : your daughter would marry one man , and you would have her marry another . In all my books I find no remedy for such a disease as this . ' " This principle has also been employed by certain priests and clergymen of every sect . A young woman , a teacher , was , as she believed and as her friends supposed , at the point of death . Her physician was not quite certain that she was as ill as she seemed , and requested the pastor to assist him in breaking up her delusion that she must die . He attempted it , but she refused to hear him , and loaded him with messages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday School . As he was about to bid her farewell , he said that he would return in the afternoon ; she said that she would like him to pray with her , but that it was useless to pray for her recovery . Having in view her hearing what he had to say , he prayed in such a way as to break the spell and make her believe that she would recover ; as he did this , the morbid symptoms of approaching death gave way , and she is still living . Another case was still more remarkable . A woman , ill and bedridden , conceived a high regard for the piety and intelligence of her pastor . He entered her room and in a loud and solemn voice said , " I command you to arise ! " Involuntarily she arose and resumed the duties of housekeeping , which after the lapse of ten years she still performs . A Roman Catholic priest , of high position // in his church , told the writer that he thought he had saved scores of lives by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the patients to say " Father does not think I am going to die . " In 1832 , when the cholera raged in Norfolk , Virginia , Dr. Buzzell , a physician of great local celebrity , lived there . He was driving night and day , and on one occasion was summoned to see a stalwart negro who wa sapparently in the state of collapse . Instead of beginning at once to medicate him , he accused him of shamming , denounced and derided him in every possible way for calling him when he was at work night and day , driven almost to death . Then , putting on the appearance of intense excitement , he procured a switch and began to thrash the negro very severely . The more he groaned , and the more he said he was dying , the more Dr. Buzzell thrashed him , and with his threatenings and beatings brought on such a tremendous reaction that the man recovered . In a visit to a branch of the Oneida Community at Wallingford , in i8*6 , I asked Mrs. Miller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , what they did if any of the snmates became ill , as they repudiated medicines . She said they had very little sickness . " But , have I not heard of an epidemic of diphtheria among you ? " She said there had been , but by their treatment they saved every case . " What was that treatment ? " " It was treatment by criticism . " " How was it applied ? " " So soon as a person was taken ill , a committee was appointed who went into the room and sat down , paying no attention to the patient ; they began at once to speak about him or her , criticising the patient 's peculiarities , bringing every defect to the surface , and unsparingly condemning it . " Mrs. Miller added that no one could endure this more than an hour . The mental and moral irritation was so great that they began to perspire and invariably recovered . The universal efficacy of this method may well be doubted , for many persons live in such an atmosphere that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die ; while others are so callous to all criticism that the remedy would be without effect . The nervous " temperament " or condition of the healer appears to be of no special importance ; that is , it is of importance only in the same sense that it is to salesmen , pub " In practice it seems to he more difficult to successfully treat one 's self than to treat another person . The reason for this is that , when personally under the influence of supposed disease , the appeal of the senses is more forcible than when the deception shows itself in another . But that one can conquer the results of his own inverted thinking , there is not the slightest VOL . XXXIV. - 6o. lic speakers , school teachers , lawyers , sea captains , detectives , military leaders , physicians , and all who impress themselves upon others . I have seen successful healers thin and tall ; others short and fat ; some pale , others florid ; some intelligent , others unintelligent ; some intellectual , more only intelligent ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best was so feeble as to seem on the verge of death. * The specimen mental treatment given on page 423 shows how the practitioner worked herself up to the point ; and it is easy to fancy how forcibly she spoke when a surge of conviction that seemed to act on all the bloodvessels of her body and made her tingle all over , went through her ; and it is equally easy to imagine the effect upon the patient . The relation of the Mind Cure movement to ordinary medical practice is important . It emphasizes what the most philosophical physicians of all schools have always deemed of the first importance , though many have neglected it . It teaches that medicine is but occasionally necessary . It hastens the time when patients of discrimination will rather pay more for advice how to live , and for frank declarations that they do not need medicine , than for drugs . It promotes general reliance upon those processes which go on equally in health and disease . But these ethereal practitioners have no new force to offer ; there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they believe has practically nothing to do with their success . If a new school were to arise claiming to heal diseases without drugs or hygiene , or prayer , by the hypothetical odylic force invented by Baron Reichenbach , the effects would be the same , if the practice were the same . Recoveries as xemarkable have been occurring through all the ages , as the results of mental states and nature 's own powers . They will not be able to displace either the skilled surgeon or the educated physician ; for their arrogant and exclusive pretensions are of the nature of a " craze . " Most sensible persons will prefer a physician who understands both the mind and the body ; who can be a " father confessor " to the sick man , relieving him of the responsibility of treating himself , quieting his mind , strengthening him by hope , and stimulating him by his personal presence ; one who , understanding the mineral , plant , occasion to doubt . . . . We must not , however , make the mistake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others must first he sound himself . . . .

They will also prefer a physican who can relieve their pains when incurable , smooth their pathway to the inevitable end , or , when he has the happiness to see them convalescent , will be able to give them such hygienic hints as may prevent a recurrence of the malady , or save them from something worse . The verdict of mankind , excepting minds prone to vagaries on the borderland of insanity , will be that pronounced by Ecclesiasticus more than two thousand years ago : " THE LORD HATH CREATED MEDICINES OUT OF THE EARTH ; AND HE THAT IS WISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SICKNESS BE NOT NEGLIGENT ; BUT PRAY UNTO THE LORD , AND HE WILL MAKE THEE WHOLE .
