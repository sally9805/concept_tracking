TWO FESTIVALS BY MRS . FOLLEN With Illustrations by Billings and others MAY MORNING AND NEW YEAR 'S EVE . It is the evening before the first of May , and the boys are looking forward to a May-day festival with the children in the neighborhood . Mrs. Chilton read aloud these beautiful lines of Milton :  --  Now the bright morning star , Day 's harbinger , Comes dancing from the east , and loads with her The flowery May , who from her green lap throws The yellow cowslip , and the pale primrose . Hail beauteous May that dost inspire Mirth , and youth , and warm desire ; Woods and groves arc of thy dressing , Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing . Thus we salute thee with our early song , And welcome thee , and with thee long . " How beautiful ! " said Frank and Harry . " Suppose , Mother , " said Harry , " it should rain , and hail , and snow to-morrow , for it looks like it now , and then you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and all our plans will be spoiled . " " Why , then , my dear , we must enjoy May morning as the great poet did , after he lost his sight , with our mind 's eye ; and you must bear your disappointment patiently . " " Easier said than done , Mother , " said Harry . " Why , only think of all our preparations , and the beautiful wreath you made for Lizzy Evans , who is to be queen of the May , and how pretty she would look in it , and then think of the dinner in the woods , we all sitting round in a circle , and she and the king of the May in the midst of us , and Ned Brown playing on his flageolet ; and then you know we are all to walk home in procession , and have a dance at his mother 's after tea . " " You will not lose your dance , Harry , " said his mother , " if it should hail , and rain , and snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more , for then you will riot be fatigued by a long walk ; and Lizzy can wear the wreath at any rate . " " I do n't care for the fatigue , Mother ; I want to be in the woods and gather the flowers with my own hands , and smell them as I gather them in the fresh air , and hear the birds sing ; and to scream as loud as I please , and kick up my heels , and not hear any one say , ' Do n't make such a noise , Harry . ' I guess Milton did not take as much pleasure in writing poetry about the spring after he became blind . But please read his May Song again , Mother . " She read it again . " I think he must have felt as glad when he wrote it , " said Harry , " as I hope to feel tomorrow.  - -  'Comes dancing from the east '  - -  how beautiful it is ! What a pity he ever lost his sight ! " " Milton , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes while he could see , that he laid up stores of beautiful images , which he remembered when he could no longer use his bodily eyes . The poetry he wrote when he was blind shows the most accurate observation of the outward appearances of things , of shades of color , and of all those beauties which only sight could have taught him . It is worth while , boys , for you to imitate him in this , while you admire his poetry . " May morning came . It did not hail , or rain , or snow . The sun shone brightly . The birds seemed to know as well as the children that it was the first of May . The country village in which Mrs. Chilton lived was as noisy as a martin box , at break of day , when doubtless , though we poor wingless bipeds do n't understand what the birds are chattering about , they are planning their work and their amusements for the day -- and why not ? Soon after sunrise , all the children from far and near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of provisions , all assembled on a little green before Mrs. Grey 's house , and were ready to set out for the woods , about two miles distant . Ned Brown had his flageolet , and another boy had a drum . Lizzy Evans received the wreath which made her queen of the May , and Frank , being the tallest boy , was chosen king . And now off they all set , in high glee , happy as only children can be . Mrs. Chilton , and the teacher of the village school had promised the children to join them at the dinner hour , which was twelve . Just about eleven , the clouds began to gather . Nevertheless , the ladies kept their promise , and set out for the wood . The threatened shower came up , and they took refuge in an old empty barn , where they had not been many minutes before all the children , one after the other , came dripping in , some laughing , some small ones crying . Soon , however , the laughers prevailed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected many , they set themselves to work to spread out the dinner , in the most attractive way possible , and make what amends they could for the unlucky chance of the rain . An old milk stool was appropriated to the queen . It had not even the accustomed number of three legs to support it , so that the poor queen had to endure the anxiety of a tottering throne , and learned experimentally some of the pains of royalty . The king took possession of an old barrel that had lost both ends , and sitting astride upon it , Bacchus fashion he took his place by the side of the poor queen on her two-legged stool , upon which she was exercising all the art of balancing that she had acquired in one quarter at dancing school , hoping against hope that she might keep her dignity from rolling on the barn floor . Just as his May-majesty was fairly seated on the barrel , it , all at once , fell in , smash , and he was half covered with old hoops and slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her balance , and thus both rolled in the dust . In the mean time , the other children , who had no dignity to support , had spread their little repast on an old sledge . Mrs. Chilton , who had brought a table-cloth , assisted them . Dinner was now announced . The queen declared she could support her throne no longer , and she and the king , both forgetting their royalty , sat down with the others on the hay-strewn floor , and discussed apples , cake , &amp;c. , &amp;c . Unfortunately the rain lasted longer than the dinner ; every scrap that was eatable of their provisions was consumed ; and now the children all looked around with that peculiar , beseeching , half- discontented look , which is their wont to have on such occasions , as much as to say , " What shall we do next ? " Grown people who have been much with children , know full well that there is no peace when such symptoms appear , under such circumstances , unless , before the king of misrule begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for turbulent spirits . Accordingly , Mrs. Chilton asked the children if they had ever heard of the Mayday ball which is given every year to the children in Washington . " No , " was the answer . She said she had been at one , and she would tell all about it . " It is held in a large public hall , decorated for the purpose . All the children in Washington and Georgetown are invited to attend ; all have an equal right to go , ignorant and educated , poor and rich ; no matter how poor , if the girls can get a neat white frock , and the boys a decent dress , they are all admitted ; every one wears a wreath of flowers , or has a bouquet in his hand or bosom . The children assemble very early , and dance as much as they please , to the music of a fine band , and all partake of some simple refreshment , provided for them , before they return home . They number often over a thousand , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a dancing flower garden . I said all the children , rich and poor , in Washington . I wish it were so ; but there are many poor children who are never invited to this festival . No one dresses one of them in a nice white frock on May morning , and puts a wreath of flowers on her head , and a nosegay in her hands , and says to her , ' Go , dance , sing , and rejoice with the other children in God 's beautiful world . ' " " Why not ? " asked the listening children . " They are slaves -- they are negroes ! " replied Mrs. Chilton . " It is a shame ; it is wicked , " cried Frank and Harry , and all the rest . " When you are men and women , " said Mrs. Chilton , " you may do much for the poor slaves . Remember them then , and do not forget them now . All can do something for them , even little children . Now I will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew it to be true . I knew , he said , a little boy , who was one of the best little fellows that ever lived . He was gentle and kind to his companions , obedient to his parents , good to all . His home was in a small country village , but he was very fond of wandering into the neighboring fields , when his tasks were all over . There , if he saw a young bird that had fallen to the ground before it could fly , he would pick it up gently , and put it back in its nest . I have often seen him step aside , lest he should tread on an anthill , and thus destroy the industrious little creatures ' habitation . If a child smaller than he was carrying a heavy bundle or basket , Harry would always offer to help him . Was any one hurt , or unhappy , Harry was quick to give aid and sympathy ; ever ready to defend the weak , feared not the strong . For every harsh word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known him to carry more than half his breakfast to a little lame boy whose mother was very poor . Harry was brave and true ; he would confess his own faults , he would hide those of others . He had a thirst for knowledge . He got all his lessons well at school , and he stood high in his class . But what he was particularly remarkable for , was his love of all beautiful things , and most especially of wild flowers . He would make wreaths of them and give them to his mother , and he was very fond of putting one on my study table , when he could contrive to place it there without my seeing him . Harry knew all the green nooks where the houstonia was to be found in the early spring , and it was he that ever brought me the beautiful gentian that opens its fringed petals in the middle of the chilly October day . On Sunday , and on all holidays , Harry always had a flower or a bit of green in the button-hole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house had an old teapot or broken pitcher in it , containing one of Harry 's plants whose bright blossoms hid defects and infirmities . He also loved music passionately ; he whistled so sweetly that it was a delight to hear him . Yet there was something in his notes that always went to your heart and made you sad , they were so mournful . Often in the summer time , he would go , towards evening , into the fields and lie down in the long grass ; and there he would look straight up into the clear deep blue sky , and whistle such plaintive tunes , that , beautiful as they were , it made your heart ache to hear them . You could not see him , and it seemed as if you were listening to the song of a spirit . Alas ! Harry was not happy ; God 's glorious world was all around him ; his soul was tuned to the harmony of heaven , and yet his young heart ached ; and tears -- bitter , scalding tears -- often ran down his smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in his mother 's lap , that blessed home for a troubled spirit . One day , I discovered the cause of Harry 's melancholy . I was returning from a walk , and saw him at a little brook that ran behind my house , washing his face and hands vehemently , and rubbing them very hard . I then remembered that I had often seen him there doing the same thing . " It seems to me , Harry , " I said , " that your face and hands are clean now ; why do you rub your face so violently ? " " I am trying , " he said , " to wash away this color . I can never be happy till I get rid of this color . If I wash me a great deal , will it not come off at last ! The boys will not play with me ; they do not love me because I am of this color ; they are all white . Why , if God is good , did he not make me white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy ! " I said , and took him in my arms and pressed him to my heart ! " God is good ; it is man that is cruel . " The little fellow was soothed and strengthened by my sympathy , and the counsel I gave him . Not long after this , it was May-day , and all the children of the village went out into the fields to gather flowers , to dress themselves for a little dance they were to have in the evening . Every boy and girl in the village , except Harry , was of the party . They set off early in the morning , and they ran gayly over hills and meadows , and hunted busily for flowers ; but the spring had been cold , and they could not find many . They were returning home , wearied , and rather chilled and disheartened , when they saw Harry coming out of the woods with a large bunch of flowers in his hand . One of the boys called out to him , " Well , nigger , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and made no answer . " Come , stop , darky , " said the hard-hearted boy , " stop , and let 's have your flowers ; here 's three cents for them . " " I do n't wish to sell them , " said Harry ; " they are all for my mother . " " A nigger carry flowers to his mother ! that 's a good one ! Come , boys , let 's take them from him ; they are as much our flowers as his ; he has gathered more than his share ; " and he approached Harry to seize his flowers . " For shame , Tom , for shame ! " cried out many of the children , and one of the larger boys came forward and stood by Harry . " Touch him if you dare , Tom . You have got to knock me down first . " The cruel boy , who was , of course , a coward , fell back , and some of the little children gathered around Harry to look at the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one little girl , and slid her little hand into his . Harry 's anger was always conquered by one word of kindness . " Where did you get all your flowers ? " asked the children . " I will show you , " replied Harry , " if you will follow me . " They all shouted , " Let 's go , let 's go ; show us the way , Harry ; " and off they set . Harry ran like a quail through bush and brier , and over rocks and stone walls , till he came to a hill covered with a wood . " On the other side of this hill , " said he , " we shall find them . " In a very few minutes the children were all there . There they saw a warm , sunny hollow ; through it ran a little brook , and all around were massive rocks and pretty nooks ; and there were the birds singing loudly , and there were cowslips , and anemones , and houstonias , and violets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had insulted Harry hung back ashamed . Harry quietly said to him , " Here , under this little tree , is a beautiful bed of violets , and there are anemones . " Harry tasted of the pleasure of doing good for evil . The boy who had defended him walked by him , and talked kindly to him . " How good it was in you to show us the flowers ! " said the little girl who had taken Harry 's hand , and whose apron he had filled with flowers . How happy now was poor Harry ! All the children gathered that morning as many flowers as they desired . Some carried home only perishable earthly flowers in their hands ; others , immortal flowers in their hearts . The village children went to their dance , and were very happy . Harry spent the rest of the day and the evening in his mother 's cottage , alone with her , and amused himself with making wreaths of his flowers . But he said he had never passed so happy a May-day . A loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sunshine in a shady place . ' " The clouds had now passed away . One of the boys proposed to pass a vote of thanks to the old barn , for the hospitable shelter it had afforded during the shower . This was received and passed with acclamations . Frank and Lizzy , or rather the king and queen of the May , declared that they had no thanks to offer to the old barrel or the milk stool . It was too wet to go into the woods again ; so they formed a procession , and with their flowers in their hands , and such music as they had , returned gayly home . The children all enjoyed the dance in the evening ; but there were some hearts there , young and merry as they were , that made a solemn vow never to forget those of whom they had heard that day ,  --  " them that are in bonds . " It is New Year 's eve . Frank and Harry are sitting with their mother by the pleasant fireside . The boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fire , and had been silent for a long time . She was thinking of the past ; they , of what was to come . " Mother , " said Harry , " will you tell me tonight what my new year 's gift will be ? " " Do n't speak to mother now , " said Frank . " Why not ? " O , because mother looks as if she did not want to talk . " " But mother told me that , if I would be silent till she had done reading , I might talk as much as I pleased to her . " " So I did , Harry , " said his mother ; " and now I am ready to hear you . What did you ask me ? " " Only , Mother , whether you meant I should know what my new year 's gift is , before tomorrow morning . " " No , dear ; I think you had better have it all new and fresh to- morrow ; the surprise is a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What can it be ? I know what I hope it is . " " What do you hope it will be , Harry ? " " I do hope it will be a magic lantern , " said Harry , without a moment 's hesitation . His mother made no answer . " What do you wish for ? " asked Harry . " I do n't know , " said Frank ; " there are so many things I wish for , that I hardly know what to say first . " " I wish , " said their mother , " that I could grant all your wishes ; that I could give you every good thing you desire ; but my means , as you know , are limited . I am sorry , dear , that you have so many wishes ungratified . " " O Mother , it is not for such things as you can give that I most wish for . You are very kind to me , and give me more good things than you ought to give me ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one can give me . " " We all have many such wishes , my dear child ; but we must not think even these quite unattainable . There are few things that a reasonable being earnestly desires , that some day or other may not become his . " " Do you think so , Mother ? " " Yes , Frank ; perhaps he may not attain them in this life , but I think the very desire is a prophecy , and even promise , that we shall at some stage of our being possess what we wish . " " I know what I shall wish , then , " said Harry , " and keep wishing it as long as I live till I get it , though I am afraid I shall never have it . I 'll tell you what my wish is , Frank , if you will tell me yours . " " Agreed , Harry , " said Frank ; " and you shall tell your wish first , and I last . " " I wish , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfectly gentle , and would go all over the world with me , and do just as I told him to , and never be tired ; but I guess I never shall get one . Come , Frank , what do you wish ? " " I wish that I had a great deal of strength and courage , more than any one else , and was never afraid of any thing , and that I could do whatever was to be done , and become , at last , a great man , and do some good in the world . I do n't want to sit still in a corner half of my life , and never use my faculties . Now , Mother , Harry and I have told our wishes ; will you tell yours ? " " First , " said the mother , " let me show you how near you may , even in this life , come to your wishes , and then I will tell mine . Harry will not continue to wish for a flying horse , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but his wish will change into a desire of travelling and seeing all that is beautiful and wonderful in God 's glorious world , and then he will find his flying horse in a rail carriage or steamboat . And you , my dear Frank , if you continue to wish to be strong and brave , and truly great , will have , perhaps , more than you ask for ; for , if you do not have a strong body , you will have a brave spirit , and you will be what is better than a strong man -- a good , great man . True greatness does not depend upon physical strength ; for instance , a brave and noble woman may be greater than a man . " " How is that , Mother ? " " Because , from the weakness of her body she has more obstacles to overcome . Her power arises from an inward strength that lasts long , and shines most brightly in the darkest hour of trial . Mere bodily strength , without this power of soul , is often cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I heard the other day , which will show you what I mean . Somewhere in the State of Maine there is a beautiful little lake , on the banks of which are a number of farms and pleasant dwelling houses . There are boats on the lake , and the people are in the habit of allowing the children to learn early the management of a boat ; girls and boys together are allowed to go out on the lake , without any man to take charge of them . One day , a little party went out . They had been rowing about for some time , and gathering pond lilies , and waking up all the echoes in the surrounding woods with loud shouts , merry laughs , and happy songs . The children were in the middle of the lake , and were thinking of returning , when , by some accident , one of the boys fell overboard . A boy of fourteen years of age had the management of the boat ; he was the principal oarsman . He was strong and active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and he immediately began to row for the shore to get help . In the mean time , the poor boy , who could not swim to the shore , and whose strength would be unequal to keep above water till they returned with help , would have been drowned . There were other boys in the boat , but it was a little girl , of ten years of age , who , immediately forgetting her weakness , became their leader and guide . She insisted that the boat should be turned back again , that the poor boy should not be left . I know not if she seized the oar , but if she did not , she prevailed with others to turn the boat round and come back again to the poor boy , who , seeing himself left by his companions , was giving himself up for lost . As soon as they came up to him again , the brave little girl asked the boy of fourteen years to keep the boat as steady as he could . Then she reached over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold her fast by the legs . Soon she was able to reach the drowning boy . He was much bigger than she . She told him to put his arms round her neck . She then put her arms under his , and pulled him safely into the boat . This girl was a small , delicate child . Now , dear Frank , who was the strong and brave one , the girl or the boy ? Which would you rather be ? " " Of course , the girl , Mother . What a brave little soul she was ! " " So you see , Frank , that what is most truly desirable in your wish is within your reach , even now . " " She was a first rate girl , " said Harry , " and the boy was a real coward for going away and leaving the poor fellow in the lake ; " and he breathed a long breath , as if he had himself just come out of the water . " Now , boys , to match that story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sailor boy who was even braver and nobler than she . As a schooner was sailing near Montauk Point , Long Island , she was suddenly struck by a heavy gust of wind , upset , and instantly sunk . A vessel near by , which had seen the calamity , sent its boat to save from sinking any that had not gone to the bottom . On coming near where the schooner went down , they saw a little boy , twelve years old , floating on some wood , and went to take him off . As they approached him , he cried out , ' Never mind me ; save the captain ; he has a wife and six children . Both , however , were saved . Can we make any better resolution , my dear boys , " said Mrs. Chilton , " to begin the New Year with , than that we will try to be as brave and self- forgetting as the little girl and boy I have been telling you about ? And now , good night . " " Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Harry ; and they were soon asleep . On New Year 's morning , Harry found a large bag hanging to his bed post , containing a magic lantern ; and Frank saw on his bureau a complete set of Miss Edgeworth 's Works . Again it is New Year 's eve . Another year has passed happily over the home of Mrs. Chilton and her boys . " To-morrow , dear Mother , is New Year 's day , " said Frank ; " may we not , as we are one year older , sit up till the clock strikes twelve , and wish you a happy new year before we go to bed ? " " Yes , boys , if you can keep awake , you may sit up . Tell me , Frank , do you think you have gained as much this year as you ought to have gained ? Ere long you will be a man . " " I think I have gained something , " replied Frank . " I am at the head of my class in school . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a great deal more than I did last year . " " Is that all you have gained ? Have you cured any of your faults ? Can you command your temper any better ? Are you any more disinterested ? Are you more careful about the truth -- in short , are you a better boy ? " " I can not say , Mother ; you know about that better than I. " " You expect a New Year 's gift to-morrow , I presume , Frank . " " Yes , Mother , you always give us a New Year 's gift , you know . Will you let us sit up till the clock strikes twelve to-night ? " Their mother promised that they should , and added , " I have been thinking of a New Year 's gift for you , Frank , that I am not quite sure you will like . I will tell you what it is , and if you do not like it , you will say so honestly , I trust . " " What is it , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my closet . It has a window in it , and contains some shelves with books on them . I propose to give you that closet , with all the books I shall leave in it , for your own . In it are a desk and a chair . From the window , you look directly , you know , upon the pine grove . In this little room , you may study and write and read and think also , as much as you please . " Frank could scarcely hear his mother finish , for delight at the thought . " All my own ? the books , the desk , the nice old-fashioned chair and the closet itself ? Why , Mother , I never should have believed you would have given it to me for my own . There is nothing I should like so well in the world . Shall I have the Shakespeare , and the Johnson , and the Classical Dictionary , and the Sir Charles Grandison , and all the old poets , and those French books in it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son , I think I need not ask you to promise to lend them to me when I wish to borrow them . I have a great affection for this closet , Frank , and therefore I give it to you . If the walls could speak , they could tell you a great deal of your mother 's history . " " I wish they could ; I shall sit there a great deal , and I should like to hear all they have to say . " " As I have promised you to let you sit up till the new year comes in , I will tell you something now of what they would say . You know that this is the house in which I was born , so that this closet knew me from a child . Many a time , when I was a little girl , has my mother shut me up in it for refusing to obey her . It was gentle treatment shutting me up in this closet ; had it not been called a punishment , I never should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wind through the pine trees rebuked my bad temper , and seemed to say , ' Hush , Alice ! Peace ! Be still . ' I always came out better than I went into it . When I was nine years old , my father gave me this closet for my own use altogether . Many of the books that are in it now were in it then , and the same desk and chair stand there to this day . My father had just built on to his house the addition which gave him the library which I now use ; his law books and papers , &amp;c. , required better accommodation ; and , from that time , the closet became mine . He gave it to me , as I do to you , for a New Year 's gift ; and this is one reason why I love to give it to you for the same purpose . It is a very dear and sacred spot to me , Frank , this closet , and I think you will like to hear something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , " said Frank . " When I first took possession of it , " continued his mother , " I felt more grand , I fancy , than Queen Victoria did when she took possession of the throne of England , for she had anticipated her elevation , whereas I had never dreamed of mine . When I was a girl , children did not fare as they do now , and my father 's liberality to me was an unusual thing . My father and mother both went up stairs with me on New Year 's day , and led me into my little sanctum , which they had dressed with evergreens , and seated me in the three- cornered leather-bottomed chair , and told me that every thing in the closet was mine . Although it was winter , still the pine trees that you know come so near the window , and that now are old trees , looked beautiful , and to me it seemed a little paradise . ' Here , ' said my mother , ' you were many a time shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Now you are old enough to know yourself when it is the right time for you to be shut up here , in order that you may grow good . I advise you , at such times , to come here and stay till you have conquered the bad spirit , and can come out with a firm resolution to do better . I shall never put you in the closet again , but I shall trust , Alice , that you will put yourself in , at all proper times . ' I well remember putting my arms around my mother 's neck and kissing her for joy , but I said not a word . My heart was too full of love , and gratitude , and pleasure to speak . After my parents left me in the closet , in my own chair , now all my own , I sat still some minutes thinking what I should do with my great possession , how I should improve my great blessing . The thought of my mother 's loving trust in me affected me very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved that , whenever I found myself doing wrong , I would come to my closet , shut myself in , and pray there for strength to cure my faults . I then counted them all over as far as I knew them , and resolved to get rid of them all . I was too happy to think of the difficulty in the way of doing this , but my self-confidence was soon rebuked . After looking over all the books , and putting my fingers upon every thing in my little kingdom , and dancing up and down with delight , I followed my father and mother down stairs to see the presents for the other children . Such was my state of exaltation that when my little sister came , full of joy , to me , with her new doll , I turned contemptuously away from her , and sneered at it , and said , ' Who wants to look at a doll ? My New Year 's gift is the best ; it is worth yours and the boys ' all put together . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little sister as she said , ' Why , Alice , I thought you would be so glad to see my doll , '  - -  and never shall I forget the silent rebuke of my mother 's gentle eye , as she looked at me sadly . I felt it all . I could not stand it . I ran up to my closet ; I turned the key as I closed the door . I fell on my knees and poured forth to my Father in heaven the first TRUE prayer I ever remember to have uttered . I prayed for forgiveness of my unkindness , I prayed for strength to conquer my many faults . That day I did not sin again . I played with Fanny 's doll . I did all that I could to make every one happy . I took the children up to my closet , and tried to make them share in all my pleasures while I tried to enjoy theirs . I made amends for my fault . From that time , I began a religious self-scrutiny and censorship . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance in my closet . When I shut myself up on account of wrong doing , I would not allow myself to read or do any thing but think of my fault . The words of my mother which had been uttered without much serious thought , were as a law to me . I became , if possible , too sensitive to my own defects ; it made me rather egotistical . It seemed as if my heart had become suddenly changed . I was , as it were , born again ; a new life began in me . One penance that I subjected myself to was to go and confess to my mother all my faults , even the most trifling . She feared that this continual self-reference would make me , as it did , an egotist , and she , one day , advised me to be satisfied with seeing my wrong doings and acknowledging them to myself , and to try to correct them without speaking of them to her . I begged her , with tears , to let me have my own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think , for a time , it did . The necessity of confiding all that is in our hearts , and all we do that is wrong , to a being whom we entirely respect and love , and in whose purity we confide , is a great check upon evil thoughts and evil deeds . One instance I well remember of the good effect of my confession . My mother insisted upon careful and neat habits in all things . She would not allow us to throw down our caps or bonnets . They must all be hung up on pegs in the hall , and each child had a peg of his or her own . As we often forgot the command , our mother , in order to remind us , made a law , one winter , that whoever broke the rule should , when the apples were distributed in the evening , have none . One day , all of us came in to supper in haste from play , and two out of four of us forgot to hang up their hats -- my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up my hat , and hung it up in the right place . At the time of distributing the apples , my mother gave me a fine one , and said , " Alice never forgets her hat . No one forgets now but Jeannie . She is very careless , and must have no apple to-night . " I was mean enough to take my apple and be silent ; but I could not eat it . Still there seemed to be a spell over me ; and , wretched as I was , I could not speak and confess before my brothers and sisters how false and shabby I had been . I went to my closet ; and there , after a while , I resolved that , in the morning , I would tell the whole truth . I went to bed , but I could not go to sleep . As soon as I heard my mother coming to bed , I went to her bedside , confessed the truth to her , gave her my apple , and begged her to tell the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as she was kind . " You must tell them yourself , " she said . " You must confess your fault to your youngest sister with your own lips , and be willing to appear before her what you are . You must not ask me to save you this disgrace . It is that which will cure you . It is your just punishment . " I did as she bade me , and this was my last sin of that kind . I had another fault , and that was a great irritability of temper , and many and many an hour of solitude have I passed in that closet , looking out at the quiet pine trees , and listening to the soft sighing of the winds through their branches , till my heart has been softened , and the spirit of love and gentleness has returned . I remember one instance in particular of my conquest there of my foolish anger . I was in the habit , in warm weather , of learning all my lessons in my closet , particularly favorite pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There I recited them aloud . I found that the other children would often come and listen to me ; this fretted me ; I was very angry at it . I desired them not to do it , and not in an amiable manner ; but they often forgot or disregarded my request . I could not , or thought I could not , command my temper whenever I found this out . One day I had been reciting Hamlet 's soliloquy ; and , just after I had repeated the last words , I heard William say in a pompous manner , " Toby or not Toby . " I was very angry , foolish as it may seem to you , and burst open the door so suddenly and violently that I threw down my little sister who stood against it ; and , instead of taking her up , I told her I was glad I had knocked her down ; and then I was coward enough to strike my little brother . The cries of both children brought up my mother . By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the story just as it was , and I felt very much ashamed . My mother simply said to me , " I thought you were beginning to be a reasonable being , and had ceased to be a passionate coward . You know that William is not so strong as you , or you would not dare to strike him . " Her words seemed to me very harsh then , but now I think they were just . All abuse of power , all cruelty to the weak , is truly cowardly and mean . That day I punished myself severely . Some friends were to dine with us , friends whom I loved particularly to see ; one of them was Jane Grey , my earliest and dearest friend ; but I would not go down to dinner . When called , I sent a note to my mother , saying I should not come down , and wanted no dinner , and begging her not to send again for me , for it would be in vain . I heard the cheerful , merry voices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trees near my window . I breathed in the sweet fragrance of the roses and the new hay . I saw the animals at a distance feeding quietly . The clear , deep-blue sky , as I gazed up at it from my window , looked so pure , so solemn , as if angels unseen might be hovering over the world . All , all but me was beautiful , and happy , and good . I was sinful , I was unhappy ; I was , it seemed to me , a discord in the world . I hated myself for my bad temper , for it was some time before I had quite conquered it . At last , however , I did , and became gentle and happy in my chosen solitude , while others were enjoying themselves together . In the middle of the afternoon , they all went out to walk . When Jeannie came up for her bonnet , she ran to my closet , and called out to me , " Dear Alice ! mother told me not to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy without you . Jane says she ca n't play without you . Ca n't you come down ? Do , Alice . " " No , " I replied . " Say nothing about me . I shall not see Jane to-day . " After Jeannie left me , I could not quite keep the tears from my eyes . Pretty soon , my dear mother , who always thought people must suffer from hunger , came to me and brought me a nice piece of pudding she had saved for me , and said kindly to me , " Come , Alice , you have punished yourself enough ; eat this pudding and come down stairs . You will not be so passionate again . " I would not go down , but I ate the pudding . When our friends were all gone , I went down , and then I told Willie I was sorry for striking him . Whether it was that my partiality to Jane , which caused what I suffered that day to make a peculiarly deep impression on my mind , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more self-command ; and never did I forget that day in my closet . I could tell you much more about my closet experiences , Frank , of what I have enjoyed and what I have suffered in it . There I went when my heart was too full of pain or pleasure to bear the eye of another . There have I prayed . There have I sent up thanksgivings . There have I wept bitter tears . A new page in its history will commence to-morrow , Frank . I hope , also , a new and fair page in the history of your mind , that inner , private apartment , on which only your own eye and the eye of Infinite Purity can rest . Begin to- morrow to write on that new page the history of conquered selfishness , of truth and purity , of devotion to duty , of a higher love for others , of obedience to the will of God ; then this will be a truly happy New Year . As I have told you , Frank , beforehand , what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Harry , if he pleases , what I have got for him . " " Tell it now , Mother . It is so pleasant here by the fire . " " You are to have a nice new desk , with a key to it , all your own . " " O , that 's prime , Mother , " said Harry ; " and where shall I keep it " ? " " In my little writing room , if you like , Harry . " " Yes , Mother ; and then I can talk a little now and then to you , I suppose . " " Sometimes , Harry ; and I doubt not that Frank will let you come , now and then , to his closet . I do n't want this closet to separate you ; but , on the contrary , to be the means of making you better friends , because it will help Frank to be a better boy , and so always to set you a good example . " " It is rather hard , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I ever did such a thing in my life . " " Mother , " said Harry , " you told us that you had been translating a little story from a French book , to read to us some evening . We shall have time enough to-night , for you know you promised to let us sit up till the clock strikes twelve ; so we can talk , and read , and tell stories too . There will be time enough for all , before Mr. Old Year goes out and Mr. New Year comes in . " Mrs. Chilton consented . Frank placed her little stand by her , with the German lamp upon it , in the way she liked to have it , and she read as follows :  --  THE BIRTHDAY . Near the coast of Northumberland , at a little distance from the land , you can just see rising up a group of little islands , rocks scattered without order , that grow in number at low water ; you may count as many as twenty of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . Nothing can be more desolate than the appearance of the little Farne Islands ; formed of rocks barely covered with a thin vegetation , surrounded by precipices , they seem accessible only to sea birds , who take refuge there in the tempests . The Island of Longstone is at the head of the group , and serves as a sort of vanguard , and is , perhaps , the most dangerous of all . A gloomy collection of black rocks , full of crevices worn by the action of the winds , the waters , and the tempests , it does not nourish a single plant ; not an atom of soil adheres to its surface ; it is naked and barren ; its steep sides bristle with cockle shells which encrust the rock . The interior is still more desolate than the exterior ; it is a succession of black hillocks cut by narrow ravines into which the sea rushes , roaring and furious , at high tide , detaching from the rocks fragments which it grinds , rounds into pebbles , and deposits pell-mell with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again will come to seek them in the storm , roll them over once more in its foam , and drag them off to its profound caverns . While our feet were wounded by the rocks , above our heads hundreds of sea birds hovered screaming , and among them we discovered the sea-gull by its shrill and harsh scream . Notwithstanding these horrors , this island is not a desert . At the summit of the rock , there rises a round tower where every evening a light is kindled , so contrived as , at intervals of some seconds , to throw a brilliant light upon the points where the fretted waves rage and boil round a hidden rock , and to light the dangerous channel which separates the island from its sister isles , and to warn the pilot to avoid by every means the perilous labyrinth . The keeper of the lighthouse did not live alone in this wild place ; his wife followed him there ; his family increased , and the cradle has rocked again and again . Grace Darling , the eldest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the family are rejoicing at the festival , for every anniversary is religiously kept by the little company that animates the solitude of Longstone . Every one is gone out to seek something by which he may take his part in the festivity , and prepare a surprise for the well-beloved sister . The mother remains at home kneading a nice cake to gratify the appetite of the little marauders . " Mother , Mother ! " cried John , who returned the first ; " see what a superb lobster the rising sea has brought up and left in the crevice of a rock , which I call my fish-trap . Might not one say that the sea knew that it was Grace 's feast day ? " " I have only some shrimps , " said William ; " but they are very fine ones , I hope . I took them , with a net at the end of the little creek . " " Imprudent boy ! " said their mother ; " your father has told you a hundred times not to venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock is too steep , and the water is more than a hundred fathoms deep . " " Yes , but , in a turning , there is a little platform which I have shown to my father , and he has consented to my going there at low water . Then I know the rock , and the sea knows me ; neither of them wish to hurt me . You have more reason for scolding Jenny ; she is not afraid of any thing ; she climbs like a cat all along the crevices to collect sea weed , which she burns in order to enrich the hole which she calls her garden , and to cultivate -- what ? nothing that one can eat -- some good-for-nothing flowers , which grow only in consequence of shelter and great care . " " And you count it for nothing to be able to present to Grace a rose like that ? " said Jenny , who just then came in bringing a rose of a dull white , surrounded by vigorous leaves of a dark green . " What a pleasure to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to see it blossom so exactly at the right time . I do not regret the pains I have taken with it , I assure you . " " And you are right , " replied her mother ; " for Grace will know well how to appreciate the pains you must have taken to give her such a pleasure ; and I , too , approve of the forethought you have discovered , which will make you one day a good housewife . Let your brothers fish and hunt ; let it be your care to plant and ornament our solitude with your little smiling , blooming nook of earth . " " But where is Grace ? " asked John ; " why is she not assisting you as usual , Mother ? " " Because I refused to let her do so . She knows well that this day will be her festival , and I have sent her up stairs to her father , whilst we are here together preparing for her . " " James and the two little ones are missing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " The two little ones are with Grace , who is giving them a lesson in reading . I do not see why James stays away so long ; it is nightfall , and his father has always desired him to take care not to be overtaken by a fog far from the house . " " Suppose I go after him , " said William . " There he comes , there he comes ! " cried John and Jenny . The boy came in , in truth , all out of breath . " I have just succeeded , " said he , " in making up the dozen . " As he said this , he put upon the table a dozen of wild eggs . " The last came near costing me very dear , " said he ; " it was laid half way down to the Black Man 's ; you know , William , the great rock which looks like a giant sitting down ; I had climbed , on my knees , and I had only one more step to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and would have carried me away if I had not clung with all my might to the great Black Man . " " Foolish child , " said the mother , " could you not foresee the return of the tide ? " " Not at all , not at all . It came before the hour . There are enormous waves in the channel , and the sea growls as when it is going to be angry . " " That will not prevent us from passing a merry evening , " replied William ; " come , let us go quickly to work . " He hastened to set the table , and assist his sister in putting on the plates , while his mother broke the eggs , beat up the omelet , and drew out the cake from the oven . All was ready , and William rang the bell to call the father and Grace to supper , who usually remained in the upper part of the tower of the lighthouse . Grace loved to contemplate the indented coast of Northumberland , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little hamlet where she was born ; it was not that she regretted the fertile soil , the verdure , the wood she had seen when she was little . No ! the Isle of Longstone , did it not contain in its rocky bosom what was dearest to Grace ? Her sympathy extended , however , far beyond . She trembled with joy when she distinguished on board of a passing vessel boys and girls , young people and women . She waved her handkerchief to them , sent to them affectionate words which the wind blew away , but which eased her full heart . She had another more intimate tie to her fellow-beings , and to her native land , and this was the reading some good books , that inexhaustible source of elevated thought and profitable example . When she at last appeared in the low hall where they waited for her , there was a general hurrah ; the question was , who should first get his arms round her neck , who should embrace her , and who should congratulate her on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much delighted , as the young providers of the festival could desire . She praised the beauty of the lobster , the size of the shrimps , the wild taste of the omelet ; but the rose touched her the most tenderly , and Jenny clapped her hands as she said ,  --  " I was very sure that you would love my poor little flower , which William despised because it was not good to eat . " " He is a little gourmand , " said Grace , laughing , " whom I condemn for his punishment to eat my part of the cake . " " To the health of Grace , " said the father . " We have just opened for her one of the bottles of old Bourdeaux , which the brave French captain gave us , who came near perishing down below at the end of the great reef of rocks , sixteen years ago . " " And whom you saved at the risk of your life , " added his wife . " I remember it all , " said Grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , yet I well remember that terrible night . I hear now the howling of the waves as they broke against the rocks , and made the lighthouse tremble . " " It was just such a night as this , " said the father ; " a Friday , the sixth of September . The sun set , just as it set to-night , in a cloud red as blood , which is never a sign of any thing good . " " It is a sign of a great wind , " said James ; " so much the better ; the wild birds will come to the island for shelter . " " A great storm , " said John , " always brings fish into my trap ; besides , I love the storm . " " Let us play hit-hand , " said Jenny . " Come , James , you begin ; put your head in my lap , and hold your hand out . There ! tell me who struck . " " That is not difficult ; it was you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it is your turn . " After this game came blind man 's buff . The eldest sister gave herself up to all their wishes . She let them bandage her eyes , and sought fearfully the little fugitives ; but notwithstanding her efforts , and the efforts of all to be amused , a cloud hung over the little assembly . Without , a thick fog enveloped the island , and veiled the friendly light . " If I am not greatly deceived , this will be a very bad night , " said the father . " There is , fortunately , no vessel in sight , if it is not , perhaps , the Hull packet , which will have had time , I think , to reach the Bay of Berwick , and which will have the discretion , I trust , to remain there ; for the heavens speak in a loud voice this evening ; the wind comes from below , and the waves run before it like a flock of frightened sheep . " " I should like to see a flock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Grace held in her lap , and whom she was getting to sleep . " Hush ! did I not hear something ? " said the mother . " It is the wind that sings us to sleep in the tower , " said the little child . Grace , who was just going up stairs , stopped and listened . " I only hear the sea which strikes and rages against the rocks , " said she . " Let it beat as it will , it will not wake me , " said John . " I am too weary . " Good nights were exchanged , and they all betook themselves to bed ; and , in a quarter of an hour after , every one slept , rocked by the storm which roared around the tower , beat against the lighthouse , shook its thick glass , and sought in vain to reach the flame . The tempest increased from hour to hour . It rose in mountainous waves , and broke against the rocks with a tremendous noise . These sounds were heard in Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with the waves ; they called her to their rescue ; she held out her hand , and felt herself drawn into the gulf with them . Presently she heard a cry . She sat up in her bed ; the day began to dawn ; it might be four o'clock in the morning . The wind brought to her ear a cry shriller than the first . This time she was not mistaken ; it was a human voice . Her whole heart was agitated . Quickly as possible she climbed to the steps that led to the outer platform of the lighthouse . Her father was there before her . Clinging to the balustrade , he looked all around ; but his eyes were unable to see through the fog and the rain ; he saw nothing . " Grace , " said he , " you have good eyes ; see if you can discover any thing . " The young girl took the spy glass , but the fog obscured the glasses . She calmly wiped them , and looked again . " I perceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is it ? " " At the head of the long reef . O God , if the fog would only lift . " And the young girl raised an earnest prayer to Heaven . " Why , Father , " she called suddenly , " I see something move . There are many of them ; they are waiting for us ; let us go . " " You do not think , my child , " said her father ; " stay here ; I will go alone . " " Alone to meet those frightful waves , and no one to guide the helm ? That would be to go to a certain death . I am stronger than you . Think of no such thing , Father . I shall go with you , and we will save them . " Her father looked in her face , and his eyes filled with tears . " So be it , " he said ; " we will die together . " " We will live , and we will save them . Let us to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twinkling of an eye , the boat , moored in a creek , was unfastened , and launched upon the boiling waves , when a voice cried from the shore ,  --  " And will you leave me behind ? I have a right to run the same risks with you ; I wish to take my part . " The mother threw herself into the bark , which rose for a moment on the menacing crest of an enormous wave , then disappeared , swallowed up in the furrow left between two mountains of water . In the mean while , the fog lifted , and a group of shipwrecked people were seen clinging to the sharp points of a ledge of rocks upon which beat the hull of a ship , split in two . " They come nearer , " cried one of them . " O , that terrible wave has carried them farther off . " " Let us thank God for that , " said the captain ; " it might have dashed them against the reef . " " They will arrive too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart an infant already stiff and motionless with cold . " They are making superhuman efforts , " said the captain . " Courage , brave hearts ! " And he raised a white handkerchief . The mother uttered a loud cry . She had just discovered that the child that she was trying to warm was dead . At this moment , the bark made a desperate effort to land ; but a furious wave carried it off for a third time . It whirled round and round , as if taken into one of those bottomless gulfs which the currents form around the rocks , and disappeared . The group of shipwrecked sufferers , six men and five women , fell upon their knees at this awful moment . Suddenly they perceived the boat nearer to them than ever . It had rounded the reef , and gained a quieter sea . It was coming along the edge of the rock , which on that side sunk precipitately into the sea . " Bless me , " said the captain , " they are women . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried a sailor . Grace had already seized hold of the poor mother . She had gently taken the dead baby out of her arms , under the pretence of carrying it for her . She led her over the rough parts of the rock into the boat . There was not a minute to lose ; the tide was rising ; a delay of a few moments might render a return impossible . The heroic young girl insisted only that she would remain on the reef till the skiff , which could only take half of the company , returned for the remainder . God rewarded her faith and courage . All those who had been wrecked on the frightful reefs of Longstone were saved , and brought in safety into the small dwelling of the lighthouse . The remains of the feast , the old wine opened in honor of Grace , helped to reanimate the poor shipwrecked sufferers who owed their lives to the young girl . " Never was a birthday , " as the good mother often said , " so full of terrible and joyful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a right good story , Mother , " said Harry . " Was Grace Darling a real person ? " " Yes , " said his mother , " and many more beautiful stories are told of her , and all true . She was a noble creature . " " One more story , dear Mother , " said the boys . " We have a good deal of time , yet . " " Many years ago , " said the mother , " I was making a visit in a family where what I am going to relate to you took place . I wrote it all down , and I will now read it to you from my manuscript book . " A TRUE STORY . One cold , stormy evening in the middle of winter , a family , consisting of four children and their parents , were gathered round a bright , blazing fire . One merry-looking little girl was sitting with a large , beautiful cat in her lap , which she was stroking , while Miss Puss was purring her satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , who was employed at some needlework . The oldest boy was getting his lesson . The youngest was sitting on his father 's knee . " How the wind roars ! " said little Robert , as a tremendous blast came swelling and moaning over the fields and rushed against their dwelling , which , saving one old elm tree that bent its protecting branches over it , stood all alone , exposed to the shock of the wind against it . " Sha n't we blow over , Father ? " said the child . " No , dear ; we have stood higher winds than this . " " Now it dies away , " said Helen , as , for a moment , she stopped caressing her favorite . " The storm is taking breath , " said Ned ; " now you can hear it a great way off ; it sounds like a troop of horse galloping up -- now it comes nearer and nearer . Hurrah ! there it comes again ! hurrah ! Hear the poor old elm creak and groan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches will break , but I am afraid the ice is too heavy for them . " " Think of poor old Fanny to-night , " said Julia , the elder girl , " in her little cottage , and the walls so thin . Mother , what will she do ? " " Her house is so small that the wind seems to pass her by , " said the mother , " and , when it is so cold as it is to-night , the poor soul goes to bed , and lies there till it is warmer . Many a time , I have found her in bed in the morning , and given her some breakfast , and advised her to lie there till she could get up with comfort . " " It is so still now , " said Robert , " that I can hear the flakes of snow on the window panes . " " And so do I , " said little Helen , " and the wind seems to say , Hush ! hush ! " " I should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loud in your ears , " replied Ned . " Do put her out of the room ; I would rather hear the loudest wind that ever blew than hear a cat purr , purr , purr so forever ; it makes my head spin to hear it ; hush , Puss ! stop purring . " Puss purred on all the same , for Ned 's words were followed by no hostile act towards her . No one , much less Helen 's pet , was ever treated inhospitably at Mr. Nelson 's fireside . Now there was a short silence in the happy group , and nothing was heard but the fitful wind without , the crackling of the fire , and the contented sound of the purring cat within . Mrs. Nelson was the first to speak . " Is it not time , " said she , " for John to return from the village ? I can not help expecting a letter from James . If , "  - -  and the color left her cheeks ,  --  " if he was alive and well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a letter by Captain S. " " I hear John coming up the avenue now . " In a moment Ned was gone to see what packages were brought from the office , and in another he was back again with a parcel in his hand . " Here , Father , " said he , " here are the newspapers , and here , Mother , is a big letter from uncle John for you . " His mother opened her brother 's letter . " A letter from Jemmy , " said she , with a voice trembling with joy . " A letter from Jemmy , " said all the children together , and in a moment each one was silent , in order to listen to its contents . " Dear Mother : Here we are all safe and sound ; but when you get this , you will , I know , thank God you have yet a son Jemmy . I have kept a sea journal which you and father can see when I get home ; so I shall say nothing more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering I was a green hand , and that I made friends with the mates and all the sailors . O , they were so kind to me ! and lucky it was for me that they did love me so well , as you 'll see presently . Well , to my story . I hate to come to it , for it makes me feel so badly ; but do n't be frightened , Mother ; here I am on shore , as lively as a cricket , and could make as much noise in your house now as I ever did . Well , dear Mother , all , as I said , went well with me , till one night , when we were on the Grand Bank ; it was a rain storm , and the captain sent me up to the topmast to reef a sail ; some one had been up , in the course of the day , and dropped some grease , and I think my foot slipped ; I was confused , the rain beat in my face , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have been stunned , for I am sure some time must have passed before I found myself overboard , struggling to keep myself above water . In a moment , I saw my whole danger . I knew that the ship must have gone on some distance , and that it was useless to try to swim after her . I did not think the sailors would know I had fallen overboard , for some time , and I knew that , in such a dark , stormy night , it was almost impossible for them to do any thing to save me . You know , dear Mother , I am an excellent swimmer ; but I immediately thought that my only chance was to save my strength as much as possible ; so I turned over on my back and floated , and determined to keep myself as quiet as I could , so as not to exhaust myself before the boat could come for me , which was what I hoped for , though I knew there was small chance of it , on such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those great birds that follow after vessels , hovering over me , and I felt his horrid wings brushing over my face . I used one of my arms to drive him away , while , with the other , I kept myself on the top of the water ; the waves rolled high , and , as they broke over me , repeatedly filled my mouth with the bitter water , so that I could not scream to let any one know where I was . Presently more birds , smaller however , fluttered their frightful wings over me ; but the large one , whose wings I am sure extended as far as I could stretch my arms , was the worst ; he kept hovering over me ; O , I can see the frightful creature now ! Well , Mother , do n't be scared , for here I am as well as ever . I found my strength began to fail me . I could not see the ship . The cold was terrible . The horrid birds were hovering , and the waves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my brothers and sisters , my dear home ; and I felt as if I could not bear my sufferings any longer , and that I had better give up . I was about turning myself over and letting myself go , when I saw a black thing at a distance which I took for a porpoise . While I was looking to see what it was , I heard the words , ' Jemmy ! Jemmy ! ' and I called out , ' Here I am ! ' This was the first sound I had been able to make from the time I had fallen over , for if I opened my mouth it filled with water . They soon had me in the boat , and , soon after , I was in the ship . Every thing was done for me , that love and kindness could do . I could not have held out much longer . It was three quarters of an hour that I had been in the water . They told me afterwards that when they found I had fallen overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sound from me , and knew not whereabouts I had fallen , the captain said it was useless to do any thing to save me . The steward and cook and one of the men were getting out the boat , but it had a bad leak in it , and the captain advised them not to go . They would not listen to him ; they said they would not give me up ; and they lowered the boat . One of the men baled all the time , and as he had nothing else to stop the leak with , he put his foot in the place , and he kept the boat above water . By the merest chance they steered directly for the spot where I was . So you see , Mother , it was their love and their courage that saved my life . " " Now , dear Mother , you will not feel anxious about me any more , for I think you may be sure that nothing worse will happen to me than has happened already on this voyage . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this , and I do n't think I shall want to go to sea again for one while . My love to father and the boys , and to Julia , and Helen , and the cat , and all inquiring friends . Glad enough I shall be to be with you all again . I never knew before , dear Mother , how much I loved you all . Your affectionate son , Jemmy . " " P.S. After my fall I could not stand for a fortnight , but they all took the kindest care of me , and I am now as well as possible . " It were vain to attempt to describe what passed in the hearts of these parents at hearing of the safety of their son after such a peril . The letter was read over and over again , and each one expressed his happiness in his own way ; little Helen wondered he should have thought of Puss , but said it was just like Jemmy . " I would not believe such a story if I had it from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing , so uncommon as to save a person that falls overboard in such a way ; and at night I never knew of it , and I have been many years at sea . Nothing but James 's presence of mind and courage saved his life ; he did the only thing that would have been of any avail ; had he attempted to swim after the ship , he would have been lost . It seems now as if the story could not be true . His presence of mind , and his courage , and his knowledge of swimming would , however , have been of little use to him , if the love of the sailors for him had not been stronger than the love of their own lives , which they put in the greatest peril to save this poor boy who , a few weeks before , was an utter stranger to them . How noble ! how beautiful ! The glory of the wise and so-called great of this world fades away as we look at this simple act of self-devoted love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angel that God has placed within us all , ever declaring , if we would listen , that love is greater than life , that there is no death to the soul . " The children , not long after , retired to bed ; the thought of dear brother Jemmy made them insensible to the storm ; all was sunshine and peace in their young hearts . The parents sat up many hours of that stormy night talking over and over again the story of their boy 's imminent danger and of his miraculous escape . The hoarse breathings of the wild storm , its alternate deep , far-off moaning and shrill piping , through every loophole and crevice in the house , sounded to these heaven-attuned souls like solemn music , and they joined in sweet accord in silent , grateful prayer to the Infinite Spirit . Frank and Harry , with their mother , were now silent for a few moments . Soon , slowly and solemnly , the bell struck one , two , three , four , five , six , and so on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to be . They kissed each other , said " Happy New Year , " and were soon fast asleep in bed .
