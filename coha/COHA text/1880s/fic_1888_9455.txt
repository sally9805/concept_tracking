Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  ( Solus and frightened . ) Now , there she goes again ! Panthers and bears and lions . I believe she really loves them . And these woods are full of them . Pa 's brought me all the way out here to see this old Frenchman 's land , wants to buy it , and found a family with her and me ; oh , why the lions would eat up all the children , like they did in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still contemplating ferns . ) Ah , precious thing , to make a bridal couch ( sighs ) !

MARGARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  ( Weeping . ) Archibald ! Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  Shoo ; I hear a bear . No ! It 's only a pioneer passing this way . A border ruffian ! Stand aside , he has a gun and may shoot . ( Up stage L. , behind trees . Enter Phin . Emmens R. 3 E. , gun on shoulder . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  No luck to-day .

And on my own land , too  --  land that I took new and fresh from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love these woods . Her little child is buried over thar , and it makes the place dear to me . I shall be buried thar , too , and my boys shall grow up , inherit this land after me . Ah , they shall have plenty ; they shall live happier and better lives than their old pioneer father , for they shall be rich and never know want , or cold , or hunger . ( Leans thoughtfully on his gun C. Gar . Dosson and Jake enter R. 3 E. Gar. , moving cautiously , crosses to C. , and taps Phin. on shoulder . ) Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Phin . Emmens , I 've got news . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  What ! news ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Yes ; I have  --  I 've got news , Phin . Emmens , news for all of us . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  News for all of us ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Yes , I have , and bad news , Phin . Emmens , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun . ) ' Taint Injuns , is it ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  No , Phin . Emmens , ' tai n't Injuns this time . It 's something worse than that . ( Sits on log L. C. ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  Worse than Injuns ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Worse ? A thousand times  --  it 's about  --  about the land  --  this land . ( Phin. intensely interested . ) Old French Pierre that bought all this land of the Hudson Bay Company nearly twenty years ago , that old French speculator that they said was dead  --  Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  He is dead  --  dead as a door nail . Been dead for nigh onto twenty years ; and that lawyer in town said , you know , if a man leaves land twenty years , why it do n't do no good if he does come back . But he 's dead . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Dead ! So we all thought when we settled down here . Dead ! Phin . Emmens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be . He is alive , and has brought some people all the way out from Boston to sell to , and he 's here . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  What ! Where ? Here ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Right here in this ' ere settlement , with some folks from Boston . He 's passin ' himself off for a doctor , disguised , kase he 's afeard of the settlers ; come to take possession and sell it before the twenty years is up . Thought we would n't know him ; but Jake knew him . ( To Jake , who nods emphatically . ) Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  He 's just as sure of it as you are standing there . War n't Jake here when he bought all this land ' round here , and did n't he pay him rent for the very cabin he lived in ? ( Jake assents . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  ( Very slowly . ) Old Pierre alive and come back ! Bad news ! Bad news ! Pierre the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was talk of his havin ' married an Injun woman back in the Walla Walla ; and the story went that havin ' grown rich he left her and her child , went abroad , and died . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Our land here was worth nothing then ; but now it has grown so valuable . He bought it for a song , the old speculator ! Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  ( Solus . ) What a fool I have been to settle on this land ! And is the Injun woman dead ! And her child ? They too left the Walla Walla , perhaps they followed the tribe to the Injun Reservation . But oh , I have been a fool , a fool ! Waiting here for a rise in land , and now it is not mine ! And the grave over thar , must I give it all up now ? Make my children beggars , and begin all over ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Look here ! It was n't worth five cents an acre when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acre . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  ( Desperately , hand on knife . ) He ought to have died , Gar . Dosson , he ought to have died ! It ai n't right for him to come back here like this , no , sir , it ai n't quite right . I 've been on this ' ere land for nigh about fifteen years , hoping to make a home ! And I 've let daylight down on the earth for fifty full acres . And now I 've got to git up and go away . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  ( Desperately . ) Look here , Phin . Emmens ! He has neither kith nor kin  --  nothing , nobody ! You 're right , he ought to have died . He oughter never come back ; by gosh , he ought n't ! He 's a sneakin ' around here disguised , ' cause he knows it 's dog mean in him . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  He ought to be made to go . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall be made to stay ! No ; do n't start , Phin . Emmens , I ai n't cleared as many acres as you have ; Gar . Dosson do n't take to work like you do . I ai n't got no young uns neither . I ai n't got no wife , but I will have  --  I will have , when I get Bricksie Jackson , the pride of this ' ere settlement . No , I ai n't agoin ' to lose my cabin and my land ! Do you see ? Do you sabe ? ( Business of picking up gun and turning face away . ) You do understand ? Now , do n't blow . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  ( Slowly puts his hand on arm . ) No blood , Gar. , shed no blood . I beg for the old man 's sake . Remember he must be a gray-haired old man now . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Old men must die as well as young men , must n't they ? If he dies ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson 's , and the other fellow 's , that 's part Indian ? Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  Would that make a murder right ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Bah ! you 've turned religious ; like John Logan , the Injun . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  No , not that , but shed no blood . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  I shed blood ! Who said I meant to shed blood ? I 'm too smart for that ! Listen ! I 've got my mind made up . We 're old neighbors , old pioneers together ; I 've been to your corn dance , and you 've been to my corn dance . I 've been to your log rollin ' and you 've been to my log rollin ' ; we 've always been friends . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  Well ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Well , since we 've always been friends , let us not fall out now . Why , man , we wo n't do nothing . I 'll only make him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't come back . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  Why , what half-breed fellow do you mean ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Why , that half-breed fellow over thar back of your field , living with his sick mother . He reads books , and I hate him . ( Looking off R. ) The very fellow that 's comin ' here now ; going to fall a tree for firewood . Shoo ! ( All stand aside in R. 3 E. , as John Logon , axe on shoulder , enters and crosses toward C. Logan , thoughtful and abstracted . ) Marg . MAR GARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  ( Aside . ) What a magnificent type of man ; a Ulysses of the old Greek ; a Hercules , as Plutarch describes him . What a founder of a race ! What a father of countries he would make ! ( Archie , jealous , draws her back behind trees . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  He seems sad ; his mother must be awful sick . I 'll speak to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Good-morning , sir . ( Going . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  But stay , I want to talk . Logan . JOHN LOGAN .  --  Ah ! Then I know there is something you want me to do . But , my duty is there ( pointing ) , with my sick mother . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  And is she so sick ? Logan . JOHN LOGAN .  --  Oh , so sick . I fear her feet are tending to the dark waters of death . Poor mother ; deserted by the white man , my father , before I saw his face . Oh , what a life of sorrow has been her 's ! But if I could only get her up so she could get out and see the maple leaves once more  --  get her out so she could smell the fresh woods , and hear the birds and squirrels chirp and chatter overhead . Oh , to get her into the warm , sweet sun once more . ( Affected , going . ) Good-morning , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ( Going . Looks on tree and sees notice . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  ( Aside to Gar. , as Logan angrily tears down notice . ) Why , I did n't see that . His Injun eye sees everything . ( Logan offers paper to Phin . Phin. awkwardly refers it to Gar. ; but as neither can read , they , in pantomime , induce him to read . ) Logan . JOHN LOGAN .  --  ( Reads excitedly . ) Notice to trespassers is hereby given that all this tract of land lying between Mollala River and Mount Hood is the property of Pierre Calvine , who hereby takes possession of the same . Signed , George Watton , Sheriff . ( Aside and going . ) Oh , this is terrible ! Heaven hangs those beautiful trees with flowers and with fruit , but man defaces them with things like this . ( Looks at notice . ) Pierre Calvine ! Why , that name I have heard my mother speak in prayers ; aye in tears , too . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know this secret . ( Exit . ) Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  How excited he is ! Dangerous , too . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  That , Phin . Emmens , is the man . Do n't start and stare now ! Why , do n't you know he 's a part Injun ? And do n't you know how every pioneer hates Injuns like pizen ? His mother is Injun , and he  --  he never had a father . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  But he is the steadiest , the best-behaved man in the settlement . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  What of that ! He 's got Injun blood in him ; and Injuns will kill . I do n't know whether he is the best-behaved man in the settlement or not , and I do n't care ; but I do know this , he 's part Injun ; and the man has no father as he knows of , and so do n't care for the world as do n't care for him . He does the job . Phin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor , he is a good man . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  This fellow that do n't know his father ? Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  You will not put him up to mischief ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  I will tell him the truth . I will tell him that this old speculator , that made his fortune off the Injuns , has at last come back ; that if he should die , why we could keep the land . And if he 's not a fool , as well as an Injun , he will know what to do . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  You will not do this  --  you dare not . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  I do dare , and I will ! Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  And you would have him murder a gray-haired old man , so that you may marry " Bricksie , " that wild torn-boy gal ? Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Ay  --  a wild torn-boy gal she is , but she suits me , and I intend to have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this puts both the old speculator and him out of the way at the same time ; and both of their lands become ours . Come , I will see to it now . ( Going . ) Ah ! What 's that ? We do n't want to be seen together . Mum 's the word , whatever happens . ( They cautiously return to corner L. Archie and Margaret down stage . ) Archie . ARCHIB ALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  ( Furious , smiting his fists . ) Did you see that ? Did you hear that , Margaret Standish Higginson ? No , do n't try to hold me up , I ai n't frightened . I 'm mad , mad , mad , mad ! That fiendish old French speculator that brought pa and us out here ! Why , I 'll strangle him the moment I get down to camp . Marg . MARGARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  Why , Archie dear , are you training for the prize ring ? Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  No ! But I am indignant . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let my pa buy this , and put these honest settlers out ? Why , I 'd go back to Boston and sell peanuts first . I 'm indignant . I 'm warlike . That 's what I am . Marg . MARGARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  Archie , you 're weak , that 's what you are  --  weak . ( He subsides . ) You are effeminate , as your father has invariably and on various opportune occasions informed me  --  weak ! You are not going to put the settlers out . This is only the contest between civilization and barbarism . It is a case of the survival of the fittest ; the fightest . The only question involved is shall the rude and half-savage children of these people populate this vast region or  --  or  --  or  --  ours , Archie ? Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  Well , I do n't care a tea-store chromo who populates it ? But I wo n't oppress the rude and ignorant settlers . And my father , a rich merchant , and a dealer in bric-a-brac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is hoop iron bric-a-brac ? ( He subsides . ) Is rags and tatters bric-a-brac ? Rich merchant , indeed ! He went South in the rebellion , and confiscated pianos for bric-a-brac . Yes I and had the legs knocked off of these pianos , then called them rosewood coffins containing our patriot dead ! Yes , and then had prayers said over them , and so had them sent to Boston , free of charge ! Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  ( Aside . ) Ah , my father 's low birth , her blue blood , Mayflower and Pilgrim Fathers come next . But , Maggie , the sentiments of a gentleman  --  Marg . MARGARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  Sentiments of a gentleman ? When you have the blood of the Pilgrim Fathers in your veins , or when you have some one in your family , Archie , who has the blood of the Pilgrim Fathers in their veins , then , Archie , then  --  and when these , our woods , are full of our precious , rosy , romping children  --  Archie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down to camp to my pa ; you are always talking about  --  about things that I do n't like , and I wo n't stay out here in the woods with you . Marg . MARGARET STANDISH HIGGINSON.  --  Archibald , Archibald , ( voices R. aside ) . Interrupted again ! I thought in this far off , wild and leafy valambrosia , at least , there would be some seclusion . But no ; then , Archie , Archie dear , come , we will go down to camp . I want to talk to you about the coming races . Archie . ARCHIBALD W. SHUTTLEBUCK.  --  ( Going off L. ) Well , then , talk about something besides filling these woods full of children . ( Exit L. Enter 3 d . R. E. Col. Joseph Jackson , cane , tall battered hat , threadbare broadcloth , military bearing and courtly manners , followed by Stumps , with crutch , pale and limping . ) Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  Come along , my little man , and do n't fret about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan , his mother buried yonder under the maples , and his father buried on the battle-fields of old Virginia . Stumps . Stumps If there was a doctor , Uncle Joe , a real jam-up good doctor , we could sell the land and have him doctor her , and she 'd get well , would n't she , Uncle Joe ? Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  ( Pats head affectionately . ) Stumps , you 've got a heart , just like your father 's was . ( Aside . ) I wonder why it is that them as have hearts never have heads ? Stumps . Stumps If we sell the land , Uncle Joe , and get a jam-up good doctor  --  Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  Oh , well now , the ager do n't kill . And then we ought not to have the ager here anyhow . Did n't have it at first ; but when men got to tearin ' down the mountains for gold , and daming the rivers with milldams  --  damn ' em  --  then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stumps . Stumps You must sell the land and get a doctor , a jam-up good doctor . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  We wo n't sell the land . Your old Uncle Joe did n't leave Virginia , after he got busted up in the wah , and come away out here to shake with the ager for nothin ' . No , no , whatever happens , Uncle Joe holds on to this . ( Stamps ground . ) It 's for you and your pretty sister Bricksie , when old Uncle Joe is no more . ( Going . Gar. steps from trees , others following . ) Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Hello , Jackson . How 's Bricksie ? Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  ( Bows stiffly , and turning away , disdains to answer . Aside . ) Corn fed ! Corn fed ! But where is your sister , Stumps ? ( Looks about . ) She was just here . The wild tomboy 's climbing a tree this moment , I 'll bet , for birds ' nests or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her ? Stumps . Stumps Why I  --  I ( hesitates and scratches head )  --  why I left her just back here a step . Oh , she 'll catch up . She 's got legs , you bet she 's got legs . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  ( Laughing . ) Yes , she has got legs . Can skin the cat , climb a tree or run a race with the toughest boy in the settlement . But she must stay with her old uncle or her brother ; do you hear ? She 's gettin ' too big to run wild in the woods . She 's got to build up the ruined old Virginia family , I tell you . Stumps . Stumps Well , she 's just here . ( Aside . ) I hope she 's clim ' the fence and got them peaches . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  ( Thoughtful , aside . ) I 've got no kids of my own . I do n't deserve any , I reckon . I inherited these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick Injun . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Well , we 've got somethin ' to say when you get done talkin ' to yourself , Jackson . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  Col. Jackson , Col. Joseph Jackson , sah . Phin . PHIN . EMMENS.  --  Well , Col. Jackson , he says a stranger has come to the settlement ( Low and earnest ) , and he 's come for to see about land . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  Wants to buy ? Well , do n't sell . Land 's going up , sah , going up . Would n't sell for fifty dollars an acre , sah . Gar . GAR DOSSON.  --  Well , now , Col. , maybe he wants to buy ; maybe to jump ? You better come down to the grocery with us and find out . Sabe ? Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  ( Thoughtfully , then suddenly . ) I 'll go . We must see about the land , sah . ( Carrie sings outside . ) Gar . GAR DOSSON. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMMENS.  --  Sings like a bird . Col. COL . JOE JACKSON .  --  Why , my niece Bricksie . A bit wild , sah . But she 's good , good as gold . And pretty ? Sweetly pretty , sah . The boys call her Bricksie because her hair is like  --  like  --  like the maple leaves in the autumn , sah . But she 's good and pretty , too , and strong as a man , sah . ( Sings again nearer them before . ) Heah ! Does n't that sound more like a boy than a girl ? Now here 's Stumps ; he 's more like a girl than she is . ( Tenderly stroking bare head . ) But it is n't his fault , poor lad , ' cause he 's a cripple and ai n't fitted for this hard life , sah ! But come , Mr. Gentlemen , we will go down and see about the land . Stumps , wait and keep with your sister . ( As going , stoops , pats head . ) Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stumps Hunky , uncle . ( Exit Col. and Gar. and party . ) My ! I wonder if she 's got them peaches ? Crosses L. to log . Enter Carrie , R. 2 E. , running and singing , suddenly stops in front of Stumps , all out of breath , and holding a peach in each hand . ) Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " Stumps , I  --  I  --  I 've got ' em . Oh , my ! I 'm all out of breath , but I 've got ' em by the holy poker ! Look at ' em , ai n't they beautiful ? And that un yourn , Stumps . ( Giving him a peach , he sits on bank and looks at it . ) And you can have both of ' em , Stumps , for I ai n't a bit hungry now . Stumps . Stumps Oh , how pretty it is , for all the world like poor sister Mable 's face the day before she died . Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry now . Stumps . Stumps No , I only want one , sister ; one 's enough . Why , sister , how you have torn 'd your dress , and your arm , too ; it 's all a'bleedin ' , why , poor sister . Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " Shoo ! Thar war a dog  --  yes , thar war a dog ! And , what do you think ? Shoo ! I thought I heard somethin ' a'comin ' , Stumps . Old Mrs. Logan , the sick Injun woman , seed me . Stumps . Stumps Why no ? Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " Yes , she did ; when I clim ' the fence , and slid down that saplin ' in the yard , there she laid on the porch on her shuck bed , a shakin ' with the ager , and the dog Bose by her side on his breast . And she was a lookin ' right straight at me . Yes , she was . Stumps . Stumps Did n't she holler and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " No , she did n't ; and that 's what 's the matter . And that 's why I do n't want to eat any peaches , Stumps .

Yes , Stumps , let 's take ' em back . ( Wipes eyes with tattered dress . ) Stumps . Stumps ( Looking at peaches ; smacks lips as about to eat ) . No ; let 's take ' em and give ' em to  --  our Uncle Joe . He 's been pretty sick ; he 's been just a'shakin ' , too ; and we ai n't been pretty good to him . Let 's take ' em to him . Carrie .

Stumps We can tell him we found ' em . Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " Found ' em , where ? Stumps . Stumps Why  --  why in the top of a cherry tree . Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " That wo n't wash ; our Uncle Joe ai n't no possum ; he 's no fool , you bet your life , and I ai n't a'goin ' to tell him any lie like that , no siree ? Stumps . Stumps Then you take ' em back . Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " I  --  I  --  I take ' em back by myself ? I take ' em back an ' hear old Bose growl and look in her holler eyes ?

Stumps . Stumps ( S tartled . ) Somebody 's comin ' ! It 's John Logan , the sick woman 's son . ( Enter John Logon , axe on shoulder , arm full of wood , comes to C. ) Logan . JOHN LOGAN .  --  ( Suddenly sees children sliding away . ) Good-evening , children ; good-evening . ( Both go slowly to him , reaching him their hands and keeping peaches in hands furthest from him . ) There ! honest little hands they are . Why , what have you got in your other hands ? cherries ? Carrie . CARRIE JACKSON .  --  " ( Very much excited , talks fast . ) Yes , that 's it , Mr. John Logan , I like cherries , I do ; I like cherries and cowcumbers and tomatusses and  --  and cherries .
