ARTICLE VIII. - IMMORTALITY AND EVOLUTiON . Is it possible for a man convinced of the truth of the law of Evolution , to believe in individual immortality ? The scientific specialist as a rule answers the question decidedly in the negative . The man whose one desire is to keep up with the ideas usually called advanced , accepts his dictum , and talks contemptuously of the superstition of the past . The truly broad and catholic thinker , a George Eliot or an Emerson , is driven to a position of unstable equilibrium and negative doubt , practically equivalent to nubelief . The intelligent Christian holds the two truths side by side in his mind , carefully preventing any contact between them . That there is yet another possible position , which views the belief in a future life as positively strengthened by a clear comprehension of the law of progress , it is the object of the present paper to show . With the alleged contradictions between Evolution and Immortality , this is not the place to deal . They all rest on the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-existence of mind as a separate entity , and hence to the impossibility of its existence after the dissolution of the body . How groundless is this assumption , may best be shown by one or two quotations . " The utmost possibility for us is an interpretation of the process of things as it presents itself to our limited consciousness , " says Spencer . " Carried to whatever extent , the inquiries of the psychologist do not reveal the ultimate nature of mind . " " The relation of thought to a material brain is no metaphysical necessity , " writes J. S. Mill , " but simply a constant co-existence within the limits of observation There is , therefore , in science , no evidence against the immortality of the soul , but that negative evidence which consists in the absence of evidence in its favor . " Leaving , then , all attempt at the reconcilement of two things which can not be directly compared , let us see what results from considering the two sciences as complemental , and // bearing to each other something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , it must be clearly understood that by immortality we mean to imply continuance of individual conscious existence after death . The word has shared the fate of many others , in being appropriated of late years by a school of thinkers who desire to keep the religious emotions which have formed the noblest incentives to action in the past , while sacrificing the definite intellectual beliefs which have formed the basis of those emotions . But the attenuated theory which sees in the belief in immortality only an assertion of the somewhat trite fact that the influence of our lives is destined to be unending , is not that which we shall adopt in the present paper . We accept the Christian hypothesis in its fullest significance ; and this it is which we desire to study in the light of scientific truth . To begin with , we must postulate the fact that law , in this visible , tangible world , is continuous . Phenomena vary , but force is constant , and it is on this truth that all our science depends . Destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rational , inductive science . Now the phenomena of that other world whose reality is claimed by the believer , are manifestly separated by a sharp line of division from those of the visible . If we find no trace of the action of familiar laws ,  --  if these novel phenomena are apparently governed by entirely new forces , having no continuity with the old ,  --  the unity of our cosmic theory will be destroyed . Our belief in the super-sensible world will not indeed be annihilated ; but we shall hold it in opposition to all analogy , and contrary to the principles of inductive science . It will not surprise us to find that there is contradiction between these two departments of science . All the conditions lead us to expect it . Investigated at different times in the world 's history ; the one a belief of eighteen hundred years standing , the other a theory of yesterday ; the one held with the greatest ardor of faith by those whom the world calls mystics , the other first formulated by men whose contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical was barely veiled ; each believed for years by it // adherents to be radically incompatible with the other , each viewed with distrust and dislike by the other , and thus pursued with absolute independence ; it would not indeed be surprising were they to be proved incompatible , nay , antagonistic . But should we find that these independent and hostile investigations had each reached one aspect of the same fundamental law ; that each science , incompleto in itself , found its complement in the other , and that , when brought together , they showed a wonderful unity and harmony-then , indeed , although in one sense , we should have no additional proof for either , we should trust , with wonderfully increased assurance , the validity of our conclusions in both . The older theory of Evolution represented its path , in so far as we can trace it , as a straight line . Development was orderly , gradual , unbroken . Of late years , however , it is granted by nearly all thinkers that the true expression of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a line , continuous indeed , but sharply deflected from its original direction in at least one point of its course . Such deflection can not be accounted for by anything in the normal sequence of cause and effect ; it must be due to the action of some anomalous intrusive force . Concerning the nature of such force , we need at present say nothing , we need only postulate its existence . Once granted the substance of which the present universe is composed , existing as a nebulous mass , and the gradual evolution proceeds with all harmony until an advanced stage of development is reached . The whole inorganic world , in all its wonderful complexity of structure , can be accounted for by the orderly and gradual working of natural laws alone . Suddenly there manifests itself an unprecedented phenomenon-a phenomenon out of the line of previous development , unaccounted for by any force hitherto recognized . Life appears upon the globe , and such appearance must necessarily cause a deflection of the straight line of development That science has , to the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now acknowledged even by those who were once the most devoted adherents of that doctrine . Between the simplest germ of living protoplasm // and the most complex mineral , there is a great gulf fixed . It is impossible for the inorganic by any effort of its own to bridge that chasm . The change can only be accounted for by the action of some new intrusive force , whose nature we can not divine . Its result is , however , evident and undisputed . Matter , by its means , is lifted into correspondence with a new environment , infinitely more complex and heterogeneous than was the former one . The law now continues , with no break , even apparent , until we reach a point where theories diverge  --  the point of the introduction of conscious mind . The old idea that man was the result of a special creation has been discarded as regards his physical nature ; but concerning his mental and moral character , the question is still mooted . Many , even among men of science , think that the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted for as being in the straight line of animal development , and differing from brute intelligence in degree but not in kind . They claim that here , for the second time , we must postulate the entrance of an intrusive force , and a resulting deflection of the line of development . We can not here attempt to discuss this question . Whatever its solution , it does not , as we have before shown , alter materially the nature of the problem before us . Here , then , is the last word of scientific evolution . It has brought us from the first appearance of matter as a nebulous and chaotic mass , to the summit of human intelligence . It has shown us the action of the law of continuity , mysteriously in harmony with the sudden lifting of matter into correspondence with an environment to which it was otherwise dead . But its revelation is in its nature fragmentary . It answers none of our questions concerning the destiny of our race or of ourselves ; it does not seek to explain the anomalous phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces the action of the one upon the other . It tells us nothing concerning the source of these external forces , the nature of the developing substance , or the cause of the development . Leaving then for the present the consideration of the facts of physical science , let us pass in review certain alleged truths // concerning man 's psychical nature . The ground here changes materially . Instead of studying development from genus to genus , we must now confine our attention to the genus homo . Putting on one side the phenomena of matter , we direct our thoughts to the consideration of mind . Our knowledge has so far been reached through observation ; henceforth , it must rest ultimately on the testimony of consciousness . The fundamental* belief of spiritual science viewed from the human side , is that , at a certain point of man 's development , there enters an intrusive force , working an unprecedented change in his nature . This force , which can not be reached in the continuous line of natural development , is lifegiving . It transforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which necessitate adjustment to new external relations . It brings him into correspondence with a new environment . The longer this correspondence continues the more does the spiritual nature of man advance in heterogeneity , in definiteness , in complexity . In other words , he is brought into contact with an environment which bears to the sphere of organic life such a relation as does that sphere to the kingdom of the inorganic . Although the entrance of this force is cataclysmic , its action is gradual , its first beginnings often barely perceptible . The correspondence is at its best imperfect and partial in the present life , but in so far as it is real , it must be imperishable , for it exists between the organism and an environment which is spiritual , and hence not subject to the laws of decay which govern the material world . The man whose nature has been thus transformed , who has entered on the spiritual life , has within him something which material , physical death can not conquer . He is a partaker of immortality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , is sufficiently startling . It may well excite our suspicions from its apparent want of scientific analogy . Here , then , it will be well to pause , and compare the result of our investigations in the two directions of physical science and objective psychology . * The treatment of this point is borrowed from Drummond 's " Natural Law in the Spiritual World . " // Sept. , To a certain point , we are struck by the identity of law . The New Testament writers , from whom the modern Christian theories are all derived , certainly had never heard of the Principle of Evolution , and had no idea that in their statements concerning the life that is from above , they were tracing the action of a scientific law , to be discovered centuries after their death ; yet such is the case . The phenomena differ ; but the law is the same , and the account of that new life which is in Christ gains fresh force as we see how perfectly it agrees with Mr. Spencer 's definition of all life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and how exactly its action follows the law of Evolution . Moreover , the complemental nature of the two sciences forces itself upon us . Where physical science ends , spiritual science begins . The former traces the development of living matter till it brings us to the human race . That race manifests phenomena so striking and peculiar that we are justified in concluding that here physical evolution has reached its limit , is contented with its work , and abruptly suspends its action . But is that work complete ? Is man , with all his varied faculties , his exquisitely adjusted organism , an end worth all this tremendous expenditure of force and material ? For the answer we can look nowhere but to the testimony of man himself ; and that testimony unanimously answers " No . " If the complex organism serve no end beyond itself , then the whole scheme and method of evolution has ended in a gigantic failure . Perhaps this is the truth . Perhaps a stoical agnosticism is destined to be the end of the researches of the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a science which comes to us vested with the authority of ages , which alone has given to humanity the faith and the courage to pursue those very investigations whose end may be thus suicidaL The message of this science is no uncertain one . The action of the Law of Evolution is not , it tells us , a line broken abruptly off and leading nowhere . When physical development is complete , the law does not end ; it simply transfers its action to another and a higher sphere . A new direction is given to the line , and in that direction our straining eyes can trace it for a short distance before the veil of physical death // conceals its further action from our sight . The human organism , with all its varied and subtle adjustments , is yet dead . As to the inert elements of hydrogen , oxygen , carbon , and nitrogen , there enters an informing force , indefinable , intangible , yet real , lifting these dead elements into relation with an environment which is in truth , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spirit of man , with its elements of thoughts , volitions , emotions , there comes a power , a life , indefinable , yet actual , lifting these elements into relation with that which to them is indeed supernatural , showing the possibility of development unending , giving earnest of infinite environments with which in turn the expectant spirit may come in contact . But it may be urged this scientific analogy , however plausible , is misleading . The conditions here are changed . The relations of the spiritual to the natural differ in many ways from those of the organic to the inorganic . For instance , there is the great distinction , that while the chemical elements are inert and unconscious , the spirit of man must acquiesce in the action of this new spiritual force . Moreover , your theory degrades most men , after all , to the level of the brute , and leaves them with no hope beyond the grave ; for on your own showing , this higher , spiritual life is granted only to a few . In answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary laws of evolution that as it continues and changes its action from one sphere to another , its workings become more compound . The law must adjust itself to the complex conditions which its own action has brought about . Once granted the evolution of conscious life and the power of self-knowledge , it is inevitable that the organism should , of its own choice , acquiesce in the action of the higher force . The complication of the problem does not destroy the action of the law . Concerning the second objection , it is enough to urge once more the fact that the silence of science , and her failure to corroborate theologic beliefs does not necessarily disprove such beliefs . Our only object is to show the scientific accuracy of the statement , " He that hath the Son hath life . " The law of the Survival of the Fittest seems indeed to accord wonderfully with the statement in the latter half of the same verse ; // but our work is constructive , not destructive , and our aim to discuss , not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to that belief in individual permanence after death which is the crucial point in our discussion . Here , surely , we have reached a dogma thoroughly unscientific . We find in the dealings of nature no hint at the perpetuation of the individual . In the struggle to reach the highest type , she wipes whole races off the face of the earth with inexorable indifference . She uses each species as a step , by which she may mount nearer to her goal . Each individual carries the development of the race a fraction farther on , and then sinks into nothingness . It would seem that a sublime arrogance alone could inspire in man the absurd idea of an immortal destiny for his own personal self . Moreover , we find no hint in the whole course of nature at so extraordinary and unprecedented a phenomenon as existeiice apart from this present material organism . The most accurate and definite testimony coud hardly make us put faith in such existence ; how much less , then , can we do so , when we have in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them every mark ot poetic legends , framed in a credulous age , for the satisfaction of man 's unreasoning discontent . At first sight , these considerations seem overwhelming . But , before condemning completely the hope of immortality as a futile and insane dream of a restless brain , let us look at the subject a little longer . We have tried to show that the length of life is a simple inference from its quality , and that the belief in existence after death is a corollary from belief in a spiritual life for man now . Scientific proof of such life is , of course , impossible . No effort on the part of a lower species can ever enable it to foretell the nature or even the real existence , of the next higher . The reasoning must be presumptive only , and demonstration must ultimately rest on testimony . No argument concerning the efficiency of such testimony is here in place . Simply stating that it exists , and has by the majority of mankind been accepted as trustworthy , we proceed to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by science . We notice first , as we have done before , the invariable // appearance of new laws to govern new conditions . As under the principles of Evolution , matter reaches higher stages of development , each increase in complexity demands the appearance of some new controlling force . The laws of Biology do not exist until the development of the living beings which they are to govern ; the laws of political economy and of historical progress have no force as applied to any race of animals lower than man . For what evolution produces , it must provide , and lower laws are constantly overruled and counteracted by higher . It is urged that the law of Death is universalman as well as brute must submit to it . In the first place , the statement that the brute perishes completely is a pure assumption . Moreover , we have no right to say that there can be no life whose nature is such as to enable the organism to survive physical death . All matter is subject to the law of gravitation . Studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to be disregarded ; yet the plant grows upward toward the sky . Death is not violated ; it is superseded by eternal life . When we consider carefully the nature of man , we are forced to the conclusion that here we find such new conditions as must demand new laws to govern them . In the first place , man is apparently the culminating point , the finished product , of organic evolution . This is no mere assumption . We are driven to the inference by the unprecedented phepomena which accompany his appearance upon the scene . The evolution of conscious mind would seem to be the final effort of the laws governing matter . When the principle of development has produced an organism which can recognize its own existence , and comprehend the forces which brought it here , we feel that it has in a sense mastered these forces , and that it is time for some new power to grant it scope for further development elsewhere . This subjective probability is corroborated by the objective fact that nature , having apparently perfected her type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . We can trace no particular variety within the genus oyster ; when nature descries an advance she involves a new type ; but between the savage and the European , how vast a difference ! // Development from genus to genus is apparently superseded by development within the genus . The growth of Personality is indeed by many regarded as the fundamental principle of Evolution . We can see foreshadowings of it in some of the higher animals , as dogs and horses ; but among all the varied species on our globe , it can be said of man alone that no one unit exactly resembles any other . The principle of increase of individuality governs all historical development . From the passive absolutism of the East to the democracy of America ; from the rigid art of the Egyptians to the portraits of Millais ; from the Iliad and Odyssey to the poems of Browning the underlying law of growth is that of differentiation . The principle holds when we consider advance in human civilization alone no less than in passing from one genus of animals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new order of things . It has developed a number of conscious individuals , each differing from each . The old laws are inadequate to govern such anomalous phenomena . By all scientific analogy , we expect a new law to appear , which shall in some peculiar sense apply to the ifidividual : and we claim that the requirements of the problem are satisfied by no result , save that which man reached centuries ago by a radically different method  --  the law of individual immortality . For this personality , so complex and delicate in its mechanism , can not be satisfactorily developed within the brief space of seventy years . Unless we are to retrograde and return to the old principle of social as distinguished from individual development , we must believe in the possibility for every man of further growth , after that catastrophic disturbance which we call death . Man without immortality is incomplete . There is , in each individual of the race , a desire for perfection , a need for something higher than he can attain in this life . If the destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous scientific anomaly ever known . Here , for the first time , we find faculties with no objective correlates . The existence of respiratory organs points inexorably and scientifically to air that can be breathed ; shall we say that man 's consciousness of faculties that strain after a spiritual atmos // phere points to a simple delusion ? It is improbable that , as is sometimes said , these aspirations imply merely future social development . They are too definite and personal , and moreover , as we have just shown , such development would be a scientific retrogression . They must point to individual perfection , and such perfection can be attained only in a life continued after death . The idea of immortality violates no law . The new conditions which its novel phenomena necessitate are wonderfully in harmony with the action of the law of evolution in the natural world . For what , essentially , is this spiritual life , which , it is claimed , is iu its nature eternal ? It is , as we have shown , the bringing the organism into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting . In this life , the correspondence is indeed imperfect ; but so far as it exists , it can not be subject to annihilation , dependent on the dissolution of the perishable body . Correspondence with an eternal environment is in its very nature unending , and t*nrwli*j*is in this world begun to live the spiritual life , can not perish , but must *ik*mv*r . Thus we reach our conclusion . The relation of the theory of Evolution to the doctrine of immortality is obscure and involved . A direct comparison of the two sciences , is , of necessity , vague and unsatisfactory , and leaves us much where it found us . It is only when we compare the conclusions and the fundamental laws of each , that we see how wonderfully the two are complemental , and in what harmony they unite in giving us a scheme of existence , incomplete , it is true , but coherent , scientific , and r*lear . We have not indeed proved the truth of immortality . Such proof could only be gained by direct testimony from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come must always rest upon the Resurrection of Christ . But we have tried to show that the idea is in wonderful harmony with the other workings of nature . Without it , the theory of Evolution is incomplete , fragmentary , hopeless ; but when this complemental truth is added , the theory gains a scientific completeness and a noble unity . We conclude , in short , that the belief in individual immortality is the legitimate sequence of faith in the law of Eyolution. //
