I. OUR civil war in its progress presented many interesting problems , both military and political . Some of these ( mainly the military ) were solved by the actual experiences of the war , but a number of the most valuable of those having political aspects , have not , it appears to me , received the amount of attention which their intrinsic importance demands or the welfare of the country should exact . Such of them as were not solved by the immediate succession of events , as were most of the military questions , appear either to have passed without notice at the time or to have been forgotten or neglected since . It is sufficiently apparent that so great a convulsion , involving so many highly intelligent people , characterized by such tremendous occurrences , and leading to such momentous results , both foreign and domestic , lasting through four years of unrelenting war and many more years of internecine strife and bitterness , could not have invaded our history without displaying to our attention many most valuable and novel lessons , the careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inure greatly to the benefit of our posterity and the stability of the government we transmit to them . It is my purpose in this brief paper to invite what attention I may to two or three of these questions which , so far , we seem to have little considered . It is hardly . necessary to say that , although the real and immediate cause of our Civil War was the manifest purpose of the minority of our people to extend the area of slavery , the avowed principle on which the war was waged was the old and long-controverted doctrine of State sovereignty and State rights . The first of these questions has been completely , and the latter in a limited sense , settled by the result of the war , and it is no longer // profitable to discuss them in any relation they bear to the integrity of the government ; but so violent a solution of questions inter* woven with all our social and political institutions has occasioned so much and such widespread bitterness of feeling on the part of the losers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of those who were successful , that there was much danger that the natural reaction might carry us so far in the readjustment of political relations that we should inflict on the country political heresies as fatal to the perpetuity of our institutions as any of those which now lie buried in the graves of so many of the best and noblest of our countrymen . We have learned , and have overcome , the disadvantages of the doctrine of State rights . Would it not have been well , also , to follow this by some more study than we have given to its advantages ? It is a little curious , at first glance , to notice that that section of our countrymen who planted themselves upon the extremest doctrines of State sovereignty , and founded a government upon the principle that each of its States possessed complete control of its own affairs , even to the extent of separating itself from the general government without assigning a reason for doing so , had actually within two years almost annihilated these State governments by assuming a control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Government in Washington , nor tolerated by the people of the North . The future historian of the war may , perhaps , find the best explanation of the breakdown of the South in the fact that the Southern people , in the early part of the struggle , had , by their own hands , almost destroyed what they professedly waged war to uphold . It is equally curious to note that , in the North , wliere theories of State sovereignty almost the precise opposite of those maintained in the South were held by a large majority of the people , the State governments , from the very beginning of hostilities , steadily and rapidly increased in power and influence , until , long before the conclusion of the war , they occupied a position of com-* manding importance in the conduct of national affairs , unknown to their history theretofore . So far from any attempt being made to impair their constitutional powers or restrict their rights of local self government , it was soon discovered that in war , as in peace , for raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully , as for administering affairs in profound peace , they were equally admirable and equally efficient instrumentalities . We can realize now , as probably many of us could not then , the important fact that the general government , by recognizing this truth promptly and acting upon it consistently , alone acquired the power to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion . In every detail of the service , from the movements of armies in battle down to the supply of the smallest article for the comfort and contentment of the soldier , the hands of the State government were everywhere felt and their good influence everywhere made manifest . They stood by us alike in sorrow and misfortune as in victory and in triumph . But for them our ranks would have been thinner and our spirits lower many times during those long years of bloody strife . In war , as in peace , our State governments are our sure reliance , and it would certainly show little wisdom in the people of this country , in this or any succeeding generation , to lend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful functions of the State governments under the Constitution of the United States . We have dealt thoroughly with the attempt of some of the State governments to overthrow the rightful authority of the United States . Will it not be well for us now to be equally careful that the rightful authority of the State governments be not invaded in like manner ? And in all deference and respect , I venture to suggest that the great source of apprehension in this direction does not seem to me to lie so much in any likely action of the legislative or executive departments of the general government as in the interpretations of constitutional and statute law by the courts of the United States , and through decisions , their gradual and almost unobserved usurpation of the powers of the State courts . Surely the extent of the jurisdiction of the United States courts and the detail to which it has been carried , find no parallel in the history of those courts for the fifty years before the Civil War . It seems rather hard to comprehend how a State government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subordinate court of the United States , by its own process , can seize a railroad within the limits of the State and completely remove it and its employees from State control . And this , notwithstanding the fact that the railroad exists // oniy by permission of the State , and subject to such limitations and conditions as its charter specifies . Not only are the persons employed on the road , as well as the road itself , removed thus summarily from the control of its creator , the State , but it is operated by the court within the State limits by its own employees whether the State consents or not . The State creates a corporation which is permitted to exist and do business on certain specified conditions . The United States courts seize and operate it without consent of its master and absolutely in viola* tion of the conditions and limitations under which the State con* sented to allow it to live at all . Again , the roads thus possessed and operated by the United States courts , together with the armies of employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and the police administration of the State altogether different from that held by other people and property in the State . In case of riot among railroad employees or others , in any way affecting the safety or convenience of the railroad , the United States Marshal promptly calls for a force of the regular army and the War Department may and does so order without the request or consent of the State Legislature or the Governor , and so a portion of the State , of its citizens , and of their property are completely removed from the jurisdiction of the State , and an armed police force introduced to apply other rules and measures than those of the State , and directed by other authority , to keep the peace among its citizens . This procedure makes the idea of States rights and local self-government somewhat hazy . No doubt plenty of decisions based on good law can be produced to justify this and like proceedings . It is in human nature that any organization of men possessed of power over their fellow men will seek by honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret the law creating it is an immense temptation to the judges , even if only to magnify the dignity and influence of the court itself . If there be really danger that the authority of the State governments may be too much restricted for the free and unobstructed exercise of their legitimate powers under the Constitution of the United States ( the benefit of which was so deeply felt and admitted during the war ) , it might be respectfully suggested to the United States courts to try , for a time , the opposite method of determining the extent and character of their jurisdiction ; that is , that they study the law for the purpose of // determining how little , rather than how much , they can absorb of the power and authority of the State courts , and the rightful authority of the State , without neglect of their own obligations . This reverse process of examining and interpreting the law would at once make clear how wide apart would be the results reached by the two methods , and both reached by equally sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive at a conclusion equally removed from both extremes , and , perhaps , also , more conducive to the general welfare and content . II . Another question equally important and perhaps more difficult to solve , was left to us by the war and by the events which followed . That question is , how we can absorb and assimilate into our social and political body the population both of foreign nationalities and of distinct races among ourselves ? The former have always , the latter only recently , been endowed with the rights of citizenship , but neither of them prepared , by knowledge and experience , to discharge such obligations intelligently . It is a well-known fact that all the peoples who have founded and consolidated great empires , since history began , have possessed one peculiar faculty , the faculty of assimilating populations , of digesting , as it were , the peoples they acquired by conquest or treaty , and of turning into citizens like themselves the almost infinite variations of mankind which in any manner fell under their influence . This peculiar power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great peoples from the beginning . Of the two peoples of the civilized world of to-day who possess it , we are one , and so long as it remains unimpaired and in full force we may look to a future of prosperity and progress . When it ceases to act , we may understand without fear of mistake that we have reached the zenith of our fortunes and must begin to contemplate our certain decline . Until lately we have detected no signs of weakness or decay . We have welcomed to our shores all strangers , from whatever country or in whatever numbers they chose to come , and we have conferred upon them , to such an extent , the rights and privileges we ourselves possess , that absolutely the result of popular elections in many of our Western States is determined often by the votes of foreign immigrants not citizens of the United States ; that is , of foreigners who have only declared their intention to become // citizens , and actually thereby , by the laws of these States , do become voters after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their naturalization as citizens of this country . So far we have been able to assimilate them , and to make , out of the native of every country in the civilized world , an American in idea and in feeling . All have adapted themselves ( or did so before the war ) to the conditions around them without much effort , and it is not too much to say that many of our best and most valuable citizens have come to us , in times not remote , from countries alien to us in blood , in language , and in institutions . Such were the conditions prior to the Civil War . Unfortunately , however , since the war , and attracted by its successful issue , European immigrants have poured themselves upon us in far greater numbers , but of far less respectability and worth , than any of their predecessors . All varieties of the criminal , and the political and social agitator , and the lowest creatures of poverty and ignorance have been encouraged and helped by their own governments to precipitate themselves into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The agitators , whether Socialists , Anarchists , Nihilists , or whatever they call themselves , have promptly thrust themselves to the front : they infest every public meeting and enliven its proceedings by their presence and their oratory . It is quite manifest by the riotous and , at times , murderous transactions , which have found , so far , their extremest development at Chicago , that our old system of assimilation can not be applied to such creatures as these . If we desire to appropriate and digest them , we must devise some newer and speedier method of doing so than the old methods that have sufficed in the past . The constantly increasing hordes of such people who are invading us every day , without an attempt on our part to resist , or even to discriminate among them , make it quite apparent that we have no time to lose if we would stay evils which threaten the overthrow , or , at least , the demoralization of our social and political organization . There is no doubt , I think , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time domiciled in this country view with even greater anxiety ( because they better know the dangers than we do ) this constantly increasing influx of political and social outlaws and of hopeless paupers , and would gladly // concur in any measures to restrain if not wholly to arrest it . The first sentiment we must get rid of ( and it will be hard , remembering how we have flaunted it in the face of mankind so long ) is that " America is the asylum of the oppressed of all nations , " unless we couple it with what is much more a truism , " and also the refuge of the scoundrels and paupers of Europe . " Late events in various parts of the country make it apparent that we must call a halt in this unjustifiable and most impolitic invitation to utterly ignorant or destitute foreigners , to sit down , unwashed and unshorn , to our banquet of liberty and self-government , at which they immediately assume the foremost position and announce and respond to every sentiment . III . More especially should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff until we have digested or in some way disposed of the great mass of ignorant people of a distinct race whom we already have in our midst , and whom the outcome of the war has left in such new and perplexing relations to us . As we ourselves brought these poor people or their ancestors to this country against their wish , and have placed them in such unfamiliar and irritating connections with their old neighbors , we surely owe to them such effort to settle them among us as citizens , and to make more satisfactory their status among the people around them , as our own action toward them imposes on us . Certainly , this duty is far higher and more binding upon us than the obligations of hospitality to such crowds of emigrants as are invading us from Europe . It happened , unfortunately , no doubt , that this great increase of emigration to this country began about the time we so suddenly endowed four millions of colored people with all the rights of citizenship . Certainly , it made the tax upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented to impose , but it has been done , and now we must dedde whether our duty , as well as our direct interest , does not demand that we provide first for those we have created citizens from among our own population , if , indeed , any choice is left us . The negroes are here , and by our own act endowed by law with all the rights we ourselves possess , though also by our own act they had been unfitted for self-gov // eminent by centuries of slavery and enforced ignorance . Extraordinary circumstances , and what seemed imperative necessity , forced ns to bestow on them the rights of citizenship , and common justice to them , as well as our own direct interest , demands that we put forth every effort to fit them for the duties we have imposed upon them . It is a great task in itself , only just begun , and of doubtful issue still , and , at times , of grievous discouragement . There are portions of this continent we live on and some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be better for us and for mankind that we should possess , and were they without population , or with such a population as ours , it would be well , perhaps to acquire them , but certainly not till we have arrested or greatly limited the dangerous and troublesome hordes of emigrants from abroad , and placed in a far more satisfactory condition the large number of new citizens so recently added to our population in the Southern States . If we accomplish this task , we can approach the acquisition of new regions and the assimilation of additional foreign elements with some assurance of success . If we fail , we shall be confronted with difficulties greater than any we have yet overcome . Actual necessity demands that we put a stop to any addition to our burden by immigration from abroad , at least until we have made far more satisfactory disposition of what we have . Iv . There is another singular result developed by the war , which may have such wide-spread influence on the country that , it appears to me , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any ) be clearly shown . I state it with much diffidence , and only because it can be easily verified , and because it involves questions in which we are alike interested in all parts of the country . I disclaim any purpose whatever , other than an honest wish to seek and examine into all that our history has offered us which appears to deserve serious consideration . Because a truth may not be agreeable to hear , it is hardly the part of wisdom in a clear-sighted , intelligent people to ignore it or put it aside , or even to have any feeling concerning it , except the wish to remedy what is evil and perpetuate what is good . This singular fact was presented for our consideration at the conclusion of our Civil War . We had passed through four years of a great and bloody war ; a convulsion which upheaved the // nation from the very foundations ; in which our social and political institutions were at stake and in danger of complete shipwreck ; a war which invaded every household and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man , woman and child was personally interested . Such a struggle commanded and obtained the best efforts of everybody , regardless of age , sex or condition . It is needless to say that the efforts were put forth and the sacrifices freely made . For us the war ended successfully , and in its progress the men best fitted to accomplish the work were naturally produced , and did it wisely and well , but when the victory was won we found this curious , and it seems to me , significant fact The President was a Western man , the Vice-President a Western man , the Chief Justice of the United States a Western man , the Speaker of the House a Western man , the Secretary of the Treasury a Western man , the Secretary of War a Western man , the Secretary of the Interior a Western man , the PostmasterGeneral a Western man , the Attorney-General a Western man , the General of the Army a Western man , the Lieutenant-General of the Army a Western man , the Admiral of the Navy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in its civil and in its military departments , had , during this tremendous struggle , passed into the hands of men from the West . I repeat that I have no purpose whatever in setting forth these facts , easy to be verified , except the honest desire that if there be meaning in them , if they are really of consequence to us as a people , we may recognize and act upon them . It is the fact that , daring our Civil War , the most tremendous convulsion that is recorded in history , New England produced neither a great soldier nor a statesman of commanding influence . Several explanations of a result so surprising have been suggested , but none which would appear to be satisfactory . Among the more plausible of them is the suggestion that some of these high functionaries were natives of the Eastern States ; but this fact hardly furnishes a sufficient explanation , unless it can also be truly said that the ten or twenty years these men lived among a people so different in modes of thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no impression upon them , and that they attained the same development they would have done had they remained amidst the surroundings and associations of their youth . Of course such a proposition // could be overthrown by the experience of every man to whom it was applied . My own consideration of the subject , which I give briefly and with much diffidence , has led me to inquire whether in the common school system of education , which has been long enough in operation in the Eastern States to bear full fruits , but which has only been introduced into the West in comparatively recent times , we may not find some clue to so strange a fact . Is it not true , that such sameness of books , of modes of teaching , and of men who teach , as prevails in our public schools , and must always prevail while the present organization and management is maintained , tends directly to that uniformity in habits of mind and modes of thought which eliminates all originality and leaves the subjects of such teaching with so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and general advancement becomes next to impossible ? Is it not true that the law of our creation is infinite diversity , mental and physical , and equally true that our system of common school education directly substitutes uniformity ? Is it wise to make systems of education so uniform in all their details that there is danger that they will turn out men as much alike as buttons from a factory ? Is the development of communities and States or of individuals the object of education ? Are not the results of such a system much in the nature of hotel soups , which have such sameness of flavor that no man can tell whether the essential element is fish , flesh , or fowl ? General education carried to the extremest possible limit is not only of all things desirable , but in a government like ours it is essential to its welfare and perpetuity . The question here is not as to the increase and extension of educational facilities and advantages , but whether as now they shall be made to conform to one standard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means stagnation , or whether they shall be carefully organized with a view to general diversity in books and in modes of teaching . Is it better for us , in view of our individual or national development , that we should all look at the subjects presented for our consideration from the same or from many different standpoints ? I beg to be understood as not offering any solution of this question . I am not at all confident myself that I have even indicated the way thereto . I do hope , however , that what I have said may serve to invite more inquiry than seems // to have been made , into a subject which certainly , on cursory examination , appears of sufficient interest to command the attention of those most capable of discussing it . Above all things , however , such a problem should be approached in the true spirit of inquiry , without prejudice and without reluctance to face the results and to tell them openly . V. But perhaps the most unhappy legacy which our Civil War has left us , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a sin which is growing daily , and which threatens soon to transfer all the political business of the country into the hands of those least qualified to do it . It is both strange and discouraging that the high privilege of taking direct part in the government of one 's own country  --  a privilege for the possession of which great wars have been waged and whole countries laid waste-should have come to be regarded with so much indifference that , like the air we breathe , we trouble ourselves to inquire neither whence it came nor whither it is going . Yet , scarce twenty years have passed since the mass of our people were exposing their lives on the field of battle to maintain the integrity of the government and the rights of its citizens . Among the foremost of these men are some , many , indeed , of the most grievous of these sinners . Have we the right to complain of corruption in our politics when the best of us subordinates the exercise of this high privilege , even in its simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no end except personal gain or enjoyment ? Can we long satisfy our consciences or hope to preserve our institutions , if we studiously neglect or contemptuously disregard privileges and duties essential to their existence ? Not thus did those who took active part in the field during our Civil War learn the obligations of duty . Whilst the world only contemplates the victory , as it regards other great successes of government , these soldiers knew how the results were achieved , how the victory was won . They knew that not alone to the bravery and skill of our troops in the battle was the triumph due , but to that careful attention in advance to every detail of service , and to that conscientious performance of the smallest duties , which brought our armies into the battle in the best condition to win it . How comes it that the rules of conduct // which gave us the victory in war should so soon have been forgotten or neglected in the administration of the government they preserved , even by many of the very men who profited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful in peace by neglecting our most important duties as citizens , than in war by neglecting the first duty of the soldier ? IDo we really believe that our administrative machinery can be honestly and efficiently conducted by the most ignorant and corrupt , any more that we believe that battles can be won by the incompetent and cowardly of the army ? How can it be explained that the very men who faced death in a hundred battles merely to preserve their govern - ment and the institutions built up under it , are willing at once to trust its administration to people whom they know to be unfit or corrupt , or both ? Politics , the daily history of our country , the embodiment of its wishes , hopes , and purposes , and which , in days not remote , furnished the highest and most honorable career to the capable and ambitious men of this country , and which was believed to be , and actually is , the highest secular vocation among us , has come , by the mere fact of the neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their civil duties , to be considered a career to be avoided , rather than sought by those best qualified to pursue it successfully . There appears to exist no longer in this country much respect for high office , nor for the men who hold it . The " talents " of the IRomans , coined and stamped , are , of necessity , in such a condition as this , far more efficacious in securing public office than the talents supplied by nature and made useful by culture . The annual salary is now the measure of the importance of a public office , not great duties and high responsibilities . Naturally all this follows the low respect with which so many of our best citizens treat their political duties and the scarcely concealed scorn and suspicion with which they view those of their fellow citizens more conscientious than they in the matter . To say nothing of the higher duty of patriotism in its large application to the nation , it would be naturally supposed that municipal government , in which every citizen is directly and personally interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command a certain amount of active effort from those who are the victims of it . It is not pleasant nor satisfactory to witness the slow , but not less certain , confiscation of property which is going on in our large cities through the operations of a municipal government whose officers // are nominated by the irresponsible and ignorant of both political parties , the election of either of which is alike injurious to the interests of good government . It takes but little observation to discover to how low a condition our politics have sunk in the estimation of the people , and to what evil consequences such a downward drift is carrying us . It is the fault of the intelligent and honest among us that this deplorable state of facts obtains . From the top and not from the bottom come the evils which are degrading us , and which threaten , if not corrected , to destroy everything that is admirable or valuable in our government . How to reach this evil and to abate it is certainly worth the consideration of the American citizen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
