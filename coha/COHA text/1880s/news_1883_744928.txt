txt On Friday a romance was consummated away up in the Adriondacks which , in tangled plot and novel details , claim equality with the , strangest of the many fabulous Christmas tales that are just now being printed . The story is told by a man who came to this town to-day from Sageville , Hamilton County . Ferd , Roderick , a young man of 25 or 26 years , of burly frame , but with a certain manly charm in his rough ways , the son of a popular old guide up at Indian Lake , has been confined in the Hamilton County Jail , at Sageville , for the past four or five months , awaiting trial on the charge of stealing a pair of horses from a farmer of that county . Every . Sunday afternoon the Rev. Arthur Chambers , the Pastor of the Methodist Church in the village , in company with a dozen or 15 members of his congregation , holds a prayermeeting and song-meeting in the jail . For two years it has been the habit of Miss Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of the village apothecary , to join the missionary band , and her sweet voice is credited with having influenced many a tough-hearted prisoner to experience conversion . The first Sunday after Roderick 's arrest she became acquainted with him during the meeting , and on several succeeding Sundays it was noticed without exciting remark that she was oftener in a side corridor doing indivftlual work with prisoner Roderick , as the Chaplain and his band . thought , than at her customary post in the ? choir laboring for the general salvation . After a month or so by permission of the Sheriff she made special and irregular week-day visits with the prisoner , assuring the jail attendants that her heathen was fast falling under the influence . Finally , she began to neglect her Sunday work , but her week-day visits became more frequent . This led to some little whispering among her deserted coworkers , but no general suspicion was aroused . Some five or six weeks ago Roderick confessed conviction at a Sunday meeting , giving at the time hearty praise and credit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy in the several breasts of her deserted coworkers , and tongue after tongue began to wag until at everyfireside in the community it was the chief topic discussed . With the Post Office loafers Aggie Austin 's name was in an opprobrious sense connected with that of Ferd Roderick , and all sorts of reckless ' talk was indulged in . Mr. Austin vainly forbade his daughter from continuing her visits to the jail . The father then called on the Sheriff , and in this way was more successful , for the visits were at once interdicted . Two weeks ago last Thursday Agnes disappeared from her home and nothing was heard of her whereabouts until last Friday , when a constable came riding into Sageville with Agnes behind him . She was taken before the magistrate and sent to jail on the charge of stealing one of the very horses for the theft of which her lover was suffering confinement . The constable said that she stole the horse ? in broad daylight , and when pursued made but a very feeble attempt to escape . Her story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's camp and await his arrival , which would be as soon as an opportunity for escape presented itself . After waiting for him at the camp for more than a week she says she became desperate , and , resolving to join him in the jail , she ran away from the camp with the deliberate intention of committing some crime that would place her by her lover 's side . Her stealing the same horse that Ferd had once stolen , she asserts , was a simple accident . Miss Austin 's bail was fixed at $600 , but she refused to accept bondsmen and resume her liberty . On Friday morning Roderick sent for the Sheriff and informed him that he wished to wed Agnes Austin , who , when brought before the Sheriff , declared a similar desire . The girl being 19 years old , and therefore of the legal age , the Sheriff deemed it his duty to comply with their wishes , and the committing magistrate , Jarvis , was summoned . i At 3 o'clock in the afternoon , in the corridor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses , the felon lovers were made one . The District Attorney unpoetically declares that this most remarkable of Hymen 's consolidations will not hinder him from prosecuting the bride and groom on the separate indictments .. He promises , however , to try and bring both cases up at the same term of court , and thus allow the pair to make their bridal journey together to their future mountain home at Clinton Prison . The father of Miss Austin makes some dire threats against the Sheriff for his course , but it is evident enough that the romantic horsethieves have many sympathizers among the excited village people , who were late to bed Friday night and neglectful of their business yesterday because of being so absorbed in hearing and so eager to tell the story of the wedding of the jail-birds . It has been said by some that no Hamilton County jury will ever convict the pair , and that as no one is a loser by their crimes they should be permitted to try liberty again . There being but one corridor in the jail , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they occupy different cells .
