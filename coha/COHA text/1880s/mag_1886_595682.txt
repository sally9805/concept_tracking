nobility at fifteen years of age . Peace under any circumstances would doubtless have been irksome to him , but a peace which forbade him free access to his own hunting-grounds and to the graves of his fathers was more than he could now school himself to endure . He had come to believe that he had been foully wronged by the treaty which was his own act ; he had even convinced himself that " land can not be sold , " * a proposition in political economy which our modern socialists would be puzzled to accept or confute . Besides this , the tenderest feelings of his heart were outraged by this exclusion from his former domain . He had never passed a year since the death of his daughter without mak ing a pilgrimage to her grave at Oquawka and spending hours in mystic ceremonies and contemplation.t He was himself prophet as well as king , and had doubtless his share of mania , which is the strength of prophets . The promptings of his own broken heart readily seemed to him the whisperings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased around him , until they could not be resisted even if death stood in the way . He made his combinations during the winter , and had it not been for the loyal attitude of Keokuk , he could have brought the entirc nation of the Sacs and Foxes to the war-path . As it was , the flower of the young men came with him when , with the opening spring , he // crossed the river once more . He came this time , he said , " to plant corn , " but as a preliminary to this peaceful occupation of the land he marched up the Rock River , expecting to be joined by the Winnebagoes and Pottawatomies . But the time was past for honorable alliances among the Indians . His oath-bound confederates gave him little assistance , and soon cast in their lot with the stronger party . This movement excited general alarm in the State . General Atkinson , commanding the United States troops , sent a formal summons to Black Hawk to return ; but the old chief was already well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet Wabokishick , at Proph // etstown , and treated the summons with contemptuous defiance . The Governor immediately called for volunteers , and was himself astonished at the alacrity with which the call was answered . Among those who enlisted at the first tap of the drum was Abraham Lincoln , and equally to his surprise and delight he was elected captain of his company . The volunteer organizations of those days were conducted on purely democratic principles . The company assembled on the green , an election was suggested , and three-fourths of the men walked over to where Lincoln was standing ; most of the small remainder joined themselves to one Kirkpatrick , a man of some substance and standing from Spring Creek . We have the word of Mr. Lincoln for it , that no subsequent success ever gave him such unmixed pleasure as this earliest distinction . It was a sincere , unsought tribute of his equals to those physical and moral qualities which made him the best man of his hundred , and as such was accepted and prized .

It was arduous marching . There were no roads and no bridges , and the day 's work included a great deal of labor . The third day out they came to the Henderson River , a stream some fifty yards wide , swift and swollen with the spring thaws , with high and steep banks . To most armies this would have seemed a serious obstacle , but these backwoodsmen swarmed to the work like beavers , and in less than three hours * the river was crossed with the loss of only one or two horses and wagons .

But on the 6th of May the FI/zY/iam Wa//ace arrived , and " this sight , " says the Governor with characteristic sincerity , " was , I presume , the most interesting I ever beheld . " From there they marched to the mouth of Rock River , and thence General Whiteside proceeded with his volunteers up the river some ninety miles to Dixon , where they halted to await the arrival of General Atkinson with the regular troops and * Reynolds 's " Life and Times , " p. 356 . VOL . XXXIII. - 34. provisions . There they found two battalions of fresh horsemen , under Majors Stillman and Bailey , who had as yet seen no service and were eager for the fray . Whiteside 's men were tired with their forced march , and besides , in their ardor to get forward , they had thrown away a good part of their provisions and left their baggage behind . It pleased the Governor , therefore , to listen to the prayers of Stillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed to the head of Old Man 's Creek , where it was supposed there were some hostile Indians , and coerce them into submission. ** " I thought , " says the Governor in his memoirs , " they might discover the enemy . " The supposition was certainly well founded . They rode merrily away , came to Old Man s Creek , thereafter to be called Stillman 's Run , and encamped for the night . By the failing light a small party of Indians was discovered on the summit of a hill a mile away , and a few courageous gentlemen hurriedly saddled their horses , and , without orders , rode after them . The Indians retreated , but were soon overtaken , and two or three of them killed . The volunteers were now strung along a half mile of hill and valley , with no more order or care than if they had been chasing rabbits .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red-hot valor of the volunteers ; they turned and ran for their lives , stampeding the camp as they fled . There was very little resistance . - so little that Black Hawk , fearing a ruse , tried to recall his warriors from the pursuit , but in the darkness and confusion could not enforce his orders . The Indians killed all they caught up with ; but the volunteers had the fleeter horses , and only eleven were overtaken . The rest reached Dixon by twos and threes , rested all night , and took courage . General Whiteside marched out to the scene of the disaster the next morning , but the Indians were gone . They had broken up into small parties , and for several days they reaped the bloody fruit of their victory in the massacre of the peaceful settlements in the adjacent districts .

Several other officers did the same , among them General Whiteside and Major Stuart . Lincoln became a member of Captain Elijah lies 's company of mounted volunteers , sometimes called the " Independent Spy Battalion , " an organization unique of its kind , if we may judge from the account given by one of its troopers . It was not , says Mr. George W. Harrison , " under the control of any regiment or brigade , but received orders directly from the Commander-in-Chief , and always , when with the army , camped within the lines , and had many other privileges , such as having no camp duties to perform and drawing rations as much and as often as we pleased , " which would seem to liken this battalion as nearly as possible to the fabled " regiment of brigadiers . " With this e'li/e corps Lincoln served through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in either of the two engagements in which General Henry broke and destroyed forever the power of Black Hawk and the British band of Sacs and Foxes at the Wisconsin Bluffs and the Bad Axe . After Lincoln was relieved of the weight of dignity involved in his captaincy , the war became a sort of holiday , and the tall private from New Salem enjoyed it as much as any one . He entered with great zest into the athletic sports with which soldiers love to beguile the tedium of camp . He was admitted to be the strongest man in the army , and , with one exception , the best wrestler . Indeed his friends never admitted the exception , and severely blamed Lincoln for confessing himself defeated on the occasion when he met the redoubtable Thompson , and the two fell together on the turf . His popularity increased from the beginning to the end of the campaign , and those of his comrades who still survive always speak with hearty and affectionate praise of his character and conduct in those rough yet pleasantly remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's forces when , by a disobedience of orders as prudent as it was audacious , he started with his slender force on the fresh trail which he was sure would lead him to Black Hawk 's camp . He found and struck the enemy at bay on the bluffs of the Wisconsin River on the 2 ist of July , and inflicted upon them a signal defeat . The broken remnant of Black Hawk 's power then fled for the Mississippi River , the whole army following in close pursuit- General Atkinson in front and General Henry bringing up the rear . Fortune favored the latter once more , for while Black Hawk with a handful of men was engaging and drawing away the force under Atkinson , General Henry struck the main trail , and brought on the battle of the Bad Axe , if that could be called a battle which was an easy slaughter of the weary and discouraged sayages , // fighting without heart or hope , an army in front and the great river behind . Black Hawk escaped the fate of his followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treachery of his allies . He was carried in triumph to Washington and presented to President Jackson , to whom he made this stem and defiant speech , showing how little age or disaster could do to tame his indomitable spirit : " I am a man , and you are another . I did not expect to conquer the white people . I took up the hatchet to avenge injuries which could no longer be borne. * Had I borne them longer my people would have said : Black Hawk is a squaw ; he is too old to be a chief ; he is no Sac . ' This caused me to raise the war-whoop . I say no more of it ; all is known to you . " He returned to Iowa , and lived to a great age . When he died he received the supreme honors paid only to mighty men of war among his people , and was buried on the high bank of the Mississippi , in arms and in war-paint , facing the rising sun . It was on the i6th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axe , that the battalion to which Lincoln belonged was finally mustered out , at Whitewater , Wisconsin . His final release from the service was signed by a young lieutenant of artillery , Robert Anderson , who , twenty-niiie years later , in one of the most awful crises in our annals , was to sustain to Lincoln relations of prodigious importance , on a scene illuminated by the flash of the opening guns of the civil war.t The men started home the next day in high spirits , like * It is a noteworthy coincidence that President Lincoln 's proclamation at the opening of the war calls for troops " to redress wrongs already long enough endured . " A story to the effect that Lincoln was mustered into service by Jefferson Davis has for a long time been current , but the strictest search in the records fails to confirm it . We are indebted to General R. C. Drum , Adjutant-General of the Army , for an interesting letter giving all the known facts in relation to this story . General Drum says : " The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln , was with others called out by Governor Reynolds , and was organized at Richland , Sangamon County , Illinois , April 21 , 1832 . The muster-in roll is not on file , but the records show that the company was mustered out at the mouth of Fox River , May 27 , 1832 , by Nathaniel Buckmaster , BrigadeMajor to General Samuel Whiteside , Illinois Volunteers . On the muster-roll of Captain Elijah Iles 's company , Illinois Mounted Volunteers , A. Lincoln ( Sangamon County ) appears as a private from May 27 , 1832 , to June s6 , 1832 , when the company was mustered out of service by Lieutenant Robert Anderson , Third United States Artillery and Colonel ( Assistant Inspector-General ) Illinois volunteers . BrigadierGeneral Henry Atkinson , in his report of May 30 , 1832 , stated that the Illinois Volunteers were called out by the Governor of that State , but in haste and for no definite period of service . On their arrival at Ottawa they became clamorous for their discharge , which the Governor granted , retaining-of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Horatio , of his good spirits , for they were his only outfit for the long journey to New Salem , he and his mess-mate Harrison j : having had their horses stolen the day before by some patriot over-anxious to reach home . But , as Harrison says , " I laughed at our fate , and he joked at it , and we all started off merrily . The generous men of our company walked and rode by turns with us , and we fared about equal with the rest . But for this generosity our legs would have had to do the better work ; for in that day this dreary route furnished no horses to buy or to steal ; and whether on horse or afoot , we always had company , for many of the horses ' backs were too sore for riding . " It is not hard to imagine with what quips and quirks of native fancy Lincoln and his friends beguiled the way through forest and prairie . With youth , good health , and a clear conscience , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , nothing was wanting to give zest and spice to this long , sociable walk of a hundred leagues . One joke is preserved , and this one is at the expense of Lincoln . One chilly morning he complained of being cold . " No wonder , " said some facetious cavalier , " there is so much of you on the ground . " We hope Lincoln 's contributions to the fun were better than this , but of course the prosperity of these jests lay rather in the liberal ears that heard them than in the good-natured tongues that uttered them . Lincoln and Harrison could not have been discharged and volunteered for a further period of twenty days - a sufficient number of men to form six companies , which General Atkinson found at Ottawa on his arrival there from Rock River . General Atkinson further reports that these companies and some three hundred regular troops , remaining in position at Rock River , were all the force left him to keep the enemy in check until the assemblage of the three thousand additional Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. 's ) requisition , to rendezvous at Ottawa , June 12-15 , 1832 . " There can be no doubt that Captain lies 's company , mentioned above , was one of the six which served until June 16 , 1832 , while the fact is fully established that the company of which Mr. Lincoln was a member was mustered out by Lieutenant Robert Anderson , who , in April , x86i , was in command of Fort Sumter . There is no evidence to show that it was mustered in by Lieutenant Jefferson Davis . Mr. Davis 's company ( B , First United States Infantry ) was stationed at Fort Crawford , Wisconsin , during the months of January and February , 1832 , and he is borne on the rolls as absent on detached service at the Dubuque mines by order of Colonel Morgan . ' From March 26 to August i8 , 1832 , the muster-rolls of his company report him as absent on furlough . " * George W. Harrison , who gives an entertaining account of his personal experiences in Lamon , p . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 71 , but transfers it to a time four years later , when Lincoln had permanently assumed shoes and had a horse of his own . // altogether penniless , for at Peoria they bought a canoe and paddled down to Pekin . Here the ingenious Lincoln employed his hereditary talent for carpentry by making an oar for the frail vessel while Harrison was providing the commissary stores . The latter goes on to say : " The river , being very low , was without current , so that we had to pull hard to make half the speed of legs on land ; in fact , we let her float all night , and on the next morning always found the objects still visible that were beside us the previous evening . The water was remarkably clear for this river of plants , and the fish appeared to be sporting with us as we moved over or near them . On the next day after we left Pekin we overhauled a raft of saw-logs , with two men afloat on it to urge it on with poles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them and went on the raft , where we were made welcome by various demonstrations , especially by an invitation to a feast on fish , corn-bread , eggs , butter , and coffee , just prepared for our benefit . Of these good things we ate almost immoderately , for it was the only warm meal we had made for several days . While preparing it , and after dinner , Lincoln entertained them , and they entertained us for a couple of hours very amusingly . " Kindly human companionship was a luxury in that green wilderness , and was readily appreciated and paid for . The returning warriors dropped down the river to the village of Havana-from Pekin to Havana in a canoe ! The country is full of these geographical nightmares , the necessary result of freedom of nomenclature bestowed by circumstances upon minds equally destitute of taste or education . There they sold their boat ,  --  no difficult task , for a canoe was a staple article in any river-town ,  --  and again set out " the old way , over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impulse became stronger and urged us on amazingly . The long strides of Lincoln , often slipping back in the loose sand six inches every step , were just right for me ; and he was greatly diverted when he noticed me behind him stepping along in his tracks to keep from slipping . " Thus the two comrades came back from their soldierings to their humble homes , from which Lincoln was soon to start on the way marked out for him by Providence , with strides which no comrade , with whatever good-will , might hope to follow . He never took his campaigning seriously . * XVe are aware that all former biographers have stated that Lincoln 's candidacy for the Legislature was subsequent to his return from the war , and a consequence of his service . But his circular is The politician 's habit of glorifying the petty incidents of a candidate 's life always seemed absurd to him , and in his speech , made in 1848 , ridiculing the effort on the part of General Cass 's friends to draw some political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontier in the war with Great Britain , he estopped any future eulogist from painting his own military achievements in too lively colors . " Did you know , Mr. Speaker , " he said , " I am a military hero ? In the days of the Black Hawk war I fought , bled , and came away . I was not at Stillman 's defeat , but I was about as near it as General Cass was to Hull 's surrender ; and , like him , I saw the place very soon afterwards . It is quite certain I did not break my sword , for I had none to break , but I bent my musket pretty badly on one occasion . If General Cass went in advance of me picking whortleberries , I guess I surpassed him in charges on the wild onions . If he saw any live fighting Indians , it was more than I did , but I had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes ; and although I never fainted from loss of blood , I can truly say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever I should conclude to doff whatever our Democratic friends may suppose there is of blackcockade Federalism about me , and thereupon they shall take me up as their candidate for the Presidency , I protest that they shall not make fun of me , as they have of General Cass , by attempting to write me into a military hero . " AN UNsuccEssFuL cANvAss . THE discharged volunteer arrived in New Salem only ten days before the August election , in which he had a deep personal interest . Before starting for the wars he had announced himself , according to the custom of the time , by a handbill circular , as a candidate for the Legislature from Sangamon County. * He had done this in accordance with his own natural bent for public life and desire for usefulness and distinction , and not without strong encouragement from friends whose opinion he valued . He had even then considerable experience in speaking and thinking on his feet . He had begun his practice in that direction before leaving Indiana , and continued it everywhere he had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lincoln was a farm-hand at Island Grove , the famous circuit-rider , Peter Cartdated March 9 ' 5832 , and the " Sangamon Journal " mentions his name among the candidates in July , and apologizes for having accidentally omitted it in May . // wright , came by , electioneering for the Legislature , and Lincoln at once engaged in a discussion with him in the cornfield , in which the great Methodist was equally astonished at the close reasoning and the uncouth figure of Mr. Brown 's extraordinary hired man . At another time , after one Posey , a politician in search of office , had made a speech in Macon , John Hanks , whose admiration of his cousins s oratory was unbounded , said that " Abe could beat it . " lie turned a keg on end , and the tall boy mounted it and made his speech . " The subject was the navigation of the Sangamon , and Abe beat him to death , " says the loyal Hanks . So it was not with all the tremor of a complete novice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days left him between his return and the election . He ran as a Whig . As this has been denied on authority which is generally trustworthy , it is well enough to insist upon the fact . In one of the few speeches of his which , made at this time , have been remembered and reported , he said : " I am in favor of a national bank ; I am in favor of the internal improvement system , and of a high protective tariff . These are my sentiments and political principles . " Nothing could be more unqualified or outspoken than this announcement of his adhesion to what was then and for years afterwards called " the American System " of Henry Clay . Other testimony is not wanting to tbe same effect . Both Major Stuart and Judge Logan* say that Lincoln ran in 1832 as a Whig , and that his speeches were unevasively in defense of the principles of that party . Without discussing the merits of the party or its purposes , we may insist that his adopting them thus openly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and marks thus early the scrupulous conscientiousness which shaped every action of his life . The State of Illinois was by a large majority Democratic , * The Democrats of New Salem worked for Lincoln out of their personal regard for him . That was the general understanding of the matter here at the time . In this he made no concession of principle whatever . He was as stiff as a man could he in his hopelessly attached to the person and policy of Jackson . Nowhere had that despotic leader more violent and unscrupulous partisans than there . They were proud of their very servility , and preferred the name of " whole-hog Jackson men " to that of Democrats . The Whigs embraced in their scanty ranks the leading men of the State , those who have since been most distinguished in its history , such as S. T. Logan , Stuart , Browning , Dubois , Hardin , Breese , and many others . But they were utterly unable to do anything except by dividing the Jackson men , whose very numbers made their party unwieldy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative portion of them . In this way , in the late election , they had secured the success of Governor Reynolds - the Old Ranger-against Governor Kinney , who represented the vehement and proscriptive spirit which Jackson had just breathed into the party . He had visited the General in Washington , and had come back giving out threatenmgs and slaughter against the Whigs in the true Tennessee style , declaring that " all Whigs should be whipped out of office like dogs out of a meat-house " ; the force of south-western simile could no farther go.t But the great popularity of Reynolds and the adroit management of the Whigs carried him through successfully . A single fact will show on which side the people who could read were enlisted , The " whole-hog " party had one newspaper , the opposition five . Of course it would have been impossible for Reynolds to poll a respectable vote if his loyalty to Jackson had been seriously doubted . As it was , he lost many votes through a report that he had been guilty of saying that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be . " The Governor himself , in his naiive account of the canvass , acknowledges the damaging nature of this accusation , and comforts himself with quoting an indiscretion of Kinney 's , who opposed a projected canal on the ground that " it would flood the country with Yankees . It showed some moral courage , and certainly an absence of the shuffling politician 's fair-weather policy , that Lincoln , in his friendless and penniless youth , at the veiy beginning of his career , when he was not embarrassed by antecedents or family connections , and when , in fact , what little social influence he knew would have led him the other way , chose to oppose a furiously intolerant majority , Whig doctrines . They did this for him simply because he was popular - because he was Lincoln . July 6 , 1875 . STEPHEN T. LOGAN . t Reynolds 's " My Own Times , " p. 291 . A. LINCOLN S SURVEYINO INSTRUMENTS AND sADnLE-RAO . ( IN POSSESSION OF LINCOLN MONUMENT COLLECTION. ) // and to take his stand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motives which led him to take this decisive course are not difficult to imagine . The better sort of people in Sangamon County were Whigs , though the majority were Democrats , and he preferred through life the better sort to the majority . The papers he read were the Louisville " Journal " and the " Sangamon Journal , " both Whig . Reading the speeches and debates of the day , he sided with Webster against Calhoun , and with Clay against anybody . Though his notions of politics , like those of any ill-educated young man of twenty-two , must have been rather crude , and not at all sufficient to live and to die by , he had adopted them honestly and sincerely , with no selfish regard to his own interests ; and though he ardently desired success , he never abated one jot or tittle of his convictions for any possible personal gain , then or thereafter . In the circular in which he announced his candidacy he made no reference to national politics , but confined himself mainly to a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorite hobby of the place and time . He had no monopoly of this " issue . " It formed the burden of nearly every candidate 's appeal to the people in that year . The excitement occasioned by the trip of the Zfalisman had not yet died away , although the little steamer was now dust and ashes , and her bold commander had left the State to avoid an awkward meeting with the sheriff . The hope of seeing Springfield an emporium of commerce was still lively among the citizens of Sangamon County , and in no one of the handbills of the political aspirants of the season was that hope more judiciously encouraged than in the one signed by Abraham Lincoln . It was a wellwritten circular , remarkable for its soberness and reserve when we consider the age and the limited advantages of the writer . It concluded in these words : " Upon the subjects of which I have treated , I have spoken as I have thought . I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them ; but holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right than at all times wrong , so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous , I shall be ready to renounce them . Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition . Whether it be true or not , I can say , for one , that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow-men , by rendering myself worthy of their esteem . How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed . I am young , and unknown to many of you . I was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life . I have no wealthy or powerful relations or friends to recommend me . My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county ; and , if elected , they will have conferred a favor upon me , for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate . But if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background , I have been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is almost precisely the style of his later years . The errors of grammar and construction which spring invariably from an effort to avoid redundancy of expression remained with him through life . He seemed to grudge the space required for necessary parts of speech . But his language was at twenty-two , as it was thirty years later , the simple and manly attire of his thought , with little attempt at ornament and none at disguise . There was an intermediate time when he sinned in the direction of fine writing ; but this ebullition soon passed away , and left that marvelously strong and transparent style in which his two inaugurals were written . Of course , in the ten days left him after his return from the field , a canvass of the county , which was then some thousands of square miles in extent , was out of the question . He made a few speeches in the neighborhood of New Salem , and at least one in Springfield . He was wholly unknown there except by his few comrades in arms . We find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , in an editorial note adding the name of Captain Lincoln to those candidates for the Legislature who were periling their lives on the frontier and had left their reputations in charge of their generous fellow-citizens at home . On the occasion of his speaking at Springfield , most of the candidates had come together to address a meeting there to give their electors some idea of their quality . These were severe ordeals for the rash aspirants for popular favor . Besides those citizens who came to listen and judge , there were many whose only object was the free whisky provided for the occasion , and who , after potations pottle-deep , became not only highly unparliamentary but even dangerous to life and limb . This wild chivalry of Lick Creek was , however , less redoubtable to Lincoln than it might be to an urban statesman unacquainted with the frolic brutality of Clary 's Grove . Their gambols never caused him to lose his self-possession . It is related that once , while he was speaking , he saw a ruffian attack a friend of his in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orator 's sympathies , he descended from the stand , seized the objectionable fighting man by the neck , " threw him some ten feet , " then calmly mounted to his place , and finished his speech , the course of his logic undisturbed by this athletic parenthesis . Judge Logan saw Lincoln for the first time on the day when he came up to Springfield // on his canvass this summer . He thus speaks of his future partner : " He was a very tall , gawky , and rough-looking fellow then ; his pantaloons did n't meet his shoes by six inches . But after he began speaking I became very much interested in him . He made a very sensible speech . His manner was very much the same as in after life ; that is , the same peculiar characteristics were apparent then , though of course in after years he evinced more knowledge and experience . But he had then the same novelty and the same peculiarity in presenting his ideas . He had the same individuality that he kept through all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting whose good opinion was worth more than all the votes of Lick Creek to one beginning life : Stephen T. Logan , a young lawyer who had recently come from Kentucky with the best equipment for a n/si Jr/us practitioner ever brought into the State ; Major Stuart , whom we have met in the Black Hawk war , once commanding a battalion and then marching as a private ; and William Butler , afterwards prominent in State politics , at that time a young man of the purest Western breed in body and character , clear-headed and courageous , and ready for any emergency where a friend was to be defended or an enemy punished . We do not know whether Lincoln gained any votes that day , but he gained what was far more valuable , the active friendship of these able and honorable men , all Whigs and all Kentuckians like himself . The acquaintances he made in his canvass , the practice he gained in speaking , and the added confidence which this experience of measuring his abilities with those of others gave , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was defeated , for the only time in his life , in a contest before the people . The fortunate candidates were E. D. Taylor , J. T.

He had 657 votes , and there were five who fared worse , among them his old adversary Kirkpatrick . XVhat must have been especially gratifying to him was the fact that he received the almost unanimous vote of his own neighborhood , the precinct of New Salem , 277 votes against 3 , a result which showed more strongly than any words could do the extent of the attachment and the confidence which his genial and upright character had inspired among those who knew him best . * " Sangamon Journal , " August II , 1832 .

It is said by Dr. Holland that he thought seriously at this time of learning the trade of a blacksmith , and using in that honest way the sinew and brawn which nature had given him . But an opening for another kind of business occurred , which prevented his entering upon any merely mechanical occupation . Two of his most intimate friends were the brothers Herudon , called , according to the fashion of the time , which held it unfriendly to give a man his proper name , and arrogant for him to claim it , " Row " and " Jim .

The next morning , while Radford was ruefully contemplaing the ruin , and doubtless concluding that he had had enough of a country where the local idea of neighborly humor found such eccentric expression , he hailed a passer-by named Greene , and challenged him to buy his establishment for four hundred dollars . This sort of trade was always irresistible to these Western speculators , and Greene at once gave his note for the amount . It next occurred to him to try to find out what the property was worth , and doubting his own skill , he engaged Lincoln to make an invoice of it .

It was entered into without sufficient reflection , and from the very nature of things was destined to fail . To Berry the business was merely the refuge of idleness .

The tavern was never opened , for about this time Lincoln and Berry were challenged to sell out to a pair of vagrant brothers named Trent , who , as they had no idea of paying , were willing to give their notes to any amount . They soon ran away , and Berry expired , extinguished in rum . Lincoln was thus left loaded with debts , and with no assets except worthless notes of Berry and the Trents . It is greatly to his credit that he never thought of doing by others as others had done by him . The morality of the frontier was deplorably loose in such matters , and most of these people would have concluded that the failure of the business expunged its liabilities . But Lincoln made no effort even to compromise the claims against him . He promised to pay when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ; but he paid at last every farthing of the debt , which seemed to him and his friends so large that it was called among them " the national debt . " He had already begun to read elementary books of law , borrowed from Major Stuart and other kindly acquaintances . Indeed , it is quite possible that Berry and Lincoln might have succeeded better in business if the junior member of the firm had not spent so much of his time reading Blackstone and Chitty in the shade of a great oak just outside the door , while the senior quietly fuddled himself within . Eye-witnesses still speak of the grotesque youth , habited in homespun tow , lying on his back with his feet on the trunk of the tree , and poring over his book by the hour , " grinding around with the shade , " as it shifted from north to east . After his store , to use his own expression , had " winked out , " he applied himself with more continuous energy to his reading , doing merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current expenses , which were of course very slight . He sometimes helped his friend Ellis in his store sometimes went into the field and renewed his exploits as a farm-hand , which had gained him a traditional fame in Indiana ; sometimes employed his clerkly hand in straightening up a neglected ledger . It is probable that he worked for his board oftener than for any VOL . XXXIII. - 35. other compensation , and his hearty friendliness and vivacity , as well as his industry in the field , made him a welcome guest in any farmhouse in the county . His strong arm was always at the disposal of the poor and needy ; it is said of him , with a graphic variation of a well-known text , " that he visited the fatherless and the widow and chopped their wood . " In the spring of this year , 1833 , he was appointed Postmaster of New Salem , and held the office for three years . Its emoluments were slender and its duties light , but there was in all probability no citizen of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mails were so scanty that he was said to carry them in his hat , and he is also reported to have read every newspaper that arrived ; it is altogether likely that this formed the leading inducement to his taking the office . His incumbency lasted until New Salem ceased to be populous enough for a post-station and the mail went by to Petersburg . Dr. Holland relates a sequel to this official experience which illustrates the quaint honesty of the man . Several years later , when he was a practicing lawyer , an agent of the Post-office Department called upon him , and asked for a balance due from the New Salem office , some seventeen dollars . Lincoln rose , and opening a little trunk which lay in a corner of the room , took from it a cotton rag in which was tied up the exact sum required . " I never use any man s money but my own , " he quietly remarked . When we consider the pinching poverty in which these years had been passed , we may appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of this little sum of government money . John Calhoun , the Surveyor of Sangamon County , was at this time overburdened with work . The principal industry then was speculation in land . Every settler of course wanted his farm surveyed and marked out for him , and every community had its syndicate of leading citizens who cherished a scheme of laying out a city somewhere . In many cases the city was plotted , the sites of the principal buildings , including a court-house and a university , were determined , and a sonorous // his youth adopted the same profession , but there were few points of similarity in the lives of the two greatest of our Presidents , in youth or later manhood .

Lincoln , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracts , made no use whatever of them .

He was , nevertheless , an excellent surveyor . His portion of the public work executed under the directions of Mr. Calhoun and his successor , T. M.

His good qualities might have excited resentment if displayed by a well-dressed stranger from an Eastern State , but the most uncouth ruffians of New Salem took a sort of proprietary interest and pride in the decency and the cleverness and the learning of their friend and comrade , Abe Lincoln .

He was sure of the united support of the Whigs , and so many of the Democrats also wanted to vote for him that some of the leading members of that party came to him and proposed they should give him an organized support . He was too loyal a partisan to accept their overtures without taking counsel from the Whig candidates . He laid the matter before Major Stuart , who at once advised him to make the canvass . It was a generous and chivalrous action , for by thus encouraging the candidacy of Lincoln he was endangering his own election . But his success two years before , in the face of a vindictive opposition led by the strongest Jackson men in the district , had made him somewhat confident , and he perhaps thought he was risking little by giving a helping hand to his comrade in the Spy Battalion .

LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENcE. - MEETING WITH STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS. - THE LONG NINE . ' ' THE election of Mr. Lincoln to the Legislature may be said to have closed the pioneer portion of his life . He was done with the wild carelessness of the woods , with the jolly ruffianism of Clary 's Grove , with the petty chaffering of grocery stores , with odd jobs for daily bread , with all the uncouth squalor of the frontier poverty . It was not that his pecuniary circumstances were materially improved . He was still , and for years continued to be , a very poor man , harassed by debts which he was always working to pay , and sometimes in distress for the means of decent subsistence . But from this time forward his asso ciations were with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , arrd a new feeling of self-respect must naturally have grown up in his mind from his constant intercourse with them  --  a feeling which extended to the minor morals of civilized life . A sophisticated reader may smile at the mention of anything like social ethics in Van dalia in 1834 ; but , compared with Gentryville and New Salem , the society which assembled in the winter at that little capital was polished and elegant . The State then contained nearly two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants , and the members of the Legislature , elected purely on personal grounds , nominated by themselves or their neighbors without the intervention ? * party machinery , were necessarily the leading men , in one way or another , in their several districts . Among the colleagues of Lincoln at Vandalia were young men with destinies only less brilliant than his own . They were to become governors , senators , and judges ; they were to organize the Whig party of Illinois , and afterwards the Republican ; they were to lead brigades and divisions in two great wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature proper , but in the lobby , where he was trying to appropriate an office then filled by Colonel Hardin-was his future antagonist , Stephen A. Douglas . Neither seemed to have any presentiment of the future greatness of the other . Douglas thought little of the raw youth from the Sangamon timber , and Lincoln said the dwarfish Vermonter was " the least man he had ever seen . " To all appearance , Vandalia was full of better men than either of them- clever lawyers , men of wit and standing , some of them the sons of provident early settlers , but more who had come from older States to seek their fortunes in these fresh fields . During his first session Lincoln occupied no especially conspicuous position . He held his own respectably among the best . One of his colleagues tells us he was not distinguished by any external eccentricity ; that he wore , according to the custom of the time , a decent suit of blue jeans ; that he was known simply as a rather quiet young man , good-natured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance of most of the members , and had evidently come to be looked upon as possessing more than ordinary capacity . His unusual common-sense began to be recognized . His name does not often appear in the records of the year . He introduced a resolution in favor of securing to the State a part of the proceeds of the sales of public lands within its limits ; he took part in the organization of the ephemeral " White " // party , which was designed to unite all the anti-Jackson elements under the leadership of Hugh L. White , of Tennessee ; he voted with the minority in favor of Young against Robinson for senator , and with the majority that passed the Bank and Canal bills , which were ; eceived with such enthusiasm throughout Illinois , and which were only the precursors of those gigantic and ill-advised schemes that came to maturity two years later , and inflicted such incalculable injury upon the State . Lincoln returned to New Salem , after this winter 's experience of men and things at the little capital , much firmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity of measuring himself with the leading men of the community , and had found no difficulty whatever in keeping pace with them . He continued his studies of the law and surveying together , and became quite indispensable in the latter capacity-so much so that General Neale , announcing in September , 1835 , the names of the deputy surveyors of Sangamon County , places the name of Lincoln before that of his old master in the science , John Calhoun . He returned to the Legislature in the winter of 1835-6 , and one of the first important incidents of the session was the election of a senator to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Elias Kent Kane . There was no lack of candidates . A journal of the time says : " This intelligence reached Vandalia on the evening of the 26th December , and in the morning nine candidates appeared in that place , and it was anticipated that a number more would soon be in , among them the lion of the North , ' who , it is thought , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known who was the roaring celebrity here referred to , but the successful candidate was General XVilliam L. D. Ewing , who was elected by a majority of one vote . Lincoln and the other XVhigs voted for him , not because he was a " White " man , as they frankly stated , but because " he had been proscribed by the Van Buren party . " Mr. Semple , the candidate of the regular Democratic caucus , was beaten simply on account of his political orthodoxy . A minority is always strongly in favor of independent action and bitterly opposed to caucuses , and therefore we need not be surprised at finding Mr. Lincoln , a few days later in the session , joining in hearty denunciation of the convention system , which had already become popular in the East , and which General Jackson was then urging upon his faithful followers . The missionaries of this new system in Illinois were the shifty young lawyer from Morgan County , who had just * " Sangamon Journal , " January 2. succeeded in having himself made circuit attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently from Vermont , and a man who was then regarded in Vandalia as a far more important and dangerous person than Douglas , Ebenezer Peck , of Chicago . He was looked upon with distrust and suspicion for several reasons , all of which seemed valid to the rural legislators assembled there . He came from Canada , where he had been a member of the provincial parliament , and was therefore imagined to be permeated with secret hostility to republican institutions ; his garb , his furs , were of the fashion of Quebec ; and he passed his time indoctrinating the Jackson men with the theory and practice of party organization , teachings which they eagerly absorbed , and which seemed sinister and ominous to the Whigs . He was showing them , in fact , the way in which elections were to be won ; and though the Whigs denounced his system as subversive of individual freedom and private judgment , it was not long before they were also forced to adopt it , or be left alone with their virtue . The organization of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in great measure from the work of Mr. Peck with the Vandalia Legislature . There was no man more dreaded and disliked than he was by the stalwart young Whigs against whom he was organizing that solid and disciplined opposition . But a quarter of a century brings wonderful changes . Twenty-five years later Mr. Peck stood shoulder to shoulder with these very men who then reviled him as a Canadian emissary of tyranny and corruption ,  --  with S. T. Logan , Browning , and Dubois ,  --  organizing a new party for victory under the name of Abraham Lincoln . The Legislature adjourned on the 23d of January , having made a beginning , it is true , in the work of improving the State by statute , though its modest work , incorporating canal and bridge companies and providing for public roads , bore no relation to the ambitious essays of its successor . Among the bills passed at this session was an Apportionment act , by which Sangamon County became entitled to seven representatives and two senators , and early in the spring nine statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems singular to us of a later day that just nine prominent men should have offered themselves for these places , without the intervention of any primary meetings . Such a thing , if we mistake not , was never known again in Illinois . The convention system was afterwards seen to be an absolute necessity to prevent the disorganization of parties through the restless vanity of obscure and insubordinate aspirants . But the nine who " took the stump " in San- // gamon in the summer of 1836 were supported as loyally and as energetically as if they had been nominated with all the solemnity of modem days . They became famous in the history of the State , partly for their stature and partly for their influence in legislation . They were called the " Long Nine " ; their average height was over six feet , and their aggregate altitude was said to have been fifty-five feet . Their names were Abraham Lincoln , John Dawson , Dan Stone , Ninian W. Edwards , William F. Elkin , R. L. Wilson , Andrew McCormick : these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Archer Herndon for the State Senate . Mr. Lincoln began his canvass with the following circular : " NEW SALEM , June 13 , 1836 . " To the Editor of the Journal . ' " In your paper of last Saturday I see a communication over the signature Many Voters'in which the candidates who are announced in the Journal ' are called upon to show their hands . ' Agreed . Here 's mine . " I go for all sharing the privileges of the Government who assist in bearing its burdens . Consequently I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or hear arms ( by no means excluding females ) . " If elected , I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my constituents , as well those that oppose as those that support me . " While acting as their representative 1 shall he governed by their will on all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will is , and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several States , to enable our State , in common with others , to dig canals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying interest on it . " If alive on the first Monday in November , I shall vote for Hugh L. White for President . " " Very respectfully , " A. LINcoLN . " It would be hard to imagine a more audacious and unqualified declaration of principles and intentions . But it was the fashion of the hour to promise exact obedience to the will of the people , and the two practical questions touched by this circular were the only ones then much talked about . The question of suffrage for aliens was a living problem in the State , and Mr. Lincoln naturally took liberal ground on it ; and he was also in favor of getting from the sale of public lands a portion of the money he was ready to vote for internal improvements . This was good Whig doctrine at that time , and the young politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a matter the lead of his idol , Henry Clay . " This phrase seems to have been adopted as a formula by the anti-Jackson party . The " cards " of several candidates contain it . He made an active canvass , and spoke frequently during the summer . He must have made some part of the campaign on foot , for we find in the county paper an advertisement of a horse which had strayed or been stolen from him while on a visit to Springfield . It was not an imposing animal , to judge from the description ; it was " plainly marked with harness , " and was " believed to have lost some of his shoes " ; but it was a large horse , as suited a cavalier of such stature , and " trotted and paced " in a serviceable manner . In July a rather remarkable discussion took place at the county seat , in which many of the leading men on both sides took part . Mr. Ninian Edwards , son of the late Governor , is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed him , was so roused by his energetic attack that he felt his only resource was a flat contradiction , which in those days meant mischief . In the midst of great and increasing excitement Dan Stone and John Calhoun made speeches which did not tend to pour oil on the waters of contention , and then it came to Mr. Lincoln 's turn . An article in the " Journal " states that he seemed embarrassed in his opening , for this was the most important contest in which he had ever been engaged . But he soon felt his easy mastery of his powers come back to him , and finished by making what was universally regarded as the strongest speech of the day . One of his colleagues says that on this occasion he used in his excitement for the first time that singularly effective clear tenor tone of voice which afterwards became so widely known in the political battles of the West . The canvass was an energetic one throughout , and excited more interest in the district than even the presidential election which occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the poll by a majority greatly in excess of the average majority of his friends , which shows conclusively how his influence and popularity had increased . The Whigs in this election effected a revolution in the politics of the county . By force of their ability and standing they had before managed to divide the suffrages of the people , even while they were unquestionably in the minority ; but this year they completely defeated their opponents and gained that control of the county which they never lost as long as the party endured . BEDLAM LEGISLATION . IF Mr. Lincoln had no other claims to be remembered than his services in the Legislature of 1836-7 , there would be little to say in his favor . Its history is one of disaster to the // State . Its legislation was almost wholly unwise and hurtful . The most we can say for Mr. Lincoln is that he obeyed the will of his constituents , as he promised to do , and labored with singular skill and ability to accomplish the objects desired by the people who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the subdivision of the county , and the project for the removal of the capital of the State to Springfield. * In both of these he was successful . In the account of errors and follies committed by the Legislature to the lasting injury of the State , he is entitled to no praise or blame beyond the rest . He shared in that sanguine epidemic of financial and industrial quackery which devastated the entire community , and voted with the best men of the country in favor of schemes which appeared then like a promise of an immediate millennium , and seem now like midsummer madness . He entered political life in one of those eras of delusive prosperity which so often precede great financial convulsions . The population of the State was increasing at the enormous rate of two hundred per centum in ten years . It had extended northward along the lines of the wooded valleys of creeks and rivers in the center to Peoria ; on the west by the banks of the Mississippi to .

The rich soil and equable climate were now attracting an excellent class of settlers from the older States , and the long-neglected northern counties were receiving the attention they deserved . The war of Black Hawk had brought the country into notice ; the utter defeat of his nation had given the guarantee of a permanent peace ; the last lodges of the Pottawatoinies had disappeared from the country in 18334 The money spent by the General Government during the war , and paid to the volunteers at its close , added to the common prosperity . There was a brisk trade in real estate , and there was even a beginning in Chicago of that passion for speculation in town lots which afterwards became a frenzy . It was too much to expect of the Illinois Legislature that it should understand that the best thing it could do to forward this prosperous tendency of things was to do nothing ; for this is a lesson which has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years they had been tinkering , at first modestly and tentatively , at a scheme of * Lincoln was at the head of the project to remove the seat of government to Springfield ; it was entirely intrusted to him to manage . The members were all internal improvements which should not cost too much money . In 1833 they began to grant charters for railroads , which remained in embryo , as the stock was never taken . Surveys for other railroads were also proposed , to cross the State in different directions ; and the project of uniting Lake Michigan with the Illinois River by a canal was of too evidant utility to be overlooked . In fact , the route had been surveyed , and estimates of cost made , companies incorporated , and all preliminaries completed many years before , though nothing further had been done , as no funds had been offered from any source . But at the special session of 1835 a law was passed authorizing a loan of half a million dollars for this purpose ; the loan was effected by Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canal commissioners having been appointed , a beginning was actually made with pick and shovel . A restless feeling of hazardous speculation seemed to be taking possession of the State . " It commenced , " says Governor Ford , in his admirable chronicle , " at Chicago , and was the means of building up that place in a year or two from a village of a few houses to be a city of several thousand inhabitants . The story of the sudden fortunes made there excited at first wonder and amazement ; n ext , a gambling spirit of adventure ; and lastly , an all-absorbing desire for sudden and splendid wealth . Chicago had been for some time only one great town-market . The plots of towns for a hundred miles around were carried there to be disposed of at auction . The Eastern people had caught the mania . Every vessel coming west was loaded with them , their money and means , bound for Chicago , the great fairy-land of fortunes . But as enough did not come to satisfy the insatiable greediness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Eastern markets . In fact , lands and town lots were the staple of the country , and were the only articles of export . " The contagion spread so rapidly , towns and cities were laid out so profusely , that it was a standing joke that before long there would be no land left in the State for farming purposes . The future of the State for many years to come was thus discounted by the fervid imaginations of its inhabitants . " We have every requisite of a great empire , " they said , " except enterprise and inhabitants , " and they thought that a little enterprise would bring the inhabitants . Through the spring and summer of 1836 the talk of internal improveelected on one ticket , but they all looked to Lincoln as the head-STEPHEN T. LOGAN . I Ford , p. io2 . I Reynolds 's " Life and Times . " * Ford , p. m8i. // ments grew more general and more clamorous . The candidates for office spoke about little else , and the only point of emulation among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandiose in its promises . XVhen the time arrived for the assembling of the Legislature , the members were not left to their own zeal and the recollection of their campaign pledges , but meetings and conventions were everywhere held to spur them up to the fulfillment of their mandate . The resolutions passed by the principal body of delegates who came together in December directed the Legislature to vote a system of internal improvements " commensurate with the wants the people , " a phrase which is never lacking in the mouth of the charlatan or the demagogue . These demands were pressed upon a not reluctant Legislature . They addressed themselves at once to the work required of them , and soon devised , with reckless and unreasoning haste , a scheme of railroads covering the vast uninhabited prairies as with a gridiron . There was to be a railroad from Galena to the mouth of the Ohio River ; from Alton to Shawneetown ; from Alton to Mount Carmel ; from Alton to the eastern State boundaryby virtue of which lines Alton was to take the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wabash River ; from Bloomington to Pekin ; from Peoria to Warsaw ; - in all , one thousand three hundred and fifty miles of railway . Some of these terminal cities were not in existence except upon neatly designed surveyors ' maps . The scheme provided also for the improvement of every stream in the State on which a child 's shingle-boat could sail ; and to the end that all objections should be stifled on the part of those neighborhoods which had neither railroads nor rivers , a gift of two hundred thousand dollars was voted to them , and with this sop they were fain to be content and not trouble the general joy . To accomplish this stupendous scheme , the Legislature voted eight million dollars , to be raised by loan. * Four millions were also voted to complete the canal . These sums , monstrous as they were , were still ridiculously inadequate to the purpose in view . But while the frenzy lasted there was no consideration of cost or of possibilities . These vast works were voted without estimates , without surveys , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason seemed to be silent in the Assembly ; only the utterances of fervid prophecy found listeners . Governor Ford speaks of one orator who insisted , amid enthusiastic plaudits , that the State could well afford to borrow one hundred millions for internal im * Ford 's " History , " p. 184. provements . The process of reasoning , or rather predicting , was easy and natural . The roads would raise the price of land ; the State could enter large tracts and sell them at a profit ; foreign capital would be invested in land , and could be heavily taxed to pay bonded interest ; and the roads , as they were built , could be operated at a great profit to pay for their own construction . The climax of the whole folly was reached by the provision of law directing that work should be begun at once at the termini of all the roads and the crossings of all rivers . It is futile and disingenuous to attempt , as some have done , to fasten upon one or the other of the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Governor and a majority of the Legislature were elected as Jackson Democrats , but the Whigs were as earnest in passing these measures as their opponents ; and after they were adopted , the superior wealth , education , and business capacity of the Whigs had their legitimate influence , and they filled the principal positions upon the boards and commissions which came into existence under the acts . The bills were passed by a large majority , and the news was received by the people of the State with the most extravagant demonstrations of delight . The villages were illuminated ; bells were rung in the rare steeples of the churches ; " fire-balls , " bundles of candlewick soaked in turpentine , were thrown by night all over the country . The day of payment was far away , and those who trusted the assurances of the sanguine politicians thought that in some mysterious way the scheme would pay for itself . Mr. Lincoln is continually found voting with his friends in favor of this legislation , and there is nothing to show that he saw any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such in favor of internal improvements in general and a liberal construction of constitutional h ? w in such matters . As a boy , he had interested himself in the details of local improvements of rivers and roads , and he doubtless went with the current in Vandalla in favor of this enormous system . He took , however , no prominent part in the work by which these railroad bills were passed . He considered himself as specially commissioned to procure the removal of the State capital from Vandaha to Springfield , and he applied all his energies to the accomplishment of this work . The enterprise was hedged around with difficulties ; for although it was everywhere agreed , except at Vandalia , that the capital ought to be moved , every city in the State , and several which existed only on paper , demanded to be made the seat of government . The ques // tion had been submitted to a popular vote in 1834 , and the result showed about as many cities desirous of opening their gates to the Legislature as claimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield was only third in popular estimation , and it was evident that Mr. Lincoln had need of all his wits if he were to fulfill the trust confided to him . It is said by Governor Ford that the " Long Nine " were not averse to using the hopes and fears of other members in relation to their special railroads to gain their adherence to the Springfield programme , but this is by no means clear . We are rather inclined to trust the direct testimony of Mr. Jesse K. Dubois , that the success of the Sangamon County delegation in obtaining the capital was due to the adroit management of Mr. Lincoln - first in inducing all the rival claimants to unite in a vote to move the capital from Vandalia , and then in carrying a direct vote for Springfield through the joint convention by the assistance of the southern counties . His personal authority accomplished this in great part . Mr. Dubois says , " He made Webb and me vote for the removal , though we belonged to the southern end of the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitywould ultimately force the seat of government to a central position . But in reality we gave the vote to Lincoln because we liked him , because we wanted to oblige our friend , and because we recognized him as our leader . " To do this , they were obliged to qnarrel with their most intimate associates , who had bought a piece of waste land at the exact geographical center of the State and were striving to have the capital established there in the interest of their own pockets and territorial symmetry . The bill was passed only a short time before the Legislature adjourned , and the Long Nine came back to their constituents , wearing their well-won laurels . They were complimented in the newspapers , at public meetings , and even at subscription dinners . We read of one at Springfield , at the " Rural Hotel , " to which sixty guests sat down , where there were speeches by Browning , Lincoln , Douglas ( who had resigned his seat in the Legislature to become Register of the Land Office at the new capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose wit and wisdom were lost to history through the absence of reporters . Another dinner was given them at Athens a few weeks later . Among the toasts on these occasions were two which we may transcribe : VOL XXXIII. - 36 . " Abraham Lincoln : He has fulfilled the expectations of his friends , and disappointed the hopes of his enemies " ; and " A. Lincoln : One of Nature 's noblemen . " THE LINCOLN-STONE PROTEST . ON the 3d of March , the day before the Legislature adjourned , Mr. Lincoln caused to be entered upon its records a paper which excited but little interest at the time , but which will probably be remembered long after the good and evil actions of the Vandalia Assembly have faded away from the minds of men . It was the authentic record of the beginning of a great and momentous career . The following protest was presented to the House , which was read and ordered to be spread on the journals , to wit : " Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same . " They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than . abate its evils . " They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power under the Constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different States . " They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power , under the Constitution , to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia , but that the HON. 0 . H. BROWNIHO . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH av WAIDE. ) // power ought not to be exercised , unless at the request passed by the Indiana territorial Legislature of the people of the District , qwq was not enough for the advocates of slavery . Soon after the adoption of the State Constitution , which prohibited slavery " hereafter , " it was evident that there was a strong undercurrent of desire for its introduction into the State . Some of the leading politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it a means of personal advancement , and began to agitate the question of a convention to amend the Constitution . At that time there was a considerable emigration setting through the State from Kentucky and Tennessee to Missouri . Day by day the teams of the movers passed through Illinois settlements , and wherever they halted for rest and refreshment they would affect to deplore the short-sighted policy which , by prohibiting slavery , had prevented their settling in that beautiful country . When young bachelors came from Kentucky on trips of business or pleasure , they dazzled the eyes of the women * and excited the envy of their male rivals with qwq not for Thomas , their candidate for senator . Jn such a dilemma they determined not to choose , but impartially to use both . They gave the seat to Hanson , and with his vote elected Thomas ; they then turned him out , gave the place to Shaw , and with his vote carried the act for submitting the convention question to a popular vote . They were not more magnanimous in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained it . The night after the vote was taken they formed in a wild and drunken procession , and visited the residences of the Governor and the other free-State leaders , with loud and indecent demonstrations of triumph . They considered their success already assured ; but they left out of view the value of the moral forces called into being by their insolent challenge . The better class of people in the State , those heretofore unknown in politics , the schoolmasters , the ministers , immediately prepared for the contest , which became one of the severest the State has ever known . They established three newspapers , and sustained them with money and contributions . The Governor gave his entire salary for four years to the expenses of this contest , in which he had no personal interest whatever . The anti-slavery members of the Legislature made up a purse of a thousand dollars . They spent their money mostly in printer 's ink and in the payment of active and zealous colporteurs . The result was an overwhelming defeat for the slave party . The convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of 11,612 , and the State saved forever from slavery . But these supreme efforts of the advocates of public morals , uninfluenced by considerations of personal advantage , are of rare occurrence , and necessarily do not survive the exigencies that call them forth . The apologists of slavery , beaten in the canvass , were more successful in the field of social opinion . In the reaction which succeeded the triumph of the anti-slavery party , it seemed as if there had never been any anti-slavery sentiment in the State . They had voted , it is true , against the importation of slaves from the South , but they were content to live under a code of Draconian ferocity , inspired by the very spirit of slavery , visiting the immigration of free negroes with penalties of the most savage description . Even Governor Coles , the publicspirited and popular politician , was indicted and severely fined for having brought his own freedmen into the State and having assisted them in establishing themselves around him upon farms of their own . The Legislature remitted the fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , though the Supreme Court afterwards overruled this decision . Any mention of the subject of slavery was thought in the worst possible taste , and no one could avow himself opposed to it without the risk of social ostracism . Every town had its one or two abolitionists , who were regarded as harmless or dangerous lunatics , according to the energy with which they made their views known . From this arose a singular prejudice against New England people . It was attributable partly to the natural feeling of distrust of strangers which is common to ignorance and provincialism , but still more to a general suspicion that all Eastern men were abolitionists . Mr. Cook , who so long represented the State in Congress , used to relate with much amusement how he once spent the night in a farmer 's cabin , and listened to the honest man 's denunciations of that Yankee Cook . Cook was a KenHON . JOHN T. STUART . ( FROM THE DAGUERREOTYPE IN POSSESSION OF HIS WIFE. ) // tuckian , but his enemies could think of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling him a Yankee . Senator McDougal once told us that although he made no pretense of concealing his Eastern nativity , he never could keep his ardent friends in Pike County from denying the fact and fighting any one who asserted it . The great preacher , Peter Cartwright , used to denounce Eastern men roundly in his sermons , calling them " imps who lived on oysters " instead of honest corn-bread and bacon . The taint of slavery , the contagion of a plague they had not quite escaped , was on the people of Illinois . They were strong enough to rise once in their might and say they would not have slavery among them . But in the petty details of every day , in their ordinary talk , and in their routine legislation , their sympathies were still with the slave-holders . They would not enlist with them , but they would fight their battles in their own way . Their readiness to do what came to be called later , in a famous speech , the " dirty work " of the South was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this very year of 1837 . He had for some years been publishing a religious newspaper in St. Louis , but finding the atmosphere of that city becoming dangerous to him on account of the freedom of his comments upon their institutions , he moved to Alton , in Illinois , a few miles further up the river . His arrival excited an , and the good people were at leisure - and threw his press into the Mississippi . Having thus expressed their determination to vindicate the law , they held a meeting , and cited him before it to declare his intentions . He said they were altogether peaceful and legal ; that he intended to publish a religious newspaper and not meddle with politics . This seemed satisfactory to the people , and he was allowed to fish out his press , buy new types , and set up his paper . But Mr. Lovejoy was a predestined martyr . He felt there was a " woe " upon him if he held his peace against the wickedness across the river . He wrote and published what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again vehemently moved . A committee appointed itself to wait upon him ; for this sort of outrage is usually accomplished with a curious formality which makes it seem to the participants legal and orderly . The preacher met them with an undaunted front and told them he must do hs duty as it apl ) eared to him ; that he was amenable to law , but nothing else ; he even spoke in condemnation of mobs . Such language " from a minister of the gospel " shocked and infuriated the committee and those whom they represented . " The l ) eople assembled , " says Governor Ford , " and quietly took the press and types and threw them into the river . " We venture to say that the word " quietly " never before found itself in such company . It is not worth while to give the details of the bloody drama that now rapidly ran to its close . There was a futile effort at compromise , which to Lovejoy meant merely surrender , and which he firmly rejected . The threats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surrounded the abolitionist . A new press was ordered , and arrived , and was stored in a warehouse , where Lovejoy and his friends shut themselves up , determined to defend it with their lives . They were there besieged by the infuriated crowd , and after a short interchange of shots Lovejoy was killed , his friends dispersed , and the press once more - and this time finally - thrown into the turbid flood . These events took place in the autumn of 1837 , but they indicate sufficiently the temper of the people of the State in the earlier part of the year . There was no sympathy nor even toleration for any public expression of hostility to slavery . The zeal of the followers of Jackson , although he had ceased to be President , had been whetted by his public denunciations of the anti-slavery propaganda ; little more than a year before he had called upon Congress to take measures to " prohibit under severe penalties " the further progress of such incendiary proceedings as were " calculated to stimulate the slaves to insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But in spite of all this , the people with uneasy consciences continued to write and talk and petition Congress against slavery , and most of the State Legislatures began to pass resolutions denouncing them . Those passed by the Illinois Legislature have not been recorded , but they were doubtless as vehement as possible , for a Legislature so deeply engaged in financial legerdemain as this never fails to denounce with especial energy anything likely to injure the prospects of trade . The resolutions went the way of all buncombe ; the sound and fury of them have passed away into silence ; but they woke an echo in one sincere heart which history will be glad to perpetuate . There was no reason that Abraham Lincoln should take especial notice of these resolutions , more than another . He had done his work at this session in effecting the removal of the capital . He had only to shrug his shoulders at the violence and untruthfulness of the majority , vote against them , and go back to his admiring constituents , to his dinners and his toasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be silent ; he felt a word must be said on the other side to redress the distorted balance . He wrote his protest , saying not one word he was not ready to stantl by then and thereafter , wasting not a syllable in rhetoric or feeling , keeping close to law and truth and justice . When he had tinished it he showed it to some of his colleagues for their adhesion ; but one and all refused , except Dan Stone , who was not a candidate for reelection , having retired from politics to a seat on the bench . The risk was too great for the rest to run . Lincoln was twenty-eight years old ; after a youth of singular l ) rivations and struggles he had arrived at an enviable position in the politics and the societx- of the State . His intimate friends , those whom he loved and honored , were Browning , Butler , Logan , and Stuart ,  --  Kentuckians all , and strongly averse to any discussion of the question of slavery . The public opinion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , was all the same way . But all these considerations could not withhold him from performing a simple duty  --  a duty which no one could have blamed him for leav ing undone . The crowning grace of the whole act is in the closing sentence : " The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions is their reason for entering this l ) rOtest . " Reason enough for the Lincolns and Luthers . He had many years of growth and development before him . There was a long distance to be traversed between the guarded utterances of this protest and the heroic audacity which launched the proclamation of emancipation . But the young man who dared declare , in the prosperous beginning of his political life , in the midst of a community imbued with slave-State superstitions , that " he believed the institution of slavery was founded both on injustice and bad policy , " - attacking thus its moral and material supports , while at the same time recognizing all the constitutional guarantees which protected it ,  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need be , a martyr . His whole career was to run in the lines marked out by these words , written in the hurry of a closing session , and he was to accomplish few acts , in that great history which God reserved for him , wiser and nobler than this .
