txt Joseph Stiokney 's steam yacht Susquehanna , with President Cleveland , Private Secretary Lamont , Postmaster-General Don M. Dickinson , Smith M. Weed , James J. Hill . and her owner on board , came to anchor 200 yards off the Surf House , Fire Island . at 9 o'clock this morning . The.arrival of the Presidential party was entirely unexpected , but it took a marvelously snort time to spread the news of its coming among 300 guests of the hotel and the oottagers along the beach ; therefore , when the big pleasure yacht came to anchor over 500 people , comprising every ablebodied person in this ' part of the island , had gathered at the wharf to catch a glimpse of the vessel that carried so distinguished a personage as the President of the United States . All sorts of marine glasses were brought into requisition , but even they could not bring the yacht into range close enough to permit a sight of the great man . Nevertheless the crowd remained on the wharf for two hours , or until after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anchor at Sandy Hook during Thursday night , and as Presideut Cleveland and all his party remained on board the statement that he visited Don ltl . Dickinson 's cottage at Bath Beach is manifestly untrue . The vessel started from bandy Hook just after daylight this morning , and arrived off the Fire Island bell buoy at 7:45 A. M. She was compelled to wait at this point three-quarters of an hour for a pilot , when she at once proceeded to her anchorage . Immediately upon the arrival of the yacht preparations were made for a bluefishing cruise in Great South Bay . The sloop Geraldine , Capt . " Dude " Wicks , and the Scud , Capt . Charlie Wicks of the life-saving station , were engaged as fishing smacks . Both of these lively little vessels were fitted out with all or the required tackle , including a full supply of chumming bait , or " moss bunkers . " The party divided up , with the President , Col. Lamont , and Mr. Stickney in the Geraldine , and with Mr-Dickinson , Mr. Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock the party started for the fishing grounds iu West Channel , off Elbow Point . The wind was blowing from the southeast , and the sloops bad the want abeam on the run to the grounds . The result was that they kept almost side by side to an anchorage . Wneu they did come to anchor , about 11:45 , they were within easy speaking distance of each other . Most of the gentlemen used poles and lines , and the President manipulated his favorite bamboo rod . Mr. Cleveland was dressed in a blue serge suit , and wore a gray flannel shirt . Col. Lamont and the other members of the party also wore yachting shirts . The President 's usual luck attended him during the morning , according to Capt . Cushing of the Susquehanna , who states that Mr. Cleveland caught even more than his share of the 24 goodlysized bluefish which made up the aggregate of the morning 's catch . Most of the fish weighed about two pounds , and the President was made the hero of the occasion by pulling in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which was served up baked for his dinner tonight on the Susquehau ua . At 1:30 o'clock the fishermen weighed anchor and started back for the yacht , which they reached at 2:30 . After a luncheon on the Susqueuanna another trip was made to the same place at about 4 P. M. On this second voyage to the fishing grounds the conditions of tide was more favorable , and the luck was better than in the morning . At dusk , when 57 more bluefish had been secured , the sport was abandoned Sor the day . and the Party returned to the Susquehanna for dinner . Of the entire number of fish caught , Mr. Cleveland hauled iu more than his average . He fished very energetically , and seemed to hugely enjoy hauling the hard-pulling and lively blue beauties out of the deep . Mr. Cleveland did not Come ashore at any time during the day , and does not intend to do so during his stay in these waters . All callers at the companion-way of the yacht , for either President Cleveland or Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive visitors in Washington , nut now they . were on a vacation , and must ask to be excused . The weather was not at all favorable to-day for successful fishing . Rain fell frequently , and during the afternoon the showers were very heavy . The Prostuent and his party will remain here all day to-morrow for another day of bluefish catching . The men on the Susquehanna decline to give any information as to where the yacht will go after leaving here , and the guests are unapproachable . All of the party are in excellent spirits and all are enjoying splendid health . Mr. Cleveland is said to have been delignted with his first day 's sport . There was a story about the Surf House tonight that Mr. Cleveland 's party had not caught a single fish during the day , and that they bought all they brought back from a smack . This was traced to a party of Republican jokers , and Capt . Cushing is positive that 81 fish in all were captured . It is reported that the President will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening ho will go to see " Nero " at Staten Island .
