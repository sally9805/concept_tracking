Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : LEXINGTON. 1776-1876. from America 1884 Thou , God of nations , wast , in battle 's hour , Our Shield , our Strength , our Helper , and our Tower ; O'er all our paths Thy sheltering wings were spread ; Our feet , through all the years , Thy wisdom led . Joy from each grief , and strength from trials grew ; God wrought our blessings from the woes we knew ; Taught us , by Him preserved , in Him to stand , And made us walk in Freedom 's promised land . So round the oak the tempests drive and beat  --  Winter 's stern blasts and summer 's fervid heat ; Time 's mighty clock counts off its hundred years  --  Its verdant beauty still the monarch wears . As on the ages roll , in solemn sweep , With pillared cloud and fire our pathways keep ; O'er all the land we love , in glory shine  --  Thine is the work , the praise be ever Thine .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
