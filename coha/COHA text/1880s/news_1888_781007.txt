txt E. B. Bradley , Teller of the Union National Bank , was not at his post to-day , and the bank 's officers were strongly of the opinion that he had gone to Canada . They had made up their minds that after 10 years ' service in the institution he had-fled to avoid the consequences of a defaleation . One day nearly a week ago it was discovered that something was wrong with Teller Bradley 's &books.; In looking over them Cashier Oakley saw unmistakable evidence that there were irregularities in them It was found that whenever they would not balance the Teller had been in the habit of using the forcing process and seemingly succeded to an admirable degree . The discrepancies in the accounts were found to extend back for some time . How much they represent and how much the Teller succeeded in appropriating is something that the officers decline to make public . In spite of the discovery of the irregularities in his accounts Bradley did not leave the bank until some . days after the officers , knew that something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty as usual . Whether or not he was informed at that time that the discrepancies had been discovered can not ' be said , but certain it is that a plan of escape was soon matured . Permission was given him to visit the dentist , as he complained that he was suffering severely from an aching tooth . Probably the toothache was caused by a hint that trouble was in store for him . At any rate , his visit to the dentist proved to nave no end so far as the bank . was concerned . Bradley did not return . On Sunday morning Cashier Oakley saw Bradley 's brother . The Cashier wanted the missing man to come to the bank and straighten out his books . The brother was dumfounded . " I do n't know where he is , " he exclaimed ; " all I do know is that his wife says he was not at home last night . " And so , for the present , Teller Bradley has dropped completely out of sight so far as his friends and relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dank , is in Europe at present , and Cashier Oakley in his absence proved very reticent when the reporters visited him for particulars of the case . Mr. Oakley expressed the deepest regret that the matter had become public , as it was the intention quietly to drop the subject . When he found , however , that it was a matter of street gossip he consented to tell the main points of the story . He added that the bank officers never had any occasion to suspect that Bradley was any-a thing but strictly honest until the revelations of the last few days . " I should judge , " continued Mr. Oakley , a ' that he had been in the employ of the beak for 10 years . We had the most implicit confidence in him , So far as we are able to judge , he had not a vice . He seemed to live a quiet and exemplary life . " As to the amount of the shortage Caseier Oakley was almost dumb . He would say that it was a mere bagatelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands he declined to state . Other officers were similarly reticent , but it leaked out this afternoon that they had made up their minds to capture the missing man if possible and to make an example of him . It is reported that detectives are looking in him and that one of them has succeeded n getting a clue to his whereabouts . It is probable that he has gone to Canada and by this time is sate from the American police . Teller Bradley lived quietly at South Evanston . He has a wife and one child and a host of acquaintances , both in the city and the suburbs . Among them all his reputation has always been excellent , and no suspicion was entertained that he was living beyond his means or engaging in any expensive diversions . One or two of his relatives , however , had an idea that he was in trouble . Bradley 's brother is a bookkeeper for George B. Carpenter &; Co. , wholesale ship chandlers . " I knew that the boy was in trouble , " said he this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never lived beyond his means , and I ca n't believe that he is a defaulter . He has been missing from home since Saturday morning , and I have no idea where he is now . "
