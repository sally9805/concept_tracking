txt There is nothing more beautiful than the love of a brother for a sister . This has been said so often that it has acquired the force of an axiom . If for the last hundred years mankind had been accustomed to say that fraternal love is warm , or square , or spheroidal , or blue , we should all admit the truth of the saying without the slightest examination . Mr. Watkins , whose place of residence is not mentioned  --  not only as an evidence of good faith , but as a saving of trouble  --  has been generally regarded by his neighbors as a man exceptionally kind and good to his sister . This is the more remarkable because he is a dentist . There can be but little doubt that the habit of pulling and filling teeth chills the admiration which the natural man has for the fair sex . The dentist is trained to look upon woman simply as a being with cavities in her teeth which require filling , or as a field for the use of forceps . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to work for his own pecuniary benefit . It is believed that dentists never kiss their wives , sisters , or daughters , but that-their most tender caresses are made with steel instruments . If the dentist feels what he imagines to be a thrill of marital affection , he either inspects his wife 's mouth with a mirror or explores it with a sharp steel crowbar . The moral qualities of dentists may be all right , but it is only reasonable to believe that they can not cultivate affection for the sex and practice their painful profession at the same time . Mr. Watkins 's love for his sister took the form of training her for his profession . He thought that women are peculiarly fitted to practice dentistry , and he looked forward to the time when he could take his sister into partnership , and advertise that " ladies would be pulled and ffiled by Miss Watkins . " The young lady took very kindly to her brother 's plan , and studied dentistry with much ardor . From time to time Mr. Watkins hired colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in colored teeth and afterward pulled them in a way that greatly pleased her brother , though it is only fair to say that the boys themselves did not show any signs of enthusiasm for dentistry . Miss Watkins became in time quite proficient in filling and pulling , and she thereupon desired to learn the art of making artificial teeth . It was not easy for her to get a subject . The supply of small colored boys was exhausted , and Mr. Watkins did not dare to let his sister try her ' prentice hand in making false teeth for his regular customers . A plan , however , was finally devised by which Miss Watkins would be furnished with a subject . Mr. Watkins argued that if his sister could induce some woman to have all her upper teeth pulled he would furnish the materials for a new set to be made by Miss Watkins free of cost . After diligent effort Miss Watkins found a lady , to wit , Miss Boardman , who wished to have a set of upper teeth , and who gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She called at the office on a fixed day , and , occupying the fatal chair , allowed herself to be placed under the influence of chloroform , so that the halfdozen damaged teeth could be removed from her upper jaw to make room for the new set . Miss Watkins enjoyed pulling teeth ? in fact , this was the branch of her profession for which she had a wild enthusiasm  --  and she had never met with teeth which pulled more delightfully than those of Miss Boardman . They were large teeth , firmly rooted , and Miss Watkins felt a fierce joy in the muscular effort of dragging them to the light . So fascinated was she that when she had thoroughly cleared the upper jaw she was unable to resist the temptation to continue , and she therefore pulled every one of the sixteen sound lower teeth of Miss Boardman before that unfortunate person recovered consciousness . The rage of Miss Boardman was great , and she suffered it to betray her into remarks which Mr. Watkins held to be insulting to his profession . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had agreed to furnish Miss Boardman with a full set of upper teeth , but that he had not agreed to furnish her with lower teeth , and should decline to do anything of the kind . Miss Watkins , for her part , said that she had never in her life met with a woman so unreasonable and ill-tempered as Miss Boardman , and since that person had been so childish as to get angry because she had had a few extra teeth pulled without charge , she would refuse to depart from the strict letter of her brother 's contract . If Miss Boardman still wanted a set of upper teeth she would make them , but as for her lower teeth , she had better put them in her pocket and leave the office without any further display of unladylike anger . Miss Boardman has since brought a suit against- the Watkinses for larceny of teeth , but it is thought by the best local lawyers that she can not recover damages , since , teeth are not recognized as personal property . The whole trouble has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister and his desire to make her an expert dentist . No doubt fraternal love is a beautiful thing , but had Mr. Watkins . had a little less of it Miss Boardman would not now be weeping and wailing and devoutly wishing she had some teeth to gnash.
