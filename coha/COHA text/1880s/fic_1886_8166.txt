Cooke , Rose Terry , 1827-1892 : MY BLOSSOM . from My blossom 1886 Once in my quiet garden A precious blossom grew ; Pink with the morning sunshine , And bright with early dew . But the Master of the garden Carried me far away , And with my precious blossom No longer could I stay . Oh ! bitter was the parting , And my tears fell fast like rain As I kissed the budding blossom I might not see again . Like Eve , in her woful passion , From the garden gate I passed ; One look of love and longing Sent backward for the last . But I said to the gracious Master , When my breath came back once more  --  " I know Thy hand is righteous Though my heart be smitten sore . " I can not tend my blossom With water and with sun ; I gave it to Thee , my Master , To see the work be done ! " Though I die by the wayside , Or wander in the showers ; Keep Thou my tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long days went by me , But never for a day , Though rolling up to hundreds , This prayer I cease to pray . And now I hear her praises Wafted on every air ; How sweet my lily groweth , How gentle and how fair . And I know the mighty Master Hath heard me day and night , And blessed her with His blessing Of beauty and delight . And my life sings like the water That runneth to the sea , For the Lord hath been to my lily All that I could not be . So now I wait with patience Till all the storm be passed , And He shall bring my blossom To Him  --  and me  --  at last .
