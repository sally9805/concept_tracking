txt Congress has been asked to loan $1,000 , - 000 to the managers of the New-Orleans Exposition . It has been discovered that the money subscribed by stockholders and contributed by the city  --  which ' will probably amount in all to $1,100,000 ? will not be sufficient to provide accommodations for the exhibitors who have already applied for space . The Loan bill agreed upon by a committee of the House seems to have been carefully framed , so as to insure the Government against loss . If it shall become a law it will be the duty of the managers to redouble their exertions and to spare no effort in the work of making the exhibition truly " national and international " in its scope and worthy in every way of the National Government 's protection and powerful aid . A report recently made to the President by the Director-General indicates that great interest has already been taken in the enterprise both at home and abroad . The main building affords 1,300,000 square feet of floor space , of which 800,000 feet may be assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Although eight months will elapse before the opening of the exhibition , eleven foreign Governments and twenty-four States and Territories have indicated their intention to take part . There is to be a very large Horticultural Hall , in ? which the fruits and flowers and plants of the tropical and semi-tropical regions are to be displayed . Mexico , Florida , California , and the republics of Central America will cover with gardens nearly a million square feet adjoining this hall . Forty acres - will be assigned to the farmers , and an equal area will be devoted to an exhibition of live stock . Extensive preparations have been made for an exhibition of educational methods . The exposition will be rendered peculiarly attractive by the exhibits of Mexico and the Central American republics , as well as by a display of the resources of our own States in the far South . The effect of a new . : impulse , due either to the direct application of Northern capital and energy , or to a wider knowledge gained by Southern men , may be plainly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved or supplanted by new , and where new industries have been established . One of the most powerful causes of what is in some respects an industrial revolution in that State arid adjoining regions was the exposition in Atlanta . An improvement of agricultural methods , the planting of new industries , and a development of natural resources heretofore neglected will undoubtedly follow the holding of a successful exhibition in New-Orleans . The exhibition will also bring us face to face with our neighbors over the border and tend to make our commercial and social relations with them more intimate . In Louisiana and the adjoining States there are millions of colored citizens . It is believed by those who are familiar with their ways and with the wants of the South in the field of skilled labor that this exhibition will teach them a lesson of great value  --  the lesson that it pays to be a good workman and to becom the master of some branch of industry . may be that the exposition will do great deal of good in this directior The colored people will surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole body of inhabitants in a large r ( religion .
