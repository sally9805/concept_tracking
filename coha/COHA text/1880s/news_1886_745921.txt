txt The trials of MCQUADE have shown beyond argument the necessity for additional trial facilities in the Court of General Sessions . During those trials the ordinary business of the court was confined to one court room , and as a result the city prison became overcrowded with persons awaiting trial . As some of these persons may be innocent of the crimes charged against them , their detention for several weeks in the city prison is not only unjust , but cruel . With additional facilities for disposing of cases with reasonable rapidity the city prison need never be crowded , nor need the pigeon holes in the District Attorney 's office be choked up as now with innumerable cases of persons out on bail . As matters stand a release on bail is equivalent to an indefinite discontinuance of all proceedings . The total number of bail cases awaiting the action of the court is not known oven in the District Attorney 's office , but it is estimated to be not less than three thousand . The Judges of the Court of General Sessions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent need of a third court room , and . have laid the matter before the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . They ask , in effect , that the Tax Receiver 's offices be removed from the General Sessions building , and that a sum of money be appropriated to change the vacated apace into a third court room . This is probably the best that can be done at present . As legal provision has already been made for the establishment of Part III . of the Court of General Sessions , any further delay in relieving the pressure upon the criminal calendars will rest solely with the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . It is to be hoped that Part III . may be opened for business before the close of the present court season .
