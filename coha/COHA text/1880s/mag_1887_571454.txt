ARTICLE Y.-STATE CONFISCATION OF UNEARNED INCREMENTS . IF I remember rightly , Mr. Mill 's famous phrase is always of the singular number . The only unearned increment known to him in the whole range of production , or at least the only one of which he takes account , is the unearned increment of land . The wages of labor and the profits of capital are the equivalent of work done , of abstinence endured or of risks taken ; but the rent of land is the equivalent of nothing at all . It is the excess of production over the cost of cultivation on the least fertile or the least accessible lands actually contributing to the supply of a given market at a given time ; and " emerges " entirely without an effort , a self-denial or a venture on the part of the fortunate owner . It has always seemed to me an extremely curious thing that IRicardo 's theory should have been fiercely disputed , and finally accepted , as if there were nothing else of the sort to be found among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noted farther on , I am not aware that any writer has attempted to generalize what is perhaps the most celebrated formula of the science . I speak with the hesitation becoming a reader who makes no pretence to having read everything , but within the range of my reading the doctrine remains very nearly where IRicardo left it . The practical effect is , that , so far as pure theory influences public opinion and political action , a particular class is selected for invidious distinction , and held up to something very like odium , as the possessors , and the only possessors , of wealth which does not belong to them . There are men who toil not , neither do they spin , who beget nothing , create nothing , give nothing , yet are growing rich , and daily richer , because everybody else is working for them ; the monstrous drones of the hive who fatten among the fierce competitions of industry , and in virtue of them . It is , of course , all right if the facts are so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for all concerned . // But considering the amount of inflammable and explosive material there is in every modern society , and how fast it is accumulating , there can at least be no harm in asking whether , after all , political economy is sure of its facts . Mr. Mill , at any rate , has no doubt about the matter , and , with that tranquillity of abstract speculation , which was so characteristic of him , has no fear of the consequences . That rent is an unearned increment and practically the only one , is for him not so much demonstrable as axiomatic . Therefore , he concludes ; let us turn to and tax the receiver of rents , if need be , up to the full amount of them . The Physiocrats , whom everybody refers to , apparently without having taken the trouble to understand them , had said precisely the same thing before ; but for precisely the opposite reason . In their thinking the landowner , so far from being the drone of the hive , is the producer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lands that the agricultural class is supported to be . gin with , and then from the surplus left ( the " net-product " ) that the manufacturing and trading classes are supported . If now you tax the agricultural class you simply increase by so much the cost of production ; and if you tax the " sterile " classes you simply diminish by so much the amount of consumption . In either case you attack the net-product which is the wealth of the land-owner . No tax can be laid anywhere between production and consumption which is not ultimately a tax on him . Simple justice and common sense prescribe , therefore , that the revenue of the State should be raised by the direct and exclusive taxation of the land-owner . But for Mr. Mill , and much more for the truculent little Mills of our day , the taxation of rents is a penal measure , the chastisement of an idler for idling , the confiscation to the State of ill-gotten wealth ; as it is coming to be put of " stolen goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a kind of income which constantly tends to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owner , these owners constituting a class in the community whom the natural course of things progressively enriches , consistently with complete passiveness on their part . In such a case there would be no violation of the principles on which private property is founded , if the State // should appropriate this increase of wealth , or any part of it , as it arises . This would not properly be taking anything from anybody ; it would merely be applying an accession of wealth , created by circumstances , to the benefit of society , instead of allowing it to become an unearned appendage to the riches of a particular class . " Now this is actually the case with the rent . The ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth , is at all times tending to augment the income of landlords . . - independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves . They grow richer , as it were , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Some people ask : But why single out land ? Does not all property rise in value with the increase of prosperity ? I answer , No . All other property fluctuates in value ; now up , now down . I defy any one to show any kind of property , not partaking of the soil , and sufficiently important to be worth considering , which tends steadily upward , without anything being done by the owners to give it increased value . So far from it that the other of the two kinds of property that yield income , namely , capital , instead of increasing , actually diminishes in value as society advances . The poorer the country , or the further back we go in history , the higher we find the interest of money to be . Land alone-using land as a general term for the whole material of the earth-has the privilege of steadily rising in value from natural causes ; and the reason is that land is strictly limited in quantity ; the supply does not increase to meet the constant increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the justice of the proposed confiscation , but only to inquire whether all the facts have been taken into account . I may remark , however , in passing , that before we dispossess the actual owner of anything we are bound to show not only that he has not earned the possession , but also that somebody else has ; it is not enough to take the stolen goods from the thief , we must hand them over to the man they were stolen from . We seize the rents of the landlord because he has done nothing to produce them . Who , then , has ? Circumstances , says Mr. Mill , in his large , abstract way . But rents can not well be // handed over to " circumstances " ; they must be hauded over to persons , and the persons indicated are the State , that is , the body-politic or the whole population acting collectively . Have all the individuals composing the State assisted in earning the stolen rents ? Or only some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Public utility " and " the benefit of society " are exceeding fine phrases , and perfectly appropriate , when it is a question of ordinary taxation ; but they are out of place when it comes to evicting a man found in possession of wealth he has not earned , for in this case we are bound to produce the man who earned them . This , and not the mere act of confiscation , which is one of the simplest of State functions , is the pleasant little problem furnished by Mr. Mill to future governments . We really ought not to make the State , i. e. , everybody , a receiver of stolen goods . But the question here is , whether the doctrine of iRicardo , on which the proposal is based , does not cover a good deal more ground ' than was at first supposed ; whether it is land only that yields an unearned increment , and the landlord alone for whose culpable riches a rightful owner must be found . I. Let it be admitted that Mr. Mill 's contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest is steadily declining because the augmenting volume of capital tends to wider diffusion , while the rate of rents is steadily rising because the fixed quantity of land tends to closer concentration . Still , when we remember that capital is the joint product of land and labor , it is not unreasonable to suggest that what Mr. Mill says of one of the factors of the product , land , is possibly also true of the other , labor . It is , to be sure , finplied in his statement that wages are falling along with rents , and for the same reason that labor is not a fixed quantity , like land , but , as population multiplies , is constantly augmenting , like capital ; and , therefore , can not be permanently monopolized in such a way as to produce unearned increments . Admitting the assimilation ( between labor and capital ) as we admitted the contrast ( between capital and land ) , it is still possible to dispute the conclusion . To make the issue perfectly clear , I affirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages , is monopolized exactly after the fashion of land , that is , so as to produce unearned increments. // For , after all , out of what do these peculiar monopolies arise ? Not in the least out of the fact that the quantity of land- " using land as a general term for the whole material of the earth " - is fixed beforehand and can not be increased to meet the increasing need of it . Most obviously , and in the very terms of the definition itself , they arise out of differences in the quality of land , and would arise exactly as they do now , were the whole material of the earth a hundred or a thousand times , or indefinitely greater than it actually is . Would the IRicardian theory cease to be true were the earth as large as Jupiter or the sun * If not , then II submit that the theory applies to labor , whether fixed or changing in quantity , if only labor , like land , is of various quality as regards production . If one class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one kind of soil is more productive ) , and if the increasing demand of the market brings into activity the less productive classes , then the former will at once possess a monopoly and begin to receive unearned increments ; that is , increments not due to their superiority ( although measured by it ) , for that remains what it was before , but due to the change in the economic situation , or , as Mr. Mill says , to " circumstances . " If anybody owned these laborers and hired them out to an employer , as land is owned and rented to the farmer , he would receive a rent for them , and , in " the ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth , " he would grow richer without " working , risking or economizing . " We need not go for an illustration a step beyond the hypothetical case always given in any statement of IRicardo 's theory . I will borrow what is necessary to the argument from the only one I happen to have at hand , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Let us imagine a village community , isolated from all others , and residing at the centre of a circular tract of land divided into four sectors equal in extent but so differing in fertility* that one piece will , with so many days of labor in the year , yield 24 bushels of wheat to the acre , while the second will * As the village is at the centre we may neglect the differences in accessibility to the market , which must ordillarily be allowed for as differences in fertility are . // yield , with the same amount of labor , but 22 bushels ; the third but 20 , aud the fourth but 18 . Now suppose that at a given time the whole demand of the community for wheat is exactly met by the yield of the whole twenty-four bushel tract . In this case the product will no more ( aud no less ) than suffice to replace the whole cost of productiou , and no rent will arise bushel tract will no longer raise all the wheat required for its subsistence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rent will at once emerge , as compensation for the use of the twenty-four bushel tract . What will be the amount of it ? The difference between the crops to be grown on the two soils , with the same application of , i. e. , two bushels . In like manner , if cultivation descends to the twenty bushel tract , the twenty-two bushel tract will bear a rent of two , the twentyfour bushel tract , of four bushels . And so , finally , when it reaches the tract of least fertility . In general , the rent of any piece of land is determined by the excess of its annual yield over that of the least productive land actually contributing to the supply of the same market , under equal applications of labor and capital . * The italics are mine , for at this point the argument comes in . Let us modify the supposition to the extent of supposing that when the whole of the twenty-four bushel tract , and no more , is required to meet the demand of the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cultivate it . If , now , the demand increases , cultivation will be driven down , not only to the soil of inferior fertility , but to the labor of inferior skill . According to the hypothesis , the best soil remaining at the disposition of the community yields 22 bushels to the acre , to the 24 bushels of the other tract , under equal applications of labor and capital . Evidently if an inferior , i. e. , a less productive kind of labor is applied , it will yield , not 22 bushels , but perhaps only 21 , or 20 , or even less , and the excess over this yielded by the twenty-four bushel tract , will not be 2 , but 3 or 4 bushels , or more , as the case may be . It is of course conceivable that the whole of this excess will go * Political Economy , by Francis A. Walker . American Science Series . // to the landlord as rent , but , in the conditions supposed , it will not go to him long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that the unearned increment is as much occasioned by their superior skill as by the superior fertility of his land , and their share of it will be taken out as an unearned increment of wages . Now in what way would it be pertinent to say in answer to this , that land-taking land as a general term for the whole material of the earth-is strictly limited iu quantity ? It is perfectly true ; but the only conclusion to be drawn is that the population which can be supported upon the earth , and , consequently , the labor that can be supplied by the population , and the capital that can be accumulated by it , are also strictly limited , for the very reason that laud is . As nobody can lengthen the diameter of the globe , there are limits which can not be passed , to land , labor , and capital alike . Evidently what concerns us here is not the prospective bounds which must ultimately arrest the progress of the race , but the rate at which lands , as yet unoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for them . Now this rate is strictly limited too ; but by what is it limited ? By the lack of land ? No , for it is part of the theory that when our village community , or the whole human race at its present stage of progress , outgrows the yield of its most fertile lands , other lands , less fertile , are waiting for cultivation . The rate at which unoccupied lands can be occupied is limited by the rate at which the actual population can provide labor to cultivate them . Put the population of the village at 5,000 , at the moment when the twenty-four bushel tract ceases to suffice for its subsistence . How fast can the other tracts be set to growing wheat ? As fast as laborers can be found to grow it . In the conditions assumed in any application of the theory , what is strictly limited is the available supply of labor ; not the land , which depends for cultivation , not the population , which depends for subsistence , upon the labor which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which something might be said  --  a good deal more than could be said with confidence when Mr. Mill wrote-that monopolies and unearned increments are to be looked for in the compensation of labor rather // than in that of land ; but that the distinctions relied on by Mr. Mill are either unreal or irrelevant ; and that in the matter under discussion , land and labor are about in the same case . The Theory , then , covers labor as well as land , if it be true that there are differences , natural or acquired , and not to be overcome , in the quality of labor , as there are in the quality of land . We know that there are ; wherever men are gathered for production there will be found , in every variety of bodily and mental aptitudes , laborers whose capability , as related to production , is exactly what the fertility of certain soils is . In both cases the superior productiveness will be monopolized , for the extremely simple reason that it is incommunicable ; and in the same circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society which increases in wealth , " it will yield , in one case as in the other , an unearned increment . I will take in illustration an instance with which I happen to be familiar , the manufacturing industries of the city of Geneva in Switzerland , and in particular the manufacture of watches , with which nearly all the others are closely associated . In the course of the last century , and with increasing rapidity of late years , the division of labor has been carried almost to its extreme limit , with the consequence that very minute differences in the ability of different laborers are brought to light , exactly as differences in the fertility of soils are by the product turned out . Gradually with the stricter organization of the industry there has grown up a sort of hierarchy , a classification of artisans according to relative merit , from the r*qleur , who gives the last touches to the completed instrument , down to the workman who manipulates a component part in the rough . Now , suppose that the demand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet it an inferior quality of labor is required ; is it not clear that the capacity to produce a better kind or a larger amount of watches ( like the ability to produce a better kind or a larger amount of wheat ) will yield an increment , measured , as before , by the superiority of producing power , but due to change in the situation ? Take , for example , the r*gleur , whose aptitudes , often inherited from generations of patient labor , are probably to be found nowhere out of western Switzerland , and are rare there ; what is there // to prevent his monopoly of skill from acquiring all the value of the most fertile soil contributing to the market for wheat , and acquiring it in the same form , as an unearned increment ? As I remarked above , the presence of the law regulating rents , in the sphere of wages , has not entirely escaped notice . My reference was to what I suppose , although I have just come upon it , is now the well-known identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land-owners , in the Political Economy of President Walker. * President Walker happens to be an authority who is aware that economic science was not born with Adam Smith , and has not been confined to English and American writers . It is , of course , his business to be familiar with the continental literature of the subject , but , what is a good deal rarer , he has made use of it . The imported word is sufficient proof of the origin of his bold distinction between the entrepreneur and the capitalist , with its consequence , the distinction between profits and interest . In the actual conditions of society the distinction is largely ideal and abstract , but , granting the standard assumption of the science , it is not to be refuted . The entrepreneur , or employer of labor and capital , is a man with special and incommunicable aptitudes for the conduct of business enterprises ; he monopoljzes a productive power for which , in every progressive society , there is sure to be an increasing demand . It results that his profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unearned increment , and they are not an element in the price of the product . It is not necessary to reproduce the demonstration here . I will only say that when the writer classes profits with rent to the exclusion of wages , as wefl as interest , I think we may venture to differ with him . In what particular . so far as this argument is concerned , does the entrepreneur differ from the r*qleur of my illustration ? He is simply , so far as I can see , a more intellectual and daring kind of laborer , to whom wider opportunities are offered and larger capital entrusted than to the ordinary laborer ; and what is true of his profits is , in its measure and so far as the organization of industry permits , true of the compensation of superior skill everywhere . * Part IV , chap . 4. // If all this is so , I suppose that I am bound to suggest some explanation of the anomaly that while the Law has passed out of rational controversy in the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of labor . I find an explanation in a well-known peculiarity of labor , which does not affect the amount of wages , but does most profoundly disturb their distribution . Land , although practically unlimited in quantity , so far as the actual or impending necessities of the race are concerned , is always a Jix*ure ; it can not be broken up into parcels and transported hither and thither where the necessity is greatest . But labor-taking labor as a general term for the aggregate of laborers-although limited in quantity at the moment of any given demand for it , is divisible into a multitude of units , each fitted for locomotion in any direction and to any distance desired . It results that the units may be intermingled in the same branch of production , without regard to differences in their quality as agents of production . Wherever this occurs  --  and it occurs everywhere in agriculture , manufactures , or trade , to the extent that industrial organization is incomplete- superior ability is lost in the multitude and confusion ; and the classification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which takes care of itself , becomes difficult or impossible . Ordinarily wages are paid , not by the piece , as they are , for example , at Geneva , but by the day of so many hours ; and the rate is fixed fo* good and bad alike , not by competition , but by custom , or by combinations of the employers , or by the tyranny of trades-unions . It does not follow from this that no unearned increments arise ; I hold that they arise everywhere , in wages as in rents , when the conditions assumed by the theory exist . What follows is , that the increments , after they arise , are divided between the employers and the employees , so that the action of the law disappears in the interminable complexity of final distribution . But if the tendency of things is toward that perfect organization of industry and that perfect freedom of competition which are the ideal of the economist , then more and more will the disturbing effects of custom , violence , and fraud disappear , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l it is worth . In that event it seems to me certain that unless // the State interferes to avert monopolies and unearned increments , they will no more be averted for labor than for land . On the whole I incline to the opinion that the State will do well to postpone its interference to the era of the realized ideal . If it confiscates anybody 's unearned increments it must everybody 's , and in the present condition of affairs the increments of wages will be an uncommonly hard thing to get at and dispose of . Finally , then , is there , in the matter under consideration , no fundamental difference whatever between land and labor ? Why , yes , there is-one , which most of us find to be fundamental enough . Land , and the laborer on it , or anywhere , are both instruments of production , and both , in the same circumstances , will become occasions of unearned increments . But while one of the instruments wears out in forty or fifty years , the other wears for ages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redress this deplorable inequality , by all means let it try ; only , if it is thinking of doing this by punishing the land-owner , we may observe that nature has already attended to that , for he too , like the laborer under him , must leave his rents and go the way of all the earth . Rents are accumulated , as wages are , by the instrument of production , but not by the owner of them beyond the term of his life . If it be insisted further that the owner can liequeath his rents , and so provide for their continuous accumulation , I reply , No , he can't-not fitture rents ; he can only bequeath the instrument which occasions them . What you are proposing is the confiscation of the land itself , a matter with which I have no concern here . II . Nobody , says Prof. Fawcett , will ever be perfectly at home in political economy who has not fathomed the mystery of capital . The warning is issued rather ruefully , as if the Professor had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , ever since Adam Smith imposed his definition upon the science , a sort of fog has drifted in after it , that sometimes seems a little too thick for the most expert navigator . Capital , in the definition , is as sharply distinguished from land and labor as either is from the other , and the term is constantly in use as if its full meaning were perfectly settled , and all its boundaries and bearings exactly determined , But when // we get down to its real functions we find it shading off into both land and labor by such insensible gradations that it is nearly impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins It has remained from its first appearance a sort of " undistribnted middle , " which vitiates the most careful calculations by letting in implications nobody suspects . Mr. Mill was , by common consent , the first logician and the first economist of his day , but in the passage already quoted he appears to have gone ashore in shoal water , as if he had never been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , to show any kind of property , not partaking of the soil , which tends steadily npward , without anything being done by the owners to give it increased value . So far from it that the other of the two kinds which yield income , namely , capital , instead of increasing , actually diminishes in value as society advances . The poorer the country , or the further back we go in history , the higher we find the interest of money to be . Now when we say that rents are rising , what is implied ? Plainly that the land.owner is growing richer , and that in two ways , by the accumulation of his rents , and by the appreciation of his land . This is the gravamen of his offence , that being an idler he contiunally gets richer . But what is the implication when we say that interest is falling , or , as Mr. Mill puts it , that capital is diminishing in value ? That the capitalist is growing poorer ? So far from it that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill ) why interest is falling is , that capital is growing more abundant , i. e. , that the capitalist is getting richer . Interest is going down , cries Mr. Mill , in his wrath with the landlord and his commiseration for the capitalist . So it is ; but what of it if the principal is going up ? The Vanderbilt property began with , say $1,000 yielding 10 per cent. ; to-day it is perhaps $150,000,000 yielding 3 per cent . Fancy the astonishment of a Minnesota farmer , if told that he is in possession of riches that do not belong to him becanse he has done nothing to earn them , while the Vanderbilts are the toiling victims of falling interest and shrinking values . He will feel that he is juggled ; and he is . Not , of course , in the intention of Mr. Mill , who was the most loyal of men . The fact seems to be that he was so pre // occupied with the function of capital as one of the three factors of production , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rents , that he quite forgot to take into account its peculiar origin . Capital is not the gift of nature , like land , or even labor ; it is itself , in its origin , the joint product of land and labor . More specifically , it is savings what is spared from previous production for future investment as the Physiocrats would have said if they had ever heard about it , the net product after consumption has been provided for . In other words , it is made up of those very rents , profits , and wages , whose morality we have been inquiring into , plus the interest on capital already saved and invested . The fact itself , that interest is steadily declining , indicates that capital is steadily accumulating , and , therefore likely to abound in unearned increments . All are agreed that rent is one ; President Walker says that profits are another ; it would seem that wages are a third . I venture to add , finally , that interest , in spite of its steady decline , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that to meet an increased demand of our village community , cultivation descends from the twenty four to the twenty-two bushel tract ; and that the labor applied to both is of uniform quality . Cultivation is not only the application of labor to land , but also of the tools of labor , i. of capital . Buildings must be erected , appliances of various sorts gathered , ditches , fences , and roads must be constructed . It may easily be that the value of the capital required will equal or exceed the value of the land itself . It can be obtained only in one of two ways ; either it must be withdrawn from previous investments , where it is earning the current rate of interest , or created outright by savings from current consumption . Either process , as we know , is a costly one , and the cost , which previous investments escape , must be a charge upon the new tract put under cultivation , and provided for by the product of this tract , which is 22 bushels per acre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 or 20 bushels , or more , as the case may be ; and raise the surplus of the twenty-four bushel tract to 3 , or 4 bushels , or more ? If yes , then a portion only of this surplus will be compensation for the use of the land , and the remainder will be compensation for the use of the // capital invested on it . And both alike are unearned increments . I will again leave the reader to carry the application as far as he chooses . Bnt it is necessary to point ont that , as labor exceeds land in the matter of divisibility and mobility , so , to a far greater degree , does capital exceed labor . It is , as much as anything else , a strictly limited quantity , at the instant of any new demand upon it ; but , since the universal adoption of a medinm of exchange , it may be promptly transformed and transferred , in almost any amount , to the point of greatest demand . To this extent it is destitute of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor , and which afford the basis of a permanent monopoly . If one form of investment is found to yield an interest above the average rate , capital will be drawn into it from other forms until the average is restored ; and , conversely , if it yields an interest below the average . Thus , to use the familiar figure , capital , as compared with either of the other factors of production , has the homogeneity and mobility of a finid , and ever tends to a level , or mean rate of earnings ; a rate which is so far from being an abstraction of science that it has actual expression in what is known as the current rate of interest . But its finidity is not perfect , and will never be until the economic ideal of society is reached . Time is always occupied in its flow , and a hundred obstacles may get in its way . In spite of the tendency to equable diffusion and a uniformly declining rate of interest , it may be immobilized in highly profitable forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and labor . To sum up : it appears , according to the remark of Whately as quoted by Walker , that rent is only one species of an extensive genus ; that the law made famous by IRicardo is present over the whole field of production ; but that its action is more or less obscured by perturbing influences everywhere . The conclusion is , that if the State is to confiscate unearned increments , it is " in , ** as the phrase goes , for a remarkably large undertaking .
