txt A petition was flied to-day before Judge Gresham by Solon Humphreys and Thomas E. Tutt as Receivers of the St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company asking for protection against their striking freight handlers . The Receivers represent that they have in their employ a large number of men who are willing and anxious to work , but they are unable to do so because of intimidation and violence by the strikers . The Receivers declare they will be unable to attend to the business of the road unless they are protected by the court , and they ask for the appointment of 15 special Deputy Marshals to take care of the company 's property and arrest any person interfering with it . The Judge , after hearing the petition rend , re-marked , with some spirit , that only 10 days ago the attorneys of the road claimed before him that he had no jurisdiction over the company 's property , but now when they were in trouble they came to him and said he did have jurisdiction . If he had it he would do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to see whether ho had the power . Ho wanted to know whether the Receivers had taken possession of the property in Cook County under the orders of the court here . A suit was originally begun in.the Federal court at St. Louis for the appointment of Receivers for the road and the sale of the property . The court then assumed jurisdic-tion of the entire property and appointed Solon Humphreys and Thomas E. Tutt Receivers . When the property including that in this county was sold under the Missouri decree of foreclosure , the other day , the Trustees had insisted that the sale was valid because the court here had not the custody of the property . if such was the fact the court hero could not afford the desired protection . The Judge further remarked that he did not like the way the counsel had adopted of denying his jurisdiction at one time and asserting it at another . If he had jurisdiction of the property he would protect it . The matter was not determined .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
