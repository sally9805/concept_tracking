Unless there is an immediate thaw , attended by 12 days of mild weather , 700 boats now icebound may be considered frozeh up for the Winter , and will have to await the opening of Spring to reach tide-water . East of Buffalo there is an open channel for a few miles ; beyond that point nothing is beard of but solid ice . The weather of the past . 24 boars helped the ice to take firmer possession . The thickness now ranges from an inch and a half to five inches . A marked moderation of the weather is reported in the North-west . The indications are that the temperature will continue to rise .

When navigation was resumed in earnest , boats were got as rapidly as possible , and a continuous line was kept moving eastward . On nearly ' every level canal boats were moving as close together as possible without danger of interfering with one another . If any interruption t occurred to the leading boat the whole fleet ' would close up until there was the appearance of an immense train . A ' gentleman just from the east stated that near 1Syracuse be could walk miles without getting off the boats . From , ' this may be imagined what the situation was when the ice began to close in . Within the last few weeks , 3,308,048 bushels of wheat , 3,679,847'buchels of corn , 41,050 bushels of oats , and 20,086 bushels of barley cleared from this port , and 772,422 bushels of barley from Oswego. making a total of 7,912,059 bushels . Until accurate reports can be obtained as to how many boats have reached West Troy , it will be impossible to tell just how much grain is now afloat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between hero and Albany. : From 5 P.:M. , Nov. 19 , to 5P . M. Nov. 21 , 32 boats , carrying about 256,000 bush ! els of wheat , and 43 carrying about 360,000 bushels of corn , were locked through West Troy . On the lakes navigation is practically closed .

The cold w ( Vhor of the past few days moderated somewhat today , and snow fell during the morning . In the northern part of the State snow has fallen to a depth of 20 inches , and drifts as high as 10. feet are reported . Experienced boatmen and old canal officers , who have had an experience of 20 years , - are of the opinion that the ice in the canal will disappear , and that every boat now ice-bound will reach tidewater . They are greatly encouraged in this belief by the moderation in the weather today . In the past 30 years the canal has been frozen over early in November to an extent that suspended navigation many times , but , with the exception of three times , the ice has broken up , and all bents have got through . In 1846 the canal closed Nov. 25 : in 1871 , Nov .

The present condition of things is such as to warrant the belief that a large amount of property , instead of being locked in the canal during the Winter , will find its way to tide-water within the gext 10 days . The cold weather which has prevailed since Saturday has completely closed the Oswego Canal . The themometer has ranged from 13 ' to 25 ? , and there has been a fall of snow ranging from six Inches to two feet in different parts of the count-17 .

Probably 800,000 or 400,000 bushels of barley will accu-mulate here , which , if the canals had remained open , would have been shipped by canal , but which will now go forward by rail . The Oswego Canal has not been so suddenly and completely closed by ice during the month of November before within 20 years . ROCHESTER , Nov. 23 . ? Assistant Superintendent Fish states that the Erie Canal for its entire length is frozen solid , to the extent of from two to three inches .

It is thought the water has been taken at Medina . Mr. Fish intends to find the guilty person and prosecute him . TROY , Nov. 23 . ? Although the weather here has not moderated , the opinion of experienced canal men is that the present cold snap will be followed by a thaw , which will set in to-morrow or next day . Boats move in the day time on the eastern division of the Erie Canal , several ice-breakers being at work on the line between West Troy and Schenectady . It is understood here that the canal officers further west are using their utmost endeavors to break the ice , and that boats are moving slowly eastward .

Most of the boats on this canal are loaded with perishable freight ? but owners expect that within a week navigation will be resumed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NewYork without difficulty , as , although reports to the contrary have been printed , there is no ice in the river that interferes with navigation . The People 's and Citizens ' Line steam-boats from New-York arrive almost on time , and report that the only cause of detention is low water . These boats , the agents say , will run for three weeks yet . Owners of tow-boat lines say that they expect that each of their boats will take two tows each to New-York . If they do that all loaded boats now on the canals will reach New-York . ALBANY , Nov. 23 . ?

The Emita tried to go to New-Baltimore this morning , and had to turn about when a few miles down the river and return to this city , where she will remain for the present . Notwithstanding a belief that the canals have been effectually closed by the ice , the produce market declined heavily yesterday , The cotton market was also much less active and lower , and stocks closed weak on a smaller volume of business .
