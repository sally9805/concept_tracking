Upon taking charge he submitted his scheme of reorganization with his nominations and rates of Day . The City Council must confirm or reject . The Council after some delay disapproved of several of Gen. Beauregard 's appointments , and reduced the salary of others . This Gen. Beauregard considered a gross breach of courtesy , and he would not submit to it . He declares that he did not seek the office ; in fact his health and his affairs made private lite preferable . He was induced to accept the office because it was thought he could be a benefit to the public . As a citizen he felt . ashamed of the condition of the city in the past , and it was his duty to come forward and endeavor to improve it . The office has been a source of great worry to him ever since he entered it . He has not tilled the office with his personal friends ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men . He appointed those applicants who had the best recommendations and who seemed best qualified for . the work . The Counoil-had condemned four out of five of his appointments at its last meeting , and as he had accepted the position for the-good0f the city , and as could not see the use of remaining in office if the Council interfered , he therefore hhd made up his mind to resign . It appeared to him as if the Council wanted favorites provided for , and he did not nropose to Do at the head of a department which was run as a. political machine . If the Council does not recede from its action the General will certainly retire from the office .
