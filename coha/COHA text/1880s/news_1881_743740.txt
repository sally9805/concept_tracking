txt The dentist 's life , one would naturally imagine , is not a romantic or even exciting one . To perpetually inflict grinding torments on one 's fellow-beings may be nothing to the mind of the misanthropic dentist , but it can not be amusing or in any way attractive to the dentist of fine esthetic feelings and delicate sympathies . Unlike the barber , who can talk to his victims , the dentist has little opportunity for conversation , for nothing is more depressing than to make remarks to a man whose mouth is held wide open , and who ' can merely respond with a groan . Hence , the dentist is ordinarily a silent man , and confines his remarks merely to the formula , " Ah ! it seems to be a little sensitive , does it ? " when a patient leaps and howls with agony . There arc , however , incidents in the career of every dentist which lighten his apparently sombre life . There was the Oshkosh Antist Who* had a beautiful daughter whom he guarded from the approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him ' there came an infatuated lover , who sought , under the pretense that he needed to have a tooth drawn , ' a few moments ' surreptitious conversation with the daughter in the front hall . This devoted young man came every Saturday afternoon for thirty-six consecutive weeks and had a fresh tooth drawn . The dentist early perceived the true state of the case . He refused to give the patient an antesthetic , : on the ground that it might prove fatal , and he pulled all his teeth vaith an oldfashioned turnkey  --  an instrument which might be freely backed against ? anything the Spanish Inquisition ever used in its palmiest days  --  because , as he said , the young man 's teeth were too firmly set to yield to the ordinary forceps . When the last tooth was drawn the dentist declined to make the martyr-lover a set of false teeth , and the daughter told him that she could dispense with the attentions of a toothless man . This dental romance drew no smiles from the grim dentist , but it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man 's situation when the daughter turned him toothless and heart-broken into the street . To a dentist in Boston there happened not very long ago an incident that agreeably diversified his professional life , besides breaking a good deal of glass . He was a philosophic dentist , and continually strove to develop all the noblest possibilities of his profession . He invented a series of straps to hold a patient in position , so that his teeth could be operated upon without interruption and without regard to the possible weakness of his nerves and resolution . To him there appeared one day a young Bostonian in company with a Frenchman who could not speak a word of English , but who ? so said the young Bostonian  --  wanted to have eleven teeth drawn . The young Bostonian was a heartless and wicked person . He had been a persistent , and apparently successful , suitor for the hand of a young Boston lady , but the Frenchman , who was a Count with a superb mustache , had suddenly appeared , and bade fair to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With treacherous hypocrisy , he made himself the bosom friend of the Frenchman , and one day when he thought the proper moment had come , he proposed to the Count to have his photograph taken , in order to present it to the young lady . The unsuspecting Frenchman gladly went , with his traitorous guide , who led him straight to the operating-room of the philosophic dentist . There was nothing in the appearance of the room to alarm the deluded foreigner . The chair with its straps he assumed to be an improved photographic chair , and as the dentist made it a point to keep his instruments out of sight , the room bore no resemblance to the ordinary dentist 's room . The Frenchman seated himself in the chair , bade farewell to his false friend who had a pretended engagement elsewhere , and in less that a minute one of his front teeth waaout . Mad with pain and indignation , the Frenchman howled , swore in his own language , and tried in vain ' to break the straps that held him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive , does it ? " and then , misunderstanding his victim 's exclamations , imagined that he wished for chloroform . Accordingly , a towel saturated with the anesthetic was laid over the Frenchman 's face , and the work of tooth-pulling resumed . Eleven teeth , including nearly all the upper front teeth , were drawn before the Frenchman recovered consciousness , and the dentist , pleased with his work , released the patient , bowed smilingly to him , and sat down to make out his bill . Unlike most of his countrymen , the Count was an athletic person . The dentist was never more surprised in his life than he was when his infuriated victim seized him and slung him around the room , breaking the window panes , smashing the chair , and upsetting the water-pitcher . Having thus partially slaked his thirst for vengeance , the Frenchman threw the dentist on the carpet , danced on him , and then withdrew , leaving him more dead than alive . The precipitate flight of the toothless Count from the city prevented the dentist from obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate , ' enabled the wicked young man to triumphantly marry the desired young woman . We thus see that even the dentist may have his . moments of professional excitement , and that the monotony may be sometimes varied in the most unexpected and gratifying way .
