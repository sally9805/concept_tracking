MISS PARLOA 'S NEW COOK BOOK . MARKETING . Upon the amount of practical knowledge of marketing that the housekeeper has , the comfort and expense of the family are in a great measure dependent ; therefore , every head of a household should acquire as much of this knowledge as is practicable , and the best way is to go into the market . Then such information as is gained by reading becomes of real value . Many think the market not a pleasant or proper place for ladies . The idea is erroneous . My experience has been that there are as many gentlemen among marketmen as are to be found engaged in any other business . One should have a regular place at which to trade , as time is saved and disappointment obviated . If not a judge of meat , it is advisable , when purchasing , to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by you . He will probably give you a nicer piece than you could have chosen . If a housekeeper makes a practice of going to the market herself , she is able to supply her table with a better variety than she is by ordering at the door or by note , for she sees many good and fresh articles that would not have been thought of at home . In a book like this it is possible to treat at length only of such things as meat , fish and vegetables , which always form a large item of expense . BEEF . Beef is one of the most nutritious , and , in the end , the most economical , kinds of meat , for there is not a scrap of it which a good housekeeper will not utilize for food . As to Choosing It . Good steer or heifer beef has a fine grain , a yellowish-white fat , and is firm . When first cut it will be of a dark red color , which changes to a bright red after a few minutes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy appearance ; the suet will be dry , crumble easily and be nearly free from fibre . The flesh and fat of the ox and cow will be darker , and will appear dry and rather coarse . The quantity of meat should be large for the size of the bones . Quarters of beef should be kept as long as possible before cutting . The time depends upon climate and conveniences , but in the North should be two or three weeks . A side of beef is first divided into two parts called the fore and hind quarters . These are then cut into variously-shaped and sized pieces . Different localities have different names for some of these cuts . The diagrams represent the pieces as they are sold in the Boston market , and the tables give the New York and Philadelphia names for the same pieces . In these latter two cities , when the side of beef is divided into halves , they cut farther back on the hind quarter than they do in Boston , taking in all the ribs  --  thirteen and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have what in Boston is called the tip of the sirloin . The Hind Quarter . In Philadelphia they cut meat more as is done in Boston than they do in New York . The following diagram shows a hind quarter as it appears in Boston . In the other two cities the parts 1 and 13f are included in the fore quarter . The dotted lines show wherein the New York cutting differs from the Boston : ILLUSTRATION : Diagram No. 1 .

The loin is usually cut into roasts and steaks ; the roasts are called sirloin roasts and the steaks sirloin or porter-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small piece of it ( about two and a half pounds in a large animal ) runs back into the rump . In Boston this is often sold under the name of the short fillet , but the New York and Philadelphia marketmen do not cut it . Plate No. 2 shows the fillet . Illustration : PLATE NO. 2 . SHORT FILLET . Next the loin comes the rump , from which are cut steaks , roasts and pieces for stewing , braising , a la mode and soups . Next the rump comes the round , from which are cut steaks , pieces for a la mode , stewing , braising and soups . The flank is cut from the loin , and used for corning , stewing and as a roll of beef . Plate No. 4 represents a loin as cut in Boston and Philadelphia , and it and No. 3 represent one as cut in New York , if the two parts be imagined joined at the point A. No. 4 also shows the inside of the loin , where the tenderloin lies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twenty pounds , to suit the purchaser . The end next the ribs gives the smallest pieces , which are best for a small family . The tenderloin in this cut is not as large as in the first and second . In cutting sirloin steaks or roasts , dealers vary as to the amount of flank they leave on . There should be little , if any , as that is not a part for roasting or broiling . When it is all cut off the price of the sirloin is of course very much more than when a part is left on , but though the cost is increased eight or ten cents a pound , it is economy to pay this rather than take what you do not want . Illustration : PLATE NO. 3 . RUMP , SHOWING END WHICH JOINS ROUND . Illustration : PLATE NO. 4 . LOIN . THE LOWER END JOINS RIBS . Porter-House Steaks . Every part of the sirloin , and a part of the rump , is named porter-house steak in various localities . In New York the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these steaks . The rump steak , when cut with the tenderloin in it , is also called porter-house steak . The original porter-house steaks came from the small end of the loin . Sirloin Steaks . Sirloin steaks are cut from all parts of the loin , beginning with the small end and finishing with the rump . In New York the rump steaks are also known as sirloin . In some places they do not cut tenderloin with sirloin . One slice of sirloin from a good-sized animal will weigh about two and a half pounds . If the flank , bone and fat were removed , there would remain about a pound of clear , tender , juicy meat There being , therefore , considerable waste to this steak , it will always be expensive as compared with one from a rump or round . But many persons care only for this kind , as it has a flavor peculiar to itself ; and they will buy it regardless of economy . Plate No. 5 shows a second cut of the sirloin , with the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really eatable as a steak is from the base to the point A , the remainder being flank . Illustration : Plate No. 5 . SIRLOIN ROAST  --  SECOND CUT . Illustration : Plate No. 7 . SHORT RUMP STEAK . Illustration : Plate No. 6 . LONG RUMP STEAK . Rump Steak . What in Boston and Philadelphia is called rump steak is in New York named sirloin . There are three methods of cutting a rump steak ; two of these give a very fine steak , the third almost the poorest kind . The first two are to cut across the grain of the meat , and thus obtain , when the beeve is a good one , really the best steaks in the animal . Plates Nos. 6 and 7 represent these steaks . No. 6 is a long rump steak , very fine ; and No. 7 a short rump , also excellent . In both of these there is a piece of tenderloin . In New York , No. 6 is sirloin without bone , and No. 7 sirloin . There is yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is cut from the back of the rump , and there is no tenderloin in it . Plate No. 8 shows a rump steak cut with the grain of the meat ; that is , cut lengthwise . It comes much cheaper than the others , but is so poor that it should never be bought . It will curl up when broiled , and will be tough and dry . Illustration ; Plate No. 8 . RUMP STEAK WITH THE GRAIN . Illustration : Plate No. 9 . BACK OF THE RUMP . Illustration : PLATE NO. 10 . AITCHBONE . Illustration : PLATE NO. 11 . ROUND OF BEEF . Some marketmen will not cut rump steak by the first two methods , because it spoils the rump for cutting into roasts , and also leaves a great deal of bone and some tough meat on hand . The price per pound for a rump steak cut with the grain is ten cents less than for that cut across , and yet dealers do not find it profitable to sell steak cut the latter way . Plate No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for steaks and to roast . The steaks are juicy and tender , but do not contain any tenderloin . Round Steaks . Plate No. 11 shows the round of beef with the aitch bone taken off ; a , a , a , a , is the top of the round , b , b , b , b , the under part , where the aitchbone has been cut off , and c , c , c , c , the vein . Plate No. 10 is this aitchbone , which is first cut from the round , and then the steaks are taken off . The best steak begins with the third slice . The top and under part of the round are often cut in one slice . The top is tender and the under part tough . When both are together the steak sells for fifteen or sixteen cents per pound ; when separate , the top is twenty or more and the under part from ten to twelve . If it is all to be used as a steak , the better way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a stew one day and have a steak another , it is cheaper to buy both parts together . Round steak is not , of course , as tender as tenderloin , sirloin or rump , but it has a far richer and higher flavor than any of the others . It should be cut thick , and be cooked rare over a quick fire . Steaks are cut from the vein in the round and from the shoulder in the fore quarter . They are of about the same quality as those from the round . Tenderloin Steak . This is cut from the tenderloin , and costs from twenty-five cents to a dollar per pound . It is very soft and tender , but has hardly any flavor , and is not half as nutritious as one from a round or rump . Quality and Cost . We will now consider the various kinds of steak , as to their cost and nutritive qualities . The prices given are not those of all sections of the country , but they will be helpful to the purchaser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Top of the round , the most nutritious , 18 to 25 cents . Rump cut across the grain , next in nutritive qualities , 28 to 30 cents Rump cut with the grain , 22 to 25 cents Sirloin , 25 to 30 cents Porter-house , 30 cents Tenderloin , 25 cts. to $1.00 The tenderloin , rump and round steaks are all clear meat ; therefore , there is no waste , and of course one will not buy as many pounds of these pieces to provide for a given number of persons as if one were purchasing a sirloin or porter-house steak , because with the latter-named the weight of bone and of the flank , if this be left on , must always be taken into consideration . After the aitchbone and steaks have been taken from the round there remain nice pieces for stewing and braising ; and still lower the meat and bones are good for soups and jellies . The price decreases as you go down to the shank , until for the shank itself you pay only from three to four cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate No. 4 represents a loin of beef , showing the end which joined the ribs , also the kidney suet . No. 12 represents the same loin , showing the end which joined the rump . There are about thirty pounds in a sirloin that has been cut from a large beeve . This makes about three roasting pieces for a moderately large family . The piece next the rump has the largest tenderloin and is , therefore , by many considered the choicest . Steaks cut from it are now served in the principal hotels as porter-house . The Rump . In plate No. 3 was shown that part of the ramp which joins the round . Plate No. 13 represents the end which joins the sirloin . Illustration : PLATE NO. 13 . RUMP . Illustration : PLATE NO. 12 . LOIN . Ribs . Plate No. 14 represents the first five ribs cut from the back half where it joins the tip of the sirloin , and shows the end that joined . This cut is considered the best of the rib-roasts . For family use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next the sirloin being the first cut of the ribs and the others the second cut . Illustration : PLATE NO. 14 . FIRST FIVE RIBS . Illustration : PLATE NO. 15 . CHUCK RIBS . Plate No. 15 represents the chuck ribs , the first chuck , or sixth rib , being seen at the end . There are ten ribs in the back half as cut in Boston , five prime and five chuck ; We must remember that in New York and Philadelphia there are thirteen ribs , eight of which are prime . The first two chuck ribs make a very good roast or steak , being one of the most nutritious cuts in the animal , and the next three are good for stewing and braising . Many people roast them . The flavor is fine when they are cooked in this manner , but the meat is rather tough . A chuck rib contains part of the shoulder-blade , while the prime ribs do not . In New York and Philadelphia the ribs are cut much longer than in Boston ; hence the price per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchaser is as great as in Boston , because he has to pay for a great deal of the rattle-ran or rack . It is always best to have the ribroasts cut short , and even pay a higher price for them , as there will then be no waste . Fore Quarter . The fore quarter is first cut into two parts , the back half and the rattle-ran , and these are then cut into smaller pieces for the different modes of cooking . Diagram No. 16 represents a fore quarter . The back half only is numbered , for the rattle-ran is given in diagram No 17 . Illustration : FACE OF THE RUMP . Illustration : DIAGRAM NO. 16 .

The whole of lower half of the fore quarter is often called the rattle-ran . Diagram No. 17 shows this , and the table following gives the name of the separate cuts : Illustration : DIAGRAM NO. 17 .

Navel end of brisket . The rattle-ran or plate piece is generally corned , and is considered one of the best cuts for pressed beef . The shoulder of mutton is used for stews , beef a la mode , roasts and steaks , and is also corned . The sticking piece , commonly called the back of the shoulder , but which is really the front , is used for stews , soups , pie meat and for corning . The shin is used for soups , and the brisket and ribs for corning and for stews and soups . One of the best pieces for corning is the navel end of the brisket . The middle cut of the rattle-ran is also corned . MUTTON . Mutton is very nutritious and easily digested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white fat , and a good deal of it ; the lean part will be juicy , firm and of a rather dark red color . When there is but little fat , and that is soft and yellow and the meat is coarse and stringy , you may be sure that the quality is poor . Mutton is much improved by being hung in a cool place for a week or more . At the North a leg will keep quite well for two or three weeks in winter , if hung in a cold , dry shed or cellar . Mutton , like beef , is first split through the back , and then the sides are divided , giving two fore and two hind quarters . Diagram No. 18 is of a whole carcass of mutton , and half of it is numbered to show the pieces into which the animal is cut for use . Illustration : DIAGRAM NO. 18 . EXPLANATION OF DIAGRAM NO. 18. 1 , 2 , 4 . Hind quarter . 3 , 5 , 5 . Fore quarter 1 . Leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flank . 5,5 . Breast . Hind Quarter of Mutton . This consists of the leg and loin , and is the choicest cut . It makes a fine roast for a large family , but for a moderate-sized or small one either the leg or loin alone is better . A hind quarter taken from a prime animal will weigh from twenty to thirty pounds . Leg of Mutton . This joint is nearly always used for roasting and boiling . It has but little bone , as compared with the other parts of the animal , and is , therefore , an economical piece to select , though the price per pound be greater than that of any other cut . It is not common to find a good leg weighing under ten or twelve pounds . A leg is shown in plate No. 19 . Illustration : PLATE NO. 19 . Loin of Mutton . In a loin , as cut in Boston , there are seven ribs , which make a good roast for a small family . This cut is particularly nice in hot weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat is , besides , of a lighter quality and more delicate flavor . The cost when the flank is taken off will be about seven cents more a pound than if the loin be sold with it on ; but , unless you wish to use the flank for a soup , stew or haricot , it is the better economy to buy a trimmed piece and pay the higher price . When the two loins are joined they are called a saddle . Plate No. 20 shows a saddle and two French chops . Illustration : PLATE NO 20 . SADDLE OF MUTTON AND FRENCH CHOPS . Fore Quarter of Mutton . In this is included the shoulder and breast . When the shoulder-blade is taken out the quarter makes a good roast for a large family . The shoulder is separated from the breast by running a sharp knife between the two , starting at the curved dotted lines near the neck ( shown in diagram No. 18 ) , and cutting round to the end of the line . The shoulder is nice for roasting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for broths , braising , stewing or cotelettes . Rib chops are also cut from the breast , which is , by the way , the cheapest part of the mutton . Chops and Cutlets . Chops are cut from the loin . They are called long when the flank is cut on them and short if without it . When part of the bone of the short chop is scraped clean it is called a French chop . The rolled chops sold by provision dealers are the long chops with the bone removed . One often sees them selling at a low price . They are then the poor parts of the mutton , like the flank , and will be found very expensive no matter how little is asked . Prices . The price of mutton varies with the seasons , but a table giving the average price may help the purchaser to an estimate of the comparative cost of each cut : Hind Quarter , 15 cents . Leg , 17 cents . Loin , with flank , 13 cents . Loin , without flank , 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 20 cents . Untrimmed Chops , 12 cents . When one has a large family it brings all kinds of meat considerably cheaper to buy large pieces untrimmed , as the trimmings can be used for soups , stews , etc. ; but for a small family , it is much better to purchase only the part you want for immediate use . Although mutton costs less per pound than beef , it is no cheaper in the end , because to be good it must be fat , and mutton fat , unlike beef fat , can not be employed for cooking purposes , as it gives a strong flavor to any article with which it is used . LAMB . Lamb is cut and sold like mutton . Being much smaller , however , a hind or fore quarter is not too large for a good-sized family . Lamb will not keep as long as mutton , for , being juicy , it taints more readily . It is of a delicate flavor until nearly a year old , when it begins to taste like mutton and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be red , and the fat hard and white . This meat is in season from May to September . VEAL . The calf being so much larger than the sheep , the fore and hind quarters are not cooked together , and for an ordinary family both are not purchased . The animal is , however , cut into the same parts as mutton . The loin , breast and shoulder are used for roasting . Chops are cut from the loin and neck , those from the neck being called rib chops or cotelettes . The neck itself is used for stews , pies , fricassees , etc . The leg is used for cutlets , fricandeaux , stews and roasts , and for braising . The fillet of veal is a solid piece cut from the leg  - -  not like the tenderloin in beef , but used in much the same way . The lower part of the leg is called a knuckle , and is particularly nice for soups and sauces . Good veal will have white , firm fat , and the lean part a pinkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been bled before being killed , which is a great cruelty to the animal , besides greatly impoverishing the meat . When veal is too young it will be soft and of a bluish tinge . The calf should not be killed until at least six weeks old . Veal is in the market all the year , but the season is really from April to September , when the price is low . The leg costs more than any other joint , because it is almost wholly solid meat . The fillet costs from 20 to 25 cents ; cutlets from the leg , 30 cents ; chops from loin , 20 cents ; loin for roast , 15 cents ; breast , 10 to 12 cents . Veal is not nutritious nor easily digested . Many people can not eat it in any form , but such a number of nice dishes can be made from it , and when in season the price is so low , that it will always be used for made dishes and soups . PORK . Pork , although not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb , etc. , is extensively employed in the preparation of food . It is cut somewhat like mutton , but into more parts . Fresh young pork should be firm ; the fat white , the lean a pale reddish color and the skin white and clear . When the fat is yellow and soft the pork is not of the best quality . After pork has been salted , if it is corn-fed , the fat will be of a delicate pinkish shade . When hogs weighing three and four hundred pounds are killed , the fat will not be very firm , particularly if they are not fed on corn . The amount of salt pork purchased at a time depends upon the mode of cooking in each family . If bought in small quantities it should be kept in a small jar or tub , half filled with brine , and a plate , smaller round than the tub , should be placed on top of the meat to press it under the brine . The parts into which the hog is cut are called leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brisket , head and feet . The legs and shoulders are usually salted and smoked . The loin of a large hog has about two or three inches of the fat cut with the rind . This is used for salting , and the loin fresh for roasting . When , however , the hog is small , the loin is simply scored and roasted . The ribs are treated the same as the loin , and when the rind and fat are cut off are called spare-ribs . This piece makes a sweet roast . Having much more bone and less meat than the loin , it is not really any cheaper , although sold for less . The loin and ribs are both used for chops and steaks . The flank and brisket are corned . The head is sold while fresh for head-cheese , or is divided into two or four parts and corned , and is a favorite dish with many people . The feet are sometimes sold while fresh , but are more frequently first pickled . The fat taken from the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved . This , when strained and cooled , is termed lard . Many housekeepers buy the leaf or clear fat and try it out themselves . This is the best way , as one is then sure of a pure article . Sausages . These should be made wholly of pork , but there is often a large portion of beef in them . They should be firm , and rather dry on the outside . Liver . Calves ' liver is the best in the market , and always brings the highest price . In some markets they will not cut it . A single liver costs about fifty cents , and when properly cooked , several delicious dishes can be made from it . Beef liver is much larger and darker than the calves ' , has a stronger flavor and is not so tender . It is sold in small or large pieces at a low price . Pigs ' liver is not nearly as good as the calves ' or beeves ' , and comes very much cheaper . Hearts . Both the calves ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The calves ' are rather small , but tenderer than the beeves ' . The price of one is usually not more than fifteen cents . The heart is nutritious , but not easily digested . Kidneys . The kidneys of beef , veal , mutton , lamb and pork are all used for stews , broils , sautes , curries and fricassees . Veal are the best . Tongues . These are very delicate . Beef tongue is the most used . It should be thick and firm , with a good deal of fat on the under side . When fresh , it it used for bouilli , mince pies and to serve cold or in jelly . Salted and smoked , it is boiled and served cold . Lambs ' tongues are sold both fresh and pickled . POULTRY AND GAME . Chickens . All fowl less than a year old come under this head . The lower end of the breast-bone in a chicken is soft , and can be bent easily . The breast should be full , the lean meat white , and the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer and the fell and winter . The largest and juciest come from Philadelphia . Spring Chickens . These are generally used for broiling . They vary in size , weighing from half a pound to two and a half pounds . The small , plump ones , weighing about one and a half or two pounds , are the best . There is little fat on spring chickens . Fowl . These may be anywhere from one to five or six years old . When over two years the meat is apt to be tough , dry and stringy . They should be fat , and the breast full and soft . The meat of fowl is richer than that of chickens , and is , therefore , better for boiling and to use for salads and made dishes . The weight of bone is not much greater than in a chicken , while there is a great deal more meat . Another point to be remembered is that the price per pound is also generally a few cents less . Turkeys . The lower end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast be plump and short , the meat firm and the fat white . When the bird is very large and fat the flavor is sometimes a little strong . Eight or ten pounds is a good size for a small family . Geese . It is more difficult to judge of the age and quality of a goose than of any other bird . If the wind pipe is brittle and breaks easily under pressure of the finger and thumb , the bird is young , but if it rolls the bird is old . Geese live to a great age  --  thirty or more years . They are not good when more than three years old . Indeed , to be perfect , they should be not more than one year old . They are in season in the fall and winter . Green Geese . The young geese are very well fed , and when from two to four months old are killed for sale . They bring a high price , and are delicious . They are sometimes in the market in winter , but the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests that are applied to chickens and geese to ascertain age and quality are made with ducks . Besides the tame bird , there are at least twenty different kinds that come under the head of game . The canvas-back is the finest in the list ; the mallard and red-head come next . The domestic duck is in season nearly all the year , but the wild ones only through the fall and winter . The price varies with the season and supply . A pair of canvas-backs will at one time cost a dollar and a half and at another five dollars . Pigeons . There are two kinds of pigeons found in the market , the tame and the wild , which are used for potting , stewing , &c.; Except when " stall-fed " they are dry and tough , and require great care in preparation . The wild birds are the cheapest . They are shipped from the West , packed in barrels , through the latter part of the winter and the early spring . Stall-fed pigeons are the tame ones cooped for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender , and come into market about the first of October . Squabs . These are the young of the tame pigeon . Their flesh is very delicate , and they are used for roasting and broiling . Grouse , or Prairie Chicken . These birds comes from the West , and are much like the partridge of the Eastern States and Canada . The flesh is dark , but exceedingly tender . Grouse should be plump and heavy . The breast is all that is good to serve when roasted , and being so dry , it should always be larded . The season is from September to January , but it is often continued into April . Venison . There should be a good deal of fat on this meat . The lean should be dark red and the fat white . Venison is in season all the year , but is most used in cold weather . In summer it should have been killed at least ten days before cooking ; in winter three weeks is better . The cuts are the leg , saddle , loin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Partridge . This bird is so like the grouse that the same rules apply to both . What is known as quail at the North is called partridge at the South . Quail . These birds are found in the market all through the fall and winter . They are quite small ( about the size of a squab ) , are nearly always tender and juicy , and not very expensive . They come from the West . Woodcock . Woodcock is in season from July to November . It is a small bird , weighing about half a pound . It has a fine , delicate flavor , and is very high-priced . Other Game . There are numerous large and small birds which are used for food , but there is not space to treat of them all . In selecting game it must be remembered that the birds will have a gamey smell , which is wholly different from that of tainted meat . FISH . To fully describe all the kinds of fish found in our markets would require too much space and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually a supply is given , that housekeepers may know what it is best to select in a certain season and have some idea of the prices . To Select Fish . When fresh , the skin and scales will be bright , the eyes full and clear , the fins stiff and the body firm . If there is a bad odor , or , if the fish is soft and darker than is usual for that kind , and has dim , sunken eyes , it is not fit to use . Codfish . This is good all the year , but best in the fall and winter . When cooked , it breaks into large white flakes . It is not as nutritious as the darker kinds of fish , but is more easily digested . The price remains about the same through all seasons . Haddock . This is a firmer and smaller-flaked fish than the cod , but varies little in flavor from it . The cod has a light stripe running down the sides ; the haddock a dark one . Cusk . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , white fish . It is best in winter . Pollock . This is used mostly for salting . It is much like the cod , only firmer grained and drier . Halibut . This fine fish is always good . It varies in weight from two pounds to three hundred . The flesh is a pearly white in a perfectly fresh fish . That cut from one weighing from fifty to seventy-five pounds is the best , the flesh of any larger being coarse and dry . The small fish are called chicken halibut . Flounders . These are thin , flat fish , often sold under the name of sole . Good at all times of the year . Turbot . This is a flat fish , weighing from two to twenty pounds . The flesh is soft , white and delicate . Turbot is not common in our market . Salmon . Salmon is in season from April to July , but is in its prime in June . It is often found in the market as early as January , when it brings a high price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provided for a given number of people than of the lighter kinds of fish . Shad . This is in season in the Eastern and Middle States from March to April , and in the Southern States from November to February . The flesh is sweet , but full of small bones . Shad is much prized for the roe . Blue-fish . This is a rich , dark fish , weighing from two to eight pounds ' and in season in June , July and August . It is particularly nice broiled and baked . Black-fish , or Tautog . Good all the year , but best in the spring . It is not a large fish , weighing only from one to five pounds . White-fish , or Lake Shad . This delicious fish is found in the great lakes , and in the locality where caught it is always in season . At the South and in the East the market is supplied only in winter , when the price is about eighteen cents a pound . The average weight is between two and three pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six or seven , pounds , is very fine , and is in season nearly all the year . It is best in March , April and May . Rock-Bass . The weight of rock-bass generally ranges from half a pound to thirty or forty pounds , but sometimes reaches eighty or a hundred . The small fish are the best . The very small ones ( under one pound ) are fried ; the larger broiled , baked and boiled . The bass are in season all the year , but best in the fall . Sword Fish . This is very large , with dark , firm flesh . It is nutritious , but not as delicate as other kinds of fish : It is cut and sold like halibut , and in season in July and August . Sturgeon . This fish , like the halibut and sword fish , is large . The flesh is of a light red color and the fat of a pale yellow . There is a rather strong flavor . A fish weighing under a hundred pounds will taste better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September . Weak-Fish . Weak-fish is found in the New York and Philadelphia markets from May to October . In the Eastern States it is not so well known . It is a delicate fish , and grows soft very quickly . It is good boiled or fried . Small , or " Pan " - Fish . The small fish that are usually fried , have the general name of " pan " - fish . There is a great variety , each kind found in the market being nearly always local , as it does not pay to pack and ship them . A greater part have the heads and skin taken off before being sold . Smelts . These are good at any time , but best in the winter , when they are both plenty and cheap . Mullet . There are several varieties of this fish , which is much prized in some sections of the country . It is a small fish , weighing from a quarter of a pound to two or three pounds . It often has a slightly muddy flavor , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rivers . Mackerel . This fish is nutritious and cheap . It is in the market through the spring and summer , and averages in weight between one and two pounds . Spanish Mackerel . These are larger than the common mackerel , and have rows of yellow spots , instead of the dark lines on the sides . They are in season from June to October , and generally bring a high price . Eels . These are sold skinned ; are always in season , but best from April to November . Lobsters . This shell-fish is in the market all the year , but is best in May and June . If the tail , when straightened , springs back into position , it indicates that the fish is fresh . The time of boiling live lobsters depends upon the size . If boiled too much they will be tough and dry . They are generally boiled by the fishermen . This is certainly the best plan , as these people know from practice , just how long to cook them . Besides , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are ugly things to handle . The medium-sized are the tenderest and sweetest . A good one will be heavy for its size . In the parts of the country where fresh lobsters can not be obtained , the canned will be found convenient for making salads , soups , stews , etc . Hard-Shell Crabs . These are in the market all the year . They are sold alive and , also , like the lobster , boiled . Near the coast of the Southern and Middle States they are plenty and cheap , but in the interior and in the Eastern States they are quite expensive . They are not used as much as the lobster , because it is a great deal of trouble to take the meat from the shell . Soft-Shell Crabs . As the crab grows , a new , soft shell forms , and the old , hard one is shed . Thus comes the soft-shelled crab . In about three days the shell begins to harden again . In Maryland there are ponds for raising these crabs , so that now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great luxury , and very expensive . In the Eastern States they are found only in warm weather . They must always be cooked while alive . Frying and broiling are the modes of preparing . Shrimp . These are found on the Southern coasts ; are much the shape of a lobster , but very small . They are used mostly for sauces to serve with fish . Their season is through the spring , summer and fall . There is a larger kind called big shrimp or prawns , sold boiled in the Southern markets . These are good for sauces or stews , and , in fact , can be used , in most cases , the same as lobster . But few shrimp are found in the Eastern or Western markets . The canned goods are , however , convenient and nice for sauces . Terrapin . This shell-fish comes from the South , Baltimore being the great terrapin market . It belongs to the turtle family . It is always sold alive , and is a very expensive fish , the diamond backs costing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market , the diamond backs , little bulls and red fenders . The first named are considered marketable when they measure six inches across the back . They are then about three years old . The little bulls , or male fish , hardly ever measure more than five inches across the back . They are cheaper than diamond backs , but not so well flavored . The red fenders grow larger than the others , and are much cheaper , but their meat is coarse and of an inferior flavor . Terrapin are in the market all the year , but the best time to buy them is from November to February . Oysters . No other shell-fish is as highly prized as this . The oyster usually takes the name of the place where it is grown , because the quality and flavor depend very much upon the feeding grounds . The Blue-point , a small , round oyster from Long Island , is considered the finest in the market , and it costs about twice as much as the common oyster . Next comes the Wareham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a salt water oyster , and is , therefore , particularly good for serving raw . The Providence River oyster is large and well flavored , yet costs only about half as much as the Blue-point . The very large ones , however , sell at the same price . Oysters are found all along ; the coast from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico . Those taken from the cool Northern waters are the best . The sooner this shell-fish is used after being opened , the better . In the months of May , June , July and August , the oyster becomes soft and milky . It is not then very healthful or well flavored . The common-sized oysters are good for all purposes of cooking except broiling and frying , when the large are preferable . The very large ones are not served as frequently on the half shell as in former years , the Blue-point , or the small Wareham , having supplanted them . Clams . There are two kinds of this shell-fish , the common thin-shelled clam and the quahaug . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peck or bushel in the shell , or by the quart when shelled . Clams are in season all the year , but in summer a black substance is found in the body , which must be pressed from it before using . The shell of the quahaug is thick and round . Scollops . This shell-fish is used about the same as the clam , but is not so popular , owing to a peculiarly sweet flavor . It is in season from September to March , and is sold shelled , as only the muscular part of the fish is used . VEGETABLES . Every good housekeeper will supply her table with a variety of vegetables all the year round . One can hardly think of a vegetable , either fresh or canned , that can not be had in our markets at any season . The railroads and steamers connect the climes so closely that one hardly knows whether he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of season . The provider , however , realizes that it takes a long purse to buy fresh produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , there are so many winter vegetables that keep well in the cellar through cold weather that if we did not have the new ones from the South , there would be , nevertheless , a variety from which to choose . It is late in the spring , when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow rank , that we appreciate what comes from the South . Buying Vegetables . If one has a good , dry cellar , it is economy to procure in the fall vegetables enough for all winter , but if the cellar is too warm the vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold months have passed . Those to be bought are onions , squashes , turnips , beets , carrots , parsnips , cabbages , potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes , all of which , except the first two , should be bedded in sand and in a cool place , yet where they will not freeze . Squashes and onions should be kept in a very dry room . The price of all depends upon the supply . WHEN IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of March or first of April . Florida soon follows , and one Southern State after another continues the supply until June , when the Northern and Eastern districts begin . It is only the rich , however , who can afford new potatoes before July ; but the old are good up to that time , if they have been well kept and are properly cooked . Cabbage is in season all the year . Beets , carrots , turnips and onions are received from the South in April and May , so that we have them young and fresh for at least five months . After this period they are not particularly tender , and require much cooking . Squashes come from the South until about May , and we then have the summer squash till the last of August , when the winter squash is first used . This is not as delicate as the summer squash , but is generally liked better . Green peas are found in the market in February , though they are very expensive up to the time of the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ordinary season , in the Eastern States . They last until the latter part of August , but begin to grow poor before that time . There is a great variety , some being quite large , others very small . The smaller are the more desirable , being much like French peas . When peas are not really in season it is more satisfactory to use French canned peas , costing forty cents a can . One can is enough for six persons . When buying peas , see that the pods are green , dry and cool . If they have turned light they have been picked either a long time or when old . SPINACH . Spinach is always in season , but is valued most during the winter and spring , as it is one of the few green vegetables that we get then , and is not expensive . It should be green and crisp . Asparagus . Asparagus , from hot houses and the South , begins to come into the market in March and April . It is then costly , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of June it grows poor , and no matter how low the price , it will be an expensive article to buy as it has then become very " woody . " The heads should be full and green ; if light and not full , the asparagus will not spend well . Dandelions . The cultivated dandelion is found in the market in March , April and a part of May . It is larger , tenderer and less bitter than the wild plant , which begins to get into the market  --  in April . By the last of May the dandelion is too rank and tough to make a good dish . Cauliflower . This vegetable is generally quite expensive . It is found in the market a greater part of the year , being now grown in hot houses in winter . It is in perfection from the first of May to November or December . The leaves should be green and fresh and the heads a creamy white . When the leaves are wilted , or when there are dark spots on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh tomato comes to the market from the South in April and sometimes in March . On account of the high price it is then used only where the canned tomato will not answer . In July , August and September it is cheap . It comes next to the potato in the variety of forms in which it may be served . By most physicians it is considered a very healthful vegetable . The time to buy ripe tomatoes for canning is about the last of August , when they are abundant and cheap . About the middle or last of September green ones should be secured for pickling , etc . As the vines still bear a great many that can not ripen before the frost comes , these are sold for this purpose . Beans . There are two kinds of green beans in the market , the string or snap bean and the shell bean . String beans come from the South about the first of April . They are picked in Northern gardens about the first of June , and they last until about the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beginning to form , and should snap crisply . If wilted or yellow they have been picked too long . Shell Beans . Shell beans come in May , but are not picked at the North before June . They are good until the last of September . There is a great variety of shell beans , but the Lima is considered the best When fresh , shell beans are dry and smooth ; but if old , they look dull and sticky . Celery . Celery is found in the market from August to April , but is in its prime and is cheapest from November to the first of March . Before the frost comes it is slightly bitter , and after the first of March it grows tough and stringy . Unless one has a good cellar in which to bury celery , it is best to purchase as one has need from time to time . Celery is a delicious salad . It is also considered one of the best vegetables that a nervous , rheumatic or neuralgic person can take . The heads should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisply . Save the trimmings for soups . Lettuce . Lettuce is found in the market all the year round , being now raised in hot houses in winter . It then costs two and three times as much as in summer ; still , it is not an expensive salad . There are a number of varieties having much the same general appearance . That which comes in round heads , with leaves like a shell , is the most popular in this country , because it can be served so handsome . There is another kind , high in favor in Paris and in some localities in this country for its tenderness and delicate flavor , but not liked by marketmen , because it will not bear rough handling . The tune will come , however , when there will be such a demand for this species that all first-class provision dealers will keep it . The French call it Romaine , and in this country it is sometimes called Roman lettuce . It does not head . The leaves are long and not handsome whole ; but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lettuce should be crisp and green , and be kept until used in a very cold place  --  in an ice chest if possible . Mushrooms . Mushrooms are in the market at all seasons . In summer , when they are found in pastures , they are comparatively ( fifty or seventy-five cents a pound ) , but in winter they are high priced . Being , however , very light , a pound goes a great way . The French canned mushrooms are safe , convenient and cheap . One can , costing forty cents , is enough for a sauce for at least ten people . There is nothing else among vegetables which gives such a peculiarly delicious flavor to meat sauces . Mushrooms are used also as a relish for breakfast and tea , or as an entree . In gathering from the fields one should exercise great care not to collect poisonous toadstools , which are in appearance much like mushrooms , and are often mistaken for these by people whose knowledge of vegetables has been gained solely by reading . The confusion of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger if purchases are made of reliable provision dealers . Green Corn . Green corn is sent from the South about the last of May or the first of June , and then costs much . It comes from the Middle States about the middle of July and from the Eastern in August , and it lasts into October in the North Eastern States . It should be tender and milky , and have well-filled ears . If too old it will be hard , and the grains straw colored , and no amount of boiling wilt make it tender . Corn is boiled simply in clear water , is made into chowders , fritters , puddings , succotash , etc . Artichokes . There are two kinds of artichokes , the one best known in this country , the Jerusalem artichoke , being a tuber something like the potato . It is used as a salad , is boiled and served as a vegetable , and is also pickled . This artichoke comes into the market about July , and can be preserved in sand for winter use . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plant that strongly resembles the thistle ; this flower is the part that is eaten . It is boiled and served with a white sauce , and is also eaten as a salad . It is much used in France , but we have so many vegetables with so much more to recommend them , that this will probably never be common in this country . Cucumbers . Cucumbers are in the market all the year round . In winter they are raised in green houses and command a high price . They begin to come from the South about the first of April , and by the last of May the price is reasonable . They last through the summer , but are not very nice after August They are mostly used as a salad and for pickles , but are often cooked . They should be perfectly green and firm for a salad , and when to be pickled , they must be small . If for cooking , it does no harm to have them a little large and slightly turned yellow . Radishes . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the long radish and the small round one . They are in the market in all seasons , and in early spring and summer the price is low . Radishes are used mostly as a relish . Chicory or Endive . The roots and leaves of this plant are both used , but the leaves only are found in the market ( the roots are used in coffee ) , and these come in heads like the lettuce . Chicory comes into the market later than lettuce , and is used in all respects like it . Sometimes it is cooked . Sweet Herbs . The housekeeper in large cities has no difficulty in finding all the herbs she may want , but this is not so in small towns and villages . The very fact , however , that one lives in a country place suggests a remedy . Why not have a little bed of herbs in your own garden , and before they go to seed , dry what you will need for the winter and spring ? Thus , in summer you could always have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried . It is essential to have green parsley throughout the winter , and this can be managed very easily by having two or three pots planted with healthy roots in the fall . Or , a still better way is to have large holes bored in the sides of a large tub or keg ; then fill up to the first row of holes with rich soil ; put the roots of the plants through the holes , having the leaves on the outside ; fill up again with soil and continue this until the tub is nearly full ; then plant the top with roots . Keep in a sunny window and you will have not only a useful herb , but a thing of beauty through the winter . For soups , sauces , stews and braising , one wants sweet marjoram , summer savory , thyme , parsley , sage , tarragon and bay-leaf always on hand . You can get bunches of savory , sage , marjoram and thyme for five cents each at the vegetable market . Five cents ' worth of bay-leaves from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is hard to find ) , and you have for a quarter of a dollar herbs enough to last a large family a year . Keep them tied together in a large paper bag or a box , where they will be dry . Mint and parsley should be used green . There is but little difficulty in regard to mint , as it is used only in the spring and summer . GROCERIES . The manner in which a housekeeper buys her groceries must depend upon where she lives and how large her family is . In a country place , where the stores are few and not well supplied , it is best to buy in large quantities all articles that will not deteriorate by keeping . If one has a large family a great saving is made by purchasing the greater portion of one 's groceries at wholesale . Flour . There is now in use flour made by two different processes , by the old , or St. Louis , and the new , or Haxall . The Haxall flour is used mostly for bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new process more starch and less of the outer coats , which contain much of the phosphates , is retained ; so that the flour makes a whiter and moister bread . This flour packs closer than that made in the old way , so that a pound of it will not measure as much as a pound of the old kind . In using an old rule , one-eighth of this flour should be left out . For instance , if in a recipe for bread you have four quarts ( old-process ) of flour given , of the new-process you would take only three and a half quarts . This flour does not make as good cake and pastry as the old-process . It is , therefore , well , to have a barrel of each , if you have space , for the pastry flour is the cheaper , and the longer all kinds of flour are kept in a dry place , the better they are . Buying in small quantities is extremely extravagant . When you have become accustomed to one brand , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one . The best flour is the cheapest . There are a great many brands that are equally good . Graham . The best Graham is made by grinding good wheat and not sifting it . Much that is sold is a poor quality of flour mixed with bran . This will not , of course , make good , sweet bread . The " Arlington Whole Wheat Meal " is manufactured from pure wheat , and makes delicious bread . Graham , like flour , will keep in a cool , dry place for years . Indian Meal . In most families there is a large amount of this used , but the quantity purchased at a time depends upon the kind of meal selected . The common kind , which is made by grinding between two mill-stones , retains a great deal of moisture , and , in hot weather , will soon grow musty ; but the granulated meal will keep for any length of time . The corn for this meal is first dried ; and it takes about two years for this . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a process that produces grains like granulated sugar . After once using this meal one will not willingly go back to the old kind . Indian meal is made from two kinds of corn , Northern and Southern . The former gives the yellow meal , and is much richer than the Southern , of which white meal is made . Rye Meal . This meal , like the old-process Indian , will grow musty in a short time in hot weather , so that but a small quantity of it should be bought at a time . The meal is much better than the flour for all kinds of bread and muffins . Oat Meal . There are several kinds of oat meal  --  Scotch , Irish , Canadian and American . The first two are sold in small packages , the Canadian and American in any quantity . It seems as if the Canadian and American should be the best because the freshest ; but the fact is the others are considered the choicest . Many people could not eat oat meal in former years , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now what is called pearled meal . All the husks are removed , and the oats are then cut . The coarse kind will keep longer than the fine ground , but it is best to purchase often , and have the meal as fresh as possible . Cracked Wheat . This is the whole wheat just crushed or cut like the coarse oat meal , but unlike the meal . It will keep a long time . It is cooked the same as oat meal . That which is cut makes a handsomer dish than the crushed , but the latter cooks more quickly . Hominy . This is made from corn , and it comes in a number of sizes , beginning with samp and ending with a grade nearly as fine as coarse-granulated sugar . The finest grade is really the best , so many nice dishes can be made with it which you can not make with the coarse . Hominy will keep a long time , and it can be bought in five-pound package or by the barrel . Sugar . The fine-granulated sugar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pure and dry ; therefore , there is more in one pound of it than in a damp , brown sugar , besides its sweetening power being considerably greater . The price of sugar at wholesale is not much less than at retail , but time and trouble are saved by purchasing by the barrel . Spice . It is well to keep on hand all kinds of spice , both whole and ground . They should not be in large quantities , as a good cook will use them very sparingly , and a good house-keeper will have too much regard for the health of her family and the delicacy of her food to have them used lavishly . For soups and sauces the whole spice is best , as it gives a delicate flavor , and does not color . A small wooden or tin box should be partly filled with whole mace , cloves , allspice and cinnamon , and a smaller paste-board box , full of pepper-corns , should be placed in it . By this plan you will have all your spices together when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep well , and if cleaned , washed and well dried , will improve in flavor by being kept . Raisins . In large families , if this fruit is much used , it is well to buy by the box . Time does not improve raisins . Soda , Cream of Tartar , Baking Powder . There should not be so much of these articles used as to require that they be purchased in large quantities . Cream of tartar is expensive , soda cheap . If one prefers to use baking powders there will be no need of cream of tartar , but the soda will still be required for gingerbread and brown bread , and to use with sour milk , etc . The advantage of baking powder is that it is prepared by chemists who know just the proportion of soda to use with the acid ( which should be cream of tartar ) , and the result will be invariable if the cook is exact in measuring the other ingredients . When an inexperienced cook uses the soda and cream of tartar there is apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just now , with the failure of the grape crops in France , from which a greater part of the crystals in use come , cream of tarter is extremely high , and substitutes , such as phosphates , are being used . To be Always Kept on Hand . Besides the things already mentioned , housekeepers should always have a supply of rice , pearl barley , dried beans , split peas , tapioca , macaroni , vermicilli , tea , coffee , chocolate , corn-starch , molasses , vinegar , mustard , pepper , salt , capers , canned tomato , and any other canned vegetables of which a quantity is used . Of the many kind of molasses , Porto Rico is the best for cooking purposes . It is well to have a few such condiments as curry powder ( a small bottle will last for years ) , Halford sauce , essence of anchovies and mushroom ketchup . These give variety to the flavoring , and , if used carefully , will not be an expensive addition , so little is needed for a dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the proper care and use of cooked and uncooked food . The first and great consideration is perfect cleanliness . The ice chest and cellar should be thoroughly cleaned once a week ; the jars in which bread is kept must be washed , scalded and dried thoroughly at least twice a week . When cooked food is placed in either the ice chest or cellar it should be perfectly cool ; if not , it will absorb an unpleasant flavor from the close atmosphere of either place . Meat should not be put directly on the ice , as the water draws out the juices . Always place it in a pan , and this may be set on the ice . When you have a refrigerator where the meat can be hung , a pan is not needed . In winter , too , when one has a cold room , it is best to hang meats there . These remarks apply , of course , only to joints and fowl . The habit which many people have of putting steaks , chops , etc. , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When purchasing meat always have the trimmings sent home , as they help to make soups and sauces . Every scrap of meat and bone left from roasts and broils should be saved for the soup-pot . Trimmings from ham , tongue , corned beef , etc. , should all be saved for the many relishes they will make . Cold fish can be used in salads and warmed up in many palatable ways . In fact , nothing that comes on the table is enjoyed more than the little dishes which an artistic cook will make from the odds and ends left from a former meal . By artistic cook is meant not a professional , but a woman who believes in cleanliness and hot dishes , and that there is something in the appearance as well as in the taste of the food , and who does not believe that a quantity of butter , or of some kind of fat , is essential to the success of nearly every dish cooked . The amount of food spoiled by butter , good butter too , is surprising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that each kind may be kept by itself . The fat trimmings from beef , pork , veal , chickens and fowl should be tried out while fresh , and then strained . The fowl and chicken fat ought to be kept in a pot by itself for shortening and delicate frying . Have a stone pot for it , holding about a quart , and another , holding three or four quarts , for the other kinds . The fat that has been skimmed from soups , boiled beef and fowl , should be cooked rather slowly until the sediment falls to the bottom and there is not the shadow of a bubble . It can then be strained into the jar with the other fat ; but if strained while bubbles remain , there is water in it , and it will spoil quickly . The fat from sausages can also be strained into the larger pot . Another pot , holding about three quarts , should be kept for the fat in which articles of food have been fried . When you have finished frying , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ; then pour the fat into the pot through a fine strainer , being careful to keep back the sediment , which scrape into the soap-grease . In this way you can fry in the same fat a dozen times , while if you are not careful to strain it each time , the crumbs left will burn and blacken all the fat . Occasionally , when you have finished frying , cut up two or three uncooked potatoes and put into the boiling fat . Set on the back of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes ; then set in a cool place for fifteen minutes longer , and strain . The potatoes clarify the fat . Many people use ham fat for cooking purposes ; and when there is no objection to the flavor , it is nice for frying eggs , potatoes , etc . But it should not be mixed with other kinds . The fat from mutton , lamb , geese , turkey or ducks will give an unpleasant flavor to anything with which it is used , and the best place for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravy should be saved , as a small quantity of either adds a great deal to many little dishes . The quicker food of all kinds cools the longer it keeps . This should be particularly remembered with soups and bread . Bread and cake must be thoroughly cooled before being put into box or jar . If not , the steam will cause them to mold quickly . Crusts and pieces of stale bread should be dried in a slow oven , rolled into fine crumbs on a board , and put away for croquettes , cutlets or anything that is breaded . Pieces of stale bread can be used for toast , griddle-cakes and puddings and for dressing for poultry and other kinds of meat . Stale cake can be made into puddings ; The best tub butter will keep perfectly well without a brine if kept in a cool , sweet room . It is more healthful and satisfactory to buy the choicest tub butter and use it for table and cooking purposes than to provide a fancy article for the table and use an inferior one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , butter becomes rancid , to each pint of it add one table-spoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of soda , and mix well ; then add one pint of cold water , and set on the fire until it comes to the boiling point Now set away to cool , and when cool and hard , take off the butter in a cake . Wipe dry and put away for cooking purposes . It will be perfectly sweet . Milk , cream and butter all quickly absorb strong odors ; therefore , care must be taken to keep them in a cool , sweet room or in an ice chest . Cheese should be wrapped in a piece of clean linen and kept in a box . Berries must be kept in a cool place , and uncovered . KITCHEN FURNISHING . Stove , or Range ? The question often arises , even with old housekeepers , Which shall it be  --  a stove or a range ? There are strong points in favor of each . For a small kitchen the range may be commended , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room as intensely as a stove , although it will heat water enough for kitchen and bath-room purposes for a large family . That the range is popular is evident from the fact that nearly every modern house is supplied with one ; and thus the cost of , and cartage for , stoves is generally saved to tenants in these days . There are these advantage of a stove over a set range : it requires less than half as much fuel and is more easily managed  --  that is , the fire can be more quickly started , and if it gets too low , more easily replenished and put in working order ; and the ovens can be more quickly heated or cooled . But , although you can have a water-back and boiler with most modern stoves or , as they are now called , portable ranges , the supply of hot water will not be large . And you can not roast before the fire as with a range . So near-perfection have the makers of ranges and stoves come that it would be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be said not of a few , but of a great many manufacturers , each having his special merit . And where the products are so generally good , it is hard to mention one make in preference to another . When purchasing , it is well to remember , that one of simple construction is the most easily managed and does not soon get out of order . No single piece of furniture contributes so much to the comfort of a family as the range or stove , which should , therefore , be the best of its kind . Gas and Oil Stoves . During the hot weather a gas or oil stove is a great comfort . The " Sun Dial , " manufactured by the Goodwin Gas Stove Co. , Philadelphia , is a " perfect gem , " roasting , baking , broiling , etc. , as well as a coal stove or range . Indeed , meats roasted or broiled by it are jucier than when cooked over or before coals . The peculiar advantage of oil and gas stoves is that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation of a meal , at a trifling expense . The cost of running a gas stove throughout the day is , however , much greater than that of a coal stove , while an oil stove can be run cheaper than either . There are a great many manufacturers of oil stoves , and as a natural consequence , where there is so much competition , the stoves are nearly all good . One would not think of doing the cooking for a large family with one or , indeed , two of them ; but the amount of work that can be accomplished with a single stove is remarkable . They are a great comfort in hot weather , many small families doing their entire cooking with them . Refrigerators . The trouble with most refrigerators is that the food kept in them is apt to have a peculiar taste . This is owing in a great measure to the wood used in the construction of the interior and for the shelves . On the inside of the Eddy chest-shaped refrigerator there is not a particle of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is simply a chest , where the ice is placed on the bottom and slate shelves put on top . With this style of refrigerator the waste of ice is much greater than in those built with a separate compartment for ice , but the food is more healthful . Utensils . The following is a list of utensils with which a kitchen should be furnished . But the housekeeper will find that there is continually something new to be bought . If there be much fancy cooking , there must be an ice cream freezer , jelly and charlotte russe moulds and many little pans and cutters . The right way is , of course , to get the essential articles first , and then , from time to time , to add those used in fancy cooking : Two cast-iron pots , size depending upon range or stove ( they come with the stove ) . One griddle . One porcelain-lined preserving kettle . One fish kettle . Three porcelain-lined stew-pans , holding from one to six quarts . One No. 4 deep Scotch frying kettle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 3 and 6 . Four stamped tin or granite ware stewpans , holding from one pint to four quarts . One double boiler , holding three quarts . One Dover egg-beater . One common wire beater . One meat rack . One dish pan . Two bread pans , holding six and eight quarts respectively . Two milk pans . Two Russian-iron baking pans  --  two sizes . Four tin shallow baking-pans . Four deep pans for loaves . Two quart measures . One deep , round pan of granite-ware , with cover , for braising . One deep Russian-iron French roll pan . Two stamped tin muffin pans . One tea-pot . One coffee-pot . One coffee biggin . One chocolate pot . One colander . One squash strainer . One strainer that will fit on to one of the cast-iron pots . One frying-basket . One melon mould . Two brown bread tins . One round pudding mould . Two vegetable cutters . One tea canister . One coffee canister . One cake box . One spice box . One dredger for flour . One for powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still smaller , for pepper . One boning knife . One French cook 's knife . One large fork . Two case-knives and forks . Two vegetable knives . Four large mixing spoons . Two table-spoons . Six teaspoons . One larding needle . One trussing needle . One set of steel skewers . One wire dish cloth . One whip churn . One biscuit cutter . One hand basin . One jagging iron . Three double broilers  --  one each for toast , fish and meat . One long-handled dipper . One large grater . One apple corer . One flour scoop . One sugar scoop . One lemon squeezer . Chopping tray and knife . Small wooden bowl to use in chopping . Moulding board of good hard wood . Board for cutting-bread on . One for cutting cold meats on . Thick board , or block , on which to break bones , open lobsters , etc . A rolling pin . Wooden buckets for sugar , Graham , Indian and rye meal . Wooden boxes for rice , tapioca , crackers , barley , soda , cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wire flour sieve  --  not too large . A pail for cleaning purposes . One vegetable masher . Stone pot for bread , holding ten quarts . One for butter , holding six quarts . One for pork , holding three quarts . One dust pan and brush . One scrubbing brush . One broom . One blacking brush . Four yellow earthen bowls , holding from six quarts down . Four white , smooth-bottomed bowls , holding one quart each . One bean pot . One earthen pudding dish . All the tin ware should be made from xx tin . It will then keep its shape , and wear three times as long as if made of thin stuff . Scouring with sand soon ruins tin , the coarse sand scratching it and causing it to rust . Sapolio , a soap which comes for cleaning tins , wood-work and paint , will be found of great value in the kitchen . Granite ware , as now made , is perfectly safe to-use . It will not become discolored by any kind of cooking , and is so perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it as quickly as in the porcelain-lined pans . Nearly every utensil used in the kitchen is now made in granite ware . The mixing spoons are , however , not desirable , as the coating of granite peels off when the spoon is bent . Have no more heavy cast-iron articles than are really needed , for they are not easily handled , and are , therefore , less likely to be kept as clean , inside and out , as the lighter and smoother ware . Illustration : Scotch Kettle The Scotch Kettle is quite cheap , and will be found of great value for every kind of frying , as it is so deep that enough fat can put into it to immerse the article to be cooked . Illustration : French Frying-Pan . The French polished frying-pans are particularly nice , because they can be used for any kind of frying and for cooking sauces and omelets . The small size , No. 1 , is just right for an omelet made with two eggs . Illustration : Tin Kitchen . When possible , a tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright fire has a flavor much nicer than when baked in an oven . Illustration : Bird Roaster . The bird roaster will be found valuable . Illustration : Ice Cream Freezer . An ice cream freezer is a great luxury in a family , and will soon do away with that unhealthy dish  --  pie . No matter how small the family , nothing less than a gallon freezer should be bought , because you can make a small quantity of the cream in this size , and when you have friends in , there is no occasion to send to the confectioner 's for what can be prepared as well at home . With the freezer should be purchased a mallet and canvas bag for pounding the ice fine , as much time and ice can be saved . Illustration : Bain-Marie . Illustration : Bain-Marie Pan . A bain-marie is a great convenience for keeping the various dishes hot when serving large dinners . It is simply a large tin pan , which is partially filled with boiling water and placed where this will keep at a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooked food are placed in the water until the time for serving . Illustration : Carving Knife and Fork . The large knives for the kitchen , as well as those belonging in the dining-room , should be kept very sharp . If used about the fire they are soon spoiled . Illustration : French Cook 's Knife . The French cook 's knife is particularly good for carving , cutting bread , etc . It . is rather expensive , but it pays to get one , if only proper care can be taken of it . The butcher 's knife should be used for all heavy work . One should never try to break a bone with a knife . That this is often attempted in both kitchen and dining room , the nicked edges of the knives give proof , and show the greater hardness of the bones . Illustration : Boning Knife . Where much boning is done a small boning knife , costing about seventy-five cents , will be necessary ; It should be used only for this purpose . Illustration : French Vegetable Scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will cut potatoes and other vegetables in balls for frying or boiling . The largest size is the best . Illustration : Garnishing Knife . The garnishing knife flutes vegetables , adding much to their appearance when they are used as a garnish . Illustration : Long French Roll Pan . Illustration : Short French Roll Pan  --  Made of Russian Iron . Illustration : Muffin Pans The long French roll pan , made from Russian iron , is nice for baking long loaves or rolls where a great deal of crust is liked There are muffin pans of tin , Russian iron and granite ware . Those of iron should be chosen last , on account of their weight . It is a good thing to have pans of a number of different shapes , as a variety for the eye is a matter of importance . The muffin rings of former years have done their duty , and should be allowed to rest , the convenient cups , which comes in sheets , more than filling their place . Illustration : Frying Basket . The frying basket should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , need more support than a coarsely-woven basket gives . Illustration : Meat Rack . Where roasting is done in the oven there must be a rack to keep the meat from coming in contact with the water in the bottom of the pan . Illustration : Larding and Trussing Needles . One medium-sized larding needle will answer for all kinds of meat that are to be larded . Illustration : Potato Slicer . A potato slicer will be found useful for slicing potatoes , for frying , or cabbage , for slaw . It cuts vegetables in very thin pieces . Illustration : Steamer for Pot . Steamer for Tea-Kettle . The steamers which fit into the cast-iron pot or the tea-kettle are quite convenient . Both kinds will not , of course , be required . Illustration : Quart Measure The quart measure for milk is the best for common measuring . Being divided into half pints , the one vessel answers for all quantities . A kitchen should be furnished with two measures , one for dry material and the other for liquids . Illustration : Bread Grater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip churn is essential . It is a tin cylinder , perforated on the bottom and sides , in which a dasher of tin , also perforated , can be easily moved tip and down . When this churn is placed in a bowl of cream and the dasher is worked , air is forced through the cream , causing it to froth . Illustration : Double Boiler . The double boiler is invaluable in the kitchen . It is a good plan to have two of them where a great deal of cooking is done . The lower part of the boiler is half filled with boiling water , and the inside kettle is placed in this . By this means food is cooked without danger of burning , and more rapidly than if the kettle were placed directly on the stove , exposed to the cold air , because the boiling water in the outside kettle reaches not only the bottom , but also the sides of that in which the food is . Illustration : Double Broiler , with Back . Illustration : Double Broiler . When broiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a back for the double broiler , for the tin reflects the heat , and the food is cooked much sooner . Illustration : Colander . Illustration : Squash Strainer . The colander is used for draining vegetables , straining soups , etc. , and with the squash arid gravy strainers , it is all that is required in the way of strainers . Illustration : Coffee Biggin . Coffee Pot . Under " Drinks " will be found a description of the French coffee biggin . Illustration : Brown-Bread Tin . There should be two brown-bread tins , each holding three pints . They answer also for steaming puddings . Illustration : Melon Mould . Round Pudding Mould . The melon and round padding moulds are nice for frozen or steamed puddings . Illustration : Stew-Pan . The stew-pans that are porcelain-lined are better than the tin-lined , because the tin is liable to melt when frying is done , as , for instance , when meat and vegetables are fried for a stew . Granite ware stew-pans are made in the same shapes as the porcelain-lined . Illustration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauces and gravies . The porcelain-lined come in the same shapes . Copper is a better conductor of heat than either tin or iron , but when it is not kept perfectly clean , oxide of copper , which is very poisonous , collects on it , and is dissolved by oils and fats . Then when fruit , pickles , or any food containing an acid is allowed to cool in the vessels , verdigris is produced ; and this is a deadly poison . Illustration : Bread or Dish Pan . Shallow Milk Pan . Illustration : Dripping Pan . Bread Pan . The stamped tin-ware is made from a better quality of metal than the soldered ; therefore , it comes higher , but it is in the end cheaper , and it is always safer . Bread , milk and dish pans should be made of stamped tin . The pans for roasting meat should be made of Russian iron . Illustration : Basting Spoon . Ladle . Dredging Box . The spoons for basting and mixing , and also the ladle , should be strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden lemon squeezer is the most easily kept clean , and is , therefore , the best . That made of iron , with a porcelain cup , is stronger , but it needs more care . Illustration : Dover Egg Beater . The Dover egg beater is the best in the market . It will do in five minutes the work that in former years required half an hour . There are three sizes . The smallest is too delicate for a large number of eggs . The second size , selling for $1.25 , is the best for family use . Illustration : Apple Parer . An apple parer saves a great deal of time and fruit , and is not very expensive . Illustration : Wooden Buckets . Illustration : Wooden Boxes . Illustration : Cake Box . Wooden buckets and boxes come in nests , or , they can be bought separately . A good supply of them goes a great way toward keeping a store-room or closet in order . The Japanned ware is best for canisters for tea and coffee and for spice and cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The square boxes have shelves . The most convenient form is the upright . It is higher-priced than the other makes . Illustration : Tea Caddy . Illustration : Spice Box . The spice box is a large box filled with smaller ones for each kind of ground spice . It is very convenient , and , besides , preserves the strength of the contents . Illustration : Oblong Jelly Mould . Illustration : Pointed Jelly Mould . Illustration : Rice Mould . There are so many beautiful moulds for fancy dishes that there is no longer any excuse for turning out jellies , blanc-mange , etc. , in the form of animals . There are two modes of making moulds . By one the tin is pressed or stamped into shape , and by the other it is cut in pieces and soldered together . Moulds made by the first method are quite cheap , but not particularly handsome . Those made in the second way come in a great variety of pretty forms , but as all are imported , they are expensive . Illustration : Crown Moulds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which is served whipped cream , heaped in the centre . Illustration : French Pie Mould . The French pie mould comes in a number of sizes , and can be opened to remove the pie . Deep tin squash-pie plates , answer for custard , cream , Washington and squash pies , and for corn cake . Illustration : Vegetable Cutter . Tin vegetable cutters , for cutting raw vegetables for soups , and the cooked ones for garnishing , are nice to have , as is also a confectioner 's ornamenting tube for decorating cake , etc . Larger tubes come for lady fingers and eclairs . Little pans also come for lady-fingers , but they cost a great deal . The jagging iron will be found useful for pastry and hard gingerbread . Illustration : Lady-Fingers Pan . Illustration : Confectioner 's Tube . Jagging Iron . The little tin , granite ware and silver-plated escaloped shells are pretty and convenient for serving escaloped oysters , lobster , etc . The price for the tin style is two dollars per dozen , for the granite ware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forty dollars . Illustration : Escaloped Shell . SOUPS . Remarks on Soup Stock . There is a number of methods of making soup stocks , and no two will give exactly the same results . One of the simplest and most satisfactory is that of clear stock or bouillon . By this the best flavor of the meat is obtained , for none passes off in steam , as when the meat is boiled rapidly . The second mode is in boiling the stock a great deal , to reduce it . This gives a very rich soup , with a marked difference in the flavor from that made with clear meat kept in water at the boiling point . The third way leaves a mixed stock , which will not be clear unless whites of eggs are used . In following the first methods we buy clear beef specially for the stock , and know from the beginning just how much stock there will be when the work is completed . By the second method we are not sure , because more or less than we estimate may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and pieces of meat left from roasts , and from the trimmings of raw meats , will always be changeable in color , quantity and quality . This is , however , a very important stock , and it should always be kept on hand . No household , even where only a moderate amount of meat is used , should be without a stock-pot . It can be kept on the back of the range or stove while cooking is going on . Two or three times a week it should be put on with the trimmings and bones left from cooked and uncooked meats . This practice will give a supply of stock at all times , which will be of the greatest value in making sauces , side dishes and soups . Meat if only slightly tainted will spoil a stock ; therefore great care must be taken that every particle is perfectly sweet . Vegetables make a stock sour very quickly , so if you wish to keep a stock do not use them . Many rules advise putting vegetables into the stock-pot with the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done they absorb the fine flavor of the meat and give the soup a rank taste . They should cook not more than an hour  --  the last hour  --  in the stock . A white stock is made with veal or poultry . The water in which a leg of mutton or fowl have been boiled makes a good stock for light soups and gravies . A soup stock must be cooled quickly or it will not keep well . In winter any kind of stock ought to keep good a week . That boiled down to a jelly will last the longest . In the warm months three days will be the average time stock will keep . Stock for Clear Soups . Five pounds of clear beef , cut from the lower part of the round ; five quarts of cold water . Let come to a boil , slowly ; skim carefully , and set where it will keep just at the boiling point for eight or ten hours . Strain , and set away to cool . In the morning skim off all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to let the sediment pass in . Into the soup put an onion , one stalk of celery , two leaves of sage , two sprigs of parsley , two of thyme , two of summer savory , two bay leaves , twelve pepper-corns and six whole cloves . Boil gently from ten to twenty minutes ; salt and pepper to taste . Strain through an old napkin . This is now ready for serving as a simple clear soup or for the foundation of all kinds of clear soups . Mixed Stock . Put the trimmings of your fresh meats and the bones and tough pieces left from roasts or broils into the soup pot with one quart of water to every two pounds of meat and bones . When it comes to a boil , skim and set back where it will simmer six hours ; then add a bouquet of sweet herbs , one onion , six cloves and twelve pepper-corns to each gallon of stock . Cook two hours longer ; strain and set in a cool place . In the morning skim off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used for common soups , sauces , and where stock is used in made dishes . It should always be kept on hand , as it really costs nothing but the labor ( which is very little ) , and enters so often into the preparation of simple , yet toothsome , dishes . Consomme . Eight pounds of a shin of veal , eight pounds of the lower part of the round of beef , half a cupful of butter , twelve quarts of cold water , half a small carrot , two large onions , half a head of celery , thirty pepper-corns , six whole cloves , a small piece each of mace and cinnamon , four sprigs each of parsley , sweet marjoram , summer savory and thyme , four leaves of sage , four bay leaves , about one ounce of ham . Put half of the butter in the soup pot and then put in the meat , which has been cut into very small pieces . Stir over a hot fire until the meat begins to brown ; then add one quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick glaze on the bottom of the kettle ( this will be about an hour ) . Add the remainder of the water and let it come to a boil . Skim carefully , and set back where it will simmer for six hours . Fry the vegetables , which have been cut very small , in the remaining butter for half an hour , being careful not to burn them . When done , turn into the soup pot , and at the same time add the herbs and spice . Cook one hour longer ; salt to taste and strain . Set in a very cold place until morning , when skim off all the fat . Turn the soup into the pot , being careful not to turn in the sediment , and set on the fire . Beat the whites and shells of two eggs with one cup of cold water . Stir into the soup , and when it comes to a boil , set back where it will simmer for twenty minutes . Strain through a napkin , and if not ready to use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week in winter , but not more than three days in summer . It is a particularly nicely-flavored soup , and is the foundation for any clear soup , the soup taking the name of the solid used with it , as Consomme au Ris , Consomme with Macaroni , etc . Bouillon . Bouillon , for Germans and other parties , is made the same as the clear stock , using a pint of water to the pound of meat , and seasoning with salt and pepper and with the spice , herbs and vegetables or not , as you please . It should be remembered that the amount of seasoning in the recipe referred to is for one gallon of stock . White Stock . Six pounds of a shin of veal , one fowl , three table-spoonfuls of butter , four stalks of celery , two onions , one blade of mace , one stick of cinnamon , eight quarts of cold water , salt , pepper . Wash and cut the veal and fowl into small pieces . Put the butter in the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cook gently ( stirring often ) half an hour , then add the water . Let it come to a boil , then skim and set back where it will boil gently for six hours . Add the vegetables and spice and boil one hour longer . Strain and cool quickly . In the morning take off all the fat . Then turn the jelly gently into a deep dish , and with a knife scrape off the sediment which is on the bottom . Put the jelly into a stone pot and set in a cold place . This will keep a week in cold weather and three days in warm . Consomme a la Royale . Two eggs , two table-spoonfuls of milk , one-fourth of a tea-spoonful of salt . Beat eggs with a spoon , and add milk and salt Turn into a buttered cup , and place in a pan of warm water .

One and a half cupfuls of flour , one pint of rich cream , four table-spoonfuls of butter , four of grated Parmesan cheese , a speck of cayenne , two eggs , three quarts of clear soup stock . Mix flour , cream , butter , cheese and pepper together . Place the basin in another of hot water and stir until the mixture becomes a smooth , firm paste . Break into it the two eggs , and mix quickly and thoroughly . Cook two minutes longer , and set away to cool . When cold , roll into little balls about the size of an American walnut When the balls are all formed drop them into boiling water and cook gently five minutes ; then put them in the soup tureen and pour the boiling stock on them . Pass a plate of finely grated Parmesan cheese with the soup . Thick Vegetable Soup . One quart of the sediment which is left from the clear stock , one quart of water , one-fourth of a cupful of pearl barley , one good-sized white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two onions , about two pounds of cabbage , three potatoes , salt and pepper . Wash the barley and put it on in the quart of water , and simmer gently for two hours . Then add all the vegetables ( except the potatoes ) , cut very fine , and the quart of stock . Boil gently for one hour and a half , then add the potatoes and the salt and pepper . Cook thirty minutes longer . When there is no stock , take two pounds of beef and two quarts of water . Cook beef , barley and water two hours , and add the vegetables as before . The meat can be served with the soup or as a separate dish . Mulligatawny Soup . One chicken or fowl weighing three pounds , three pounds of veal , two large onions , two large slices of carrot , four stalks of celery , three large table-spoonfuls of butter , one table-spoonful of curry powder , four of flour , salt , pepper , five quarts of water .

Skim , and set back where it will simmer for four hours ( in the mean time taking out the chicken when it is tender ) . Now put the butter into a small frying-pan , and when hot , add the dry flour . Stir until a rich brown ; then take from the fire and add the curry powder . Stir this mixture into the soup , and let it cook half an hour longer ; then strain through a sieve , rinse out the soup pot and return the strained soup to it . Add salt and pepper and the chicken ( which has been freed from the bones and skin and cut into small pieces ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may rise to the top , and serve . This soup is served with plain boiled rice in a separate dish or with small squares of fried or toasted bread . The rice can be served in the soup if you choose . Mulligatawny Soup , No. 2 . Chicken or turkey left from a former dinner , bones and scraps from roast veal , lamb or mutton , four quarts of water , four stalks of celery , four table-spoonfuls of butter , four of flour , one of curry , two onions , two slices of carrot , salt , pepper , half a small cupful of barley .

Stir into the soup ; season with salt and pepper and let simmer very gently one hour . Strain , skim off all the fat and serve with thin slices of lemon , egg or force-meat balls , and the green fat . The lemon should have a very thin rind ; should be put into the tureen and the soup poured over it Cooking the lemon in this or any other soup often gives it a bitter taste . If the soup is wished quite thick , add a table-spoonful of butter to that in which the vegetables were cooked , and use three table-spoonfuls of flour instead of two . Many people use wine in this soup , but it is delicious without . In case you do use wine there should not be more than four table-spoonfuls to this quantity . If you desire the soup extremely rich , use a quart of rich soup stock . The green turtles are so very large that it is only in great establishments that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing the live turtle is not given . Few housekeepers would ever see one . The cans contain not what is commonly called turtle soup , but the meat of the turtle , boiled , and the proper proportions of lean meat , yellow and green fat put together . They cost fifty cents each , and a single can will make soup enough for six persons . Black Bean Soup . A pint of black beans , soaked over night in three quarts of water .

It may seem as if a small number of recipes has been given , but the aim has been to present under the heads of Baking , Boiling , Broiling , Frying and Stewing such general directions that one can not be at a loss as to how to prepare any kind of fish . Once having mastered the five primary methods , and learned also how to make sauces , the variety of dishes within the cook 's power is great All that is required is confidence in the rules , which are perfectly reliable , and will always bring about a satisfactory result if followed carefully . Fish , to be eatable , should be perfectly fresh . Nothing else in the line of food deteriorates so rapidly , especially the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cusk , etc . Most of the oil in this class centres in the liver . Salmon , mackerel , etc. , have it distributed throughout the body , which gives a higher and richer flavor , and at the same time tends to preserve the fish . People who do not live near the seashore do not get that delicious flavor which fish just caught have . If the fish is kept on ice until used , it will retain much of its freshness ; let it once get heated and nothing will bring back the delicate flavor . Fresh fish will be firm , and the skin and scales bright . When fish looks dim and limp , do not buy it . Fish should be washed quickly in only one ( cold ) water , and should not be allowed to stand in it . If it is cut up before cooking , wash while whole , else much of the flavor will be lost . For frying , the fat should be deep enough to cover the article , and yet have it float from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way it is not necessary to have a separate pot of fat for this kind of frying . The same pot , with proper care , will answer for chops , cutlets , muffins , potatoes , croquettes , etc . All the cold fish left from any mode of cooking can be utilized in making delicious salads , croquettes , and escallops . Boiled Fish . A general role for boiling fish , which will hold good for all kinds , and thus save a great deal of time and space , is this : Any fresh fish weighing between four and six pounds should be first washed in cold water and then put into boiling water enough to cover it , and containing one table-spoonful of salt . Simmer gently thirty minutes ; then take up . A fish kettle is a great convenience , and it can be used also for boiling hams . When you do not have a fish kettle , keep a piece of strong white cotton cloth in which pin the fish before putting into the boiling water . This will hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , of course , there will be great waste , besides the dish 's not looking so handsome and appetizing . There should be a gentle bubbling of the water , and nothing more , all the time the fish is in it , A fish weighing more than six pounds should cook five minutes longer for every additional two pounds . Boiled fish can be served with a great variety of sauces . After you have learned to make them ( which is a simple matter ) , if you can not get a variety of fish you will not miss it particularly , the sauce and mode of serving doing much to change the whole character of the dish . Many people put a table-spoonful of vinegar in the water in which the fish is boiled . The fish flakes a little more readily for it . Small fish , like trout , require from four to eight minutes to cook . They are , however , much better baked , broiled or fried . Court-Bouillon . This preparation gives boiled fish a better flavor than cooking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is no necessity for it . Four quarts of water , one onion , one slice of carrot , two cloves , two table-spoonfuls of salt , one teaspoonful of pepper , one table-spoonful of vinegar , the juice of half a lemon and a bouquet of sweet herbs are used . Tie the onion , carrot , cloves and herbs in a piece of muslin , and put in the water with the other ingredients . Cover , and boil slowly for one hour . Then put in the fish and cook as directed for plain boiling . Boiled Cod with Lobster Sauce . Boil the fish , as directed see boiled fish , and , when done , carefully remove the skin from one side ; then turn the fish over on to the dish on which it is to be served , skin side up . Remove the skin from this side . Wipe the dish with a damp cloth . Pour a few spoonfuls of the sauce over the fish , and the remainder around it ; garnish with parsley , and serve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sauce . The same as cod . In fact , all kinds of fish can be served in the same manner ; but the lighter are the better , as the sauce is so rich that it is not really the thing for salmon and blue fish . Many of the best cooks and caterers , however , use the lobster sauce with salmon , but salmon has too rich and delicate a flavor to be mixed with the lobster . Cold Boiled Fish , a la Vinaigrette . If the fish is whole , take off the head and skin , and then place it in the centre of a dish . Have two cold hard-boiled eggs , and cut fine with a silver knife or spoon , ( steel turns the egg black ) . Sprinkle the fish with this , and garnish either with small lettuce leaves , water-cresses , or cold boiled potatoes and beets , cut in slices . Place tastefully around the dish , with here and there a sprig of parsley . Serve the vinaigrette sauce in a separate dish . Help to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoonful of the sauce over the fish as you serve it . This makes a nice dish for tea in summer , and takes the place of a salad , as it is , in fact , a kind of salad . If the fish is left from the dinner , and is broken , pick free from skin and bones , heap it lightly in the centre of the dish , sprinkle the sauce over it , and set away in a cool place until tea time . Then add the garnish , and serve as before . Many people prefer the latter method , as the fish is seasoned better and more easily served . The cold fish remaining from a bake or broil can be served in the same manner . This same dish can be served with a sauce piquante or Tartare sauce , for a change . Baked Fish . As for the boiled fish , a general rule , that will cover all kinds of baked fish , is herewith given : A fish weighing about five pounds ; three large , or five small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two table-spoonfuls of salt , quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper , half a table-spoonful of chopped parsley , two table-spoonfuls of flour . If the fish has not already been scraped free of scales , scrape , and wash clean ; then rub into it one table-spoonful of the salt . Roll the crackers very fine , and add to them the parsley , one table-spoonful of chopped pork , half the pepper , half a table-spoonful of salt , and cold water to moisten well . Put this into the body of the fish , and fasten together with a skewer . Butter a tin sheet and put it into a baking pan . Cut gashes across the fish , about half an inch deep and two inches long . Cut the remainder of the pork into strips , and put these into the gashes . Now put the fish into the baking pan , and dredge well with salt , pepper and flour . Cover the bottom of the pan with hot water , and put into a rather hot oven . Bake one hour , basting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time with salt , pepper and flour . The water in the pan must often be renewed , as the bottom is simply to be covered with it each time . The fish should be basted every fifteen minutes . When it is cooked , lift from the pan on to the tin sheet , and slide it carefully into the centre of the dish on which it is to be served . Pour around it Hollandaise sauce , tomato sauce , or any kind you like . Garnish with parsley . Broiled Fish . Bluefish , young cod , mackerel , salmon , large trout , and all other fish , when they weigh between half a pound and four pounds , are nice for broiling . When smaller or larger they are not so good . Always use a double broiler , which , before putting the fish into it , rub with either butter or a piece of salt pork . This prevents sticking . The thickness of the fish will have to be the guide in broiling . A bluefish weighing four pounds will take from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks brown the fish handsomely over the coals and then put it into the oven to finish broiling . Where the fish is very thick , this is a good plan . If the fish is taken from the broiler to be put into the oven , it should be slipped on to a tin sheet , that it may slide easily into the platter at serving time ; for nothing so mars a dish of fish as to have it come to the table broken . In broiling , the inside should be exposed to the fire first , and then the skin . Great care must be taken that the skin does not burn . Mackerel will broil in from twelve to twenty minutes , young cod ( also called scrod ) in from twenty to thirty minutes , bluefish in from twenty to thirty minutes , salmon , in from twelve to twenty minutes , and whitefish , bass , mullet , etc. , in about eighteen minutes . All kinds of broiled fish can be served with a seasoning of salt , pepper and butter , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maitre d ' hotel , Tartare , sharp , tomato and curry . Always , when possible , garnish with parsley or something else green . Broiled Halibut . Season the slices with salt and pepper , and lay them in melted butter for half an hour , having them well covered on both sides . Roll in flour , and broil for twelve minutes over a clear fire . Serve on a hot dish , garnishing with parsley and slices of lemon . The slices of halibut should be about an inch thick , and for every pound there should be three table-spoonfuls of butter . Broiled Halibut , with Maitre d ' Hotel Butter . Butter both sides of the broiler . Season the slices of halibut with salt and pepper , place them in the broiler and cook over clear coals for twelve minutes , turning frequently . Place on a hot dish , and spread on them the sauce , using one spoonful to each pound . Garnish with parsley . Stewed Fish . Six pounds of any kind of fish , large or small ; three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork , or , half a cupful of butter ; two large onions , three table-spoonfuls of flour , salt and pepper to taste . Cut the heads from the fish , and cut out all the bones . Put the heads and bones on to boil in the three pints of water . Cook gently half an hour . In the meanwhile cut the pork in slices , and fry brown . Cut the onions in slices , and fry in the pork fat . Stir the dry flour into the onion and fat , and cook three minutes , stirring all the time . Now pour over this the water in which the bones have been cooking , and simmer ten minutes . Have the fish cut in pieces about three inches square . Season well with salt and pepper , and place in the stew-pan . Season the sauce with salt and pepper , and strain on the fish . Cover tight , and simmer twenty minutes . A bouquet of sweet herbs , simmered with the bones , is an improvement . Taste to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platter . Garnish with potato balls and parsley . The potato balls are cut from the raw potatoes with a vegetable scoop , and boiled ten minutes in salted water . Put them in little heaps around the dish . Fried Fish . All small fish , like brook trout , smelts , perch , etc. , are best fried . They are often called pan-fish for this reason . They should be cleaned , washed and drained , then well salted , and rolled in flour and Indian meal ( half of each ) , which has been thoroughly mixed and salted . For every four pounds of fish have half a pound of salt pork , cut in thin slices , and fried a crisp brown . Take the pork from the pan and put the fish in , having only enough to cover the bottom . Fry brown on one side ; turn , and fry the other side . Serve on a hot dish , with the salt pork as a garnish . Great care must be taken that the pork or fat does not burn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cod , haddock , cusk and halibut are all cut in handsome slices and fried in this manner ; or , the slices can be well seasoned with salt and pepper , dipped in beaten egg , rolled in bread or cracker crumbs and fried in boiling fat enough to cover . This method gives the handsomer dish , but the first the more savory . Where Indian meal is not liked , all flour can be used . Serve very hot Any kind of fried fish can be served with beurre noir , but this is particularly nice for that which is fried without pork . When the cooked fish is placed in the dish , pour the butter over it , garnish with parsley , and serve . To Cook Salt Codfish . The fish should be thoroughly washed , and soaked in cold water over night . In the morning change the water , and put on to cook . As soon as the water comes to the boiling point set back where it will keep hot , but will not boil . From four to six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are kinds which will cook in half an hour . The boneless codfish , put up at the Isles of Shoals , by Brown &; Seavey , will cook in from half an hour to an hour . Where a family uses only a small quantity of salt fish at a time , this is a convenient and economical way to buy it , as there is no waste with bone or skin . It comes in five pound boxes , and costs sixty cents . Dropped Fish Balls . One pint bowlful of raw fish , two heaping bowlfuls of pared potatoes , ( let the potatoes be under medium size ) , two eggs , butter , the size of an egg , and a little pepper . Pick the fish very fine , and measure it lightly in the bowl . Put the potatoes into the boiler , and the fish on top of them ; then cover with boiling water , and boil half an hour . Drain off all the water , and mash fish and potatoes together until fine and light . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well beaten . Have a deep kettle of boiling fat . Dip a table-spoon in it , and then take up a spoonful of the mixture , having care to get it into as good shape as possible . Drop into the boiling fat , and cook until brown , which should be in two minutes . Be careful not to crowd the balls , and , also , that the fat is hot enough . The spoon should be dipped in the fat every time you take a spoonful of the mixture . These balls are delicious . Common Fish Balls . One pint of finely-chopped cooked salt fish , six medium-sized potatoes , one egg , one heaping table-spoonful of butter , pepper , two table-spoonfuls of cream , or four of milk . Pare the potatoes , and put on in boiling water . Boil half an hour . Drain off all the water , turn the potatoes into the tray with the fish , and mash light and fine with a vegetable masher . Add the butter , pepper , milk and eggs , and mix all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shape into smooth balls , the size of an egg , and fry brown in boiling fat enough to float them . They will cook in three minutes . If the potatoes are very mealy it will take more milk or cream to moisten them , about two spoonfuls more . If the fat is smoking in the centre , and the balls are made very smooth , they will not soak fat ; but if the fat is not hot enough , they certainly will . Putting too many balls into the fat at one time cools it . Put in say four or five . Let the fat regain its first temperature , then add more . Salt Fish with Dropped Eggs . One pint of cooked salt fish , one pint of milk or cream , two table-spoonfuls of flour , one of butter , six eggs , pepper . Put milk on to boil , keeping half a cupful of it to mix the flour .

Add the salt , pepper , one table-spoonful of butter , and the cupful of milk , which has been allowed to come to a boil . Beat very thoroughly , and spread a thin layer of the potatoes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the edge , making a wall to keep in the cream and fish , which should then be poured in . Garnish the border with parsley , and serve . To prepare the fish when well mixed , add two table-spoonfuls of the hot milk .

Put the fish on in boiling water enough to cover , and which contains one table-spoonful of salt . Cook gently twenty minutes ; then lift out of the water , but let it remain on the tray . Now carefully remove all the skin and the head ; then turn the fish over into the dish in which it is to be served ( it should be stone china ) , and scrape off the skin from the other side . Pick out all the small bones . You will find them the whole length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fish , near the tail . They are in rows like pins in a paper , and if you start all right it will take but a few minutes to remove them . Then take out the back-bone , starting at the head and working gently down toward the tail . Great care must be taken , that the fish may keep its shape . Cover with the cream , and bake about ten minutes , just to brown it a little . Garnish with parsley or little puff-paste cakes ; or , you can cover it with the whites of three eggs , beaten to a stiff froth , and then slightly brown . To prepare the cream : Put the milk , parsley and onion on to boil , reserving half a cupful of milk to mix with the flour . When it boils , stir in the flour , which has been mixed smoothly with the cold milk . Cook eight minutes .

Put fish on to boil , then the cream and milk . Mix the flour with half a cupful of cold milk , and stir into boiling cream and milk . Cook eight minutes and season highly with salt and pepper . Remove skin and bones from fish , and break it into flakes . Put a layer of sauce in a deep escalop dish , and then a layer of fish , which dredge well with salt ( a table-spoonful ) and pepper ; then another layer of sauce , again fish , and then sauce . Cover with the bread crumbs , and bake half an hour . This quantity requires a dish holding a little over two quarts , or , two smaller dishes will answer . If for the only solid dish for dinner , this will answer for six persons ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , it will serve twelve . Cold boiled fish can be used when you have it . Great care must be taken to remove every bone when fish is prepared with a sauce , ( as when it is served a la creme , escaloped , &c.),; because one can not look for bones then as when the sauce is served separately . Turbot a la Creme . Boil five or six pounds of haddock . Take out all bones , and shred the fish very fine . Let a quart of milk , a quarter of an onion and a piece of parsley come to a boil ; then stir in a scant cupful of flour , which has been mixed with a cupful of cold milk , and the yolks of two eggs . Season with half a teaspoonful of white pepper , the same quantity of thyme , half a cupful of butter , and well with salt . Butter a pan , and put in first a layer of sauce , then one of fish . Finish with sauce , and over it sprinkle cracker crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour in a moderate oven . Matelote of Codfish . Cut off the head of a codfish weighing five pounds .

Place five slices of pork both under and over the fish . Boil the bones in a pint of water , and pour this around the fish . Bake an hour , and baste often with gravy and butter . Have a bouquet in the corner of the baking pan . Make a gravy , and pour around the fish . Then garnish with fried smelts . Smelts a la Tartare . Clean the smelts by drawing them between the finger and thumb , beginning at the tail . This will press out the insides at the opening at the gills . Wash them , and drain in the colander ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cracker crumbs ( one egg and one cupful of crumbs to twelve smelts , unless these are very large ) . Dip first in the egg , and then roll in the crumbs . Fry in boiling fat deep enough to float them . They should be a handsome brown in two minutes and a half . Take them up , and place on a sheet of brown paper for a few moments , to drain ; then place on a hot dish . Garnish with parsley and a few slices of lemon , and serve with Tartare sauce in a separate dish ; or , they may be served without the sauce . Smelts as a Garnish , Smelts are often fried , as for a la Tartare ; or , rolled in meal or flour , and then fried , they are used to garnish other kinds of fish . With baked fish they are arranged around the dish in any form that the taste of the cook may dictate ; but in garnishing fish , or any other dish , the arrangement should always be simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder than if the dish were not garnished . Smelts are also seasoned well with salt and pepper , dipped in butter and afterwards in flour , and placed in a very hot oven for eight or ten minutes to get a handsome brown . They are then served as a garnish or on slices of buttered toast . When smelts are used as a garnish , serve one on each plate with the other fish . If you wish to have the smelts in rings , for a garnish , fasten the tails in the opening at the gills , with little wooden tooth picks ; then dip them in the beaten egg and in the crumbs , place in the frying basket and plunge into the boiling fat . When they are cooked take out the skewers , and they will retain their shape . Fish au Gratin . Any kind of light fish  --  that is , cod , cusk , flounder , etc . Skin the fish by starting at the head and drawing down towards the tail ; then take out the bones . Cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pepper well . Butter such a dish , as you would use for escolloped oysters . Put in one layer of fish , then moisten well with sauce ; add more fish and sauce , and finally cover with fine bread crumbs . Bake half an hour . The dish should be rather shallow , allowing only two layers of fish . Sauce for au gratin : One pint of stock , three table-spoonfuls of butter , two of flour , juice of half a lemon , half a tablespoonful of chopped parsley , a slice of onion , the size of half a dollar , and about as thick  --  chopped very fine , ( one table-spoonful of onion juice is better ) ; one table-spoonful of vinegar , salt , pepper . Heat the butter in a small frying-pan , and when hot , add the dry flour . Stir constantly until a rich brown ; then add , gradually , the cold stock , stirring all the time . As soon as it boils , season well with salt and pepper , and then add the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , weighed after being skinned and boned , and will serve six persons if it is the only solid dish for dinner , or ten if served in a course . Another way to serve fish au gratin , is to skin it , cut off the head , and take out the back-bone ; and there are then two large pieces of fish . Season the fish , and prepare the sauce as before . Butter a tin sheet that will fit loosely into a large baking-pan . Lay the fish on this , and moisten well with the sauce . Cover thickly with bread crumbs , and cook twenty-five minutes in a rather quick oven . Then slip on a hot dish , and serve with tomato , Tartare or Hollandaise sauce poured around the fish . Eels a la Tartare . Cut the eels into pieces about four inches long . Cover them with boiling water , in which let them stand five minutes , and then drain them .

Place the fried eels in a circle on this , garnish with parsley , and serve . Stewed Eels . Cut two eels in pieces about four inches long . Put three large table-spoonfuls of butter into the stew-pan with half a small onion . As soon as the onion begins to turn yellow stir in two table-spoonfuls of flour , and stir until brown . Add one pint of stock , if you have it ; if not , use water . Season well with pepper and salt ; then put in the eels and two bay leaves . Cover , and simmer gently three-quarters of an hour . Heap the eels in the centre of a hot dish , strain the sauce over them and garnish with toasted bread and parsley . If you wish , add a table-spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice to the stew . OYSTERS . On the Half Shell . Not until just before serving should they be opened . Marketmen often furnish some one to do this . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the shell , they are placed on a dinner plate , with a thin slice of lemon in the centre of the dish . On a Block of Ice . Having a perfectly clear and solid block of ice , weighing ten or fifteen pounds , a cavity is to be made in the top of it in either of two ways . The first is to carefully chip with an ice pick ; the other , to melt with heated bricks . If the latter be chosen the ice must be put into a tub or large pan , and one of the bricks held upon the centre of it until there is a slight depression , yet sufficient for the brick to rest in . When the first brick is cold remove it , tip the block on one side , to let off the water , and then use another brick . Continue the operation till the cavity will hold as many oysters as are to be served . These should be kept an hour previous in a cool place ; should be drained in a colander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After laying two folded napkins on a large platter , to prevent the block from slipping , cover the dish with parsley , so that only the ice is visible . Stick a number of pinks , or of any small , bright flowers that do not wilt rapidly , into the parsley . Pour oysters into the space in the top of the ice , and garnish with thin slices of lemon . This gives an elegant dish , and does away with the unsightly shells in which raw oysters are usually served . It is not expensive , for the common oysters do as well as those of good size . Indeed , as many ladies dislike the large ones , here is an excellent substitute for serving in the shell , particularly as the oysters require no seasoning when once on the table . A quart is enough for a party of ten ; but a block of the size given will hold two quarts . Roasted Oysters on Toast .

Lobster , to be eatable , should be perfectly fresh . One of the tests of freshness is to draw back the tail , for if it springs into position again , it is safe to think the fish good . The time of boiling varies with the size of the lobster and in different localities . In Boston , Rockport and other places on the Massachusetts coast the time is fifteen or twenty minutes for large lobsters and ten for small . The usual way is to plunge them into boiling water enough to cover , and to continue boiling them until they are done . Some people advocate putting the lobsters into cold water , and letting this come to a boil gradually . They claim that the lobsters do not suffer so much . This may be so , but it seems as if death must instantly follow the plunge into boiling water . Cooking a lobster too long makes it tough and dry . When , on opening a lobster , you find the meat clinging to the shell , and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiling was too long . There are very few modes of cooking lobster in which it should be more than thoroughly heated , as much cooking toughens it and destroys the fine , delicate flavor of the meat . To open a lobster . Separate the tail from the body , and shake out the tom-ally , and , also , the " coral , " if there is any , upon a plate . Then by drawing the body from the shell with the thumb , and pressing the part near the head against the shell with the first and second finger , you will free it from the stomach or " lady . " Now split the lobster through the centre and , with a fork , pick the meat from the joints . Cut the under side of the tail shell open and take out the meat without breaking . On the upper part of that end of this meat which joined the body is a small piece of flesh , which should be lifted ; and a strip of meat attached to it should be turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncover a little vein , running the entire length , which must be removed . Sometimes this vein is dark , and sometimes as light as the meat itself . It and the stomach are the only parts not eatable . The piece that covered the vein should be turned again into place . Hold the claws on edge on a thick board , and strike hard with a hammer until the shell cracks . Draw apart , and take out the meat . If you have the claws lying flat on the board when you strike , you not only break the shell , but mash the meat , and thus spoil a fine dish . Remember that the stomach of the lobster is found near the head , and is a small , hard sack containing poisonous matter ; and that the intestinal vein is found in the tail . These should always be carefully removed . When lobster is opened in the manner explained it may be arranged handsomely on a dish , and each person can season it at the table to suit himself . Lobster Broiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cutting lengthwise . Break the large claws in two parts , and free the body from the small claws and stomach . Replace the body in the shell . Put the meat from the claws in half of the shells it came from , and put the other half of the shells where they will get hot . Put the lobster into the double broiler , and cook , with the meat side exposed to the fire , for eight minutes ; then turn , and cook ten minutes longer . Place on a hot dish , and season slightly with salt and cayenne , and then well with maitre d ' hotel butter . Cover the claws with the hot shells . Garnish the dish with parsley , and serve . Broiled Lobster . Split the meat of the tail and claws , and season well with salt and pepper . Cover with soft butter and dredge with flour . Place in the broiler , and cook over a bright fire until a delicate brown . Arrange on a hot dish , pour Bechamel sauce around , and serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and claws , and season well with salt and pepper . Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs , which let dry on the meat ; and then repeat the operation . Place in a frying-basket , and plunge into boiling fat . Cook till a golden brown  --  about two minutes . Serve with Tartare sauce . Stewed Lobster . The meat of a two and a half pound lobster , cut into dice ; two table-spoonfuls of butter , two of flour , one pint of stock or water , a speck of cayenne , salt and pepper to taste .

Add the lobster ; heat thoroughly , and serve . Curry of Lobster .

Add the meat of lobster , cut into dice , and simmer five minutes . Serve with a border of boiled rice around the dish . Devilled Lobster in the Shell . Two lobsters , each weighing about two and a half pounds ; one pint of cream , two table-spoonfuls of butter , two of flour , one of mustard , a speck of cayenne , salt , pepper , a scant pint of bread crumbs . Open the lobster and , with a sharp knife , cut the meat rather fine . Be careful , in opening , not to break the body or tail shells . Wash these shells and wipe dry ; join them in the form of a boat , that they may hold the prepared meat . Put the cream on to boil . Mix the butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three spoonfuls of the boiling cream . Stir all into the remaining cream , and cook two minutes . Add the lobster , salt and pepper , and boil one minute . Fill the shells with the mixture , and place in a pan , with something to keep them in position ( a few small stones answer very well ) . Cover with the bread crumbs , and brown for twenty minutes in a hot oven . Serve on a long , narrow dish ; the body in the centre , the tails at either end . Garnish with parsley . If for a large company , it would be best to have a broad dish , and have four lobsters , instead of two . This is a very handsome dish , and is really not hard to cook . There is always a little more of the prepared lobster than will go into the shells without crowding , and this is nice warmed and served on slices of crisp toast . Escaloped Lobster . Prepare the lobster as for devilling , omitting , however , the mustard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crumbs . Brown in a hot oven , and serve . White stock may be used instead of the cream . Many people who can not eat lobster when prepared with cream or milk , find it palatable when prepared with stock or water . Lobster Cutlets .

Make perfectly smooth with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut into chops , to resemble cutlets . Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs , being sure to have every part covered . Place in the frying-basket and plunge into boiling fat . Cook till a rich brown . It will take about two minutes . Drain for a moment in the basket ; then arrange on a hot dish , and put part of a small claw in each one , to represent the bone in a cutlet . Put the parsley in the basket and plunge for a moment into the boiling fat . Garnish with this , or , pour a white or Bechamel sauce around the dish , and garnish with fresh parsley . The quantity given will make six or seven cutlets . Canned Lobster . Canned lobster can be used for cutlets , stews , curries and patties , can be escaloped , or served on toast . OTHER SHELL-FISH . Stewed Terrapins . Put them into boiling water , and boil rapidly for ten or fifteen minutes , or until the nails will come out and the black skin rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this , put into fresh boiling water , and boil until the under shell cracks , which will be about three-quarters of an hour . Remove the under shell , throw away the sand and gall bags , take out intestines , and put the terrapins to boil again in the same water for an hour . Pick liver and meat from upper shell . Cut the intestines in small pieces , and add to this meat . Pour over all a quantity of the liquor in which the intestines were boiled sufficient to make very moist . Put away until the next day . For each terrapin , if of good size , a gill of cream and of wine , half a cupful of butter , yolks of two hard-boiled eggs , rubbed smooth , salt , pepper and cayenne are needed . Pour over the terrapin , let it come to a boil , and serve ,  --  Mrs. Furness , of Philadelphia . Soft-Shell Crabs . Lift the shell at both sides and remove the spongy substance found on the back .

Serve with Tartare sauce . Or , the egg and bread crumbs may be omitted . Season with salt and cayenne , and fry as before , When broiled , crabs are cleaned , and seasoned with salt and cayenne ; are then dropped into boiling water for one minute , taken up , and broiled over a hot fire for eight minutes . They are served with maitre d ' hotel butter or Tartare sauce . MEATS . BOILING . All pieces , unless very salt , should be plunged into boiling water , and boiled rapidly for fifteen minutes , to harden the albumen that is on the outside , and thus keep in the juices . The kettle should then be put back where it will just simmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while that which is kept just at the boiling point ( where the water hardly bubbles ) will cut tender and juicy , provided there is any juiciness in it at the beginning . White meats , like mutton and poultry , are improved in appearance by having rice boiled with them ; or , a still better way is to thickly flour a piece of coarse cotton cloth , pin the meat in it , and place in the boiling water . Meat cooked in this way will be extremely juicy . Leg of Mutton . Cook , as directed , in boiling water to cover . A leg that weighs eight or nine pounds will cook in one hour and a quarter if it is wanted done rare . Allow five minutes for every additional pound . Save the water for soups . Lamb . Cook the same as mutton . Serve with drawn butter . Boiled Ham . Wash the ham very clean , and put on with cold water to cover . Simmer gently five hours , and set the kettle aside for one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw off the skin . Cover with cracker crumbs and about three table-spoonfuls of sugar . Place in the oven , in a baking-pan , for thirty or forty minutes . Many people stick cloves into the fat part of the ham , and use only a few crumbs . The time given is for a ham weighing about twelve pounds ; every pound over that will require fifteen minutes more . The fish kettle comes next to a regular ham kettle , and answers quite as well as both . If you have neither kettle , and no pot large enough to hold all the meat , cut off the knuckle , which will cook in about two hours . But this rather hurts the flavor and appearance of the dish . Salt Tongue . Soak over night , and cook from five to six hours . Throw into cold water and peel off the skin . Fresh Tongue . Put into boiling water to cover , with two table-spoonfuls of salt . Cook from five to six hours . Skin the same as salt tongue . Corned Beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very salt ; but such a piece as one finds in town and city shops , and which the butchers corn themselves , put into boiling water . Cook very slowly for six hours . This time is for a piece weighing eight or ten pounds . When it is to be served cold let it stand for one or two hours in the water in which it was boiled . If the beef is to be pressed , get either a piece of the brisket , flank or rattle-ran . Take out the bones , place in a flat dish or platter , put a tin sheet on top , and lay on it two or three bricks . If you have a corned beef press , use that , of course . ROASTING . There are two modes of roasting : one is to use a tin Kitchen before an open fire , and the other and more common way is to use a very hot oven . The former gives the more delicious favor , but the second is not by any means a poor way , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly when in the oven . A large piece is best for roasting , this being especially true of beef . When meat is cooked in a tin kitchen it requires more time , because the heat is not equally distributed , as it is in the oven . To prepare for roasting : Wipe the meat with a wet towel . Dredge on all sides with salt , pepper and flour ; and if the kitchen is used , dredge the flour into that . Run the spit through the centre of the meat , and place very near the fire at first , turning as it browns . When the flour in the kitchen is browned , add a pint of hot water , and baste frequently with it , dredging with salt and flour after each basting . Roast a piece of beef weighing eight pounds fifty minutes , if to be rare , but if to be medium , roast one hour and a quarter , and ten minutes for each additional pound . Roasting in the Oven . Prepare the meat as before . Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the pan rather lightly with flour , put in rack , and then meat Place in a very hot oven for a few minutes , to brown the flour in the pan , and then add hot water enough to cover the bottom of the pan . Close the oven ; and in about ten minutes , open , and baste the meat with the gravy . Dredge with salt , pepper and flour . Do this every fifteen minutes ; and as soon as one side of the meat is brown , turn , and brown the other . Make gravy as before . Allow a quarter of an hour less in the oven than in the tin kitchen . The heat for roasting must be very great at first , to harden the albumen , and thus keep in the juices . After the meat is crusted over it is not necessary to keep up so great a heat , but for rare meats the heat must , of course , be greater than for those that are to be well done . The kitchen can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drafts closed . Putting salt on fresh meat draws out the juices , but by using flour a paste is formed , which , keeps in all the juices and also enriches and browns the piece . Never roast meat without having a rack in the pan . If meat is put into the water in the pan it becomes soggy and looses its flavor . A meat rack costs not more than thirty or forty cents , and the improvement in the looks and flavor of a piece of meat is enough to pay for it in one roasting . The time given for roasting a piece of beef is for rib roasts and sirloin . The same weight in the face or the back of the rump will require twenty minutes longer , as the meat on these cuts is in a very compact form . If a saddle or loin of mutton is to be roasted , cook the same time as beef if the weight is the same ; but if a leg is to be roasted , one hour and a quarter is the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; veal , two hours and three-quarters ; pork , three hours and a quarter . Ten minutes before dishing the dinner turn the gravy into a sauce-pan , skim off all the fat , and set on the stove . Let it come to a boil ; then stir in one table-spoonful of flour , mixed with half a cupful of cold water . Season with salt and pepper , and cook two minutes . Serve the meat on a hot dish and the gravy in a hot tureen . Boiled Rib Roast . Either have the butcher remove the bones , or do it your-self by slipping a sharp knife between the flesh and bones  --  a simple matter with almost any kind of meat . Roll up the piece and tie with strong twine . Treat the same as plain roast beef , giving the same time as if it were a piece of rump ( one hour and a half for eight pounds ) , as the form it is now in does not readily admit the heat to all parts . This piece of beef can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and braised . Serve with tomato or horse-radish sauce . Roast Beef , with Yorkshire Pudding . A rib or sirloin roast should be prepared as directed for roasting . When within three-quarters of an hour of being done , have the pudding made . Butter a pan like that in which the meat is being cooked , and pour in the batter . Put the rack across the pan , not in it . Place the meat on the rack , return to the oven , and cook forty-five minutes . If you have only one pan , take up the meat , pour off the gravy and put in the pudding . Cut in squares , and garnish the beef with these . Another method is to have a pan that has squares stamped in it . This gives even squares and crust on all the edges , which baking in the flat pan does not . When the meat is roasted in the tin-kitchen , let the pudding bake in the oven for half an hour , and then place it under the meat to catch the drippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two-thirds of a cupful of flour , three eggs and one scant teaspoonful of salt will be needed . Beat the eggs very light . Add salt and milk , and then pour about half a cupful of the mixture upon the flour ; and when perfectly smooth , add the remainder . This makes a small pudding  --  about enough for six persons . Serve it hot . Fillet of Veal , Roasted . About eight or ten pounds of the fillet , ham force-meat ( see rule for force-meat ) , half a cupful of butter , half a teaspoonful of pepper , two table-spoonfuls of salt , two lemons , half a pound of salt pork . Rub the salt and pepper into the veal ; then fill the cavity , from which the bone was taken , with the force-meat . Skewer and tie the fillet into a round shape . Cut the pork in thin slices , and put half of these on a tin sheet that will fit into the dripping pan ; place this in the pan , and the fillet on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put hot water enough in the pan to just cover the bottom , and place in the oven . Bake slowly for four hours , basting frequently with the gravy in the pan , and with salt , pepper and flour . As the water in the pan cooks away , it must be renewed , remembering to have only enough to keep the meat and pan from burning . After it has been cooking three hours , take the pork from the top of the fillet , spread the top thickly with butter and dredge with flour . Repeat this after thirty minutes , and then brown handsomely . Put the remainder of the butter , which should be about three table-spoonfuls , in a sauce-pan , and when hot , add two heaping table-spoonfuls of flour , and stir until dark brown . Add to it half a pint of stock or water ; stir a minute , and set back where it will keep warm , but not cook . Now take up the fillet , and skim all the fat off of the gravy ; add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the sauce just made . Let this boil up , and add the juice of half a lemon , and more salt and pepper , if needed . Strain , and pour around the fillet . Garnish the dish with potato puffs and slices of lemon . Roast Ham . Prepare the ham as for boiling , and if it is of good size ( say ten pounds ) , boil three hours . Remove the skin , and put the ham in a baking pan . Let it cook two hours in a moderate oven . Serve with champagne sauce . BROILING . The fire for broiling must be clear , and for meats it must be hotter and brighter than for fish . Coals from hard wood or charcoal are best , but in all large towns and cities hard coal is nearly always used , except in hotels and restaurants , where there is usually a special place for broiling with charcoal . The double broiler is the very best thing in the market for broiling meats and fish . When the meat is placed in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there is to do is to hold the broiler over the fire , or , if you have an open range , before the fire . A fork or knife need not go near the meat until it is on the dish . A great amount of the juice is saved . With the old-fashioned gridirons it is absolutely necessary to stick a fork into the meat to turn it , and although there are little grooves for the gravy to run into , what is saved in this way does not compare with what is actually kept within the meat where the double broiler is used . Professional cooks can turn a steak without running a fork into the meat , but not one in a hundred common cooks can do it . Mutton Chops . Sprinkle the chops with salt , pepper and flour . Put them in the double broiler . Broil over or before the fire for eight minutes . Serve on a hot dish with butter , salt and pepper for tomato sauce . The fire for chops should not be as hot as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrapped in buttered paper and broiled ten minutes over a hot fire . Beef Steak . Have it cut thick . It will never be good , rich and juicy if only from one-fourth to one-half an inch thick . It ought to be at least three-quarters of an inch thick . Trim off any suet that may be left on it , and dredge with salt , pepper and flour . Cook in the double broiler , over or before clear coals , for ten minutes , if to be rare , twelve , if to be rather well done . Turn the meat constantly . Serve on a hot dish with butter and salt , or with mushroom sauce , maitre d ' Hotel butter or tomato sauce . Do not stick a knife or fork into the meat to try it . This is the way many people spoil it . Pounding is another bad habit : much of the juice of the meat is lost . When , as it sometimes happens , there is no convenience for broiling , heat the frying pan very hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steak . Turn frequently . MISCELLANEOUS MODES . Braised Beef . Take six or eight pounds of the round or the face of the rump , and lard with quarter of a pound of salt pork . Put six slices of pork in the bottom of the braising pan , and as soon as it begins to fry , add two onions , half a small carrot and half a small turnip , all cut fine . Cook these until they begin to brown ; then draw them to one side of the pan and put in the beef , which has been well dredged with salt , pepper and flour . Brown on all sides , and then add one quart of boiling water and a bouquet of sweet herbs ; cover , and cook slowly in the oven for four hours , basting every twenty minutes . Take up , and finish the gravy as for braised tongue . Or , add to the gravy half a can of tomatoes , and cook for ten minutes . Strain , pour around the beef , and serve . Fricandeau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight pounds , cut from that part of the leg called the cushion . Wet the vegetable masher , and beat the veal smooth ; then lard one side thickly . Put eight slices of pork in the bottom of the braising-pan ; place the veal on this , larded side up . Add two small onions , half a small turnip , two slices of carrot , one clove and a bouquet of sweet herbs  --  these to be at the sides of the meat , not on top ; and one quart of white stock or water . Dredge with salt , pepper and flour . Cover , and place in a rather moderate oven . Cook three hours , basting every fifteen minutes . If cooked rapidly the meat will be dry and stringy , but if slowly , it will be tender and juicy . When done , lift carefully from the pan . Melt four table-spoonfuls of glaze , and spread on the meat with a brush . Place in the open oven for five minutes . Add one cupful of hot water to the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then add one heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch , which has been mixed with a little cold water . Let it boil one minute ; then strain , and return to the fire . Add two table-spoonfuls of glaze , and when this is melted , pour the sauce around the fricandeau , and serve . Potato balls , boiled for twelve minutes in stock , and then slightly browned in the oven , make a pretty garnish for this dish . It is also served on a bed of finely-chopped spinach or mashed potatoes . Leg of Lamb a la Francaise . Put a leg of lamb , weighing about eight pounds , in as small a kettle as will hold it . Put in a muslin bag one onion , one small white turnip , a few green celery leaves , three sprigs each of sweet marjoram and summer savory , four cloves and twelve allspice . Tie the bag and place it in the kettle with the lamb ; then pour on two quarts of boiling water . Let this come to a boil , and then skim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been mixed with one cupful of cold water , two table-spoonfuls of salt and a speck of cayenne . Cover tight , and set back where it will just simmer for four hours . In the meantime make a pint and a half of veal or mutton force-meat , which make into little balls and fry brown . Boil six eggs hard . At the end of four hours take up the Iamb . Skim all the fat off of the gravy and take out the bag of seasoning . Now put the kettle where the contents will boil rapidly for ten minutes . Put three table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan , and when hot , stir in two of flour ; cook until a dark brown , but not burned , and stir into the gravy . Taste to see if seasoned enough . Have the whites and yolks of the hard-boiled eggs chopped separately . Pour the gravy over the lamb ; then garnish with the chopped eggs , making a hill of the whites , and capping it with part of the yolks . Sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat balls in groups around the dish . Garnish with parsley , and serve . Braised Breast of Lamb . With a sharp knife , remove the bones from a breast of lamb ; then season it well with salt and pepper , and roll up and tie firmly with twine . Put two table-spoonfuls of butter in the braising-pan , and when melted , add one onion , one slice of carrot and one of turnip , all cut fine . Stir for five minutes , and then put in the lamb , with a thick dredging of flour . Cover , and set back , where it will not cook rapidly , for half an hour ; then add one quart of stock or boiling water , and place in the oven , where it will cook slowly , for one hour . Baste often . Take up the meat , skim all the fat off of the gravy , and then put it where it will boil rapidly for five minutes . Take the string from the meat . Strain the gravy , and pour over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Bechamel sauce . The bones should be put in the pan with the meat , to improve the gravy . Beef Stew . Two pounds of beef ( the round , flank , or any cheap part ; if there is bone in it , two and a half pounds will be required ) , one onion , two slices of carrot , two of turnip , two potatoes , three table-spoonfuls of flour , salt , pepper , and a generous quart of water . Cut all the fat from the meat , and put it in a stew-pan ; fry gently for ten or fifteen minutes . In the meantime cut the meat in small pieces , and season well with salt and pepper , and then sprinkle over it two table-spoonfuls of flour . Cut the vegetables in very small pieces , and put in the pot with the fat . Fry them five minutes , stirring well , to prevent burning . Now put in the meat , and move it about in the pot until it begins to brown ; then add the quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skim , and set back , where it will just bubble , for two and a half hours . Add the potatoes , cut in thin slices , and one table-spoonful of flour , which mix smooth with half a cupful of cold water , pouring about one-third of the water on the flour at first , and adding the rest when perfectly smooth . Taste to see if the stew is seasoned enough , and if it is not , add more salt and pepper . Let the stew come to a boil again , and cook ten minutes ; then add dumplings . Cover tightly , and boil rapidly ten minutes longer . Mutton , lamb or veal can be cooked in this manner . When veal is used , fry out two slices of pork , as there will not be much fat on the meat . Lamb and mutton must have some of the fat put aside , as there is so much on these meats that they are otherwise very gross . Irish Stew . About two pounds of the neck of mutton , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three pints of water and two table-spoonfuls of flour . Cut the mutton in handsome pieces . Put about half the fat in the stew-pan , with the onions , and stir for eight or ten minutes over a hot fire ; then put in the meat , which sprinkle with the flour , salt and pepper . Stir ten minutes , and add the water , boiling . Set for one hour where it will simmer ; then add the potatoes , peeled , and cut in quarters . Simmer an hour longer , and serve . You can cook dumplings with this dish , if you choose . They are a great addition to all kinds of stews and ragouts . Toad in the Hole . This is an English dish , and a good one , despite the unpleasant name . One pound of round steak , one pint of milk , one cupful of flour , one egg , and salt and pepper . Cut the steak into dice . Beat the egg very light ; add milk to it , and then half a teaspoonful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very light and smooth . Butter a two-quart dish , and in it put the meat . Season well , and pour over it the batter . Bake an hour in a moderate oven . Serve hot . This dish can be made with mutton and lamb in place of steak . Scotch Roll . Remove the tough skin from about five pounds of the flank of beef . A portion of the meat will be found thicker than the rest . With a sharp knife , cut a thin layer from the thick part , and lay upon the thin . Mix together three table-spoonfuls of salt , one of sugar , half a teaspoonful of pepper , one-eighth of a teaspoonful of clove and one teaspoonful of summer savory . Sprinkle this over the meat , and then sprinkle with three table-spoonfuls of vinegar . Roll up , and tie with twine . Put away in a cold place for twelve hours When it has stood this time , place in a stew-pan , with boiling water to cover , and simmer gently for three hours and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupful of cold water , and stir into the gravy . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Simmer half an hour longer . This dish is good hot or cold . POULTRY AND GAME . To Clean and Truss Poultry . First singe , by holding the bird over a blazing paper . It is best to do this over the open stove , when all the particles of burnt paper will fall into the fire . Next open the vent and draw out the internal organs , if this has not been done at the butcher 's . Be careful not to break the gall bladder . Wash quickly in one water . If there are large black pin-feathers , take out what you can with the point of a knife , ( it is impossible to get out all ) . Cut the oil bag from the tail . Be sure that you have taken out every part of the wind-pipe , the lights and crop . Turn the skin back , and cut the neck quite short . Fill the crop with dressing , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fasten the legs together at the joint where the feet were cut off . Be careful , in cutting off the feet of game or poultry , to cut in the joint . If you cut above , the ligaments that hold the flesh and bones together will be severed , and in cooking , the meat will shrink , leaving a bare , unsightly bone . Besides , you will have nothing to hold the skewer , if the ligaments are cut off . Run the skewer into the bone of the tail , and tie firmly with a long piece of twine . Now take a longer skewer , and run through the two wings , fastening them firmly to the sides of the bird . With another short skewer , fasten the skin of the neck on to the back-bone . Place the bird on its breast , and draw the strings , with which the legs were tied , around the skewers in the wings and neck ; pass them across the back three times , and tie very tightly . By following these directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the strings on the back , so that you will avoid breaking the handsome crust that always forms on properly basted and roasted poultry . When cooked , first cut the strings , then draw out the skewers . The fat that comes from the vent and the gizzard of chickens , should be tried out immediately and put away for shortening and frying . That of geese , turkeys and ducks is of too strong a flavor to be nice in cookery . To clean the giblets : Cut the gall-bag from the lobe of the liver , cutting a little of the liver with it , so as not to cut into the bag . Press the heart between the finger and thumb , to extract all the blood . With a sharp knife , cut lightly around the gizzard , and draw off the outer coat , leaving the lining coat whole . If you can not do that ( and it does require practice ) , cut in two , and after removing the filling , take out the lining . When the poultry is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sewed with mending cotton or soft twine . Unless the bird is full of dressing , this will not be necessary in roasting . Fowl and Pork . Clean and truss , pin in the floured cloth and put into water in which one pound of rather lean pork has been boiling three hours . The time of cooking depends upon the age of the fowl . If they are not more than a year old an hour and a half will be enough , but if very old they may need three hours . The quantity of pork given is for only a pair of fowl , and more must be used if a large number of birds be cooked . Serve with egg sauce . The liquor should be saved for soups . Boiled Fowl with Macaroni . Break twelve sticks of macaroni in pieces about two inches long ; throw them into one quart of boiling water , add a table-spoonful of salt and half a table-spoonful of pepper . Boil rapidly for twelve minutes ; then take up , and drain off all the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . After the fowl have been singed and cleaned , stuff with the macaroni . Truss them , and then pin in a floured cloth and plunge into enough boiling water to cover them . Boil rapidly for fifteen minutes ; then set back where they will just simmer for from one and a half to two and a half hours . The time of cooking depends upon the age of the birds . Serve with an egg or Bechamel sauce . The quantity of macaroni given is for two fowl . Plain boiled macaroni should be served with this dish . Boiled Turkey with Celery . Chop half a head of celery very fine . Mix with it one quart of bread crumbs , two scant table-spoonfuls of salt , half a teaspoonful of pepper , two heaping table-spoonfuls of butter and two eggs . Stuff the turkey with this ; sew up and truss . Wring a large square of white cotton cloth out of cold water , and dredge it thickly with flour . Pin the turkey in this , and plunge into boiling water . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it will simmer . Allow three hours for a turkey weighing nine pounds , and twelve minutes for every additional pound . Serve with celery sauce . The stuffing may be made the same as above , only substitute oysters for celery , and serve with oyster sauce . Boiled Turkey . Clean and truss the same as for roasting . Rub into it two spoonfuls of salt , and put into boiling water to cover . Simmer gently three hours , if it weighs nine or ten pounds , and is tender . If old and tough it will take longer . Serve with oyster , celery or egg sauce . Pour some of the sauce over the turkey , and serve the rest in a gravy boat . Roast Turkey . Proceed the same with a turkey as with a chicken , allowing one hour and three-quarters for a turkey weighing eight pounds , and ten minutes for every additional pound . Roast Turkey with Chestnut Stuffing and Sauce . Clean the turkey , and lard the breast . Throw fifty large chestnuts into boiling water for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the thin , dark skin . Cover them with boiling water , and simmer for one hour ; take them up , and mash fine . Chop one pound of veal and half a pound of salt pork very fine . Add half of the chestnuts to this , and add , also , half a teaspoonful of pepper , two table-spoonfuls of salt and one cupful of stock or water . Stuff the turkey with this . Truss , and roast as already directed . Serve with a chestnut sauce . The remaining half of the chestnuts are for this sauce . Boned Turkey . Get a turkey that has not been frozen ( freezing makes it tear easily ) . See that every part is whole ; one with a little break in the skin will not do . Cut off the legs , in the joints , and the tips of the wings . Do not draw the bird . Place it on its breast , and with a small , sharp boning knife , cut in a straight line through to the bone , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but little flesh , where it is all skin and fat . Begin at the neck , and run the knife between the flesh and the bones until you come to the wing . Then cut the ligaments that hold the bones together and the tendons that hold the flesh to the bones . With the thumb and fore-finger , press the flesh from the smooth bone . When you come to the joint , carefully separate the ligaments and remove the bone . Do not try to take the bone from the next joint , as that is not in the way when carving , and it gives a more natural shape to the bird . Now begin at the wish-bone , and when that is free from the flesh , run the knife between the sides and the flesh , always using the fingers to press the meat from the smooth bones , as , for instance , the breast-bone and lower part of the sides . Work around the legs the same as you did around the wings , always using great care at the joints not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns that part of the bird inside out . Turn the bird over , and proceed in the same manner with the other side . When all is detached , carefully draw the skin from the breast-bone ; then run the knife between the fat and bone at the rump , leaving the small bone in the extreme end , as it holds the skewers . Carefully remove the flesh from the skeleton , and turn it right side out again . Rub into it two table-spoonfuls of salt and a little pepper , and fill with dressing . Sew up the back and neck and then the vent . Truss the same as if not boned . Take a strong piece of cotton cloth and pin the bird firmly in it , drawing very tight at the legs , as this is the broadest place , and the shape will not be good unless this precaution be taken . Steam three hours , and then place on a buttered tin sheet , which put in a baking pan . Baste well with butter , pepper , salt and flour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice with stock . When cold , remove the skewers and strings , and garnish with aspic jelly , cooked beets and parsley . To carve : First cut off the wings , then about two thick slices from the neck , where it will be quite fat , and then cut in thin slices . Serve jelly with each plate . Filling for a turkey weighing eight pounds : The flesh of one chicken weighing four pounds , one pound of clear veal , half a pound of clear salt pork , one small capful of cracker crumbs , two eggs , one cupful of broth , two and a half table-spoonfuls of salt , half a teaspoonful of pepper , one teaspoonful of summer savory , one of sweet majoram , one of thyme , half a spoonful of sage , and , if you like , one table-spoonful of capers , one quart of oysters and two table-spoonfuls of onion juice . Have the meat uncooked and free from any tough pieces . Chop very fine . Add seasoning , crackers , etc. , mix thoroughly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the veal must be omitted . Where one can not eat veal , use chicken instead . Veal is recommended for its cheapness . Why people choose boned turkey instead of a plain roast turkey or chicken , is not plain , for the flavor is not so good ; but at the times and places where boned birds are used , it is a very appropriate dish . That is , at suppers , lunches and parties , where the guests are served standing , it is impracticable to provide anything that can not be broken with a fork or spoon ; therefore , the advantage of a boned turkey , chicken , or bird , is apparent . One turkey weighing eight pounds before being boned , will serve thirty persons at a party , if there are , also , say oysters , rolls , coffee , ices , cake and cream . If the supper is very elaborate the turkey will answer for one of the dishes for a hundred or more persons . If nothing more were gained in the boning of a bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in carving , pay to bone two or three chickens . It is advisable to bone at least two fowls before trying a turkey , for if you spoil them there is nothing lost , as they make a stew or soup . Aspic jelly : One and a half pints of clear stock  --  beef if for amber jelly , and chicken or veal if for white ; half a box of gelatine , the white of one egg , half a cupful of cold water , two cloves , one large slice of onion , twelve pepper-corns , one stalk of celery , salt . Soak gelatine two hours in the cold water . Then put on with other ingredients , the white of the egg being beaten with one spoonful of the cold stock . Let come to a boil , and set back where it will just simmer for twenty minutes . Strain through a napkin , turn into a mould or shallow dish , and put away to harden . The jelly can be made with the bones of the turkey and chicken , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about three pints ; by then straining and setting away to cool , and in the morning skimming off all the fat and turning off the clear stock . The bones may , instead , be used for a soup . Roast Goose . Stuff the goose with a potato dressing made in the following manner : Six potatoes , boiled , pared and mashed fine and light ; one table-spoonful of salt , one teaspoonful of pepper , one spoonful of sage , two table-spoonfuls of onion juice , two of butter . Truss , and dredge well with salt , pepper and flour . Roast before the fire ( if weighing eight pounds ) one hour and a half ; in the oven , one hour and a quarter . Make gravy the same as for turkey . No butter is required for goose , it is so fat . Serve with apple sauce . Many people boil the goose half an hour before roasting , to take away the strong flavor . Why not have something else if you do not like the real flavor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be cooked rare : for this reason it is best not to stuff . If , however , you do stuff them , use the goose dressing , and have it very hot . The better way is to cut an onion in two , and put into the body of the bird ; then truss , and dredge with salt , pepper and flour , and roast , if before the fire , forty minutes , and if in the oven , thirty minutes . The fire must be very hot if the duck be roasted in the kitchen , and if in the oven , this must be a quick one . Serve with currant jelly and a sauce made the same as for turkey . Roast Chicken . Clean the chicken , and stuff the breast and part of the body with dressing made as follows : For a pair of chickens weighing between seven and eight pounds , take one quart of stale bread ( being sure not to have any hard pieces ) , and break up in very fine crumbs . Add a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teaspoonful of chopped parsley , half a teaspoonful of powdered sage , one of summer savory and a scant half cupful of butter . Mix well together . This gives a rich dressing that will separate like rice when served . Now truss the chickens , and dredge well with salt . Take soft butter in the hand , and rub thickly over the chicken ; then dredge rather thickly with flour . Place on the side , on the meat rack , and put into a hot oven for a few moments , that the flour in the bottom of the pan may brown . When it is browned , put in water enough to cover the pan . Baste every fifteen minutes with the gravy in the pan , and dredge with salt , pepper and flour . When one side is browned , turn , and brown the other . The last position in which the chicken should bake is on its back , that the breast may be nicely frothed and browned . The last basting is on the breast , and should be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour . Putting the butter on the chicken at first , and then covering with flour , makes a paste , which keeps the juices in the chicken , and also supplies a certain amount of rich basting that is absorbed into the meat . It really does not take as much butter to baste poultry or game in this manner as by the old method of putting it on with a spoon after the bird began to cook . The water in the pan must often be renewed ; and always be careful not to get in too much at a time . It will take an hour and a quarter to cook a pair of chickens , each weighing between three and a half and four pounds ; anything larger , an hour and a half . A sure sign that they are done is the readiness of joints to separate from the body . If the chickens are roasted in the tin-kitchen , before the fire , it will take a quarter of an hour longer than in the oven . Gravy for chickens : Wash the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil in three pints of water ; boil down to one pint . Take them all up . Put the liver on a plate , and mash fine with the back of the spoon ; return it to the water in which it was boiled . Mix two table-spoonfuls of flour with half a cupful of cold water . Stir into the gravy , season well with salt and pepper , and set back where it will simmer , for twenty minutes . Take up the chickens , and take the meat rack out of the pan . Then tip the pan to one side , to bring all the gravy together . Skim off the fat . Place the pan on top of the stove and turn into it one cupful of water . Let this boil up , in the meantime scraping everything from the sides and bottom of the pan . Turn this into the made gravy , and let it all boil together while you are removing the skewers and strings from the chickens . Chicken a la Matelote . Cut up an uncooked chicken . Rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fry in four table-spoonfuls of chicken fat or butter , for about twenty minutes , a small carrot , onion and parsnip , all cut into dice . When the chicken is browned , put it in a stew-pan with the cooked vegetables and one quart of white stock . Then into the fat in which the vegetables were fried , put two table-spoonfuls of flour , and cook until brown . Stir this in with the chicken . Add the liver , mashed fine , one table-spoonful of capers and salt and pepper to taste . Cook very gently three-quarters of an hour ; then add one-fourth of a pound of mushrooms , cut in small pieces . Cook fifteen minutes longer . Serve with a border of boiled macaroni , mashed potatoes or rice . Chicken a la Reine . Clean , stuff and truss a pair of chickens , as for roasting . Dredge well with salt , pepper and flour . Cut a quarter of a pound of pork in slices , and put part on the bottom of a deep stew-pan with two slices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fire until they begin to color ; then put in the chickens , and lay the remainder of the pork over them . Place the stew-pan in a hot oven for twenty minutes ; then add white stock to half cover the chicken ( about two quarts ) , and a bouquet of sweet herbs . Dredge well with flour . Cover the pan and return to the oven . Baste about every fifteen minutes , and after cooking one hour , turn over the chickens . Cook , in all , two hours . Serve with Hollandaise sauce or with the sauce in which the chickens were cooked , it being strained over them . Chicken a la Tartare . Singe the chicken , and split down the back . Wipe thoroughly with a damp cloth . Dredge well with salt and pepper , cover thickly with softened butter , and dredge thickly on both sides with fine , dry bread crumbs . Place in a baking pan , the inside down , and cook in a very hot oven thirty minutes , taking care not to bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken , and split down the back , if not already prepared ; and wipe with a damp cloth . Never wash it . Season well with salt and pepper . Take some soft butter in the right hand and rub over the bird , letting the greater part go on the breast and legs . Dredge with flour . Put in the double broiler , and broil over a moderate fire , having the breast turned to the heat at first . When the chicken is a nice brown , which will be in about fifteen minutes , place in a pan and put into a moderate oven for twelve minutes . Place on a hot dish , season , with salt , pepper and butter , and serve immediately . This rule is for a chicken weighing about two and a half pounds . The chicken is improved by serving with maitre d ' hotel butter or Tartare sauce . Chicken Stew with Dumplings . One chicken or fowl , weighing about three pounds ; one table-spoonful of butter , three of flour , one large onion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pints of boiling water and salt and pepper . Cut the chicken in slices suitable for serving . Wash , and put in a deep stew-pan , add the water , and set on to boil . Put the carrot , turnip and onion , cut fine , in a sauce-pan , with the butter , and cook slowly half an hour , stirring often ; then take up the vegetables in a strainer , place the strainer in the stew-pan with the chicken , and dip some of the water into it . Mash the vegetables with the back of a spoon , and rub as much as possible through the strainer . Now skim two spoonfuls of chicken fat from the water , and put in the pan in which the vegetables were cooked . When boiling hot , add the three table-spoonfuls of flour . Stir over the fire until a dark brown ; then stir it in with the chicken , and simmer until tender . Season well with pepper and salt . The stew should only simmer all the while it is cooking . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook a year old chicken . Twelve minutes before serving draw the stew-pan forward , and boil up ; then put in the dumplings , and cook ten minutes . Take them up , and keep in the heater while you are dishing the chicken into the centre of the platter . Afterwards , place the dumplings around the edge . This is a very nice and economical dish , if pains are taken in preparing . One stewed chicken will go farther than two roasted . Larded Grouse . Clean and wash the grouse . Lard the breast and legs . Run a small skewer into the legs and through the tail . Tie firmly with twine . Dredge with salt , and rub the breast with soft butter ; then dredge thickly with flour . Put into a quick oven . If to be very rare , cook twenty minutes ; if wished better done , thirty minutes . The former time , as a general thing , suits gentlemen better , but thirty minutes is preferred by ladies . If the birds are cooked in a tin-kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When done , place on a hot dish , on which has been spread bread sauce . Sprinkle fried crumbs over both grouse and sauce . Garnish with parsley . The grouse may , instead , be served on a hot dish , with the parsley garnish , and the sauce and crumbs served in separate dishes . The first method is the better , however , as you get in the sauce all the gravy that comes from the birds . Larded Partridges . Partridges are cooked and served the same as grouse . Larded Quail . The directions for cooking and serving are the same as those for grouse , only that quails cook in fifteen minutes . All dry-meated birds are cooked in this way . The question is sometimes asked , Should ducks be larded ? Larding is to give richness to a dry meat that does not have fat enough of its own ; therefore , meats like goose , duck and mutton are not improved by larding . Broiled Quail . Split the quail down the back . Wipe with a damp towel . Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dredge with flour . Broil ten minutes over clear coals . Serve on hot buttered toast , garnishing with parsley . Broiled Pigeons . Prepare , cook and serve the same as quail They should be young for broiling , squabs being the best . Broiled Small Birds . All small birds can be broiled according to the directions for quail , remembering that for extremely small ones it takes a very bright fire . As the birds should be only browned , the time required is very brief . Small Birds , Roasted . Clean , by washing quickly in one water after they have been drawn . Season with salt and pepper . Cut slices of salt pork very thin , and with small skewers , fasten a slice around each bird . Run a long skewer through the necks of six or eight , and rest it on a shallow baking-pan . When all the birds are arranged , put into a hot oven for twelve minutes , or before a hot fire for a quarter of an hour . Serve on toast . Potted Pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their necks in a deep earthen or porcelain pot , and turn on them a pint of vinegar . Cut three large onions in twelve pieces , and place a piece on each pigeon . Cover the pot , and let it stand all night In the morning take out the pigeons , and throw away the onions and vinegar . Fry , in a deep stew-pan , six slices of fat pork , and when browned , take them up , and in the fat put six onions , sliced fine . On these put the pigeons , having first trussed them , and dredge well with salt pepper and flour . Cover , and cook slowly for forty-five minutes , stirring occasionally ; then add two quarts of boiling water , and simmer gently two hours . Mix four heaping table-spoonfuls of flour with a cupful of cold water , and stir in with the pigeons . Taste to see if there is enough seasoning , and if there is not , add more . Cook half an hour longer . Serve with a garnish of rice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if you like it so , spice the gravy slightly . Pigeons in Jelly . Wash and truss one dozen pigeons . Put them in a kettle with four pounds of the shank of veal , six cloves , twenty-five pepper-corns , an onion that has been fried in one spoonful of butter , one stalk of celery , a bouquet of sweet herbs and four and a half quarts of water . Have the veal shank broken in small pieces . As soon as the contents of the kettle come to a boil , skim carefully , and set for three hours where they will just simmer . After they have been cooking one hour , add two table-spoonfuls of salt . When the pigeons are done , take them up , being careful not to break them , and remove the strings . Draw the kettle forward , where it will boil rapidly , and keep there for forty minutes ; then strain the liquor through a napkin , and taste to see if seasoned enough . The water should have boiled down to two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold six pigeons . Put a thin layer of the jelly in these , and set on ice to harden . When hard , arrange the pigeons in them , and cover with the jelly , which must be cold , but liquid . Place in the ice chest for six or , better still , twelve hours . There should be only one layer of the pigeons in the mould . To serve : Dip the mould in a basin of warm water for one minute , and turn on a cold dish . Garnish with pickled beets and parsley . A Tartare sauce can be served with this dish . If squabs are used , two hours will cook them . All small birds , as well as partridge , grouse , etc. , can be prepared in the same manner . Remember that the birds must be cooked tender , and that the liquor must be so reduced that it will become jellied . Roast Rabbit . First make a stuffing of a pound of veal and a quarter of a pound of pork , simmered two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a table-spoonful of salt , a scant teaspoonful of pepper , a teaspoonful of summer savory , a large table-spoonful of butter and one and a quarter cupfuls of the broth in which the veal and pork were cooked . Chop the meat fine , add the other ingredients , and put on the fire to heat . Cut off the rabbit 's head , open the vent , and draw . Wash clean , and season with salt and pepper . Stuff while the dressing is hot , and sew up the opening . Put the rabbit on its knees , and skewer in that position . Rub thickly with butter , dredge with flour , and put in the baking pan , the bottom of which should be covered with hot water . Bake half an hour in a quick oven , basting frequently . Serve with a border of mashed potatoes , and pour the gravy over the rabbit . Curry of Rabbit . Cut the rabbit in small pieces . Wash , and cook the same as chicken curry . Saddle of Venison . Carefully scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Season well with salt and pepper , and roll up and skewer together . Rub thickly with soft butter and dredge thickly with flour . Roast for an hour before a clear fire or in a hot oven , basting frequently . When half done , if you choose , baste with a few spoonfuls of claret . Or , you can have one row of larding on each side of the back-bone . This gives a particularly nice flavor . To make the gravy : Pour off all the fat from the baking pan , and put in the pan a cupful of boiling water . Stir from the sides and bottom , and set back where it will keep hot . In a small frying-pan put one table-spoonful of butter , a small slice of onion , six pepper-corns and four whole cloves . Cook until the onion is browned , and then add a generous teaspoonful of flour . Stir until this is browned ; then , gradually , add the gravy in the pan . Boil one minute . Strain , and add half a teaspoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serve both venison and gravy very hot . The time given is for a saddle weighing between ten and twelve pounds . All the dishes and plates for serving must be hot . Venison is cooked in almost the same manner as beef , always remembering that it must be served rare and hot . Roast Leg of Venison . Draw the dry skin from the meat , and wipe with a damp towel . Make a paste with one quart of flour and a generous pint of cold water . Cover the venison with this , and place before a hot fire , if to be roasted in the tin kitchen , or else in a very hot oven . As the paste browns , baste it frequently with the gravy in the pan . When it has been cooking one hour and a half , take off the paste , cover with butter , and dredge thickly with flour . Cook one hour longer , basting frequently with butter , salt and flour . Make the gravy the same as for a saddle of venison , or serve with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing about fifteen pounds . ENTREES . Fillet of Beef , Larded . The true fillet is the tenderloin , although sometimes one will see a rib roast , boned and rolled , called a fillet . A short fillet , weighing from two and a half to three pounds ( the average weight from a very large rump ) , will suffice for ten persons at a dinner where this is served as one course ; and if a larger quantity is wanted a great saving will still be made if two short fillets are used . They cost about two dollars , while a large one , weighing the same amount , would cost five dollars , Fillet of beef is one of the simplest , safest and most satisfactory dishes that a lady can prepare for either her own family or guests . After a single trial she will think no more of it than of broiling a beef steak . First , remove from the fillet , with a sharp knife , every shred of muscle , ligament and thin , tough skin . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shape . Draw a line through the centre , and lard with two rows of pork , having them meet at this line . Dredge well with salt , pepper and flour , and put , without water , in a very small pan . Place in a hot oven for thirty minutes . Let it be in the lower part of the oven the first ten minutes , then place on the upper grate . Serve with mushroom , Hollandaise or tomato sauce , or with potato balls . If with sauce , this should be poured around the fillet , the time given cooks a fillet of any size , the shape being such that it will take half an hour for either two or six pounds . Save the fat trimmed from the fillet for frying , and the lean part for soup stock . Fillet of Beef a la Hollandaise . Trim and cut the short fillet into slices about half an inch thick . Season these well with salt , and then lay in a pan with six table-spoonfuls of butter , just warm enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lemon over them . Let them stand one hour ; then dip lightly in flour , place in the double broiler , and cook for six minutes over a very bright fire . Have a mound of mashed potatoes in the centre of a hot dish , and rest the slices against this . Pour a Hollandaise sauce around . Garnish with parsley . Fillet of Beef a l'Allemand . Trim the fillet and skewer it into a good shape . Season well with pepper and salt . Have one egg and half a teaspoonful of sugar well beaten together ; roll the fillet in this and then in bread crumbs . Bake in the oven for thirty minutes . Serve with Allemand sauce poured around it . Fillet of Beef in Jelly . Trim a short fillet , and cut a deep incision in the side , being careful not to go through to the other side or the ends . Fill this with one cupful of veal , prepared as for quenelles , and the whites of three hard-boiled eggs , cut into rings . Sew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with broad bands of cotton cloth . Put in a deep stew-pan two slices of ham and two of pork , and place the fillet on them ; then put in two calf 's feet , two stalks of celery and two quarts of clear stock . Simmer gently two hours and a half . Take up the fillet , and set away to cool . Strain the stock , and set away to harden . When hard , scrape of every particle of fat , and put on the fire in a clean sauce-pan , with half a slice of onion and the whites of two eggs , beaten with four table-spoonfuls of cold water . When this boils , season well with salt , and set back where it will just simmer for half an hour ; then strain through a napkin . Pour a little of the jelly into a two-quart charlotte russe mould ( half an inch deep ) , and set on the ice to harden . As soon as it is hard , decorate with the egg rings . Add about three spoonfuls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , add enough jelly to cover the eggs , and when this is also hard , trim the ends of the fillet , and draw out the thread . Place in the centre of the mould , and cover with the remainder of the jelly . If the fillet floats , place a slight weight on it . Set in the ice chest to harden . When ready to serve , place the mould in a pan of warm water for half a minute , and then turn out the fillet gently upon a dish . Garnish with a circle of egg rings , each of which has a stoned olive in the centre . Put here and there a sprig of parsley . Alamode Beef . Six pounds of the upper part , or of the vein , of the round of beef , half a pound of fat salt pork , three table-spoonfuls of butter , two onions , half a carrot , half a turnip , two table-spoonfuls of vinegar , one of lemon juice , one heaping table-spoonful of salt , half a teaspoonful of pepper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick cinnamon , a bouquet of sweet herbs , two scant quarts of boiling water and four table-spoonfuls of flour . Cut the pork in thick strips  - -  as long as the meat is thick , and , with a large larding needle ( which comes for this purpose ) , draw these through the meat . If you do not have the large needle , make the holes with the boning knife or the carving steel , and press the pork through with the fingers . Put the butter in a six-quart stew-pan , and when it melts , add the vegetables , cut fine . Let them cook five minutes , stirring all the while . Put in the meat , which has been well dredged with the flour ; brown on one aide , and then turn , and brown the other . Add one quart of the water ; stir well , and then add the other , with the spice , herbs , vinegar , salt and pepper . Cover tightly , and simmer gently four hours . Add the lemon juice . Taste the gravy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let it cook twenty minutes longer . Take up the meat , and draw the stew-pan forward , where it will boil rapidly , for ten or fifteen minutes , having first skimmed off all the fat . Strain the gravy on the beef , and serve . This dish may be garnished with , potato balls or button onions . Macaronied Beef . Six pounds of beef from the upper part of the round or the vein , a quarter of a pound of macaroni ( twelve sticks ) , half a cupful of butter , four large onions , one quart of peeled and sliced tomatoes , or a quart can of the vegetable ; two heaping table-spoonfuls of flour , salt , pepper and two cloves . Make holes in the beef with the large larding needle or the steel , and press the macaroni into them . Season with salt and pepper . Put the butter and the onions , which have been peeled and cut fine , in a six-quart stew-pan , and stir over the fire until a golden brown ; then put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the flour , and spread the top of the meat with the fried onions . Put in the spice and one quart of boiling water . Cover tightly , and simmer slowly for three hours ; then add the tomato , and cook one hour longer . Take up the meat , and strain the gravy over it . Serve hot . The tomato may be omitted if one pint more of water and an extra table-spoonful of flour are used instead . Always serve macaroni with this dish . Cannelon of Beef . One thin slice of the upper part of the round of beef . Cut off all the fat , and so trim as to give the piece a regular shape . Put the trimmings in the chopping tray , with a quarter of a pound of boiled salt pork and one pound of lean cooked ham . Chop very fine ; then add a speck of cayenne , one teaspoonful of mixed mustard , one of onion juice , one table-spoonful of lemon juice and three eggs . Season the beef with salt and pepper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie with twine , being careful not to draw too tightly . Have six slices of fat pork fried in the braising pan . Cut two onions , two slices of carrot , and two of turnip into this , and stir for two minutes over the fire . Roll the cannelon in a plate of flour , and put it in the braising pan with the pork and vegetables . Brown slightly on all sides ; then add one quart of boiling water , and place in the oven . Cook three hours , basting every fifteen minutes . When it has been cooking two hours , add half a cupful of canned tomatoes or two fresh ones . Taste to see if the gravy is seasoned enough ; if it is not , add seasoning . The constant dredging with flour will thicken the gravy sufficiently . Slide the cake turner under the beef , and lift carefully on to a hot dish . Cut the string in three or four places with a sharp knife , and gently draw it away from the meat . Skim off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the meat . Garnish with a border of toast or riced potatoes . Cut in thin slices with a sharp knife . Cannelon of Beef , No. 2 . Two pounds of the round of beef , the rind of half a lemon , three sprigs of parsley , one teaspoonful of salt , barely one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper , a quarter of a nutmeg , two table-spoonfuls of melted butter , one raw egg and half a teaspoonful of onion juice . Chop meat , parsley and lemon rind very fine . Add other ingredients , and mix thoroughly . Shape , into a roll , about three inches in diameter and six in length . Roll in buttered paper , and bake thirty minutes , basting with butter and water . When cooked , place on a hot dish , gently unroll from the paper , and serve with Flemish sauce poured over it . You may serve tomato or mushroom sauce if you prefer either . Beef Roulette . Have two pounds of the upper part of the round , cut very thin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one teaspoonful of mixed mustard , a speck of cayenne and three table-spoonfuls of stock or water . Spread upon the beef , which roll up firmly and tie with soft twine , being careful not to draw too tightly , for that would cut the meat as soon as it began to cook . Cover the roll with flour , and fry brown in four table-spoonfuls of ham or pork fat . Put it in as small a sauce-pan as will hold it . Into the fat remaining in the pan put two finely-chopped onions , and cook until a pale yellow ; then add two table-spoonfuls of flour , and stir three minutes longer . Pour upon this one pint and a half of boiling water . Boil up once , and pour over the roulette ; then add two cloves , one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper and one heaping teaspoonful of salt . Cover the sauce-pan , and set where it will simmer slowly for three hours . After the first hour and a half , turn the roulette over .

Cover the sauce-pan , and let simmer two hours . Take up at the end of this time and cut the strings with a sharp knife . Place the olives in a row on a dish , and pour the gravy over them . Veal Olives . These are made in the same manner , except that a dressing , like chicken dressing , is made for them . For one and a half pounds of veal take three crackers , half a table-spoonful of butter , half a teaspoonful of savory , one-fourth of a teaspoonful of sage , a teaspoonful of salt , a very little pepper and an eighth of a cupful of water . Spread the strips with this , and proceed as for beef olives . Fricandelles of Veal . Two pounds of clear veal , half a cupful of finely-chopped cooked ham , one cupful of milk , one cupful of bread crumbs , the juice of half a lemon , one table-spoonful of salt , half a teaspoonful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half of stock , three table-spoonfuls of flour . Chop the veal fine . Cook the bread crumbs and milk until a smooth paste , being careful not to burn . Add to the chopped veal and ham , and when well mixed , add the seasoning and four tablespoonfuls of the butter . Mix thoroughly , and form into balls about the size of an egg . Have the yolks of three eggs well beaten , and use to cover the balls . Fry these , till a light brown , in the remainder of the butter , being very careful not to burn . Stir the three table-spoonfuls of flour into the butter that remains after the balls are fried . Stir until dark brown , and then gradually stir the stock into it . Boil for two minutes . Taste to see if seasoned enough ; then add the balls , and cook very slowly for one hour . Serve with a garnish of toast and lemon . Fricandelles can be made with chicken , mutton , lamb and beef , the only change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Cover with boiling water , and boil gently for two hours ; then take up and drain . Put six table-spoonfuls of butter in the braising pan , and when hot , put in half a small carrot , half a small turnip and two onions , all cut fine . Cook five minutes , stirring all the time , and then draw to one side . Roll the tongue in flour , and put in the pan . As soon as browned on one side , turn , and brown the other . Add one quart of the water in which it was boiled , a bouquet of sweet herbs , one clove , a small piece of cinnamon and salt and pepper .

For a change , a table-spoonful of chopped pickles , or of capers , can be stirred into the sauce the last moment . Escaloped Tongue . Chop some cold tongue  --  not too fine , and have for each pint one table-spoonful of onion juice , one teaspoonful of chopped parsley , one heaping teaspoonful of salt , one teaspoonful of capers , one cupful of bread crumbs , half a cupful of stock and three table-spoonfuls of butter . Butter the escalop dish , and cover the bottom with bread crumbs . Put in the tongue , which has been mixed with the parsley , salt , pepper and capers , and add the stock , in which has been mixed the onion juice . Put part of the butter on the dish with the remainder of the bread crumbs , and then bits of butter here and there . Bake twenty minutes , and serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh or salt tongue . When cold , trim off the roots . Have one and a fourth quarts of aspic jelly in the liquid state . Cover the bottom of a two-quart mould about an inch deep with it , and let it harden . With a fancy vegetable cutter , cut out leaves from cooked beets , and garnish the bottom of the mould with them . Gently pour in three table-spoonfuls of jelly , to set the vegetables . When this is hard , add jelly enough to cover the vegetables , and let the whole get very hard . Then put in the tongue , and about half a cupful of jelly , which should be allowed to harden , and so keep the meat in place when the remainder is added . Pour in the remainder of the jelly and set away to harden . To serve : Dip the mould for a few moments in a pan of warm water , and then gently turn on to a dish . Garnish with pickles and parsley . Pickled beet is especially nice . Lambs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as beef tongues .

Any kind of cold meat can be served in this manner . Sweetbreads . Sweetbreads are found in calves and lambs . The demand for calves ' sweetbreads has grown wonderfully within the past ten years . In all our large cities they sell at all times of the year for a high price , but in winter and early spring they cost more than twice as much as they do late in the spring and during the summer . The throat and heart sweetbreads are often sold as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high price , the former is sold for the same price as the latter . The throat sweetbread is found immediately below the throat . It has an elongated form , is not so firm and fat , and has not the fine flavor of the heart sweetbread . The heart sweetbread is attached to the last rib , and lies near the heart . The form is somewhat rounded , and it is smooth and firm . To Clean Sweetbreads . Carefully pull off all the tough and fibrous skin . Place them in a dish of cold water for ten minutes or more , and they are then ready to be boiled . They must always be boiled twenty minutes , no matter what the mode of cooking is to be . Sweetbreads Larded and Baked .

Or , cover with a thin layer of jelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one dish . SALADS . A salad should come to the table fresh and crisp . The garnishes should be of the lightest and freshest kind . Nothing is more out of place than a delicate salad covered with hard-boiled eggs , boiled beets , etc . A salad with which the mayonnaise dressing is used , should have only the delicate white leaves of the celery , or the small leaves from the heart of the lettuce , and these should be arranged in a wreath at the base , with a few tufts here and there on the salad . The contrast between the creamy dressing and the light green is not great , but it is pleasing . In arranging a salad on a dish , or in a bowl , handle it very lightly . Never use pressure to get it into form . When a jelly border is used with salads , some of it should be helped with the salad . The small round radishes may be arranged in the dish with a lettuce salad . In washing lettuce great care must be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark green leaves are not nice for salad . As lettuce is not an expensive vegetable , it is best , when the heads are not round and compact , to buy an extra one and throw the large tough leaves away . In winter and early spring , when lettuce is raised in hot-houses , it is liable to have insects on it . Care must be taken that all are washed off . Only the white , crisp parts of celery should be used in salads . The green , tough parts will answer for stews and soups . Vegetable salads can be served for tea and lunch and with , or after , the meats at dinner . The hot cabbage , red cabbage , celery , cucumber and potato salads , are particularly appropriate for serving with meats . The lettuce salad , with the French dressing , and the dressed celery , are the best to serve after the meats . A rich salad , like chicken , lobster or salmon , is out of place at a company dinner . It is best served for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the dressing is made ) depends upon keeping the lettuce or celery crisp and not adding meat or dressing to it until the time for serving . Mayonnaise Dressing . A table-spoonful of mustard , one of sugar , one-tenth of a teaspoonful of cayenne , one teaspoonful of salt , the yolks of three uncooked eggs , the juice of half a lemon , a quarter of a cupful of vinegar , a pint of oil and a cupful of whipped cream .

When it can be obtained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be washed thoroughly in cold water and dropped into water which has been salted and is just beginning to boil There should be a table-spoonful of salt for every two quarts of water . If the water boils a long time before the vegetables are put in it loses all its gases , and the mineral ingredients are deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle , so that the water is flat and tasteless : the vegetables will not look green , nor have a fine flavor . The time of boiling green vegetables depends very much upon the age , and how long they have been gathered . The younger and more freshly gathered , the more quickly they are cooked . The following is a time-table for cooking : Potatoes , boiled . 30 minutes . Potatoes , baked . 45 minutes . Sweet Potatoes , boiled . 45 minutes . Sweet Potatoes , baked . 1 hour . Squash , boiled . 25 minutes . Squash , baked . 45 minutes . Green Peas , boiled . 20 to 40 minutes . Shell Beans , boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2 hours . Green Corn . 25 minutes to 1 hour . Asparagus. 15 to 30 minutes . Tomatoes , fresh . 1 hour . Tomatoes , canned . 30 minutes . Cabbage . 45 minutes to 2 hours . Cauliflower. 1 to 2 hours . Dandelions. 2 to 3 hours . Beet Greens . 1 hour . Onions . 1 to 2 hours . Turnips , white . 45 minutes to 1 hour . Turnips , yellow . 1 1/2 to 2 hours . Parsnips . 1 to 2 hours . Carrots . 1 to 2 hours . Nearly all these vegetables are eaten dressed with salt , pepper and butter , but sometimes a small piece of lean pork is boiled with them , and seasons them sufficiently . Potatoes . No other vegetable is in America so commonly used and abused . The most inexperienced housekeeper takes it as a matter of course that she or her cook can not fail of boiling potatoes properly . The time of cooking the potato , unlike that of nearly all other vegetables , does not vary with age or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In baking , the heat of the oven is not always the same , and the time of cooking will vary accordingly . The potato is composed largely of starch . Cooking breaks the cells and sets this starch free . If the potato is removed from heat and moisture as soon as this occurs , it will be dry and mealy , but if it is allowed to boil or bake , even for a few minutes , the starch will absorb the moisture , and the potato will become soggy and have a poor flavor . Boiled Potatoes . Twelve medium-sized potatoes , one table-spoonful of salt , boiling water to cover . Pare the potatoes , and if old , let them stand in cold water an hour or two , to freshen them . Boil fifteen minutes ; then add the salt , and boil fifteen minutes longer . Pour off every drop of water . Take the cover from the sauce-pan and shake the potatoes in a current of cold air ( at either the door or window ) . Place the saucepan on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse towel until serving time . The sooner the potatoes are served , the better . This rule will ensure perfectly sweet and mealy potatoes , if they were good and ripe at first . Mashed Potatoes . Twelve potatoes , one and a half table-spoonfuls of salt , one table-spoonful of butter , half a cupful of boiling milk . Pare and boil as directed for boiled potatoes , and mash fine and light . Add the salt and butter . Beat well ; then add the milk , and beat as you would for cake . This will give a light and delicate dish of potatoes . The potatoes must be perfectly smooth before adding the other ingredients . Puree of Potato . Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potatoes , except use a generous cupful of milk and half a teaspoonful of pepper . If the puree is to serve as a foundation for dry meats , like grouse , veal or turkey , use a cupful of rich stock instead of the milk . This preparation , spread on a hot platter , with any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sauce or gravy , heaped in the centre of it , makes a delightful dish for lunch or dinner . Potato Puffs . Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato . While hot , shape in balls about the size of an egg . Have a tin sheet well buttered , and place the balls on it . As soon as all are done , brash over with beaten egg . Brown in the oven . When done , slip a knife under them and slide them upon a hot platter . Garnish with parsley , and serve immediately . Riced Potato . Have a flat dish and the colander hot . With a spoon , rub mashed potato through the colander on to the hot dish . Be careful that the colander does not touch the potato on the dish . It is best to have only a few spoonfuls of the potato in it at one time . When all has been pressed through , place the dish in the oven for five minutes . Potato a la Royale . One pint of hot toiled potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two table spoonfuls of butter , the whites of four eggs and yolk of one , salt and pepper to taste . Beat the potato very light and fine .

Smooth with a knife and brush over with the yolk of the egg , which has been well beaten . Brown quickly , and serve . It will take ten minutes to brown . The dish in which it is baked should hold a little more than a quart . Potatoes a l'Italienne . Prepare the potatoes as for serving a la royale . Add one table-spoonful of onion juice , one of finely-chopped parsley , and half a cupful of finely-chopped cooked ham . Heap lightly in the dish , but do not smooth . Sprinkle on this one table-spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese . Brown quickly , and serve . The cheese may be omitted if not liked . Thin Fried Potatoes . Pare and cut raw potatoes very thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put them in cold water and let them stand in a cold place ( the ice chest is best ) from ten to twenty-four hours . This draws out the starch . Drain them well . Put about one pint in the frying basket , plunge into boiling lard , and cook about ten minutes . After the first minute set back where the heat will decrease . Drain , and dredge with salt . Continue this until all are fried . Remember that the fat must be hot at first , and when it has regained its heat after the potatoes have been added , must be set back where the potatoes will not cook fast . If the cooking is too rapid they will be brown before they have become crisp . Care must also be taken , when the potatoes are first put in the frying kettle , that the fat does not boil over . Have a fork under the handle of the basket , and if you find that there is danger , lift the basket partly out of the kettle . Continue this until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in the kettle . If many potatoes are cooked in this way for a family , quite an amount of starch can be saved from the water in which they were soaked by pouring off the water and scraping the starch from the bottom of the vessel . Dry , and use as any other starch . French Fried Potatoes . Pare small uncooked potatoes . Divide them in halves , and each half in three pieces .

Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin fried potatoes . Cook ten minutes . Drain . Dredge with salt , and serve very hot . These are nice to serve with a fillet of beef , beefsteak , chops or game . They may be arranged on the dish with the meats , or served in a separate dish . Potato Balls Fried in Butter . Cut little balls from cooked potatoes with the vegetable scoop . After all the salt has been washed from one cupful of butter ( chicken fat will do instead ) , put this in a small frying-pan . When hot , put in as many potato balls as will cover the bottom , and fry until a golden brown . Take up , drain , and dredge with salt . Serve very hot . These balls can be cut from raw potatoes , boiled in salted water five minutes , and fried in the butter ten minutes . When boiled potatoes are used , the part left after the balls have been cut out , will answer for creamed or Lyonnaise potatoes ; but when raw potatoes are used , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and can be used for mashed or riced potatoes .
