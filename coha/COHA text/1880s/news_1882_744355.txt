txt A very clever scheme , by which the poolboxes at Long Island City have been most successfully beaten , came to light yesterday . The book-makers at that popular resort for gamblers have , it is said , for the past few weeks been unconscious:y accepting wagers which were laid on certainties , and which have brought to a select coterie of experienced manipulators of telegraph wires a handsome and substantial reward . So skilfully was the plan laid , and so quietly carried out , according to the statements of parties who have every means for knowing the exact details , that it worked successfully in every particular , and was only discovered at last by the merest accident . The story , as it leaked out yesterday , against the most positive assertions of the managers of the several telegraph companies interested that it was either a fable or the revival of an old game played over a year aco , is as follows : Several telegraph operators conceived the idea that there was money to bo made by sending information as to the winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to the pool-sellers . They knew very well that with the best possible connections between the track and the geniis ing-roome at Hunter 's Point some minutes must elapse before the decisions could be received at the latter place . These telegrams are sent as soon as the horses pass under the wire , and the time is known and the decisions made . The syndicate who conceived the new plan well understood that if the news of the winner could be sent in advance of the actual result of the race , they coutd , by acting promptly , purchase pools that would in every instance bring them handsome profits . They secured , it is said , the service of an operator of the Mutual Union Company , at the Saratoga track , to send to this City , whenever a heat was near its finish , that such and such a horse was sure to come in winner . The operator could tell by the position of the horses generally , unless it was an extraordinarily close ' contest , which animal would carry the leaa under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important post , the next move was to gut the news to Long Island City . There is no connection between the Mutaal Union Teleeraph Company 's wires and Long Island City , where the Western Union Company has an office . A brilliant idea was here carried into successful execution . The American Rapid ' I'elegra ph Company 's lines pass close to these of the Mutual Union , and likewise near the ? V eatern Union Company 's cables , which connect with Long Island points . It is stated that the Mutual Union Wire , which was switched into a duplex instrument , working with the Saratoga track , was placed in connection with the American rapid wire at some point near the hitter 's office , a fine wire being used . This was in turn connected with a dead cable wire -- that is , one not in use , by the same means , and thus an unbroken circuit was established between Saratoga and Long Island City , at which latter point another fine wire was used for the working of an instrument in a shed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be done without assistance on the part of operators irk the Mutual Union and the American Rapid Telegraph offices . That this was secured appears to be pretty well established by the fact that i the scheme is said to have worked charmingly for several weeks , or until a chief operator in the Mutual Union Company 's office a few days ago stumbled . by the merest accident , upon the little game that was lining the pockets of the principals who had put it in execution . Whenever a race was in progress , the informe nt states , the Saratoga operator would send the news of the probable winner when the horses had entered upon the home stretch and were nearing the wires . His confederate hero had taken precautions to have his wire placed in connection with some instrument in the office not in use for other business at that hour . By this means , and the co-operation of the operator 's party to the alf4tir in the American Rapid office , there would he uninterrupted communication with the shanty office at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain horse would he the winner , those in the syndicate , and who did the buying . woul I break for the pool-room , take anything they could get on their horse , and wait for the official anncunceroent , and the cashing of their tickets . How much money was thus harvested by these parties of course , can not be ascertained , but it is believed that they secured a large sum , find that the pool-sellers and other gandslors over the river have been most roundly fleeced . It generally took from five to eight , and sometimes more than ten minutes to get the actual returns as to the winner in the race , and during this interim , of course , the little cldb of private wire ? workers could have things aboutas they wished them . A few days ago the chief operator of the Mutual Union Company is said to have accidentally heard the message going to Long Island City , and as it was an instrument that ought not to have been in Ilse at that time , and , furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island City , he was for a moment puzzled to understand its meaning . He went to work to unravel the mystery , and by careful searching discovered the connecting links and ran the game to cover . An investigation was at once begun by the officers of the company , and with excellent results , for , as the story goes , two have been brought to the block , a third placed u nder surveillance , and a fourth informed that he could resign at once from the company 's service . One of the first persons who was , as alleged , apprehended was a gentleman who had been employed by the Mutual Union Company as its electrician , and known to the telegraph fraternity as " Jack " Wright . Mr. Wright is one of the finest electricians in the country , and is familiar with all the technicalities of the electrical system . An operator named Keefe is the second one who is reported to have been dismissed , while another named Tallman was arraigned yesterday and given the alternative of resigning or being dismissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been in the habit of going to Long Island City , and sometimes purchased pools , when he " saw a chance to make a few dollars , " but he did not consi der it to be within the province of the company to say he should not do so , and he did not propose to resign . What has been done as yet , if anything , with the Saratoga operator is not reported . It is said , as well , that the General Manager of the New-York office of the Mutual Union Company suspected a well-known manufacturer of telegraph instruments in this City of being a party to the scheme , and held an interview with him for . the purpose of securing sonic admission to that effect . He was , however , politely told to attend to his own affairs  --  the party in question made instruments for the company , and the company had no right to interfere with the business of any one of the firm beyo nd the direct transactions in the way of purchases . This scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one carried through last year . In that instance the wires were cut and tapped and a telegram sent to a pool-room in this city informing its managers that a certain horse bad won a race . The cull and the signature of the sending operator were found to be right by the receiving operator in the pool-room , and he fully believed that the telegram was straight . It not only announced the winner , hut instructed the room to pay the pools on that horse . When the result of the vice became known some time later , and n , was found that this horse was not the wiener : the fraud was discovered , but not , it is said , until the nerDetratdrs of it had secured somethinse like $3,000 on side bets , where the money changed hands at once . The officers of the telegraph companies whose wires are said to have been used for furthering this last dodge for depleting the pockets of gamblers at Long Island City deny that it is so ; but inside parties who have good channels for securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed for being implicated to it , and that the : investigations are still being conducted , with the prospect of others being discovered who must follow those who have already been sent adrift .
