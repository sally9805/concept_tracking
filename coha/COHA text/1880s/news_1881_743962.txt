txt The President bas passed a very good day , a much more even day than yesterday , and although comparisons which are limited to 24 hours are scarcely of value in the case of a man so exhausted as he is , the impression of the surgeon and attendants is that his general condition is a little better than it was last night . They all report an improvement in each of the special features of his case . The cough is easier and less frequent , and the phlegm less purulent ; the ' wound shows more marked granulation , end exudes healthier pus ; he has more appetite , or rather is able to take an increased quantity of food , and there is less fever than there was last night . Col. Rockwell said this evening that there is not a single pimple or pus secretion of any kind remaining on the surface of his body . Gen. Swaim , in conversation tonight , described him as able to move his legs and arms freely , to help himself to food and drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bright as ever , and his comprehension is perfectly clear . He can , without effort , make himself heard all over the room . The General thinks he has more muscular strength than he had in Washington . His voice is undoubtedly stronger , but that may be partly ascribed to the improvement of the parotid swelling , which has ceased to be a factor in determining the question of the President 's condition . The discovery last evening that the physi-Mans had concealed or omitted to make known the existence of a nightly fever , and the comments which have been made upon their conduct , have had a good effect . The bulletins to-day have been unusually full and explicit , and the information thus imparted , instead of exciting alarm , as they perhaps erroneously supposed it would , has recovery of the patient . Some of the surgeons strengthened public confidence in the probable have been sharply criticised , and it has been charged more than once that they have deliberately lied about the case . This is hardly a just accusation . As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly changing , and a statement made one day , while perfectly- true then , might not be the truth the next ; and when instances of alleged falsehoods are closely examined in connection with the circumstances existing at the time , it is invariably found that the charge of lying is not well founded . The mistake the surgeons have made throughout is not telling the whole truth . They have carefully refrained from making public synip , kens and complications , or have slighted them ashen asked about them , in the hope of improvement . The consequence has been that in a multitude of instances the facts have leaked out , exaggerated and distorted , or that the complications have become so serious that further concealment was impossible . In both cases unnecessary alarm has Leen created , which the surgeons have found it difficult to allay , owing to the loss of confidence which the public naturally experienced in their statements . As has been intimated , they now seem to perceive the ? orce of this reasoning , though it appears to /nave required considerable argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have adopted was right . The consultation over the morning bulletin lasted an hour and a half , and it was that much Late in consequence . It is reported on the best authority that a very animated discussion took place over the propriety of inserting in the official statement the figures of the highest pulsation and the term " septic , " as applied to the President 's condition . Dr. Hamilton has hitherto refused to acknowledge that his patient was suffering from blood poison , and at no time have any of the attending surgeons officially recognized that fact . The statement was consequently regarded as significant ; but the bulletion on the whole was accepted as very satisfactory , as it undoubtedly was . Just after the morning dressIn g , and before the bulletin was made public , Dr. Hamilton came over to the Elberon Hotel , on his way to the breakfast-room , and was stopped by a lady guest , who asked him how the President was getting along . He answered that he was doing well indeed . " Now , honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he will recover ? " " Yes , I do , " was the response . " There are now no active disturbances in his case , and no Indications of any new complications . Of course , until the septic condition of his blood Is thoroughly , eliminated there will always be danger of new complications , and fluctuations of pulse , temperature , and respiration will occur ; but the first is not probable , and there is ho alarm felt in respect to the latter . " " How long is this thing going to last ? " was the next question. - " Well , some time . The President is gradually getting rid of his septicinia , and , in my opinion , will successfully do so altogether . It will probably take at least five weeks . Thereafter his recovery will be very rapid . " The lady expressed her great gratification at this good news and then fired off a last question : " Doctor , " she asked , " will President Garfield ever be as well a man as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good-natured Doctor . " I see no reason to believe that he will not be In every respect as strong and healthy as he ever was . " Dr. Hamilton , while always courteous and ready to impart information , has been extremely chary in permitting his name to be used as authority . The above conversation , however , was upon the public porch in the presence and hearing of several persons , including THE Tn , ras 's correspondent , and as no restriction was placed upon anybody concerning it , faith will not be broken in thus repeating it for the general benefit . It is. no doubt , a concise and accurate view of the probabilities as they appear to a surgeon of recognized skill and experience and intimate acquaintance with the President 's condition , and it is therefore of the greatest value in forming a correct opinion . The President enjoyed an unusually good night 's rest . He fell asleep about 9 o'clock and had refreshing naps of one and a half and two hours each until midnight , when he remained awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soma nourishment . Toward 1 o'clock he went to sleep again and did not awake more than twice until 8 o'clock this morning . At one time five hours elapsed without a coughing spell . After the dressing he was given a milk punch and some porridge . The ' evening bulletin speaks of his taking an unusual quantity of food today . This has reference to the meal which was given him at midday . It was of his own selection , and consisted of three teaspoonfuls of minced porterhouse steak , three pieces of toasted bread , a woodcock , some peaches and some grapes . He swallowed the steak , the soft parts of all the pieces of toast , four grapes , and two bits of peaches . He has also taken at intervals during the day the usual quantity of beef tea , porridge , &c.,; and this evening he drank another milk punch . A short time after the meal spoken of the President was transferred to the invalid chair , his head being raised to an angle of 40 ? , a little higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day has been a delightful one , but the aspect of nature has been entirely different as compared with yesterday and the day before . Heavy clouds have rolled rapidly across the sky , letting through an occasional gleam of sunshine . The darkened sea has been lashed into whitecaps as far as the eye could reach , and the rollers have thundered with increasing force upon the beach . A strong gale of wind has blown from the sea all day , rattling doors and windows . bending trees and shrubbery , and leveling the tall grass . ? It has not been cold , though to-night light overcoats are by no means uncomfortable . While the President was in his chair a small coasting steamer passed , rolling and pitching tremendously . A short distance behind there followed a majestic ocean steam-ship , which did not appear to be affected in the least by the motion of the billows . The President gazed long and earnestly upon the scene and then listened to his wife who read to him some private letters to personal friends . He was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then returned to his bed . He said the change had been a great relief to him . The usual febrile rise came on earlier than usual this afternoon , but was of a much milder type than yesterday , and there was nothing in the evening bulletin to serve as the foundation of a note of alarm . Dr. Bliss went to New-York this morning and returned in time for the evening examination . He expressed surprise when informed that a number of interviews had been published purporting to have been with him in the afternoon newspapers and said that he had not talked with a newspaper reporter while in the city . He was , as usual , in good humor and full of confidence . Dr. Boynton is also cheerful , for him , tonight . He says that the President has had a satisfactory day  --  that he has held his own . Mrs. Dr. Edson stopped at Elberon to-day on her way to New-York from Asbury Park , for the purpose of making inquiries as to the President 's condition . She left much encouraged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a very pretty and convenient night clock , to be used by the President on the:gas-burner in his room . A card was attached to the gift , on which was written , " with sympathy of five interested children , from Boston . " The clock will be placed in the President 's chamber . A very handsome three-whetled easy chair was also received by Col. Rockwell to-day for the President , being a present from Mr. John Hoer , of this place . The following telegram from Topeka , Kan. , was received by Mrs. Garfield to-day : Twenty thousand veteran soldiers in reunion here assembled send you our sympathy and love , and ask you to say to our stricken comrade that our hearts are beating with an anxious hope for his recovery . Say to him we believe that , under heaven , aided by that sublime courage and faith which in the past have been to all the people his crown of glory , he will be preserved to the country he has served so long , so faithfully , and so well . LOUIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NewJersey have sent a letter to each of the workmen employed in the construction of the temporary track used in removing President Garfield to the Francklyn cottage , thanking him for the promptness and fidelity with which he worked 24 hours without rest .
