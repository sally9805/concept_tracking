Illustration : EVENING DEVOTIONS . DIDDIE , DUMPS &; TOT OR PLANTATION CHILD-LIFE By Louise-Clarke Pyrnelle Originally Published 1882 TO MY DEAR FATHER DR . RICHARD CLARKE OF SELMA , ALABAMA MY HERO AND MY BEAU IDEAL OF A GENTLEMAN I Dedicate this Book WITH THE LOVE OF HIS DAUGHTER PREFACE . In writing this little volume , I had for my primary object the idea of keeping alive many of the old stories , legends , traditions , games , hymns , and superstitions of the Southern slaves , which , with this generation of negroes , will pass away . There are now no more dear old " Mammies " and " Aunties " in our nurseries , no more good old " Uncles " in the workshops , to tell the children those old tales that have been told to our mothers and grandmothers for generations -- the stories that kept our fathers and grandfathers quiet at night , and induced them to go early to bed that they might hear them the sooner . Nor does my little book pretend to be any defence of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( there are many pros and cons on that subject ) ; but it was the law of the land , made by statesmen from the North as well as the South , long before my day , or my father 's or grandfather 's day ; and , born under that law a slave-holder , and the descendant of slave-holders , raised in the heart of the cotton section , surrounded by negroes from my earliest infancy , " I KNOW whereof I do speak ; " and it is to tell of the pleasant and happy relations that existed between master and slave that I write this story of " Diddie , Dumps , and Tot . " The stories , plantation games , and hymns are just as I heard them in my childhood . I have learned that Mr. Harris , in " Uncle Remus , " has already given the " Tar Baby ; " but I have not seen his book , and , as our versions are probably different , I shall let mine remain just as " Chris " told it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers will be shocked at the seeming irreverence of my book , for that intimacy with the " Lord " was characteristic of the negroes . They believed implicitly in a Special Providence and direct punishment or reward , and that faith they religiously tried to impress upon their young charges , white or black ; and " heavy , heavy hung over our heads " was the DEVIL ! The least little departure from a marked-out course of morals or manners was sure to be followed by , " Nem ' min ' , de deb'l gwine git yer . " And what the Lord ' lowed and what he did n't ' low was perfectly well known to every darky . For instance , " he did n't ' low no singin ' uv week-er-day chunes uv er Sunday , " nor " no singin ' uv reel chunes " ( dance music ) at any time ; nor did he " ' low no sassin ' of ole pussons . " The " chu'ch membahs " had their little differences of opinion . Of course they might differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinklin ' , " " open " or " close " communion ; but when it came to such grave matters as " singin ' uv reel chunes , " or " sassin ' uv ole pussons , " Baptists and Methodists met on common ground , and stood firm . Nor did our Mammies and Aunties neglect our manners . To say " yes " or " no " to any person , white or black , older than ourselves was considered very rude ; it must always be " yes , mam , " " no , mam ; " " yes , sir , " " no , sir ; " and those expressions are still , and I hope ever will be , characteristic of Southerners . The child-life that I have portrayed is over now ; for no hireling can ever be to the children what their Mammies were , and the strong tie between the negroes and " marster 's chil'en " is broken forever . So , hoping that my book ( which claims no literary merit ) will serve to amuse the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to the South in her palmy days , without further preface I send out my volume of Plantation Child-life .

CHAPTER I. DIDDIE , DUMPS , AND TOT . They were three little sisters , daughters of a Southern planter , and they lived in a big white house on a cotton plantation in Mississippi . The house stood in a grove of cedars and live-oaks , and on one side was a flower-garden , with two summer-houses covered with climbing roses and honeysuckles , where the little girls would often have tea-parties in the pleasant spring and summer days . Back of the house was a long avenue of water-oaks leading to the quarters where the negroes lived . Major Waldron , the father of the children , owned a large number of slaves , and they loved him and his children very dearly . And the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nursed their mother , and now had entire charge of the children ; and Aunt Milly , a lame yellow woman , who helped Mammy in the nursery ; and Aunt Edy , the head laundress , who was never too busy to amuse them . Then there was Aunt Nancy , the " tender , " who attended to the children for the field-hands , and old Uncle Snake-bit Bob , who could scarcely walk at all , because he had been bitten by a snake when he was a boy : so now he had a little shop , where he made baskets of white-oak splits for the hands to pick cotton in ; and he always had a story ready for the children , and would let them help him weave baskets whenever Mammy would take them to the shop . Besides these , there were Riar , Chris , and Dilsey , three little negroes , who belonged to the little girls and played with them , and were in training to be their maids by-and-by . Diddie , the oldest of the children , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Carrie , who had taught her to read quite well , and even to write a letter . She was a quiet , thoughtful little girl , well advanced for her age , and ladylike in her manners . Dumps , the second sister , was five , full of fun and mischief , and gave Mammy a great deal of trouble on account of her wild tomboyish ways . Tot , the baby , was a tiny , little blue-eyed child of three , with long light curls , who was always amiable and sweet-tempered , and was petted by everybody who knew her . Now , you must not think that the little girls had been carried to the font and baptized with such ridiculous names as Diddie , Dumps , and Tot : these were only pet names that Mammy had given them ; but they had been called by them so long that many persons forgot that Diddie 's name was Madeleine , that Dumps had been baptized Elinor , and that Tot bore her mother 's name of Eugenia , for they were known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . The little girls were very happy in their plantation home . ' T is true they lived ' way out in the country , and had no museums nor toy-shops to visit , no fine parks to walk or ride in , nor did they have a very great variety of toys . They had some dolls and books , and a baby-house furnished with little beds and chairs and tables ; and they had a big Newfoundland dog , Old Bruno ; and Dumps and Tot both had a little kitten apiece ; and there was " Old Billy , " who once upon a time had been a frisky little lamb , Diddie 's special pet ; but now he was a vicious old sheep , who amused the children very much by running after them whenever he could catch them out-of-doors . Sometimes , though , he would butt them over and hurt them , and Major Waldron had several times had him turned into the pasture ; but Diddie would always cry and beg for him to be brought back , and so Old Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbin , the little white pony that belonged to all of the children together , and was saddled and bridled every fair day , and tied to the horse-rack , that the little girls might ride him whenever they chose ; and ' t was no unusual sight to see two of them on him at once , cantering down the big road or through the grove . And , besides all these amusements , Mammy or Aunt Milly or Aunt Edy , or some of the negroes , would tell them tales ; and once in a while they would slip off and go to the quarters , to Aunt Nancy the tender 's cabin , and play with the little quarter children . They particularly liked to go there about dark to hear the little negroes say their prayers . Aunt Nancy would make them all kneel down in a row , and clasp their hands and shut their eyes : then she would say , " Our Father , who art in heaven , " and all the little darkies together would repeat each petition after her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out together , she would give the delinquent a sharp cut with a long switch that she always kept near her . So the prayer was very much interrupted by the little " nigs " telling on each other , calling out " Granny " ( as they all called Aunt Nancy ) , " Jim did n't say his ' kingdom come . ' " " Yes I did , Granny ; do n't yer b'lieve dat gal ; I said jes ' much ' kingdom come ' ez she did . " And presently Jim would retaliate by saying , " Granny , Polly nuber sed nuf'n ' bout her ' cruspusses . ' " " Lord-ee ! jes ' lis'n at dat nigger , " Polly would say . " Granny , do n't yer min ' ' im ; I sed furgib us cruspusses , jes ' as plain ez anybody , and Ginny hyeard me ; did n't yer , Ginny ? " At these interruptions Aunt Nancy would stop to investigate the matter , and whoever was found in fault was punished with strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarters was in the morning before breakfast , to see Aunt Nancy give the little darkies their " vermifuge . " She had great faith in the curative properties of a very nauseous vermifuge that she had made herself by stewing some kind of herbs in molasses , and every morning she would administer a teaspoonful of it to every child under her care ; and she used to say , " Ef'n hit want fur dat furmifuge , den marster would n't hab all dem niggers w'at yer see hyear . " Now , I do n't know about that ; but I do know that the little darkies would rather have had fewer " niggers " and less " furmifuge ; " for they acted shamefully every time they were called upon to take a dose . In the first place , whenever Aunt Nancy appeared with the bottle and spoon , as many of the children as could get away would flee for their lives , and hide themselves behind the hen-coops and ash-barrels , and under the cabins , and anywhere they could conceal themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make them all form in a line , and in that way would soon miss any absentees ; but there were always volunteers to hunt out and run down and bring back the shirkers , who , besides having to take the vermifuge , would get a whipping into the bargain . And even after Aunt Nancy would get them into line , and their hands crossed behind their backs , she would have to watch very closely , or some wicked little " nig " would slip into the place of the one just above him , and make a horrible face , and spit , and wipe his mouth as if he had just taken his dose ; and thereby the one whose place he had taken would have to swallow a double portion , while he escaped entirely ; or else a scuffle would ensue , and a very animated discussion between the parties as to who had taken the last dose ; and unless it could be decided satisfactorily , Aunt Nancy would administer a dose to each one ; for , in her opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so you see the giving of the vermifuge consumed considerable time . After that was through with , she would begin again at the head of the line , and , making each child open its mouth to its fullest extent , she would examine each throat closely , and if any of them had their " palates down , " she would catch up a little clump of hair right on top of their heads and wrap it around as tightly as she could with a string , and then , catching hold of this " topknot , " she would pull with all her might to bring up the palate . The unlucky little " nig " in the meanwhile kept up the most unearthly yells , for so great was the depravity among them that they had rather have their palates down than up . Keeping their " palate locks " tied was a source of great trouble and worriment to Aunt Nancy . Illustration : SANITARY MEASURES . The winter was always a great season with the children ; Mammy would let them have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings , and Aunt Milly had to make them so many new doll 's clothes , to " keep them quiet , " as Dumps said ; and such romps and games as they would have in the old nursery ! There were two rooms included in the nursery -- one the children 's bedroom and the other their playroom , where they kept all their toys and litter ; and during the winter bright wood fires were kept up in both rooms , that the children might not take cold , and around both fireplaces were tall brass fenders that were kept polished till they shone like gold . Yet , in spite of this precaution , do you know that once Dilsey , Diddie 's little maid , actually caught on fire , and her linsey dress was burned off , and Aunt Milly had to roll her over and over on the floor , and did n't get her put out till her little black neck was badly burned , and her little woolly head all singed . After that she had to be nursed for several days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stella , " a china doll that was perfectly good , only she had one leg off and her neck cracked ; but , for all that , she was a great favorite in the nursery , and it grieved Dumps very much to part with her ; but she thought it was her " Christian juty , " as she told Diddie ; so Aunt Milly made Stella a new green muslin dress , and she was transferred to Dilsey . There was no railroad near the plantation , but it was only fifteen miles to the river , and Major Waldron would go down to New Orleans every winter to lay in his year 's supplies , which were shipped by steamboats to the landing and hauled from there to the plantation . It was a jolly time for both white and black when the wagons came from the river ; there were always boxes of fruits and candies and nuts , besides large trunks which were carried into the store-room till Christmas , and which everybody knew contained Christmas presents for " all hands . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the big gate , on the lookout for the wagons . Diddie was perched upon one gate-post and Dumps on the other , while Tot was sitting on the fence , held on by Riar , lest she might fall . Dilsey and Chris were stationed ' way down the road to catch the first glimpse of the wagons . They were all getting very impatient , for they had been out there nearly an hour , and it was now getting so late they knew Mammy would not let them stay much longer . " I know de reason dey so late , Miss Diddie , " said Riar ; " dey got dat new mule Sam in de lead in one de wagins and Unker Bill say he know he gwine cut up , f'um de look in he 's eyes . " " Uncle Bill do n't know everything , " answered Diddie . " There are six mules in the wagon , and Sam 's jest only one of ' em ; I reckon he ca n't cut up much by hisself ; five 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do b'lieve we 've been out hyear er hun-der-d hours , " said Dumps , yawning wearily ; and just then Dilsey and Chris came running towards the gate , waving their arms and crying , " Hyear dey come ! hyear dey come ! " and , sure enough , the great white-covered wagons came slowly down the road , and Major Waldron on Prince , his black horse , riding in advance . He quickened his pace when he caught sight of the children ; for he was very fond of his little daughters , and had been away from them two weeks , trading in New Orleans . He rode up now to the fence , and lifting Tot to the saddle before him , took her in his arms and kissed her . Diddie and Dumps scrambled down from the gate-posts and ran along by the side of Prince to the house , where their mamma was waiting on the porch . And oh ! such a joyful meeting ! such hugging and kissing all around ! Then the wagons came up , and the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying them to the store-room . " Hand me out that covered basket , Nelson , " said Major Waldron to one of the men ; and , taking it carefully to the house , he untied the cover , and there lay two little white woolly puppies -- one for Diddie , and one for Dumps . The little girls clapped their hands and danced with delight . " Ai n't they lovely ? " said Dumps , squeezing hers in her arms . " Lubly , " echoed Tot , burying her chubby little hands in the puppy 's wool , while Diddie cuddled hers in her arms as tenderly as if it had been a baby . Mammy made a bed for the doggies in a box in one corner of the nursery , and the children were so excited and so happy that she could hardly get them to bed at all ; but after a while Tot 's blue eyes began to droop , and she fell asleep in Mammy 's arms , murmuring , " De booful itty doggie . " " De booful itty doggies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried and howled , and Dumps insisted on taking hers up and rocking him to sleep . " Hit 's er gittin ' so late , honey , " urged Mammy , " let ' um stay in de box , an ' go ter bed now , like good chil'en . " " I know I ai n't , Mammy , " replied Dumps . " You mus ' think I ai n't got no feelin 's ter go ter bed an ' leave ' im hollerin ' . I 'm er goin ' ter rock ' im ter sleep in my little rockin ' - cheer , an ' you need n't be er fussin ' at me nuther . " " I ai n't er fussin ' at yer , chile ; I 'm jes ' visin ' uv yer fur yer good ; caze hit 's yer bedtime , an ' dem puppies will likely holler all night . " " Then we will sit up all night , " said Diddie , in her determined way . " I 'm like Dumps ; I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So Mammy drew her shawl over her head and lay back in her chair for a nap , while Diddie and Dumps took the little dogs in their arms and sat before the fire rocking ; and Chris and Dilsey and Riar all squatted on the floor around the fender , very much interested in the process of getting the puppies quiet . Presently Dumps began to sing : " Ef'n ' ligion was er thing that money could buy , O reign , Marse Jesus , er reign ; De rich would live , an ' de po ' would die , O reign , Marse Jesus , er reign . Chorus . O reign , reign , reign , er my Lord , O reign , Marse Jesus , er reign : O reign , reign , reign , er my Lord , O reign , Marse Jesus , er reign . But de Lord he ' lowed he would n't have it so , O reign , Marse Jesus , er reign ; So de rich mus ' die jes ' same as de po ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was one of the plantation hymns with which Mammy often used to sing Tot to sleep , and all the children were familiar with the words and air ; so now they all joined in the singing , and very sweet music it was . They had sung it through several times , and the puppies , finding themselves so outdone in the matter of noise , had curled up in the children 's laps and were fast asleep , when Diddie interrupted the chorus to ask : " Dumps , what are you goin ' ter name your doggie ? " " I b'lieve I 'll name ' im ' Papa , ' " replied Dumps , " because he give ' im ter me . " " ' Papa , ' indeed ! " said Diddie , contemptuously ; " that 's no name for a dog ; I 'm goin ' ter name mine after some great big somebody . " " Lord-ee ! I tell yer , Miss Diddie ; name ' im Marse Samson , atter de man w'at Mammy wuz tellin ' ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No yer do n't , Miss Diddie ; do n't yer name ' im no sich , " said Chris ; " le 's name im ' Marse Whale , w'at swallered de man an ' nuber chawed ' im . " " No , I sha' n't name him nothin ' out'n the Bible , " said Diddie , " because that 's wicked , and maybe God would n't let him live , just for that ; I b'lieve I 'll name him Christopher Columbus , ' cause if he had n't discovered America there would n't er been no people hyear , an ' I would n't er had no father nor mother , nor dog , nor nothin ' : an ' , Dumps , sposin ' you name yours Pocahontas , that was er beau-ti-ful Injun girl , an ' she throwed her arms ' roun ' Mr. Smith an ' never let the tomahawks kill ' im . " " I know I ai n't goin ' to name mine no Injun , " said Dumps , decidedly . " Yer right , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Riar ; " I would n't name ' im no Injun ; have ' im tearin ' folks ' hyar off , like Miss Diddie reads in de book . I do n't want ter hab nuffin ' tall ter do wid no Injuns ; no , sar ! I do n't like dem folks . " " Now , chil'en , de dogs is ' sleep , " said Mammy , yawning and rubbing her eyes ; " go ter bed , wo n't yer ? " And the little girls , after laying the puppies in the box and covering them with an old shawl , were soon fast asleep . But there was not much sleep in the nursery that night ; the ungrateful little dogs howled and cried all night . Mammy got up three times and gave them warm milk , and tucked them up in the shawl ; but no sooner would she put them back in the box than they would begin to cry and howl . And so at the breakfast-table next morning , when Dumps asked her papa to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think , Dumps , we had better name ' um Cherubim an ' Seraphim , for they continually do cry . " And her papa was so amused at the idea that he said he thought so too ; and thus the puzzling question of the names was decided , and the little woolly poodles were called Cherubim and Seraphim , and became great pets in the household . CHAPTER II . CHRISTMAS ON THE OLD PLANTATION . Christmas morning , 1853 , dawned cold and rainy , and scarcely had the first gray streak appeared when the bolt of the nursery was quietly turned , and Dilsey 's little black head peered in through the half-open door . " Chris'mus gif ' , chil'en ! " she called out , and in a twinkling Diddie , Dumps , and Tot were all wide awake , and climbing over the side of the bed . Then the three little sisters and Dilsey tip-toed all around to everybody 's rooms , catching " Chris'mus gif ' ; " but just as they were creeping down stairs to papa and mamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Riar and Chris called out , " Chris'mus gif ' ! " and laughed and danced to think they had " cotch de white chil'en . " As soon as everybody had been caught they all went into the sitting-room to see what Santa Claus had brought , and there were eight stockings all stuffed full ! Three long , white stockings , that looked as if they might be mamma 's , were for the little girls , and three coarse woollen stockings were for the little nigs ; and now whom do you suppose the others were for ? Why , for Mammy and Aunt Milly , to be sure ! Oh , such lots of things -- candies and nuts , and raisins and fruits in every stocking ; then there was a doll baby for each of the children . Diddie 's was a big china doll , with kid feet and hands , and dressed in a red frock trimmed with black velvet . Dumps 's was a wax baby with eyes that would open and shut ; and it had on a long white dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack , all worked around with white . Tot was so little , and treated her dollies so badly , that " Old Santa " had brought her an India-rubber baby , dressed in pink tarlatan , with a white sash . Dilsey , Chris , and Riar each had an alabaster baby , dressed in white Swiss , and they were all just alike , except that they had different colored sashes on . And Diddie had a book full of beautiful stories , and Dumps had a slate and pencil , and Tot had a " Noah 's ark , " and Mammy and Aunt Milly had red and yellow head " handkerchiefs , " and Mammy had a new pair of " specs " and a nice warm hood , and Aunt Milly had a delaine dress ; and ' way down in the toes of their stockings they each found a five-dollar gold piece , for Old Santa had seen how patient and good the two dear old women were to the children , and so he had " thrown in " these gold pieces . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out of their stockings ! But pretty soon Mammy made them put them all away , to get ready for breakfast . After breakfast the big plantation bell was rung , and the negroes all came up to the house . And then a great box that had been in the store-room ever since the wagons got back from the river , three weeks before , was brought in and opened , and Mrs. Waldron took from it dresses and hats , and bonnets and coats , and vests and all sorts of things , until every pair of black hands had received a present , and every pair of thick lips exclaimed , " Thankee , mistis ! thankee , honey ; an ' God bless yer ! " And then Chris , who had been looking anxiously every moment or two towards the quarters , cried out , " Yon ' dey is ! I see um ! Yon ' dey come ! " And down the long avenue appeared the funniest sort of a procession . First came Aunt Nancy , the " tender , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight up from her head ; and behind her , two and two , came the little quarter negroes , dressed in their brightest and newest clothes . All were there -- from the boys and girls of fourteen down to the little wee toddlers of two or three , and some even younger than that ; for in the arms of several of the larger girls were little bits of black babies , looking all around in their queer kind of way , and wondering what all this was about . The procession drew up in front of the house , and Diddie , Dumps , and Tot went from one end of it to the other distributing candies and apples , and oranges and toys ; and how the bright faces did light up with joy as the little darkies laughed and chuckled , and I dare say would have jumped up and clapped their hands but for Aunt Nancy , who was keeping a sharp eye upon them , and who would say , as every present was delivered , " Min ' yer manners , now ! " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bob-down " courtesy and say , " Thankee , marm . " When the presents were all delivered , Major Waldron told the negroes that their mistress and himself were going to the quarters to take presents to the old negroes and the sick , who could not walk to the house , and that after that he would have service in the chapel , and that he hoped as many as could would attend . Then the crowd dispersed , and the children 's mamma filled a basket with " good things , " and presents for old Aunt Sally , who was almost blind ; and poor Jane , who had been sick a long time ; and Daddy Jake , the oldest negro on the place , who never ventured out in bad weather for fear of the " rheumatiz ; " and then , accompanied by her husband and children , she carried it to the quarters to wish the old negroes a happy Christmas . The quarters presented a scene of the greatest excitement . Men and women were bustling about , in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning up the big barn and dressing it with boughs of holly and cedar ; for you see Aunt Sukey 's Jim was going to be married that very night , and the event had been talked of for weeks , for he was a great favorite on the place . He was a tall , handsome black fellow , with white teeth and bright eyes , and he could play the fiddle and pick the banjo , and knock the bones and cut the pigeon-wing , and , besides all that , he was the best hoe-hand , and could pick more cotton than any other negro on the plantation . He had amused himself by courting and flirting with all of the negro girls ; but at last he had been caught himself by pretty Candace , one of the house-maids , and a merry dance she had led him . She had kept poor Jim six long months on the rack . First she 'd say she 'd marry him , and then she 'd say she would n't ( not that she ever really meant that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; and she succeeded so well that Jim became utterly wretched , and went to his master to know " even he could n't make dat yaller gal ' have herse'f . " But his master assured him it was a matter that he had nothing on earth to do with , and even told Jim that it was but fair that he , who had enjoyed flirting so long , should now be flirted with . However , one evening his mistress came upon the poor fellow sitting on the creek bank looking very disconsolate , and overheard him talking to himself . " Yes , sar ! " he was saying , as if arguing with somebody . " Yes , sar , by rights dat nigger gal oughter be beat mos ' ter deff , she clean bodder de life out'n me , an ' marster , he jes ' oughter kill dat nigger . I du n no w'at makes me kyar so much er bout'n her no way ; dar 's plenty er likelier gals ' n her , an ' I jes ' b'lieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sho 's yer born ; an ' even I did n't b'long ter nobody , I 'd jump right inter dis creek an ' drown myse'f . But I ai n't got no right ter be killin ' up marster 's niggers dat way ; I 'm wuff er thousan ' dollars , an ' marster ai n't got no thousan ' dollars ter was'e in dis creek , long er dat lazy , shif'less , good-fur-nuffin ' yaller nigger . " The poor fellow 's dejected countenance and evident distress enlisted the sympathy of his mistress , and thinking that any negro who took such good care of his master 's property would make a good husband , she sought an interview with Candace , and so pleaded with her in behalf of poor Jim that the dusky coquette relented , and went down herself to Aunt Sukey 's cabin to tell her lover that she did love him all along , and was " jis ' er projeckin ' wid ' im , " and that she would surely marry him Christmas-night . Their master had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had furnished it neatly for the young folks to begin housekeeping , and in mamma 's wardrobe was a white dress and a veil and wreath that were to be the bride 's Christmas gifts . They were to be married in the parlor at the house , and dance afterwards in the barn , and the wedding supper was to be set in the laundry . So you see it was a busy day , with so much of cake-baking and icing and trimming to be done ; and then the girls had to see about their dresses for the evening , and the young men had their shoes to black , and their best clothes to brush , and their hair to unwrap ; but , notwithstanding all this , when Major Waldron and his family entered the chapel they found a large congregation assembled ; indeed , all were there except the sick ; and master and slaves , the white children and black , united their hearts and voices to " Laud and magnify His holy name , " and to return thanks to God for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they were leaving the chapel after service , Dumps drew close to her mother and whispered , " Mamma , bein ' as this is Chris'mas , an ' it 's rainin ' , ca n't we have some of the little quarter niggers to go to the house and play Injuns with us ? " Mamma was about to refuse , for the little girls were not allowed to play with the quarter children ; but Dumps looked very wistful , and , besides , Mammy would be with them in the nursery , so she consented , and each of the children were told that they might select one of the little negroes to play with them . Diddie took a little mulatto girl named Agnes . Dumps had so many favorites that it was hard for her to decide ; but finally she selected Frances , a lively little darky , who could dance and pat and sing and shout , and do lots of funny things . Tot took Polly , a big girl of fourteen , who could , and sometimes did , take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lifted her now to her shoulders , and , throwing her head up and snorting like a horse , started off in a canter to the house ; while Diddie and Dumps , and Chris and Riar , and Agnes and Frances followed on behind , all barking like dogs , and making believe that Tot was going hunting and they were the hounds . " See , Mammy , here 's Agnes and Polly and Frances , " said Diddie , as they entered the nursery ; " mamma let us have them , and they are to stay here a long time and play Injuns with us . " " Now , Miss Diddie , honey , " said Mammy , " Injuns is sich a sackremenchus play , an ' makes so much litter and fuss ; git yer dolls , an ' play like er little lady . " " No , no , no , " interrupted Dumps ; " we 're goin ' ter play Injuns ! We 're goin ' ter make out we 're travellin ' in the big rockin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little niggers is got ter be Injuns , hid all behin ' the trunks an ' beds an ' door ; an ' after we rock an ' rock er lo-o-ong time , then we 're goin ' ter make out it 's night , an ' stretch mamma 's big shawl over two cheers an ' make er tent , and be cookin ' supper in our little pots an ' kittles , an ' the little niggers is got ter holler , ' Who-ee , who-eee , ' an ' jump out on us , an ' cut off our heads with er billycrow . " " How silly you do talk , Dumps ! " said Diddie : " there ai n't any Injuns between here and New Orleans ; we 've got ter be goin ' ter California , a far ways f'um here . An ' I do n't b'lieve there 's nothin ' in this world named er ' billycrow ; ' it 's er tommyhawk you 're thinkin ' about : an ' Injuns do n't cut off people 's heads ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair and call it sculpin ' , do n't they , Mammy ? " " Lor ' , chile , " replied Mammy , " I du n no , honey ; I allers hyeard dat Injuns wuz monstrous onstreperous , an ' I would n't play no sich er game . " But " Injuns , Injuns , Injuns ! " persisted all the little folks , and Mammy had to yield . The big chair was put in the middle of the room , and the little girls got in . Chris sat up on the arms to be the driver , and they started off for California . After travelling some time night set in , and the emigrants got out , and pitched a tent and made preparations for cooking supper : little bits of paper were torn up and put into the miniature pots and kettles , and the children were busy stirring them round with a stick for a spoon , when the terrible war-whoop rang in their ears , and from under the bed and behind the furniture jumped out the five little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Injuns after them . Diddie hid in the wardrobe , and Mammy covered Tot up in the middle of the bed ; Chris turned the chip-box over and tried to get under it , but the fierce savages dragged her out , and she was soon tied hand and foot ; Dumps jumped into the clothes-basket , and Aunt Milly threw a blanket over her , but Frances had such keen little eyes that she soon spied her and captured her at once . Then a wild yell was sounded , and Polly and Dilsey pounced upon Tot , who had become tired of lying still , and was wriggling about so that she had been discovered ; and now all the travellers were captured except Diddie . The Injuns looked everywhere for her in vain . " She mus ' er gone up fru de chimbly , like Marse Santion Claws , " said Agnes ; and Diddie thought that was so funny that she giggled outright , and in a moment the wardrobe was opened and she was also taken prisoner . Then the four little captives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clothes-brush for a tomahawk . As soon as they were all scalped they started over again , and kept up the fun until the big plantation bell sounded , and then the Injuns deserted in a body and ran off pell-mell to the quarters ; for that bell was for the Christmas dinner , and they would n't miss that for all the scalps that ever were taken . Illustration : PLAYING " INJUNS . " There were three long tables , supplied with good , well-cooked food , followed by a nice dessert of pudding and cake , and the darkies , one and all , did full justice to it . Up at the house was a grand dinner , with turkey , mince-pie , and plum-pudding , of course . When that was through with , mamma told the little girls that the little quarter negroes were to have a candy stew , and that Mammy might take them to witness the pulling . This was a great treat , for there was nothing the children enjoyed so much as going to the quarters to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Aunt Nancy as a fine device for getting rid of the little darkies for the night . They were to have the frolic only on condition that they would go to bed and not insist on being at the wedding . This they readily agreed to ; for they feared they would not be allowed to sit up any way , and they thought best to make sure of the candy-pulling . When the little girls reached Aunt Nancy 's cabin , two big kettles of molasses were on the fire , and , to judge by the sputtering and simmering , the candy was getting on famously . Uncle Sambo had brought his fiddle in , and some of the children were patting and singing and dancing , while others were shelling goobers and picking out scaly-barks to put in the candy ; and when the pulling began , if you could have heard the laughing and joking you would have thought there was no fun like a candy stew . As a special favor , the little girls were allowed to stay up and see Candace married ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing her : her white Swiss was fresh and new , and the wreath and veil were very becoming , and she made quite a pretty bride ; at least Jim thought so , and that was enough for her . Jim was dressed in a new pepper-and-salt suit , his Christmas present from his master , and the bridesmaids and groomsmen all looked very fine . Mamma arranged the bridal party in the back parlor , and the folding-doors were thrown open . Both rooms and the large hall were full of negroes . The ceremony was performed by old Uncle Daniel , the negro preacher on the place , and the children 's father gave the bride away . After the marriage , the darkies adjourned to the barn to dance . Diddie and Dumps begged to be allowed to go and look at them " just a little while , " but it was their bedtime , and Mammy marched them off to the nursery . About twelve o'clock supper was announced , and old and young repaired to the laundry . The room was festooned with wreaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tempting the table looked , spread out with meats and breads , and pickles and preserves , and home-made wine , and cakes of all sorts and sizes , iced and plain ; large bowls of custard and jelly ; and candies , and fruits and nuts . In the centre of the table was a pyramid , beginning with a large cake at the bottom and ending with a " snowball " on top . At the head of the table was the bride-cake , containing the " ring " and the " dime ; " it was handsomely iced , and had a candy Cupid perched over it , on a holly bough which was stuck in a hole in the middle of the cake . It was to be cut after a while by each of the bridesmaids and groomsmen in turns ; and whoever should cut the slice containing the ring would be the next one to get married ; but whoever should get the dime was to be an old maid or an old bachelor . The supper was enjoyed hugely , particularly a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dancing was entered into with renewed vigor , and kept up till the gray tints in the east warned them that another day had dawned , and that Christmas was over . But you may be sure that in all Christendom it had been welcomed in and ushered out by no merrier , lighter hearts than those of the happy , contented folks on the old plantation . CHAPTER III . MAMMY 'S STORY . One cold , rainy night a little group were assembled around a crackling wood fire in the nursery ; Mammy was seated in a low chair , with Tot in her arms ; Dumps was rocking her doll back and forth , and Diddie was sitting at the table reading ; Aunt Milly was knitting , and the three little darkies were nodding by the fire . " Mammy , " said Dumps , " s'posin ' you tell us a tale . " Tot warmly seconded the motion , and Mammy , who was never more delighted than when astonishing the children with her wonderful stories , at once assumed a meditative air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scratching her head ; " I reckon I 'll tell yer ' bout de wushin ' - stone , ai n't neber told yer dat yit . I know yer 've maybe hearn on it , leastways Milly has ; but den she may n't have hearn de straight on it , fur ' taint eb'y nigger knows it . Yer see , Milly , my mammy was er ' riginal Guinea nigger , an ' she knowed ' bout de wushin ' - stone herse'f , an ' she told me one Wednesday night on de full er de moon , an ' w'at I 'm gwine ter tell yer is de truff . " Having thus authenticated her story beyond a doubt , Mammy hugged Tot a little closer and began : " Once ' pon er time dar wuz a beautiful gyarden wid all kind er nice blossoms , an ' trees , an ' brooks , an ' things , whar all de little chil'en usen ter go and play , an ' in dis gyarden de grass wuz allers green , de blossoms allers bright , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Fraid , named Cheery . " " A ' little Fraid , ' " interrupted Diddie , contemptuously . " Why , Mammy , there 's no such a thing as a ' Fraid . ' " " Lord , Miss Diddie , ' deed dey is , " said Dilsey , with her round eyes stretched to their utmost ; " I done seed ' em myse'f , an ' our Club-foot Bill he was er gwine ' long one time --  " " Look er hyear , yer kinky-head nigger , whar 's yer manners ? " asked Mammy , " ' ruptin uv eld'ly pussons . " I 'm de one w'at 's ' struck'n dese chil'en , done strucked dey mother fuss ; I 'll tell ' em w'at 's becomin ' fur ' em ter know ; I do n't want ' em ter hyear nuf'n ' bout sich low cornfiel ' niggers ez Club-foot Bill . " Yes , Miss Diddie , honey , " said Mammy , resuming her story , " dar sholy is Fraids ; Mammy ai n't gwine tell yer nuf'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fack ; so as I wuz er sayin ' , dis little Fraid wuz name Cheery , an ' she 'd go all ' roun ' eb'y mornin ' an ' tech up de grass an ' blossoms an ' keep ' em fresh , fur she loved ter see chil'en happy , an ' w'en dey rolled ober on de grass , an ' strung de blossoms , an ' waded up an ' down de streams , an ' peeped roun ' de trees , Cheery 'd clap ' er han 's an ' laugh , an ' dance roun ' an ' roun ' ; an ' sometimes dar 'd be little po ' white chil'en , an ' little misfortnit niggers would go dar ; an ' w'en she 'd see de bright look in dey tired eyes , she 'd fix things prettier ' n eber . " Now dar wuz er nudder little Fraid name Dreary ; an ' she wuz sad an ' gloomy , an ' nebber dance , nor play , nor nuf'n ; but would jes go off poutin ' like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big flat stone under a tree . She said ter herse'f , ' I ai n't gwine ter be like dat foolish Cheery , dancin ' an ' laughin ' foreber , caze she thinks sich things ez flowers an ' grass kin make folks happy ; but I 'm gwine ter do er rael good ter eb'ybody ; ' so she laid er spell on de stone , so dat w'en anybody sot on de stone an ' wush anything dey 'd hab jes w'at dey wush fur ; an ' so as ter let er heap er folks wush at once , she made it so dat eb'y wush would make de stone twice ez big as ' twuz befo ' . " Po ' little Cheery was mighty troubled in her min ' w'en she foun ' out bout'n hit , an ' she beg Dreary ter tuck de spell off ; but no , she would n't do it . She ' lowed , do , ef anybody should eber wush anything fur anybody else , dat den de stone might shrink up ergin ; fur who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur things fur tudder folks ? An ' she tol ' de little birds dat stay in de tree de stone wuz under , when anybody sot on de stone dey mus ' sing , ' I wush I had , ' an ' ' I wush I wuz , ' so as ter min ' em bout'n de wushin ' - stone . Well , ' twa n't long fo ' de gyarden wuz plum crowded wid folks come ter wush on de stone , an ' hit wuz er growin ' bigger an ' bigger all de time , an ' mashin ' de blossoms an ' grass ; an ' dar wa n't no mo ' merry chil'en playin ' ' mong de trees an ' wadin ' in de streams ; no soun 's ob laughin ' and joy in de gyarden ; eb'ybody wuz er quarlin ' bout'n who should hab de nex ' place , or wuz tryin ' ter study up what dey 'd wush fur ; an ' Cheery wuz jes ez mizer'bul as er free nigger , ' bout her gyarden . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little birds would sing , ' I wush I had ; ' an ' dey 'd wush dey had money , an ' fren 's , an ' sense , an ' happiness , an ' ' ligion ; an ' ' t would all come true jes like dey wush fur . Den de little birds would sing , ' I wush I wuz ; ' an ' dey 'd wush dey wuz lubly , an ' good , an ' gran ' ; un ' ' t would all come ter pass jes so . " But all dat time nobody neber wush nobody else was rich , an ' good , an ' lubly , an ' happy ; fur do n't yer see de birds neber sung , ' I wush you wuz , ' ' I wush dey had ; ' but all de time ' I wush I wuz , ' ' I wush I had . ' At last , one day dar come inter de gyarden er po ' little cripple gal , who lived ' way off in er ole tumble-down house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' she did n't hab no farder nor mudder , nor niggers ter do fur her , an ' she had to do all her own wuck herse'f . " " Bress de Lord ! " ejaculated Aunt Milly , who was becoming very much interested in the story , while tears gathered in Dumps 's blue eyes ; and even Diddie was seen to wink a little at the forlorn condition of " de po ' white chile . " " Yes , indeed , " continued Mammy , " she done all her own wuk herse'f , an ' nobody ter say er blessed word ter her , nor he'p her a bit ; an ' she neber eben hyeard ob de wushin ' - stone , but had jes come out fur er little while ter enjoy de birds , an ' de fresh air , an ' flowers , same as de quality folks ; fur she was mos ' all de time sick , an ' dis wuz jes de same as Christmus ter her . She hobbled erlong on her crutchers , an ' atter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happened dar wa n't nobody dar , so she sot down ter res ' . Well , mun , she had n't mo 'n totch de stone when de little birds began , ' I wush I had , ' ' I wush I wuz . ' " ' Oh , what er sweet , pretty place ! ' de little gal said ; an ' what nice little birds ! I wush dat po ' ole sick man what libs next ter us could come out here and see it all . ' " ' I wush I had , ' ' I wush I wuz , ' sung de little birds . ' I wush all de po ' chil'en could come an ' spen ' de day here , ' said de little gal ; ' what er nice time dey would hab !

' " But de little gal neber min ' ' em . She was rested , an hobbled on all by herse'f , but now , sence she done wush fur blessin 's fur tudder folks , de spell was loosen ' , an ' de stone all drawed up ter a little bit er stone , den sunk away in de groun ' clar out o ' sight . An ' dat wuz de last ob de wushin ' - stone . " " Dar now ! " exclaimed Aunt Milly . " De truff , sho ' ! jes like I ben tellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammy , what about the little girl ? did she ever get well an ' strong , an ' not be lame any more ? " asked Dumps . " Well , honey , yer see de Lord , he fixes all dat . He so n't fur her one night , an ' she jes smiled , bright an ' happy like , an ' laid right back in de angel 's arms ; an ' he tuck her right along up the de hebenly gates , an ' soon as eber he sot her down , an ' her foot totch dem golden streets , de lameness , an ' sickness , an ' po'ness all come right ; an ' her fader , an ' her mudder , an ' her niggers wuz all dar , an ' she wuz well an ' strong , an ' good an ' happy . Jes ' like she wush fur de po ' folks , an ' de sick folks , de Lord he fixed it jes dat way fur her . He fixed all dat hisse'f . " CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some distance from the house , and in an opposite direction from the quarters . It was out in an open field , but a narrow strip of woods lay between the field and the house , so the gin-house was completely hidden . Just back of the gin-house was a pile of lumber that Major Waldron had had hauled to build a new pick-room , and which was piled so as to form little squares , large enough to hold three of the children at once . During the last ginning season they had gone down once with Mammy to " ride on the gin , " but had soon abandoned that amusement to play housekeeping on the lumber , and have the little squares for rooms . They had often since thought of that evening , and had repeatedly begged Mammy to let them go down to the lumber pile ; but she was afraid they would tear their clothes , or hurt themselves in some way , and would never consent . So one day in the early spring , when Mammy and Aunt Milly were having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent into the yard to play , Chris suggested that they should all slip off , and go and play on the lumber pile . " Oh yes , " said Dumps , " that will be the very thing , an ' Mammy wo n't never know it , ' cause we 'll be sho ' ter come back befo ' snack-time . " " But something might happen to us , you know , " said Diddie , " like the boy in my blue book , who went off fishin ' when his mother told him not to , an ' the boat upsetted and drownded him . " " Tai n't no boat there , " urged Dumps ; " tai n't no water even , an ' I do n't b'lieve we 'd be drownded ; an ' tai n't no bears roun ' this place like them that eat up the bad little chil'en in the Bible ; and tai n't no Injuns in this country , an ' tai n't no snakes nor lizards till summer-time , an ' all the cows is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghos'es in the daytime , an ' I do n't b'lieve there 's nothin ' ter happen to us ; an ' ef there wuz , I reckon God kin take care of us , ca n't he ? " " He wo n't do it , though , ef we do n't mind our mother , " replied Diddie . " Mammy ai n't none of our mother , and tai n't none of her business not to be lettin ' us play on the lumber , neither . Please come , Diddie , we 'll have such a fun , an ' nothin ' ca n't hurt us . If you 'll come , we 'll let you keep the hotel , an ' me an ' Tot 'll be the boarders . " The idea of keeping the hotel was too much for Diddie 's scruples , and she readily agreed to the plan . Dilsey was then despatched to the nursery to bring the dolls , and Chris ran off to the wood-pile to get the wheelbarrow , which was to be the omnibus for carrying passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , the next thing was to slip off from Cherubim and Seraphim , for they followed the little girls everywhere , and they would be too much trouble on this occasion , since they could n't climb up on the pile themselves , and would whine piteously if the children left them . The plan finally decided upon was this : Diddie was to coax them to the kitchen to get some meat , while the other children were to go as fast as they could down the avenue and wait for her where the road turned , and she was to slip off while the puppies were eating , and join them . They had only waited a few minutes when Diddie came running down the road , and behind her ( unknown to her ) came Old Billy . " Oh , what made you bring him ? " asked Dumps , as Diddie came up . " I did n't know he was comin ' , " replied Diddie , " but he wo n't hurt : he 'll just eat grass all about , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hurt , " said Dumps ; " he behaves jus ' dreadful , an ' I do n't want ter go , neither , ef he 's got ter be er comin ' . " " Well -- I know he shall come , " retorted Diddie . " You jes do n't like him ' cause he 's gettin ' old . I 'd be ashamed to turn against my friends like that . When he was little and white , you always wanted to be er playin ' with him ; an ' now , jes ' cause he ai n't pretty , you do n't want him to come anywhere , nor have no fun nor nothin ' ; yes -- he shall come ; an ' ef that 's the way you 're goin ' to do , I 'm goin ' right back to the house , an ' tell Mammy you 've all slipped off , an ' she 'll come right after you , an ' then you wo n't get to play on the lumber . " Diddie having taken this decided stand , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party ; and peace being thus restored , the children continued their way , and were soon on the lumber-pile . Diddie at once opened her hotel . Chris was the chambermaid , Riar was the waiter , and Dilsey was the man to take the omnibus down for the passengers . Dumps and Tot , who were to be the boarders , withdrew to the gin-house steps , which was to be the depot , to await the arrival of the omnibus . " I want ter go to the hotel , " said Dumps , as Dilsey came up rolling the wheelbarrow --  " me an ' my three little chil'en . " " Yes , marm , jes git in , " said Dilsey , and Dumps , with her wax baby and a rag doll for her little daughters , and a large cotton-stalk for her little boy , took a seat in the omnibus . Dilsey wheeled her up to the hotel , and Diddie met her at the door . " What is your name , madam ? " she inquired . " My name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' this is my little boy , an ' these is my little girls . " " Oh , Dumps , you play so cur'us , " said Diddie ; " who ever heard of anybody bein ' named Mrs. Dumps ? there ai n't no name like that . " " Well , I do n't know nothin ' else , " said Dumps ; " I could n't think of nothin ' . " " Sposin ' you be named Mrs. Washington , after General Washington ? " said Diddie , who was now studying a child 's history of America , and was very much interested in it . " All right , " said Dumps ; and Mrs. Washington , with her son and daughters , was assigned apartments , and Chris was sent up with refreshments , composed of pieces of old cotton-bolls and gray moss , served on bits of broken china . The omnibus now returned with Tot and her family , consisting of an India-rubber baby with a very cracked face , and a rag body that had once sported a china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was nicely dressed , and there were red shoes on the feet , and it answered Tot 's purpose very well . " Dese my ' itty dirls , " said Tot , as Diddie received her , " an ' I tome in de bumberbuss . " " What is your name ? " asked Diddie . " I name -- I name -- I name -- Miss Ginhouse , " said Tot , who had evidently never thought of a name , and had suddenly decided upon gin-house , as her eye fell upon that object . " No , no , Tot , that 's a thing ; that ai n't no name for folks , " said Diddie . " Let 's play you 're Mrs. Bunker Hill , that 's a nice name . " " Yes , I name Miss Unker Bill , " said the gentle little girl , who rarely objected to playing just as the others wished . Miss " Unker Bill " was shown to her room ; and now Riar came out , shaking her hand up and down , and saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all assembled around a table that Riar had improvised out of a piece of plank supported on two bricks , and which was temptingly set out with mud pies and cakes and green leaves , and just such delicacies as Riar and Diddie could pick up . As soon as Mrs. Washington laid eyes on the mud cakes and pies , she exclaimed , " Oh , Diddie , I 'm er goin ' ter be the cook , an ' make the pies an ' things . " " I doin ' ter be de took an ' make de itty mud takes , " said Miss Unker Bill , and the table at once became a scene of confusion . " No , Dumps , " said Diddie , " somebody 's got to be stoppin ' at the hotel , an ' I think the niggers ought to be the cooks . " " But I want ter make the mud cakes , " persisted Dumps , an ' Tot can be the folks at the hotel -- she and the doll-babies . " " No , I doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tot , and the hotel seemed in imminent danger of being closed for want of custom , when a happy thought struck Dilsey . " Lor-dy , chil'en ! I tell yer : le 's play Ole Billy is er gemman what writ ter Miss Diddie in er letter dat he was er comin ' ter de hotel , an ' ter git ready fur ' im gins he come . " " Yes , " said Diddie , " and lets play Dumps an ' Tot was two mo ' niggers I had ter bring up from the quarters to help cook ; an ' we 'll make out Ole Billy is some great general or somethin ' , an ' we 'll have ter make lots of cakes an ' puddin' 's for ' im . Oh , I know ; we 'll play he 's Lord Burgoyne . " All of the little folks were pleased at that idea , and Diddie immediately began to issue her orders . " You , Dumps , an ' Tot an ' Dilsey , an ' all of yer -- I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be here to-morrow , an ' I want you all to go right into the kitchen an ' make pies an ' cakes . " And so the whole party adjourned to a little ditch where mud and water were plentiful ( and which on that account had been selected as the kitchen ) , and began at once to prepare an elegant dinner . Dear me ! how busy the little housekeepers were ! and such beautiful pies they made , and lovely cakes all iced with white sand , and bits of grass laid around the edges for trimming ! and all the time laughing and chatting as gayly as could be . " Ai n't we havin ' fun ? " said Dumps , who , regardless of her nice clothes , was down on her knees in the ditch , with her sleeves rolled up , and her fat little arms muddy to the elbows ; " an ' ai n't you glad we slipped off , Diddie ? I tol ' yer there wa n't nothin ' goin ' to hurt us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Diddie ; " we would n't er had nobody to be Lord Burgoyne . " " Yes , " replied Dumps ; " an ' he ai n't behaved bad at all ; he ai n't butted nobody , an ' he ai n't runned after nobody to-day . " " ' Ook at de take , " interrupted Tot , holding up a mudball that she had moulded with her own little hands , and which she regarded with great pride . And now , the plank being as full as it would hold , they all returned to the hotel to arrange the table . But after the table was set the excitement was all over , for there was nobody to be the guest . " Ef Ole Billy wa n't so mean , " said Chris , " we could fotch ' im hyear in de omnibus . I wush we 'd a let Chubbum an ' Suppum come ; dey 'd er been Lord Bugon . " " I b'lieve Billy would let us haul ' im , " said Diddie , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's rael gentle now , an ' he 's quit buttin ' ; the only thing is , he 's so big we could n't get ' im in the wheelbarrer . " " Me ' n Chris kin put ' im in , " said Dilsey . " We kin lif ' im , ef dat 's all ; " and accordingly the omnibus was dispatched for Lord Burgoyne , who was quietly nibbling grass on the ditch bank at some little distance from the hotel . He raised his head as the children approached , and regarded them attentively . " Billy ! Billy ! po ' Ole Billy ! " soothingly murmured Diddie , who had accompanied Dilsey and Chris with the omnibus , as she had more influence over Old Billy than anybody else . He came now at once to her side , and rubbed his head gently against her ; and while she caressed him , Dilsey on one side and Chris on the other lifted him up to put him on the wheelbarrow . And now the scene changed . Lord Burgoyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye single to avenging this insult to his dignity , struggled from the arms of his captors , and , planting his head full in Diddie 's chest , turned her a somersault in the mud . Then , lowering his head and rushing at Chris , he butted her with such force that over she went headforemost into the ditch ! and now , spying Dilsey , who was running with all her might to gain the lumber-pile , he took after her , and catching up with her just as she reached the gin-house , placed his head in the middle of her back , and sent her sprawling on her face . Diddie and Chris had by this time regained their feet , both of them very muddy , and Chris with her face all scratched from the roots and briers in the ditch . Seeing Old Billy occupied with Dilsey , they started in a run for the lumber ; but the wily old sheep was on the lookout , and , taking after them full tilt , he soon landed them flat on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt from her eyes , preparatory to making a fresh start . Billy , however , seemed to have made up his mind that nobody had a right to stand up except himself , and , before the poor little darky could get out of his way , once more he had butted her down . Illustration : " OLE BILLY . " Diddie and Chris were more fortunate this time ; they were nearer the lumber than Dilsey , and , not losing a minute , they set out for the pile as soon as Old Billy 's back was turned , and made such good time that they both reached it , and Chris had climbed to the top before he saw them ; Diddie , however , was only half-way up , so he made a run at her , and butted her feet from under her , and threw her back to the ground . This time he hurt her very much , for her head struck against the lumber , and it cut a gash in her forehead and made the blood come . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , though they , with Riar , were safely ensconced on top of the lumber , out of all danger . Diddie , too , was crying bitterly ; and as soon as Billy ran back to butt at Dilsey , Chris and Riar caught hold of her hands and drew her up on the pile . Poor little Dilsey was now in a very sad predicament . Billy , seeing that the other children were out of his reach , devoted his entire time and attention to her , and her only safety was in lying flat on the ground . If she so much as lifted her head to reconnoitre , he would plant a full blow upon it . The children were at their wits ' end . It was long past their dinner-time , and they were getting hungry ; their clothes were all muddy , and Diddie 's dress almost torn off of her ; the blood was trickling down from the gash in her forehead , and Chris was all scratched and dirty , and her eyes smarted from the sand in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on top of the lumber , while Old Billy stood guard over Dilsey , but with one eye on the pile , ready to make a dash at anybody who should be foolish enough to venture down . " I tol ' yer not to let ' im come , " sobbed Dumps , " an ' now I spec ' we 'll hafter stay here all night , an ' not have no supper nor nothin ' . " " I did n't let ' im come , " replied Diddie ; " he come himself , an ' ef you had n't made us run away fum Mammy , we would n't er happened to all this trouble . " " I never made yer , " retorted Dumps , " you come jes ez much ez anybody ; an ' ef it had n't er been fur you , Ole Billy would er stayed at home . You 're all time pettin ' ' im an ' feedin ' ' im -- hateful old thing -- tell he thinks he 's got ter go ev'ywhere we go . You ought ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd think myse'f too good ter be always er ' soshatin ' with sheeps . " " You 're mighty fond of ' im sometimes , " said Diddie , " an ' you was mighty glad he was here jes now , to be Lord Burgoyne : he 's jes doin ' this fur fun ; an ' ef Chris was my nigger , I 'd make her git down an ' drive ' im away . " Chris belonged to Dumps , and Mammy had taught the children never to give orders to each other 's maids , unless with full permission of the owner . " I ai n't gwine hab nuf'n ter do wid ' im , " said Chris . " Yes you are , Chris , " replied Dumps , who had eagerly caught at Diddie 's suggestion of having him driven away . " Get down this minute , an ' drive ' im off ; ef yer do n't , I 'll tell Mammy you would n't min ' me . " " Mammy 'll hatter whup me , den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes for disobedience to their mistresses ) ; " she 'll hatter whup me , caze I ai n't gwine ter hab nuf'n tall ter do wid dat sheep ; I ai n't gwine ter meddle long ' im , hab ' im buttin ' me in de ditch . " " Riar , you go , " said Diddie ; " he ai n't butted you yet . " " He ai n't gwine ter , nuther , " said Riar , " caze I gwine ter stay up hyear long o ' Miss Tot , like Mammy tell me . I ' longs to her , an ' I gwine stay wid ' er myse'f , an ' nuss ' er jes like Mammy say . " It was now almost dark , and Old Billy showed no signs of weariness ; his vigilance was unabated , and the children were very miserable , when they heard the welcome sound of Mammy 's voice calling " Chil'en ! O-o-o-o , chil-en ! " " Ma-a-a-m ! " answered all of the little folks at once . " Whar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber-pile , " answered the children ; and soon Mammy appeared coming through the woods . She had missed the children at snack-time , and had been down to the quarters , and , in fact , all over the place , hunting for them . The children were delighted to see her now , and so , indeed , seemed Old Billy , for , quitting his position at Dilsey 's head , he set out at his best speed for Mammy , and Dilsey immediately jumped to her feet , and was soon on the lumber with her companions . " Now yer gwuf fum yer , gwuf fum yer ! " said Mammy , furiously waving a cotton-stalk at Old Billy . " Gwuf fum yer , I tell you ! I ai n't bodern ' you . I jes come fur de chil'en , an ' yer bet not fool ' long er me , yer low-life sheep . " But Old Billy , not caring a fig for Mammy 's dignity or importance , planted his head in her breast , and over the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammy dearly , set up a yell , and Mammy , still waving the cotton-stalk , attempted to rise , but Billy was ready for her , and , with a well-aimed blow , sent her back to the earth . " Now yer stop dat , " said Mammy . " I do n't want ter fool wid yer ; I lay I 'll bus ' yer head open mun , ef I git er good lick at yer ; yer better gwuf fum yer ! " But Billy , being master of the situation , stood his ground , and I dare say Mammy would have been lying there yet , but fortunately Uncle Sambo and Bill , the wagoners , came along the big road , and , hearing the children 's cries , they came upon the scene of action , and , taking their whips to Old Billy , soon drove him away . " Mammy , we wo n't never run away any more , " said Diddie , as Mammy came up ; " ' t was Dumps 's fault , anyhow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yer , " said Mammy ; " yer 'd no business at dis gin-house long o ' dat sheep , an ' I won'er what you kinky-head niggers is fur , ef yer ca n't keep de chil'en in de yard : come yer ter me ! " And , picking up a cotton-stalk , she gave each of the little darkies a sound whipping . The children were more fortunate . Mamma lectured them on the sin of running away from Mammy ; but she put a piece of court-plaster on Diddie 's head , and kissed all of the dirty little faces , much to Mammy 's disgust , who grumbled a good deal because they were not punished , saying , " Missis is er spilin ' dese chil'en , let'n uv ' em cut up all kind er capers . Yer all better hyear me , mun . Yer better quit dem ways yer got , er runnin ' off an ' er gwine in de mud , an ' er gittin ' yer cloes tor 'd , an ' er gittin ' me butted wid sheeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ef yer do n't , de deb'l gwine git yer , sho 's yer born . " But , notwithstanding her remarks , the little girls had a nice hot supper , and went to bed quite happy , while Mammy seated herself in her rocking-chair , and entertained Aunt Milly for some time with the children 's evil doings and their mother 's leniency . CHAPTER V. DIDDIE 'S BOOK . One morning Diddie came into the nursery with a big blank-book and a lead-pencil in her hand . " What 's that , Diddie ? " asked Dumps , leaving her paper dolls on the floor where she had been playing with Chris , and coming to her sister 's side . " Now do n't you bother me , Dumps , " said Diddie ; " I 'm goin ' to write a book . " " Are you ? " said Dumps , her eyes opening wide in astonishment . " Who 's goin ' ter tell yer what ter say ? " " I 'm goin ' ter make it up out o ' my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys and ladies . " " I would n't have no boys in it , " said Dumps ; " they 're always so hateful : there 's Cousin Frank broke up my tea-set , an ' Johnnie Miller tied er string so tight roun ' Cherubim 's neck till hit nyearly choked ' im . Ef I was writin ' er book , I would n't have no boys in it . " " There 's boun ' ter be boys in it , Dumps ; you ca n't write a book without'n boys ; " and Diddie seated herself , and opened the book before her , while Dumps , with her elbows on the table and face in her hands , looked on anxiously . " I 'm not goin ' ter write jes one straight book , " said Diddie ; " I 'm goin ' ter have little short stories , an ' little pieces of poetry , an ' all kin ' of things ; an ' I 'll name one of the stories ' Nettie Herbert : ' do n't you think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' beautiful , " replied Dumps ; and Diddie wrote the name at the beginning of the book . " Do n't you think two pages on this big paper will be long enough for one story ? " asked Diddie . " Plenty , " answered Dumps . So at the bottom of the second page Diddie wrote " The END of Nettie Herbert . " " Now , what would you name the second story ? " asked Diddie , biting her pencil thoughtfully . " I 'd name it ' The Bad Little Girl , ' " answered Dumps . " Yes , that will do , " said Diddie , and she wrote " The Bad Little Girl " at the top of the third page ; and , allowing two pages for the story , she wrote " The END of The Bad Little Girl " at the bottom of the next page . " And now it 's time for some poetry , " said Diddie , and she wrote " Poetry " at the top of the fifth page , and so on until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and poetry . She had three stories --  " Nettie Herbert , " " The Bad Little Girl , " and " Annie 's Visit to her Grandma . " She had one place for poetry , and two places she had marked " History ; " for , as she told Dumps , she was n't going to write anything unless it was useful ; she was n't going to write just trash . The titles being all decided upon , Dumps and Chris went back to their dolls , and Diddie began to write her first story . " Nettie Herbert . " " Nettie Herbert was a poor little girl ; " and then she stopped and asked , " Dumps , would you have Nettie Herbert a po ' little girl ? " " No , I would n't have nobody er po ' little girl , " said Dumps , conclusively , and Diddie drew a line through what she had written , and began again . " Nettie Herbert was a rich little girl , and she lived with her pa and ma in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father give her a gold dollar , and she went down town , and bort a grate big wax doll with open and shet eyes , and a little cooking stove with pots and kittles , and a wuck box , and lots uv pieces uv clorf to make doll cloes , and a bu-te-ful gold ring , and a lockit with her pas hare in it , and a big box full uv all kinds uv candy and nuts and razens and ornges and things , and a little git-ar to play chunes on , and two little tubs and some little iuns to wash her doll cloes with ; then she bort a little wheelbarrer , and put all the things in it , and started fur home . When she was going a long , presently she herd sumbody cryin and jes a sobbin himself most to deaf ; and t was a poor little boy all barefooted and jes as hungry as he could be ; and he said his ma was sick , and his pa was dead , and he had nine little sisters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthful to eat in two weeks , and no place to sleep , nor nuthin ' . So Nettie went to a doctors house , and told him she would give him the gold ring fur some fyssick fur the little boys muther ; and the doctor give her some castor-oil and parrygorick , and then she went on tell they got to the house , and Nettie give her the fyssick , and some candy to take the taste out of her mouth , and it done her lots uv good ; and she give all her nuts and candy to the poor little chillen . And she went back to the man what sold her the things , and told him all about it ; and he took back all the little stoves and tubs and iuns and things she had bort , and give her the money , and she carried it strait to the poor woman , and told her to buy some bread and cloes for her chillen . The poor woman thanked her very much , and Nettie told em good-by , and started fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come here a little minute , Dumps ; I want you to help me wind up this tale . " Then , after reading it aloud , she said , " You see , I 've only got six mo ' lines of paper , an ' I have n't got room to tell all that happened to her , an ' what become of her . How would you wind up , if you were me ? " " I b'lieve I 'd say , she furgive her sisters , an ' married the prince , an ' lived happy ever afterwards , like ' Cinderilla an ' the Little Glass Slipper . ' " " Oh , Dumps , you 're such er little goose ; that kind of endin ' would n't suit my story at all , " said Diddie ; " but I 'll have to wind up somehow , for all the little girls who read the book will want to know what become of her , an ' there 's only six lines to wind up in ; an ' she 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ; besides , there ai n't any prince in Nu Orlins . No , somethin ' will have to happen to her . I tell you , I b'lieve I 'll make a runaway horse run over her goin ' home . " " Oh , no , Diddie , please do n't , " entreated Dumps ; " po ' little Nettie , do n't make the horse run over her . " " I 'm obliged to , Dumps ; you must n't be so tender-hearted ; she 's got ter be wound up somehow , an ' I might let the Injuns scalp her , or the bears eat her up , an ' I 'm sure that 's a heap worse than jes er horse runnin ' over her ; an ' then you know she ai n't no sho ' nuff little girl ; she 's only made up out of my head . " " I do n't care , I do n't want the horse to run over her . I think it 's bad enough to make her give ' way all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wheelbarrers , without lettin ' the horses run over her ; an ' ef that 's the way you 're goin ' ter do , I sha' n't have nuthin ' ' tall ter do with it . " And Dumps , having thus washed her hands of the whole affair , went back to her dolls , and Diddie resumed her writing : " As she was agoin along , presently she herd sumthin cumin book-er-ty-book , book-er-ty-book , and there was a big horse and a buggy cum tearin down the road , and she ran jes hard as she could ; but befo she could git out er the way , the horse ran rite over her , and killed her , and all the people took her up and carried her home , and put flowers all on her , and buried her at the church , and played the organ ' bout her ; and that 's " The END of Nettie Herbert . " " Oh , dear me ! " she sighed , when she had finished , " I am tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ' bout the ' Bad Little Girl , ' an ' I 'll write it down jes like you tell me . " " All right , " assented Dumps , once more leaving her dolls , and coming to the table . Then , after thinking for a moment , she began , with great earnestness : " Once pun er time there was er bad little girl , an ' she would n't min ' nobody , nor do no way nobody wanted her to ; and when her mother went ter give her fyssick , you jes ought ter seen her cuttin ' up ! she skweeled , an ' she holler 'd , an ' she kicked , an ' she jes done ev'y bad way she could ; an ' one time when she was er goin ' on like that the spoon slipped down her throat , an ' choked her plum ter death ; an ' not long after that , when she was er playin ' one day --  " " Oh , but , Dumps , " interrupted Diddie , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuver said nuthin ' ' bout her bein ' dead , " replied Dumps ; " an ' ef you wrote down that she 's dead , then you wrote a story , ' cause she 's livin ' as anybody . " " You said the spoon choked her to death , " said Diddie . " Well , hit nuver killed her , anyhow , " said Dumps ; " hit jes only give her spasums ; an ' now you 've gone and put me all out ; what was I sayin ' ? " " When she was er playin ' one day , " prompted Diddie . " Oh yes , " continued Dumps , " when she was er playin ' one day on the side uv the creek with her little sister , she got ter fightin ' an ' pinchin ' an ' scrougin ' , an ' the fus thing she knowed , she fell kersplash in the creek , and got drownded . An ' one time her mammy tol ' ' er not nuber ter clim ' up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but clum right upon the fender ter git an apple off'n the mantel-piece ; an ' the fender turned over , an ' she fell in the fire an ' burnt all up . An ' another time , jes er week after that , she was er foolin ' ' long --  " " Dumps , what are you talkin ' ' bout ? " again interrupted Diddie . " She could n't be er foolin ' long o ' nothin ' ef she 's dead . " " But she ai n't dead , Diddie , " persisted Dumps . " Well , you said the fire burned her up , " retorted Diddie . " I do n't care ef hit did , " said Dumps ; " she nuver died bout hit ; an ' ef you 're goin ' ter keep sayin ' she 's dead , then I sha' n't tell yer no mo ' . " " Go on , then , " said Diddie , " and I wo n't bother you . " " Well , one time , " continued Dumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' cow , what she had no business , the cow run his horns right through her neck , an ' throwed her way-ay-ay up yon'er ; an ' she nuver come down no mo ' , an ' that 's all . " " But , Dumps , what become of her ? " asked Diddie . " I du n no what become uv her , " said Dumps . " She went ter hebn , I reckon . " " But she could n't go ter hebn ef she 's so bad , " said Diddie ; " the angel would n't let her come in . " " The cow throwed her in , " said Dumps , " an ' the angel wa n't er lookin ' , an ' he nuver knowed nuthin ' ' bout it . " " That 's er mighty funny story , " said Diddie ; " but I 'll let it stay in the book -- only you ai n't finished it , Dumps , Hyear 's fo ' mo ' lines of paper ai n't written yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Diddie , after considering awhile , said she thought it would be very nice to wind it up with a piece of poetry . Dumps was delighted at that suggestion , and the little girls puzzled their brains for rhymes . After thinking for some time , Diddie wrote , " Once ' t was a little girl , and she was so bad , " and read it aloud ; then said , " Now , Dumps , sposin ' you make up the nex ' line . " Dumps buried her face in her hands , and remained in deep study for a few moments , and presently said , " And now she is dead , an ' I am so glad . " " Oh , Dumps , that 's too wicked , " said Diddie . " You must n't never be glad when anybody 's dead ; that 's too wicked a poetry ; I sha' n't write it in the book . " " Well , I nuver knowed nuthin ' else , " said Dumps . " I could n't hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my might ; and I 'm tired of writin poetry , anyhow ; you make it up all by yoursef . " Diddie , with her brows drawn together in a frown , and her eyes tight shut , chewed the end of her pencil , and , after a few moments , said , " Dumps , do you min ' ef the cow was to run his horns through her forrid stid of her neck ? " " No , hit do n't make no diffrence to me , " replied Dumps . " Well , then , " said Diddie , " ef ' t was her forrid , I kin fix it . " So , after a little more study and thought , Diddie wound up the story thus : " Once ' t was er little girl , so wicked and horrid , Till the cow run his horns right slap through her forrid , And throwed her to hebn all full of her sin , And , the gate bein open , he pitched her right in . " And that was " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's jes one mo ' tale , " said Diddie , " and that 's about ' Annie 's Visit , ' an ' I 'm tired of makin ' up books ; Chris , ca n't you make up that ? " " I du n no hit , " said Chris , " but I kin tell yer ' bout'n de tar baby , ef dat 'll do . " " Do n't you think that 'll do jes as well , Dumps ? " asked Diddie . " Certingly ! " replied Dumps . So Diddie drew her pencil through " Annie 's Visit , " and wrote in its place , " The Tar Baby , " and Chris began : " Once pun a time , ' twuz er ole Rabbit an ' er ole Fox and er ole Coon : an ' dey all lived close togedder ; an ' de ole Fox he had him er mighty fine goober-patch , w'at he nuber ' low nobody ter tech ; an ' one mornin ' atter he git up , an ' wuz er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks , an ' he foller de tracks , an ' he see whar sumbody ben er grabbin ' uv his goobers . An ' ev'y day he see de same thing ; an ' he watch , an ' he watch , an ' he could n't nuber cotch nobody ! an ' he went , he did , ter de Coon , and he sez , sezee , ' Brer Coon , dar 's sumbody stealin ' uv my goobers .

" The children were mightily pleased with this story ; and Diddie , after carefully writing underneath it , " The END of The Tar Baby , " said she could write the poetry and history part some other day ; so she closed the book , and gave it to Mammy to put away for her , and she and Dumps went out for a ride on Corbin . CHAPTER VI . UNCLE SNAKE-BIT BOB 'S SUNDAY-SCHOOL . There was no more faithful slave in all the Southland than old Uncle Snake-bit Bob . He had been bitten by a rattlesnake when he was a boy , and the limb had to be amputated , and its place was supplied with a wooden peg . There were three or four other " Bobs " on the plantation , and he was called Snake-bit to distinguish him . Though lame , and sick a good deal of his time , his life had not been wasted , nor had he been a useless slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used in the cotton-picking season , and had learned to mend shoes ; besides that , he was the great horse-doctor of the neighborhood , and not only cured his master 's horses and mules , but was sent for for miles around to see the sick stock ; and then , too , he could re-bottom chairs , and make buckets and tubs and brooms ; and all of the money he made was his own : so the old man had quite a little store of gold and silver sewed up in an old bag and buried somewhere -- nobody knew where except himself ; for Uncle Snake-bit Bob had never married , and had no family ties ; and , furthermore , he was old Granny Rachel 's only child , and Granny had died long , long ago , ever since the children 's mother was a baby , and he had no brothers or sisters . So , having no cause to spend his money , he had laid it up until now he was a miser , and would steal out by himself at night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great delight . But he was a very good old man ; as Mammy used to say , " he wuz de piuses man dar wuz on de place ; " and he had for years led in " de pra'r-meetin 's , and called up de mo'ners . " One evening , as he sat on a hog-pen talking to Uncle Daniel , who was a preacher , they began to speak of the wickedness among the young negroes on the plantation . " Pyears ter me , " said Uncle Bob , " ez ef dem niggers done furgot dey got ter die ; dey jes er dancin ' an ' er cavortin ' ev'y night , an ' dey 'll git lef ' , mun , wheneber dat angel blow his horn . I tell you what I ben er stud'n , Brer Dan'l . I ben er stud'n dat what 's de matter wid deze niggers is , dat de chil'en ai n't riz right . Yer know de Book hit sez ef yer raise de chil'en , like yer want ' em ter go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an ' , sar , ef de Lord spars me tell nex ' Sunday , I ' low ter ax marster ter lemme teach er Sunday-school in de gin-house fur de chil'en . " Major Waldron heartily consented to Uncle Bob 's proposition , and had the gin-house all swept out for him , and had the carpenter to make him some rough benches . And when the next Sunday evening came around , all of the little darkies , with their heads combed and their Sunday clothes on , assembled for the Sunday-school . The white children begged so hard to go too , that finally Mammy consented to take them . So when Uncle Snake-bit Bob walked into the gin-house , their eager little faces were among those of his pupils . " Now , you all sot down , " said Uncle Bob , " an ' ' have yerse'fs till I fix yer in er line . " Having arranged them to his satisfaction , he delivered to them a short address , setting forth the object of the meeting , and his intentions concerning them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fotch yer hyear dis ebenin fur ter raise yer like yer ought ter be riz . De folks deze days is er gwine ter strucshun er dancin ' an ' er pickin ' uv banjers an ' er singin ' uv reel chunes an ' er cuttin ' up uv ev'y kin ' er dev'lment . I ben er watchin ' ' em ; an ' , min ' yer , when de horn hit soun ' fur de jes ' ter rise , half de niggers gwine ter be wid de onjes ' . An ' I ' low ter myse'f dat I wuz gwine ter try ter save de chil'en . I gwine ter pray fur yer , I gwine ter struc yer , an ' I gwine do my bes ' ter lan ' yer in hebn . Now yer jes pay tenshun ter de strucshun I gwine give yer -- dat 's all I ax uv yer -- an ' me an ' de Lord we gwine do de res ' . " After this exhortation , the old man began at the top of the line , and asked " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you ? " " I dun no , sar , " answered Gus , very untruthfully , for Aunt Nancy had told him repeatedly . " God made yer , " said Uncle Bob . " Now , who made yer ? " " God , " answered Gus . " Dat 's right , " said the old man ; then proceeded to " Jim , " the next in order . " What 'd he make yer outn ? " demanded the teacher . " I du n no , sar , " answered Jim , with as little regard for truth as Gus had shown . " He made yer out'n dut , " said Uncle Bob . " Now , what 'd he make yer out'n ? " " Dut , " answered Jim , promptly , and the old man passed on to the next . " What 'd he make yer fur ? " Again the answer was , " I du n no , sar ; " and the old man , after scratching his head and reflecting a moment , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which the child repeated after him . " Who wuz de fus man ? " was his next question ; and the little nig professing ignorance , as usual , the old man replied , " Marse Adum . " And so he went all down the line , explaining that " Marse Cain kilt his brudder ; " that " Marse Abel wuz de fus man slewed ; " that " Marse Noah built de ark ; " that " Marse Thuselum wuz de oldes ' man , " and so on , until he reached the end of the line , and had almost exhausted his store of information . Then , thinking to see how much the children remembered , he began at the top of the line once more , and asked the child , " Who made yer ? " " Dut , " answered the little negro . " Who ? " demanded Uncle Bob , in astonishment . " Dut , " replied the child . " Didn ' I tell yer God made yer ? " asked the old man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat'n wat God made done slip out de do ' . " And so it was . As soon as Uncle Bob 's back was turned , Gus , who had wearied of the Sunday-school , slipped out , and the old man had not noticed the change . The confusion resulting from this trifling circumstance was fearful . " Dut " made the first child . The question , " What did he make yer fur ? " was promptly answered , " Marse Adum . " " Eve wuz de fus man . " " Marse Cain wuz de fus ' oman . " " Marse Abel kilt his brudder . " " Marse Noah wuz de fus one slewed . " " Marse Thuselum built de ark . " And so on , until the old man had to begin all over again , and give each one a new answer . The catechising through with , Uncle Bob said : " Now , chil'en , I gwine splain de Scripchurs ter yer .

O bless us , Lord ! O bless us mo ' an ' mo ' ; Unless yer 'll come an ' bless us , Lord , We will not let yer go . " My marster , Lord ; my marster , Lord --  O Lord , he does his bes ' , So when yer savin ' sinners , Lord , Save him wid all de res ' . O bless us , Lord ! O bless us , Lord !

" called Dilsey , running into the nursery one morning in a great state of excitement ; then , seeing that Diddie was not there , she stopped short , and demanded , " Whar Miss Diddie ? " " She 's sayin ' her lessons , " answered Dumps . " What do you want with her ? " " De specerlaters is come , " said Dilsey ; " dey 's right down yon'er on de crick banks back er de quarters . " In an instant Dumps and Tot had abandoned their dolls , and Chris and Riar had thrown aside their quilt-pieces ( for Aunt Milly was teaching them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room when Mammy entered . " Whar yer gwine ? " asked Mammy . " Oh , Mammy , de specerlaters is come , " said Dumps , " an ' we 're goin ' down to the creek to see ' um . " " No yer ai n't , nuther , " said Mammy . " Yer ai n't er gwine er nyear dem specerlaters , er cotchin ' uv measles an ' hookin ' - coffs an ' sich , fum dem niggers . Yer ai n't gwine er nyear ' um ; an ' yer jes ez well fur ter tuck off dem bunnits , an ' ter set yerse'fs right back on de flo ' an ' go ter playin ' . An ' efn you little niggers do n't tuck up dem quilt-pieces an ' go ter patchin ' uv ' em , I lay I 'll hu't yer , mun ! Who dat tell deze chil'en ' bout de specerlaters ? " " Hit uz Dilsey , " answered Chris and Riar in a breath ; and Mammy , giving Dilsey a sharp slap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyear ergin wid all kin ' er news , an ' I bet yer 'll be sorry fur it . Yer know better'n dat . Yer know deze chil'en ai n't got no bizness ' long o ' specerlaters . " In the meanwhile Dumps and Tot were crying over their disappointment . " Yer mean old thing ! " sobbed Dumps . " I ai n't goin ' ter min ' yer , nuther ; an ' I sha' n't nuver go ter sleep no mo ' , an ' let yer go to prayer-meetin 's ; jes all time botherin ' me , an ' wo n't lemme see de specerlaters , nor nothin ' . " " Jes lis'en how yer talkin ' , " said Mammy , " givin ' me all dat sass . You 're de sassies ' chile marster 's got . Nobody ca n't nuver larn yer no manners , aller er sassin ole pussons . Jes keep on , an ' yer 'll see wat 'll happen ter yer ; yer 'll wake up some er deze mornins , an ' yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed er little gal once wat sassed her mudder , an ' de Lord he sent er angel in de night , he did , an ' struck her plum ' bald-headed . " " You ai n't none o ' my mother , " replied Dumps . " You 're mos ' black ez my shoes ; an ' de Lord ai n't er goin ' ter pull all my hair off jes ' boutn you . " " I gwine right down-sta'rs an ' tell yer ma , " said Mammy . " She do n't ' low none o ' you chil'en fur ter sass me , an ' ter call me brack ; she nuver done it herse'f , wen she wuz little . I'se got ter be treated wid ' spec myse'f ; ef I do n't , den hit 's time fur me ter quit min'en chil'en : I gwine tell yer ma . " And Mammy left the room in high dudgeon , but presently came back , and said Dumps was to go to her mother at once . " What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she came slowly down-stairs , crying bitterly , and met him in the hall . " Mammy 's ben er sa-a-as-sin me , " sobbed Dumps ; " an ' she sa-aid de Lord wuz goin ' ter sen ' an angel fur ter git my ha-air , an ' she wo n't lem'me go-o-o ter see de spec-ec-ec-erlaters . " " Well , come in mamma 's room , " said her father , " and we 'll talk it all over . " And the upshot of the matter was that Major Waldron said he would himself take the children to the speculator 's camp ; and accordingly , as soon as dinner was over , they all started off in high glee -- the three little girls and the three little negroes -- leaving Mammy standing at the top of the stairs , muttering to herself , " Er catchin ' uv de measles an ' de hookin ' - coffs . " The speculator 's camp was situated on the bank of the creek , and a very bright scene it presented as Major Waldron and his party came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encampment was the speculator 's tent , and the tents for the negroes were dotted here and there among the trees . Some of the women were washing at the creek , others were cooking , and some were sitting in front of their tents sewing ; numbers of little negroes were playing about , and , altogether , the " speculator 's camp " was not the horrible thing that one might suppose . The speculator , who was a jolly-looking man weighing over two hundred pounds , came forward to meet Major Waldron and show him over the encampment . The negroes were well clothed , well fed , and the great majority of them looked exceedingly happy . They came across one group of boys and girls dancing and singing . An old man , in another group , had collected a number of eager listeners around him , and was recounting some marvellous tale ; but occasionally there would be a sad face and a tearful eye , and Mr. Waldron sighed as he passed these , knowing that they were probably grieving over the home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tents , the speculator said , " There is a sick yellow woman in there , that I bought in Maryland . She had to be sold in the settlement of an estate , and she has fretted herself almost to death ; she is in such bad health now that I doubt if anybody will buy her , though she has a very likely little boy about two years old . " Mr. Waldron expressed a wish to see the woman , and they went in . Lying on a very comfortable bed was a woman nearly white ; her eyes were deep-sunken in her head , and she was painfully thin . Mr. Waldron took her hand in his , and looked into her sad eyes . " Do you feel much pain ? " he asked , tenderly . " Yes , sir , " answered the woman , " I suffer a great deal ; and I am so unhappy , sir , about my baby ; I ca n't live long , and what will become of him ? If I only had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I die , where I could beg and entreat the people to be kind to him and take care of him ! ' T is that keeps me sick , sir . " By this time Diddie 's eyes were swimming in tears , and Dumps was sobbing aloud ; seeing which , Tot began to cry too , though she had n't the slightest idea what was the matter ; and Diddie , going to the side of the bed , smoothed the woman 's long black hair , and said , " We 'll take you home with us , an ' we 'll be good to your little boy , me an ' Dumps an ' Tot , an ' I 'll give ' im some of my marbles . " " An ' my little painted wagin , " put in Dumps . " An ' you shall live with us always , " continued Diddie ; " an ' Mammy 'll put yer feet into hot water , an ' rub turkentine on yer ches ' , an ' give yer ' fermifuge ' ev'y mornin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa , sha' n't she go home with us ? " Major Waldron 's own eyes moistened as he answered , " We will see about it , my daughter ; " and , telling the woman , whose name was Ann , that he would see her again , he left the tent , and presently the camp . That night , after the little folks were asleep , Major Waldron and his wife had a long talk about the sick woman and her little boy , and it was decided between them that Major Waldron should go the next morning and purchase them both . The children were delighted when they knew of this decision , and took an active part in preparing one room of the laundry for Ann 's reception . Their mother had a plain bedstead moved in , and sent down from the house a bed and mattress , which she supplied with sheets , pillows , blankets , and a quilt . Then Uncle Nathan , the carpenter , took a large wooden box and put shelves in it , and tacked some bright-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three chairs were spared from the nursery , and Diddie put some of her toys on the mantel-piece for the baby ; and then , when they had brought in a little square table and covered it with a neat white cloth , and placed upon it a mug of flowers , and when Uncle Nathan had put up some shelves in one corner of the room , and driven some pegs to hang clothes on , they pronounced the room all ready . And Ann , who had lived for several months in the camp , was delighted with her new home and the preparations that her little mistresses had made for her . The baby , too , laughed and clapped his hands over the toys the children gave him . His name was Henry , and a very pretty child he was . He was almost as white as Tot , and his black hair curled in ringlets all over his head ; but , strange to say , neither he nor his mother gained favor with the negroes on the place . Mammy said openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers , " and that " marster sholy had niggers ' nuff fur ter wait on ' im doutn buyen ' em . " But , for all that , Ann and her little boy were quite happy . She was still sick , and could never be well , for she had consumption ; though she got much better , and could walk about the yard , and sit in front of her door with Henry in her lap . Her devotion to her baby was unusual in a slave ; she could not bear to have him out of her sight , and never seemed happy unless he was playing around her or nestling in her arms . Mrs. Waldron , of course , never exacted any work of Ann . They had bought her simply to give her a home and take care of her , and faithfully that duty was performed . Her meals were carried from the table , and she had every attention paid to her comfort . One bright evening , when she was feeling better than usual , she went out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stopped to look at his baskets , and to let little Henry pick up some white-oak splits that he seemed to have set his heart on . The old man , like all the other negroes , was indignant that his master should have purchased her ; for they all prided themselves on being inherited , and " did n't want no bought folks " among them . He had never seen her , and now would scarcely look at or speak to her . " You weave these very nicely , " said Ann , examining one of his baskets . Uncle Bob looked up , and , seeing she was pale and thin , offered her a seat , which she accepted . " Is this always your work ? " asked Ann , by way of opening a conversation with the old man . " In cose ' t is , " he replied ; " who dat gwine ter make de baskits les'n hit 's me ? I done make baskits ' fo mistiss wuz born ; I usen ter ' long ter her pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are certainly very fortunate , " answered Ann , " for the slave that has never been on the block can never know the full bitterness of slavery . " " Wy , yer talkin ' same as wite folks , " said Uncle Bob . " Whar yer git all dem fine talkin 's fum ? ai n't you er nigger same ez me ? " " Yes , I am a negress , Uncle Bob ; or , rather , my mother was a slave , and I was born in slavery ; but I have had the misfortune to have been educated . " " Kin yer read in de book ? " asked the old man earnestly . " Oh yes , as well as anybody . " " Who showed yer ? " asked Uncle Bob . " My mistress had me taught ; but , if it wo n't bother you , I 'll just tell you all about it , for I want to get your interest , Uncle Bob , and gain your love , if I can -- yours , and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , and I want to make friends , so they will be kind to my baby . Shall I tell you my story ? " The old man nodded his head , and went on with his work , while Ann related to him the sad history of her life . " My mother , who was a favorite slave , died when I was born ; and my mistress , who had a young baby only a few days older than myself , took me to nurse . I slept , during my infancy , in the cradle with my little mistress , and afterwards in the room with her , and thus we grew up as playmates and companions until we reached our seventh year , when we both had scarlet fever . My little mistress , who was the only child of a widow , died ; and her mother , bending over her death-bed , cried , ' I will have no little daughter now ! ' when the child placed her arms about her and said , ' Mamma , let Ann be your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to her mamma , and she 'll stay with my mamma . ' " And from that time I was no more a slave , but a child in the house . My mistress brought a governess for me from the North , and I was taught as white girls are . I was fond of my books , and my life was a very happy one , though we lived on a lonely plantation , and had but little company . " I was almost white , as you see , and my mistress had taught me to call her mamma . I was devoted to her , and very fond of my governess , and they both petted me as if I really had been a daughter instead of a slave . Four years ago the brother of my governess came out from Vermont to make his sister a visit at our home . He fell in love with me , and I loved him dearly , and , accompanied by my ' mamma ' and his sister , we went into Pennsylvania , and were married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is a Slave State , and I was a slave . My mistress had , of course , always intended that I should be free , but neglected from time to time to draw up the proper papers . " For two years after my marriage my husband and I lived on the plantation , he managing the estate until he was called to Washington on business , and , in returning , the train was thrown down an embankment , and he was among the killed . " Soon after that my baby was born , and before he was six months old my mistress died suddenly , when it was found that the estate was insolvent , and everything must be sold to pay the debts ; and I and my baby , with the other goods and chattels , were put up for sale . Mr. Martin , the speculator , bought me , thinking I would bring a fancy price ; but my heart was broken , and I grieved until my health gave way , so that nobody ever wanted me , until your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in . But oh , Uncle Bob , " she continued , bursting into tears , " to think my boy , my baby , must be a slave ! His father 's relatives are poor . He had only a widowed mother and two sisters . They are not able to buy my child , and he must be raised in ignorance , to do another 's bidding all his life , my poor little baby ! His dear father hated slavery , and it seems so hard that his son must be a slave ! " " Now do n't yer take on like dat , er makin ' uv yerse'f sick , " said Uncle Bob ; " I know wat I gwine do ; my min ' hit 's made up ; hit 's true , I 'm brack , but den my min ' hit 's made up . Now you go on back ter de house , outn dis damp a'r , an ' tuck cyar er yerse'f , an ' do n't yer be er frettin ' , nuther , caze my marster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' den , ' sides dat , my min ' hit 's made up . Hyear , honey , " addressing the child , " take deze hyear wite-oak splits an ' go'n make yer er baskit ' long o ' yer ma . " Illustration : " MY MIN ' HIT 'S MADE UP . " Ann and her baby returned to the house , but Uncle Snake-bit Bob , long after the sun went down , still sat on his little bench in front of his shop , his elbows on his knees , and his face buried in his hands ; and when it grew quite dark he rose , and put away his splits and his baskets , saying to himself , " Well , I know wat I 'm gwine do ; my min ' , hit 's made up . " CHAPTER VIII . UNCLE BOB 'S PROPOSITION . The night after Ann 's interview with Uncle Bob , Major Waldron was sitting in his library overlooking some papers , when some one knocked at the door , and , in response to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ebenin ' ter yer , marster , " said the old man , scraping his foot and bowing his head . " How are you , Uncle Bob ? " responded his master . " I 'm jes po'ly , thank God , " replied Uncle Bob , in the answer invariably given by Southern slaves to the query " How are you ? " No matter if they were fat as seals , and had never had a day 's sickness in their lives , the answer was always the same --  " I 'm po'ly , thank God . " " Well , Uncle Bob , what is it now ? " asked Major Waldron . " The little negroes been bothering your splits again ? " " Dey 's all de time at dat , marster , an ' dey gwine git hu't , mun , ef dey fool long o ' me ; but den dat ai n't wat I come fur dis time . I come fur ter hab er talk wid yer , sar , ef yer kin spar de ole nigger de time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob ; take a seat , then , if we are to have a talk ; " and Major Waldron lit his cigar , and leaned back , while Uncle Bob seated himself on a low chair , and said : " Marster , I come ter ax yer wat 'll yer take fur dat little boy yer bought fum de specerlaters ? " " Ann 's little boy ? " asked his master ; " why , I would not sell him at all . I only bought him because his mother was dying of exposure and fatigue , and I wanted to relieve her mind of anxiety on his account . I would certainly never sell her child away from her . " " Yes , sar , dat 's so , " replied the old man ; " but den my min ' , hit 's made up . I 've laid me up er little money fum time ter time , wen I 'd be er doct'in ' uv hosses an ' mules an ' men'in ' cheers , an ' all sich ez dat ; de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erlone dat , I 'm done mighty well wid my taters an ' goobers , er sellin ' uv ' em ter de steamboat han 's , wat takes ' em ter de town , an ' ' sposes uv ' em . So I 'm got er right smart chance uv money laid up , sar ; an ' now I wants ter buy me er nigger , same as wite folks , fur ter wait on me an ' bresh my coat an ' drive my kerridge ; an ' I ' lowed ef yer 'd sell de little wite nigger , I 'd buy ' im , " and Uncle Bob chuckled and laughed . " Why , Bob , I believe you are crazy , " said his master , " or drunk . " " I ai n't neder one , marster ; but den I 'm er jokin ' too much , mo 'n de ' lenity uv de cazhun inquires , an ' now I 'll splain de facks , sar . " And Uncle Bob related Ann 's story to his master , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marster , my min ' , hit 's made up . I wants ter buy de little chap , an ' give ' im ter his mammy , de one wat God give ' im to . Hit 'll go mighty hard wid me ter part fum all dat money , caze I ben years pun top er years er layin ' uv it up , an ' hit 's er mighty cumfut ter me er countin ' an ' er jinglin ' uv it ; but hit ai n't doin ' nobody no good er buried in de groun ' ; an ' I do n't special need it myse'f , caze you gives me my cloes , an ' my shoes , an ' my eatin 's , an ' my backer , an ' my wisky , an ' I ai n't got no cazhun fur ter spen ' it ; an ' , let erlone dat , I ca n't stay hyear fureber , er countin ' an ' er jinglin ' dat money , caze wen de angel soun ' dat horn , de ole nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur ter be dar ! de money ca n't hol ' ' im ! De Lord , he ai n't gwine ter say , ' Scuze dat nigger , caze he got money piled up ; lef ' im erlone , fur ter count dat gol ' an ' silver . ' No , sar ! But , marster , maybe in de jedgemun ' day , wen Ole Bob is er stan'in ' fo ' de Lord wid his knees er trim'lin ' , an ' de angel fotches out dat book er hisn , an ' de Lord tell ' im fur ter read wat he writ gins ' im , an ' de angel he ' gin ter read how de ole nigger drunk too much wisky , how he stoled watermillions in de night , how he cussed , how he axed too much fur doct'in ' uv hosses , an ' wen he wuz men'in ' cheers , how he would n't men ' ' em strong , so 's he 'd git ter men ' ' em ergin some time ; an ' den , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe de Lord he 'll say , ' Well , he 's er pow'ful sinful nigger , but den he tuck his money , he did , an ' buy 'd de little baby fur ter give ' im ter his mammy , an ' I sha' n't be too hard on ' im . " " Maybe he 'll say dat , an ' den ergin maybe he wo n't . Maybe he 'll punish de ole nigger ter de full stent uv his ' greshuns ; an ' den , ergin , maybe he 'll let him off light ; but dat ai n't neder hyear nur dar . What 'll yer take fur de baby , caze my min ' hit 's made up ? " " And mine is too , Uncle Bob , " said his master , rising , and grasping in his the big black hand . " Mine is too . I will give Ann her freedom and her baby , and the same amount of money that you give her ; that will take her to her husband 's relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken care of . " The next day Uncle Bob dug up his money , and the bag was found to contain three hundred dollars . His master put with it a check for the same amount , and sent him into the laundry to tell Ann of her good fortune . The poor woman was overcome with happiness and gratitude , and , throwing her arms around Uncle Bob , she sobbed and cried on his shoulder . She wrote at once to her husband 's relatives , and a few weeks after Major Waldron took her to New Orleans , had the requisite papers drawn up for her freedom , and accompanied her on board of a vessel bound for New York ; and then , paying her passage himself , so that she might keep her money for future emergencies , he bade adieu to the only slaves he ever bought . CHAPTER IX . AUNT EDY 'S STORY . Aunt Edy was the principal laundress , and a great favorite she was with the little girls . She was never too busy to do up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad when she could amuse and entertain them . One evening Dumps and Tot stole off from Mammy , and ran as fast as they could clip it to the laundry , with a whole armful of their dollies ' clothes , to get Aunt Edy to let them " iun des er ' ittle , " as Tot said . " Lemme see wat yer got , " said Aunt Edy ; and they spread out on the table garments of worsted and silk and muslin and lace and tarlatan and calico and homespun , just whatever their little hands had been able to gather up . " Lor ' , chil'en , ef yer washes deze fine close yer 'll ruint ' em , " said Aunt Edy , examining the bundles laid out ; " de suds 'll tuck all de color out'n ' em ; s'posin ' yer jes press ' em out on de little stool ober dar wid er nice cole iun . " " Yes , that 's the very thing , " said Dumps ; and Aunt Edy folded some towels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children a cold iron . And , kneeling down , so as to get at their work conveniently , the little girls were soon busy smoothing and pressing the things they had brought . " Aunt Edy , " said Dumps , presently , " could'n yer tell us ' bout Po ' Nancy Jane O ? " " Dar now ! " exclaimed Aunt Edy ; " dem chil'en nuber is tierd er hyearn ' dat tale ; pyears like dey like hit mo ' an ' mo ' eb'y time dey hyears hit ; " and she laughed slyly , for she was the only one on the plantation who knew about " Po ' Nancy Jane O , " and she was pleased because it was such a favorite story with the children . " Once pun er time , " she began , " dar wuz er bird name ' Nancy Jane O , an ' she wuz guv up ter be de swif'es ' - fly'n thing dar wuz in de a'r .

" And Aunt Edy turned to her ironing-table , as if she did n't care for company ; and Dumps and Tot , seeing that she was tired of them , went back to the house , Tot singing , " Who on-tied , who on-tied Po ' Nanty Dane O ? " and Dumps answering back , " Pig-un-a-wa-ya , Pig-un-a-wa-ya , hooo-hooo ! " CHAPTER X. PLANTATION GAMES . " Mammy , the quarter folks are goin ' ter play to-night ; ca n't we go look at ' em ? " pleaded Diddie one Saturday evening , as Mammy was busy sorting out the children 's clothes and putting them away . " Yer allers want ter be ' long er dem quarter-folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soshuts fur you chil'en . " " We do n't want ter ' soshate with ' em , Mammy ; we only want ter look at ' em play ' Monkey Moshuns ' and ' Lipto ' and ' The Lady You Like Best , ' and hear Jim pick the banjo , and see ' em dance ; ca n't we go ? PLEASE ! It 's warm weather now , an ' er moonshiny night ; ca n't we go ? " And Diddie placed one arm around Mammy 's neck , and laid the other little hand caressingly on her cheek ; and Mammy , after much persuasion , agreed to take them , if they would come home quietly when she wanted them to . As soon as the little girls had had their supper , they set out for the quarters . Dilsey and Chris and Riar , of course , accompanied them , though Chris had had some difficulty in joining the party . She had come to grief about her quilt patching , having sewed the squares together in such a way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip it all out and sew it over again , and had boxed her soundly , and now said she should n't go with the others to the quarters ; but here Dumps interfered , and said Mammy should n't be " all time ' posin ' on Chris , " and she went down to see her father about it , who interceded with Mammy so effectually that , when the little folks started off , Chris was with them . When they got to the open space back of Aunt Nancy 's cabin , and which was called " de play-groun ' , " they found that a bright fire of light-wood knots had been kindled to give a light , and a large pile of pine-knots and dried branches of trees was lying near for the purpose of keeping it up . Aunt Nancy had a bench moved out of her cabin for " marster 's chil'en " to sit on , while all of the little negroes squatted around on the ground to look on . These games were confined to the young men and women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mammy , seeing that the children were safe and in good hands , repaired to " Sis Haly 's house , " where " de chu'ch membahs " had assembled for a prayer-meeting . Soon after the children had taken their seats , the young folks came out on the play-ground for a game of Monkey Motions . They all joined hands , and made a ring around one who stood in the middle , and then began to dance around in a circle , singing , " I ac ' monkey moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' monkey moshuns , so I do ; I ac ' ' em well , an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem monkeys ac ' . " I ac ' gemmun moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' gemmun moshuns , so I do ; I ac ' ' em well , an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem gemmuns ac ' . " I ac ' lady moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' lady moshuns , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem ladies ac ' . " I ac ' chil'en moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' chil'en moshuns , so I do ; I ac ' ' em well , an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem chil'ens ac ' . " I ac ' preacher moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' preacher moshuns , so I do ; I ac ' ' em well , an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem preachers ac ' . " I ac ' nigger moshuns , too-re-loo ; I ac ' nigger moshuns , so I do ; I ac ' ' em well , an ' dat 's er fac '  --  I ac ' jes like dem niggers ac ' . " The song had a lively air , and Jim picked the accompaniment on the banjo . Many of the negroes had good voices , and the singing was indeed excellent . While the dancers were singing the first verse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle would screw up his face and hump his shoulders in the most grotesque manner , to represent a monkey . When they sang " I ac ' gemmun moshuns , " he would stick his hat on one side of his head , take a walking-cane in his hand , and strut back and forth , to represent a gentleman . In the " lady moshuns , " he would take little mincing steps , and toss his head from side to side , and pretend to be fanning with his hand . " I ac ' chil'en moshuns " was portrayed by his pouting out his lips and twirling his thumbs , or giggling or crying . When they sang " I ac ' preacher moshuns , " he straightened himself back , and began to " lay off " his hands in the most extravagant gestures . " I ac ' nigger moshuns " was represented by scratching his head , or by bending over and pretending to be picking cotton or hoeing . The representation of the different motions was left entirely to the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of the game that no two people should represent the same character in the same way . If one acted the lady by a mincing walk , the next one must devise some other manner of portraying her , such as sewing , or playing on an imaginary piano , or giving orders to servants , or anything that his fancy would suggest . The middle man or woman was always selected for his or her skill in taking off the different characters ; and when they were clever at it , the game was very amusing to a spectator . After one or two games of " Monkey Moshuns , " some one proposed they should play " Lipto , " which was readily acceded to . All joined hands , and formed a ring around one in the middle , as before , and danced around , singing , " Lipto , lipto , jine de ring ; Lipto , lipto , dance an ' sing ; Dance an ' sing , an ' laugh an ' play , Fur dis is now er holerday . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times , singing , " Turn erroun ' an ' roun ' an ' roun ' ; " then they would clap their hands , singing , " Clap yer han 's , an ' make ' em soun ' ; " then they would bow their heads , singing , " Bow yer heads , an ' bow ' em low ; " then , joining hands again , they would dance around , singing , " All jine han 's , an ' hyear we go . " And now the dancers would drop hands once more , and go to patting , while one of the men would step out with a branch of honeysuckle or yellow jessamine , or something twined to form a wreath , or a paper cap would answer , or even one of the boys ' hats -- anything that would serve for a crown ; then he would sing , " Lipto , lipto -- fi-yi-yi ; Lipto , lipto , hyear am I , Er holdin ' uv dis goldin ' crown , An ' I choose my gal fur ter dance me down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of any girl he chooses , and she must step out and dance with him , or , as they expressed it , " set to him " ( while all the rest patted ) , until one or the other " broke down , " when the man stepped back in the ring , leaving the girl in the middle , when they all joined hands , and began the game over again , going through with the wheeling around and clapping of hands and the bowing of heads just as before ; after which the girl would choose her partner for a " set to , " the song being the same that was sung by the man , with the exception of the last line , which was changed to " An ' I choose my man fur ter dance me down . " " Lipto " was followed by " De One I Like de Bes ' , " which was a kissing game , and gave rise to much merriment . It was played , as the others were , by the dancers joining hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle , and singing , " Now while we all will dance an ' sing , O choose er partner fum de ring ; O choose de lady you like bes ' ; O pick her out fum all de res ' , Fur her hansum face an ' figur neat ; O pick her out ter kiss her sweet . O walk wid her erroun ' an ' roun ' ; O kneel wid her upon de groun ' ; O kiss her once , an ' one time mo ' ; O kiss her sweet , an ' let her go . O lif ' her up fum off de groun ' , An ' all jine han 's erroun ' an ' roun ' , An ' while we all will dance an ' sing , O choose er partner fum de ring . " At the words " choose de lady you like bes ' , " the middle man must make his selection , and , giving her his hand , lead her out of the ring . At the words " walk wid her erroun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm , and they promenade ; at the words " kneel wid her upon de groun ' , " both kneel ; when they sing " Kiss her once , " he kisses her ; and at the words " one time mo ' " the kiss is repeated ; and when the dancers sing " Lif ' her up fum off de groun ' , " he assists her to rise ; and when they sing " All jine han 's erroun ' an ' roun ' , " he steps back into the ring , and the girl must make a choice , the dancers singing , " O choose de gemmun you like bes ' ; " and then the promenading and kneeling and kissing were all gone through with again . Some of the girls were great favorites , and were chosen frequently ; while others not so popular would perhaps not be in the middle during the game . " De One I Like de Bes ' " was a favorite play , and the young folks kept it up for some time , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fiddle , and turning it into a sure-enough dance . Uncle Sambo was very accommodating , and soon made his appearance , when partners were taken , and an Old Virginia reel formed . The tune that they danced by was " Cotton-eyed Joe , " and , the words being familiar to all of them as they danced they sang , " Cotton-eyed Joe , Cotton-eyed Joe , What did make you sarve me so , Fur ter take my gal erway fum me , An ' cyar her plum ter Tennessee ? Ef it had n't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe , I 'd er been married long ergo . " His eyes wuz crossed , an ' his nose wuz flat , An ' his teef wuz out , but wat uv dat ? Fur he wuz tall , an ' he wuz slim , An ' so my gal she follered him . Ef it had n't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe , I 'd er ben married long ergo . " No gal so hansum could be foun ' , Not in all dis country roun ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bright ; Wid her lips so red an ' her teef so white . Ef it had n't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe , I 'd er been married long ergo . " An ' I loved dat gal wid all my heart , An ' she swo ' fum me she 'd never part ; But den wid Joe she runned away , An ' lef ' me hyear fur ter weep all day . O Cotton-eyed Joe , O Cotton-eyed Joe , What did make you sarve me so ? O Joe , ef it had n't er ben fur you , I 'd er married dat gal fur true . " And what with Uncle Sambo 's fiddle and Jim 's banjo , and all of those fresh , happy young voices , the music was enough to make even the church members want to dance . The children enjoyed the dancing even more than they had the playing , and Diddie and Dumps and Tot and all of the little darkies were patting their hands and singing " Cotton-eyed Joe " at the very top of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was time to go home . " No , Mammy , " urged Dumps ; " we ai n't er goin ' ter ; we want ter sing ' Cotton-eyed Joe ; ' hit ai n't late . " " Umph-humph ! dat 's jes wat I ' lowed , " said Mammy . " I ' lowed yer would n't be willin ' fur ter go , er set'n ' hyear an ' er patt'n ' yer han 's same as niggers , an ' er singin ' uv reel chunes ; I du n no wat makes you chil'en so onstrep'rous . " " Yes , Dumps , you know we promised , " said Diddie , " and so we must go when Mammy tells us . " Dumps , finding herself overruled , had to yield , and they all went back to the house , talking very animatedly of the quarter folks and their plays and dances . CHAPTER XI . DIDDIE IN TROUBLE . Diddie was generally a very good and studious little girl , and therefore it was a matter of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day without her , and , in answer to Major Waldron 's inquiry concerning her , replied that Diddie had been so wayward that she had been forced to keep her in , and that she was not to have any dinner . Neither Major nor Mrs. Waldron ever interfered with Miss Carrie 's management , so the family sat down to the meal , leaving the little girl in the schoolroom . Dumps and Tot , however , were very indignant , and ate but little dinner ; and , as soon as their mamma excused them , they ran right to the nursery to tell Mammy about it . They found her overhauling a trunk of old clothes , with a view of giving them out to such of the little negroes as they would fit ; but she dropped everything after Dumps had stated the case , and at once began to expatiate on the tyranny of teachers in general , and of Miss Carrie in particular . " I know 'd how ' t would be , " she said , " wen marster fotch her hyear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit me , er shettin ' my chile up , an ' er starvin ' uv her ; I ai n't got no ' pinion uv po ' wite folks , nohow . " " Is Miss Carrie po ' white folks , Mammy ? " asked Dumps , in horror , for she had been taught by Mammy and Aunt Milly both that the lowest classes of persons in the world were " po ' white folks " and " free niggers . " " She ai n't no rich wite folks , " answered Mammy , evasively ; " caze efn she wuz , she would n't be teachin ' school fur er livin ' ; an ' den ergin , efn she 's so mighty rich , whar 's her niggers ? I neber seed ' em . An ' , let erlone dat , I ai n't neber hyeard uv ' em yit ; " for Mammy could not conceive of a person 's being rich without niggers . " But , wedder she 's rich or po ' , " continued the old lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chile ; an ' marster , he ought n't ter ' low it . " And Mammy resumed her work , but all the time grumbling , and muttering something about " ole maids " and " po ' wite folks . " " I do n't like her , nohow , " said Dumps , " an ' I 'm glad me an ' Tot 's too little ter go ter school ; I do n't want never to learn to read all my life . An ' , Mammy , ca n't you go an ' turn Diddie erloose ? " " No , I ca n't , " answered Mammy . " Yer pa do n't ' low me fur ter do it ; he wo n't do it hisse'f , an ' he wo n't let dem do it wat wants ter . I du n no wat 's gittin ' in ' im myse'f . But , you chil'en , put on yer bunnits , an ' run an ' play in de yard tell I fixes dis chis ' uv cloes ; an ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuck cyar uv ' em ; an ' ef dem chil'en git hut , yer 'll be sorry fur it , mun ; so yer 'd better keep em off'n seesaws an ' all sich ez dat . " Dumps and Tot , attended by their little maids , went out in the yard at Mammy 's bidding , but not to play ; their hearts were too heavy about poor little Diddie , and the little negroes were no less grieved than they were , so they all held a consultation as to what they should do . " Le 's go ' roun ' ter de schoolroom winder , an ' talk ter her , " said Dilsey . And , accordingly , they repaired to the back of the house , and took their stand under the schoolroom window . The schoolroom was on the first floor , but the house was raised some distance from the ground by means of stone pillars , so none of the children were tall enough to see into the room . Dilsey called Diddie softly , and the little girl appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? " asked Dumps . " No , an ' I ai n't ergoin ' to , neither , " answered Diddie . " An ' yer ai n't had yer dinner , nuther , is yer , Miss Diddie ? " asked Dilsey . " No ; but I do n't care ' bout that ; I sha' n't say my lesson not ef she starves me clean ter death . " At this dismal prospect , the tears sprang to Tot 's eyes , and saying , " I 'll dit it , Diddie ; don ' yer min ' , I 'll dit it , " she ran as fast as her little feet could carry her to the kitchen , and told Aunt Mary , the cook , that " Diddie is sut up ; dey lock her all up in de woom , an ' s'e neber had no dinner , an ' s'e 's starve mos ' ter def . Miss Tawwy done it , an ' s'e 's des ez mean ! " Then , putting her chubby little arms around Aunt Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diddie some dinner . " And Aunt Mary , who loved the children , rose from the low chair on which she was sitting to eat her own dinner , and , picking out a nice piece of fried chicken and a baked sweet potato , with a piece of bread and a good slice of ginger pudding , she put them on a plate for the child . Now it so happened that Douglas , the head dining-room servant , was also in the kitchen eating his dinner , and , being exceedingly fond of Tot , he told her to wait a moment , and he would get her something from the house . So , getting the keys from Aunt Delia , the housekeeper , on pretence of putting away something , he buttered two or three slices of light bread , and spread them with jam , and , putting with them some thin chips of cold ham and several slices of cake , he carried them back to the kitchen as an addition to Diddie 's dinner . Tot was delighted , and walked very carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the window , when she called out , joyfully , " Hyear ' t is , Diddie ! ' t is des de bes'es kine er dinner ! " And now the trouble was how to get it up to Diddie . " I tell yer , " said Chris ; " me ' n Dilsey 'll fotch de step-ladder wat Uncle Douglas washes de winders wid . " No sooner said than done , and in a few moments the step-ladder was placed against the house , and Dilsey prepared to mount it with the plate in her hand . But just at this juncture Diddie decided that she would make good her escape , and , to the great delight of the children , she climbed out of the window , and descended the ladder , and soon stood safe among them on the ground . Then , taking the dinner with them , they ran as fast as they could to the grove , where they came to a halt on the ditch bank , and Diddie seated herself on a root of a tree to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negroes wade up and down the ditch . The water was very clear , and not quite knee-deep , and the temptation was too great to withstand ; so the little girls took off their shoes and stockings , and were soon wading too . When Diddie had finished her dinner , she joined them ; and such a merry time as they had , burying their little naked feet in the sand , and splashing the water against each other ! " I tell yer , Diddie , " said Dumps , " I do n't b'lieve nuthin ' ' bout bad little girls gittin ' hurt , an ' not havin ' no fun when they runs away , an ' do n't min ' nobody . I b'lieve Mammy jes makes that up ter skyeer us . " " I do n't know , " replied Diddie ; " you ' member the time ' bout Ole Billy ? " " Oh , I ai n't er countin ' him , " said Dumps ; " I ai n't er countin ' no sheeps ; I 'm jes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And just then the little girls heard some one singing , " De jay bird died wid de hookin ' - coff , Oh , ladies , ai n't yer sorry ? " and Uncle Snake-bit Bob came up the ditch bank with an armful of white-oak splits . " Yer 'd better git outn dat water , " he called , as soon as he saw the children . " Yer 'll all be havin ' de croup nex ' . Git out , I tell yer ! Efn yer do n't , I gwine straight an ' tell yer pa . " It needed no second bidding , and the little girls scrambled up the bank , and , drying their feet as best they could upon their skirts , they put on their shoes and stockings . " What are you doin ' , Uncle Bob ? " called Diddie . " I 'm jes er cuttin ' me er few willers fur ter make baskit-handles outn . " " Ca n't we come an ' look at yer ? " asked Diddie . " Yes , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mightily pleased . " You 're all pow'ful fon ' er dis ole nigger ; you 're allers wantin ' ter be roun ' him . " " It 's ' cause you always tell us tales , an ' do n't quar'l with us , " replied Diddie , as the children drew near the old man , and watched him cut the long willow branches . " Uncle Bob , " asked Dumps , " what was that you was singin ' ' bout the jay bird ? " " Lor ' , honey , hit wuz jes ' boutn ' im dyin ' wid de hookin ' - coff ; but yer better lef ' dem jay birds erlone ; yer needn ' be er wantin ' ter hyear boutn ' em . " " Why , Uncle Bob ? " " Caze , honey , dem jay birds dey cyars news ter de deb'l , dey do ; an ' yer better not fool ' long ' em . " " Do they tell him everything ? " asked Diddie , in some solicitude . " Dat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do wat ai n't right ; dey cyars hit right erlong ter de deb'l . " " Uncle Bob , " said Dumps , thoughtfully , " s'posin ' they wuz some little girls l-o-n-g time ergo what stole ernuther little girl outn the winder , an ' then run 'd erway , an ' waded in er ditch , what they Mammy never would let ' em ; efn er jay bird would see ' em , would he tell the deb'l nuthin ' erbout it ? " " Lor ' , honey , dat ' ud be jes nuts fur ' im ; he 'd light right out wid it ; an ' he would n't was'e no time , nuther , he 'd be so fyeard he 'd furgit part'n it . " Illustration : " YER 'LL ALL BE HAVIN ' DE CROUP NEXT . " " I do n't see none ' bout hyear , " said Dumps , looking anxiously up at the trees . " They do n't stay ' bout hyear much , does they , Uncle Bob ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come up de ditch , " said Uncle Bob . " He had his head turnt one side , he did , er lookin ' mighty hard at you chil'en , an ' I ' lowed ter myse'f now I won'er wat is he er watchin ' dem chil'en fur ? but , den , I knowed you chil'en would n't do nuffin wrong , an ' I knowed he would n't have nuffin fur ter tell . " " Do n't he never make up things an ' tell ' em ? " asked Dumps . " I ai n't neber hyeard boutn dat , " said the old man . " Efn he do , or efn he do n't , I ca n't say , caze I ai n't neber hyeard ; but de bes ' way is fur ter keep ' way fum ' em . " " Well , I bet he do , " said Dumps . " I jes bet he tells M-O-O-O-R-E S-T-O-R-I-E-S than anybody . An ' , Uncle Bob , efn he tells the deb'l sump'n ' boutn three little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fum they teacher an ' wadin ' in er ditch , then I jes b'lieve he made it up !

I'se er God-fyearn nigger , I is ; an ' , let erlone dat , I keeps erway fum dem jay birds . Didn ' yer neber hyear wat er trick he played de woodpecker ? " " No , Uncle Bob , " answered Diddie ; " what did he do to him ? " " Ai n't yer neber hyeard how come de woodpecker 's head ter be red , an ' wat makes de robin hab er red breas ' ? " " Oh , I know ' bout the robin 's breast , " said Diddie . " When the Saviour was on the cross , an ' the wicked men had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead was all scratched up an ' bleedin ' , er little robin was settin ' on er tree lookin ' at him ; an ' he felt so sorry ' bout it till he flew down , an ' tried to pick the thorns out of the crown ; an ' while he was pullin ' at ' em , one of ' em run in his breast , an ' made the blood come , an ' ever since that the robin 's breast has been red . " " Well , I du n no , " said the old man , thoughtfully , scratching his head ; " I du n no , dat mout be de way ; I neber hyeard it , do ; but den I ai n't sayin ' tai n't true , caze hit mout be de way ; an ' wat I 'm er stan'in ' by is dis , dat dat ai n't de way I hyeard hit . " " Tell us how you heard it , Uncle Bob , " asked Diddie . " Well , hit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Uncle Bob . " An ' efn yer got time fur ter go ' long o ' me ter de shop , an ' sot dar wile I plats on dese baskits fur de oberseer 's wife , I 'll tell jes wat I hyearn ' boutn hit . " Of course they had plenty of time , and they all followed him to the shop , where he turned some baskets bottom-side up for seats for the children , and , seating himself on his accustomed stool , while the little darkies sat around on the dirt-floor , he began to weave the splits dexterously in and out , and proceeded to tell the story . CHAPTER XII . HOW THE WOODPECKER 'S HEAD AND THE ROBIN 'S BREAST CAME TO BE RED . " Well " began Uncle Bob , " hit wuz all erlong er de jay bird , jes ez I wuz tellin ' yer . Yer see , Mr. Jay Bird he fell 'd in love , he did , ' long o ' Miss Robin , an ' he wuz er courtin ' her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be er gwine ter see her , an ' er singin ' ter her , an ' er cyarin ' her berries an ' wums ; but , somehow or udder , she did n't pyear ter tuck no shine ter him . She 'd go er walkin ' ' long ' im , an ' she 'd sing songs wid ' im , an ' she 'd gobble up de berries an ' de wums wat he fotch , but den w'en hit come ter marry'n uv ' im , she wa n't dar . " Well , she would n't gib ' im no kin ' er ' couragement , tell he got right sick at his heart , he did ; an ' one day , ez he wuz er settin ' in his nes ' an ' er steddin how ter wuck on Miss Robin so 's ter git her love , he hyeard somebody er laughin ' an ' talkin ' , an ' he lookt out , he did , an ' dar wuz Miss Robin er prumurradin ' wid de Woodpecker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad , an ' he ' low 'd ter hisse'f dat efn de Lord spar 'd him , he inten ' fur ter fix dat Woodpecker . " In dem times de Woodpecker 's head wuz right black , same as er crow , an ' he had er topknot on ' im like er rooster . Gemmun , he wuz er han'sum bird , too . See ' im uv er Sunday , wid his ' go-ter-meetin ' ' cloze on , an ' dar wa n't no bird could totch ' im fur looks . " Well , he an ' Miss Robin dey went on by , er laffin ' an ' er talkin ' wid one ernudder ; an ' de Jay he sot dar , wid his head turnt one side , er steddin an ' er steddin ter hisse'f ; an ' by'mby , atter he made up his min ' , he sot right ter wuck , he did , an ' he fix him er trap . " He got ' im some sticks , an ' he nailt ' em cross'n ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lef ' space ' nuff twix ' de bottum stick an ' de nex ' one fur er bird ter git the ; den , stid er nailin ' de stick nex ' de bottum , he tuck'n prope it up at one een wid er little chip fur ter hole it , an ' den jes res ' tudder een ' gins de side er de nes ' . Soon 's eber he done dat , he crawlt out the de crack mighty kyeerful , I tell yer , caze he wuz fyeared he mout er knock de stick down , an ' git his own se'f cotch in de trap ; so yer hyeard me , mun , he crawlt the mighty tick'ler . " Atter he got the , den he santer ' long , he did , fur ter hunt up de Woodpecker ; an ' by'mby he hyeard him peckin ' at er log ; an ' he went up ter him kin ' er kyeerless , an ' he sez , ' Good-mornin ' , ' sezee ; ' yer pow'ful busy ter day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' im , des same ez any udder gemmun ; an ' atter dey talk er wile , den de Blue Jay he up'n sez , ' I wuz jes er lookin ' fur yer , ' sezee ; ' I gwine ter hab er party ter-morrer night , an ' I 'd like fur yer ter come . All de birds 'll be dar , Miss Robin in speshul , ' sezee . " An ' wen de Woodpecker hyearn dat , he ' lowed he 'd try fur ter git dar . An ' den de Jay he tell him good-mornin ' , an ' went on ter Miss Robin 's house . Well , hit pyeart like Miss Robin wuz mo ' cole dan uzhul dat day , an ' by'mby de Jay Bird , fur ter warm her up , sez , ' Yer lookin ' mighty hansum dis mornin ' , ' sezee . An ' sez she , ' I 'm proud ter hyear yer say so ; but , speakin ' uv hansum , ' sez she , ' hev yer seed Mr. Peckerwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er mad ; an ' sezee , ' Yer pyear ter tuck er mighty intrus ' in ' im . ' " ' Well , I du n no ' bout'n dat , ' sez Miss Robin , sez she , kinter lookin ' shame . ' I du n no ' boutn dat ; but , den I tink he 's er mighty hansum bird , ' sez she . " Well , wid dat de Jay Bird ' gun ter git madder'n he wuz , an ' he ' lowed ter hisse'f dat he 'd ax Miss Robin ter his house , so 's she could see how he 'd fix de Peckerwood ; so he sez , " ' Miss Robin , I gwine ter hab er party ter-morrer night ; de Woodpecker 'll be dar , an ' I 'd like fur yer ter come . ' " Miss Robin ' lowed she 'd come , an ' de Jay Bird tuck his leave . " Well , de nex ' night de Jay sot in ' is nes ' er waitin ' fur ' is cump'ny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon 's eber he seed de sticks ercross de do ' , he sez , ' Wy , pyears like yer ben er fixin ' up , ' sezee . ' Ai n't yer ben er buildin ' ? ' " ' Well , ' sez de Jay Bird , ' I 've jes put er few ' provemunce up , fur ter keep de scritch-owls outn my nes ' ; but dar 's plenty room fur my frien 's ter git the ; jes come in , ' sezee ; an ' de Woodpecker he started the de crack . Soon 's eber he got his head the , de Jay pullt de chip out , an ' de big stick fell right crossn his neck . Den dar he wuz , wid his head in an ' his feet out ! an ' de Jay Bird ' gun ter laff , an ' ter make fun atn ' im . Sezee , ' I hope I see yer ! Yer look like sparkin ' Miss Robin now ! hit 's er gre't pity she ca n't see yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyear , too , d'rectly ; she 's er comin ' ter de party , ' sezee , ' an ' I 'm gwine ter gib her er new dish ; I 'm gwine ter sot her down ter roas ' Woodpecker dis ebenin ' . An ' now , efn yer 'll ' scuse me , I 'll lef ' yer hyear fur ter sorter ' muse yerse'f wile I grin 's my ax fur ten ' ter yer . ' " An ' wid dat de Jay went out , an ' lef de po ' Woodpecker er lyin ' dar ; an ' by'mby Miss Robin come erlong ; an ' wen she seed de Woodpecker , she axt ' im ' wat 's he doin ' down dar on de groun ' ? ' an ' atter he up an ' tol ' her , an ' tol ' her how de Jay Bird wuz er grin'in ' his axe fur ter chop offn his head , den de Robin she sot to an ' try ter lif ' de stick offn him . She straint an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nuff fur ter move hit den ; an ' so she sez , ' Mr. Woodpecker , ' sez she , ' s'posin ' I cotch holt yer feet , an ' try ter pull yer back dis way ? ' ' All right , ' sez de Woodpecker ; an ' de Robin , she cotch er good grip on his feet , an ' she brace herse'f up ' gins er bush , an ' pullt wid all her might , an ' atter er wile she fotch ' im the ; but she wuz bleeged fur ter lef ' his topknot behin ' , fur his head wuz skunt des ez clean ez yer han ' ; an ' ' twuz jes ez raw , honey , ez er piece er beef . " An ' wen de Robin seed dat , she wuz mighty ' stressed ; an ' she tuck his head an ' helt it gins her breas ' fur ter try an ' cumfut him , an ' de blood got all ober her breas ' , an ' hit 's red plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erlong home , an ' de Robin she nusst him tell his head got well ; but de topknot wuz gone , an ' it pyeart like de blood all settled in his head , caze fum dat day ter dis his head 's ben red . " " An ' did he marry the Robin ? " asked Diddie . " Now I done tol ' yer all I know , " said Uncle Bob . " I gun yer de tale jes like I hyearn it , an ' I ai n't er gwine ter make up nuffin ' , an ' tell yer wat I du n no ter be de truff . Efn dar 's any mo ' ter it , den I ai n't neber hyearn hit . I gun yer de tale jes like hit wuz gunt ter me , an ' efn yer ai n't satisfied wid hit , den I ca n't holp it . " " But we are satisfied , Uncle Bob , " said Diddie . " It was a very pretty tale , and we are much obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Uncle Bob , soothed by Diddie 's answer --  " yer mo'n welcome ; but hit 's gittin ' too late fur you chil'en ter be out ; yer 'd better be er gittin ' toerds home . " Here the little girls looked at each other in some perplexity , for they knew Diddie had been missed , and they were afraid to go to the house . " Uncle Bob , " said Diddie , " we 've done er wrong thing this evenin ' : we ran away fum Miss Carrie , an ' we 're scared of papa ; he might er lock us all up in the library , an ' talk to us , an ' say he 's ' stonished an ' mortified , an ' so we 're scared to go home . " " Umph ! " said Uncle Bob ; " you chil'en is mighty bad , anyhow . " " I think we 're heap mo ' better'n we 're bad , " said Dumps . " Well , dat mout er be so , " said the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but you chil'en comes fum er mighty high-minded stock uv white folks , an ' hit ai n't becomin ' in yer fur ter be runnin ' erway an ' er hidin ' out , same as oberseer 's chil'en , an ' all kin ' er po ' white trash . " " We are sorry about it now , Uncle Bob , " said Diddie " but what would you ' vize us to do ? " " Well , my invice is dis , " said Uncle Bob , " fur ter go ter yer pa , an ' tell him de truff ; state all de konkumstances des like dey happen ; do n't lebe out none er de facks ; tell him you 're sorry yer ' haved so onstreperous , an ' ax him fur ter furgib yer ; an ' ef he do , wy dat 's all right ; an ' den ef he do n't , wy yer mus ' ' bide by de kinsequonces . But fuss , do , fo ' yer axes fur furgibness , yer mus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax you chil'en dis , **37;872;TOOLONG ? an '  -- is -- you -- 'pentin '  - -  uv - -  wadin '  - -  in - -  de - -  ditch ? " Uncle Bob spoke very slowly and solemnly , and in a deep tone ; and Diddie , feeling very much as if she had been guilty of murder , replied , " Yes , I am truly sorry , Uncle Bob . " Dumps and Tot and the three little darkies gravely nodded their heads in assent . " Den jes go an ' tell yer pa so , " said the old man . " An ' , anyway , yer 'll hatter be gwine , caze hit 's gittin ' dark . " The little folks walked off slowly towards the house , and presently Dumps said , " Diddie , I do n't b'lieve I 'm rael sorry we runned off , an ' I do n't right ' pent ' bout wadin ' in the ditch , cause we had er mighty heap er fun ; an ' yer reckon ef I 'm jes sorter sorry , an ' jes toler'ble ' pent , that 'll do ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 'm right sorry , and I 'll tell papa for all of us . " Illustration : " WELL , MY INVICE IS DIS . " The children went at once to the library , where Major Waldron was found reading . " Papa , " said Diddie , " we 've ben very bad , an ' we 've come ter tell yer ' bout it . " " An ' the Jay Bird , he tol ' the deb'l , " put in Dumps , " an ' ' twa n't none er his business . " " Hush up , Dumps , " said Diddie , " till I tell papa ' bout it . I would n't say my lesson , papa , an ' Miss Carrie locked me up , an ' the chil'en brought me my dinner . " " ' Tuz me , " chimed in Tot . " I b'ing ' er de besses dinner -- take an ' jam an ' pud'n in de p'ate . Aunt Mawy durn turn me . " " Hush , Tot , " said Diddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , papa , I climbed out the winder on the step-ladder , an ' I --  " " Dilsey an ' Chris got the ladder , " put in Dumps . " HUSH UP , Dumps ! " said Diddie ; " you 're all time ' ruptin ' me . " " I reckon I done jes bad ez you , " retorted Dumps , " an ' I got jes much right ter tell ' boutn it . You think nobody ca n't be bad but yerse'f . ' " Well , then , you can tell it all , " said Diddie , with dignity . " Papa , Dumps will tell you . " And Dumps , nothing daunted , continued : " Dilsey an ' Chris brought the step-ladder , an ' Diddie clum out ; an ' we runned erway in the woods , an ' waded in the ditch , an ' got all muddy up ; an ' the Jay Bird , he was settin ' on er limb watchin ' us , an ' he carried the news ter the deb'l ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' tol ' us ' bout the Woodpecker 's head , an ' that 's all ; only we ai n't n-e-v-er goin ' ter do it no mo ' ; an ' , oh yes , I furgot -- an ' Diddie 's rael sorry an ' right ' pents ; an ' I 'm sorter sorry , an ' toler'ble ' pents . An ' , please , are you mad , papa ? " " It was certainly very wrong , " said her father , " to help Diddie to get out , when Miss Carrie had locked her in ; and I am surprised that Diddie should need to be kept in . Why did n't you learn your lesson , my daughter ? " " I did , " answered Diddie ; " I knew it every word ; but Miss Carrie jus ' cut up , an ' would n't let me say it like ' t was in the book ; an ' she laughed at me ; an ' then I got mad , an ' would n't say it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Waldron . " ' T was er hist'ry lesson , an ' the question was , ' Who was Columbus ? ' an ' the answer was , ' He was the son of er extinguished alligator ; ' an ' Miss Carrie laughed , an ' said that wa n't it . " " And I rather think Miss Carrie was right , " said the father . " Go and bring me the book . " Diddie soon returned with her little history , and , showing the passage to her father , said , eagerly , " Now do n't you see here , papa ? " And Major Waldron read , " He was the son of a distinguished navigator . " Then , making Diddie spell the words in the book , he explained to her her mistake , and said he would like to have her apologize to Miss Carrie for being so rude to her . This Diddie was very willing to do , and her father went with her to the sitting-room to find Miss Carrie , who readily forgave Diddie for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her discipline . And that was a great deal more than Mammy did , when she saw the state of their shoes and stockings , and found that they had been wading in the ditch . She slapped the little darkies , and tied red-flannel rags wet with turpentine round the children 's necks to keep them from taking cold , and scolded and fussed so that the little girls pulled the cover over their heads and went to sleep , and left her quarrelling . CHAPTER XIII . A PLANTATION MEETING AND UNCLE DANIEL 'S SERMON . " Are you gwine ter meetin ' , Mammy ? " asked Diddie one Sunday evening , as Mammy came out of the house attired in her best flowered muslin , with an old-fashioned mantilla ( that had once been Diddie 's grandmother 's ) around her shoulders . " Cose I gwine ter meetin ' , honey ; I'se er tryin ' ter sarve de Lord , I is , caze we ai n't gwine stay hyear on dis yearth all de time . We got ter go ter nudder kentry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetin ' , an ' watch an ' pray , like de Book say fur yer ter do , den yer mus ' look out fur yerse'f wen dat Big Day come wat I hyears ' em talkin ' ' bout . " " Ca n't we go with you , Mammy ? We 'll be good , an ' not laugh at ' em shoutin ' . " " I du n no wat yer gwine loff at ' em shoutin ' fur ; efn yer do n't min ' de loff gwine ter be turnt some er deze days , an ' dem wat yer loffs at hyear , dem 's de ones wat 's gwine ter do de loffin ' wen we gits up yon'er ! But , let erlone dat , yer kin go efn yer wants ter ; an ' efn yer 'll make has'e an ' git yer bunnits , caze I ai n't gwine wait no gret wile . I do n't like ter go ter meetin ' atter hit starts . I want ter hyear Brer Dan'l 's tex ' , I duz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyears de tex ' . " You may be sure it was n't long before the children were all ready , for they knew Mammy would be as good as her word , and would not wait for them . When they reached the church , which was a very nice wooden building that Major Waldron had had built for that purpose , there was a large crowd assembled ; for , besides Major Waldron 's own slaves , quite a number from the adjoining plantations were there . The younger negroes were laughing and chatting in groups outside the door , but the older ones wore very solemn countenances , and walked gravely in and up to the very front pews . On Mammy 's arrival , she placed the little girls in seats at the back of the house , and left Dilsey and Chris and Riar on the seat just behind them , " fur ter min ' ' em , " as she said ( for the children must always be under the supervision of somebody ) , and then she went to her accustomed place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , and sat in the amen corner . Soon after they had taken their seats , Uncle Gabe , who had a powerful voice , and led the singing , struck up : " Roll , Jordan , roll ! roll , Jordan , roll ! I want ter go ter heb'n wen I die , Fur ter hyear sweet Jordan roll . " Oh , pray , my brudder , pray ! Yes , my Lord ; My brudder 's settin ' in de kingdum , Fur ter hyear sweet Jordan roll . Chorus . Roll , Jordan , roll ! roll , Jordan , roll ! I want ter go ter heb'n wen I die , Fur ter hyear sweet Jordan roll . " Oh , shout , my sister , shout ! Yes , my Lord ; My sister she 's er shoutin ' Caze she hyears sweet Jordan roll . " Oh , moan , you monahs , moan ! Yes , my Lord ; De monahs sobbin ' an ' er weepin ' , Fur ter hyear sweet Jordan roll . " Oh , scoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dem sinners wat 's er scoffin ' Ca n't hyear sweet Jordan roll . " And as the flood of melody poured through the house , the groups on the outside came in to join the singing . After the hymn , Uncle Snake-bit Bob led in prayer , and what the old man lacked in grammar and rhetoric was fully made up for in fervency and zeal . The prayer ended , Uncle Daniel arose , and , carefully adjusting his spectacles , he opened his Bible with all the gravity and dignity imaginable , and proceeded to give out his text . Now the opening of the Bible was a mere matter of form , for Uncle Daniel did n't even know his letters ; but he thought it was more impressive to have the Bible open , and therefore never omitted that part of the ceremony . " My bredren an ' my sistren , " he began , looking solemnly over his specs at the congregation , " de tex ' wat I'se gwine ter gib fur yer ' strucshun dis ebenin ' yer 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nur yit in de hine part .

" And while the hymn was being sung , Uncle Daniel had his wish of " monahs ' pun top er monahs , " for the benches and aisles immediately around the altar were soon crowded with the weeping negroes . Some were crying , some shouting Glory ! some praying aloud , some exhorting the sinners , some comforting the mourners , some shrieking and screaming , and , above all the din and confusion , Uncle Daniel could be heard halloing , at the top of his voice , " Dem s'ords an ' dem famines ! " After nearly an hour of this intense excitement , the congregation was dismissed , one of them , at least , more dead than alive ; for " Aunt Ceely , " who had long been known as " er pow'ful sinful ooman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or assumed must be determined by wiser heads than mine ; for it was no uncommon occurrence for those " seekin ' ' ligion " to lie in a state of unconsciousness for several hours , and , on their return to consciousness , to relate the most wonderful experiences of what had happened to them while in the trance . Aunt Ceely lay as if she were dead , and two of the Christian men ( for no sinner must touch her at this critical period ) bore her to her cabin , followed by the " chu'ch membahs , " who would continue their singing and praying until she " come the , " even if the trance should last all night . The children returned to the house without Mammy , for she was with the procession which had followed Aunt Ceely ; and as they reached the yard , they met their father returning from the lot . " Papa , " called Dumps , " we 're goin ' ter have awful troubles hyear . " " How , my little daughter ?

" Illustration : " MONAH 'S ' PUN TOP ER MONAHS . " Major Waldron was annoyed that his children should have witnessed any such scene , for they were all very much excited and frightened at the fearful fate that they felt was approaching them ; so he took them into his library , and explained the meaning of the terms " swords and famines , " and read to them the whole chapter , explaining how the prophet referred only to the calamities that should befall the Hebrews ; but , notwithstanding all that , the children were uneasy , and made Aunt Milly sit by the bedside until they went to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting them . CHAPTER XIV . DIDDIE AND DUMPS GO VISITING . It was some time in June that , the weather being fine , Mammy gave the children permission to go down to the woods beyond the gin-house and have a picnic . They had a nice lunch put up in their little baskets , and started off in high glee , taking with them Cherubim and Seraphim and the doll babies . They were not to stay all day , only till dinner-time ; so they had no time to lose , but set to playing at once . First , it was " Ladies come to see , " and each of them had a house under the shade of a tree , and spent most of the time in visiting and in taking care of their respective families . Dumps had started out with Cherubim for her little boy ; but he proved so refractory , and kept her so busy catching him , that she decided to play he was the yard dog , and content herself with the dolls for her children . Riar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the yard , she had inveigled Hester 's little two-year-old son to go with them , and now was desirous of claiming him as her son and heir -- a position which he filled very contentedly until Diddie became ambitious of living in more style than her neighbors , and offered Pip ( Hester 's baby ) the position of dining-room servant in her establishment ; and he , lured off by the prospect of playing with the little cups and saucers , deserted Riar for Diddie . This produced a little coolness , but gradually it wore off , and the visiting between the parties was resumed . After " ladies come to see " had lost its novelty , they made little leaf-boats , and sailed them in the ditch . Then they played " hide the switch , " and at last concluded to try a game of hide-and-seek . This afforded considerable amusement , so they kept it up some time ; and once , when it became Dumps 's time to hide , she ran away to the gin-house , and got into the pick-room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , she thought she heard somebody breathing . This frightened her very much , and she had just opened the door to get out , when a negro man crawled from under a pile of dirty cotton , and said , " Little missy , fur de Lord 's sake , ca n't yer gim me sump'n t ' eat ? " Dumps was so scared she could hardly stand ; but , notwithstanding the man 's haggard face and hollow eyes , and his weird appearance , with the cotton sticking to his head , his tone was gentle , and she stopped to look at him more closely . " Little missy , " he said , piteously , " I'se er starvin ' ter def . I ai n't had er mouf'l ter eat in fo ' days . " " What 's the reason ? " asked Dumps . " Are you a runaway nigger ? " " Yes , honey ; I ' longs ter ole Tight-fis ' Smith ; an ' he wanted ter whup me fur not gittin ' out ter de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erway fum ' im , an ' now I 'm skyeert ter go back , an ' ter go anywhar ; an ' I ca n't fin ' nuf'n t ' eat , an ' I'se er starvin ' ter def . " " Well , you wait , " said Dumps , " an ' I 'll go bring yer the picnic . " " Do n't tell nobody ' boutn my bein ' hyear , honey . " " No , I wo n't , " said Dumps , " only Diddie ; she 's good , an ' she wo n't tell nobody ; an ' she can read an ' write , an ' she 'll know what to do better'n me , because I 'm all the time such a little goose . But I 'll bring yer sump'n t ' eat ; you jes wait er little minute ; an ' do n't yer starve ter def till I come back . " Dumps ran back to the ditch where the children were , and , taking Diddie aside in a very mysterious manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gin-house , and about his being so hungry . " An ' I tol ' ' im I 'd bring ' im the picnic , " concluded Dumps ; and Diddie , being the gentlest and kindest-hearted little girl imaginable , at once consented to that plan ; and , leaving Tot with the little negroes in the woods , the two children took their baskets , and went higher up the ditch , on pretence of finding a good place to set the table ; but , as soon as they were out of sight , they cut across the grove , and were soon at the gin-house . They entered the pick-room cautiously , and closed the door behind them , The man came out from his hiding-place , and the little girls emptied their baskets in his hands . He ate ravenously , and Diddie and Dumps saw with pleasure how much he enjoyed the nice tarts and sandwiches and cakes that Mammy had provided for the picnic . " Do you sleep here at night ? " asked Diddie . " Yes , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uv Tight-fis ' Smith . " " He 's awful mean , ai n't he ? " asked Dumps . " Dat he is , chile , " replied the man ; " he 's cruel an ' bad . " " Then do n't you ever go back to him , " said Dumps . " You stay right here an ' me'n Diddie 'll bring you ev'y-thing ter eat , an ' have you fur our nigger . " The man laughed softly at that idea , but said he would stay there for the present , anyway ; and the children , bidding him good-bye , and telling him they would be sure to bring him something to eat the next day , went back to their playmates at the ditch . " Tot , " said Diddie , " we gave all the picnic away to a poor old man who was very hungry ; but you do n't mind , do you ? we 'll go back to the house , and Mammy will give you just as many cakes as you want . " Tot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat the picnic in the woods ; but Diddie soon comforted her , and before they reached the house she was as merry and bright as any of them . The next morning Diddie and Dumps were very much perplexed to know how to get off to the gin-house without being seen . There was no difficulty about obtaining the provisions ; their mother always let them have whatever they wanted to have tea-parties with , and this was their excuse for procuring some slices of pie and cake , while Aunt Mary gave them bread and meat , and Douglass gave them some cold buttered biscuit with ham between . They wrapped it all up carefully in a bundle , and then , watching their chances , they slipped off from Tot and the little darkies , as well as from Mammy , and carried it to their guest in the pick-room . He was truly glad to see them , and to get the nice breakfast they had brought ; and the little girls , having now lost all fear of him , sat down on a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you always b'long to Mr. Tight-fis ' Smith ? " asked Diddie . " No , honey ; he bought me fum de Powell ' state , an ' I ai n't b'longst ter him no mo'n ' boutn fo ' years . " Illustration : " BRINGIN ' ' IM THE PICNIC .

" No , honey , my name 's Pomp ; but den I 'm er prayin ' man , des same as Dan'l wuz . " " Well , Uncle Pomp , " said Diddie , " you stay here just as long as you can , an ' I 'll ask papa to see Mr. Tight-fis ' Smith , an ' he 'll get --  " " Lor ' , chile , " interrupted Uncle Pomp , " do n't tell yer pa nuf'n ' boutn it ; he 'll sho ' ter sen ' me back , an ' dat man 'll beat me half ter def : caze I'se mos ' loss er week 's time now , an ' hit 's er mighty ' tickler time in de crap .

As they neared the house , Dumps asked Diddie how far it was to Mr. " Tight-fis ' Smith 's . " " I do n't know exactly , " said Diddie ; " ' bout three miles , I think . " " Could n't we walk there , an ' ask him not to whup Uncle Pomp ? Maybe he would n't , ef we was ter beg him right hard . " " Yes , that 's jest what we 'll do , Dumps ; and we 'll get Dilsey to go with us , ' cause she knows the way . " Dilsey was soon found , and was very willing to accompany them , but was puzzled to know why they wanted to go . The children , however , would not gratify her curiosity , and they started at once , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all of three miles to Mr. Smith 's plantation , and the little girls were very tired long before they got there . Dumps , indeed , almost gave out , and once began to cry , and only stopped with Diddie 's reminding her of poor Uncle Pomp , and with Dilsey 's carrying her a little way . At last , about two o'clock , they reached Mr. Smith 's place . The hands had just gone out into the field after dinner , and of course their master , who was only a small planter and kept no overseer , was with them . The children found the doors all open , and went in . The house was a double log-cabin , with a hall between , and they entered the room on the right , which seemed to be the principal living-room . There was a shabby old bed in one corner , with the cover all disarranged , as if its occupant had just left it . A table , littered with unwashed dishes , stood in the middle of the floor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little girls were frightened at the unusual silence about the place , as well as the dirt and disorder , but , being very tired , they sat down to rest . " Diddie , " asked Dumps , after a little time , " ai n't yer scared ? " " I do n't think I 'm scared , Dumps , " replied Diddie ; " but I 'm not right comfor'ble . " " I 'm scared , " said Dumps . " I 'm jes ez fraid of Mr. Tight-fis ' Smith ! " " Dat 's hit ! " said Dilsey . " Now yer talkin ' , Miss Dumps ; dat 's er mean wite man , an ' he mighter git mad erlong us , an ' take us all fur his niggers . " " But we ai n't black , Diddie an ' me , " said Dumps . " Dat do n't make no diffunce ter him ; he des soon hab wite niggers ez black uns , " remarked Dilsey , consolingly ; and Dumps , being now thoroughly frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ter put my pen'ence in de Lord . I 'm er goin ' ter pray . " Diddie and Dilsey thought this a wise move , and , the three children kneeling down , Dumps began , " Now , I lay me down to sleep . " And just at this moment Mr. Smith , returning from the field , was surprised to hear a voice proceeding from the house , and , stepping lightly to the window , beheld , to his amazement , the three children on their knees , with their eyes tightly closed and their hands clasped , while Dumps was saying , with great fervor , " If I should die before I wake , I pray the Lord my soul to take ; An ' this I ask for Jesus ' sake . " " Amen ! " reverently responded Diddie and Dilsey ; and they all rose from their knees much comforted . " I ai n't ' fraid uv him now , " said Dumps , " ' cause I b'lieve the Lord 'll he'p us , an ' not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b'lieve so too , " said Diddie ; and , turning to the window , she found Mr. Smith watching them . " Are you Mr. Tight-fis ' Smith ? " asked Diddie , timidly . " I am Mr. Smith , and I have heard that I am called ' tight-fisted ' in the neighborhood , " he replied , with a smile . " Well , we are Major Waldron 's little girls , Diddie and Dumps , an ' this is my maid , Dilsey , an ' we 've come ter see yer on business . " " On business , eh ? " replied Mr. Smith , stepping in at the low window . " Well , what 's the business , little ones ? " and he took a seat on the side of the bed , and regarded them curiously . But here Diddie stopped , for she felt it was a delicate matter to speak to this genial , pleasant-faced old man of cruelty to his own slaves . Dumps , however , was troubled with no such scruples ; and , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared , she approached him boldly , and , standing by his side , she laid one hand on his gray head , and said : " Mr. Smith , we 've come ter beg you please not ter whup Uncle Pomp if he comes back . He is runned erway , an ' me an ' Diddie know where he is , an ' we 've ben feedin ' him , an ' we do n't want you ter whup him ; will you please do n't ? " and Dumps 's arm slipped down from the old man 's head , until it rested around his neck ; and Mr. Smith , looking into her eager , childish face , and seeing the blue eyes filled with tears , thought of the little faces that long years ago had looked up to his ; and , bending his head , he kissed the rosy mouth . " You wo n't whup him , will you ? " urged Dumps . " Do n't you think he ought to be punished for running away and staying all this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smith , gently . " But , indeed , he is punished , " said Diddie ; " he was almost starved to death when me and Dumps carried him the picnic ; and then he is so scared , he 's been punished , Mr. Smith ; so please let him come home , and do n't whup him . " " Yes , PLE-EE-ASE promise , " said Dumps , tightening her hold on his neck ; and Mr. Smith , in memory of the little arms that once clung round him , and the little fingers that in other days clasped his , said : " Well , I 'll promise , little ones . Pomp may come home , and I 'll not whip or punish him in any way ; " and then he kissed them both , and said they must have a lunch with him , and then he would take them home and bring Pomp back ; for he was astonished to learn that they had walked so long a distance , and would not hear of their walking back , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen off , and nobody knew where they were . He made the cook bake them some hot corn hoe-cakes and boil them some eggs ; and while she was fixing it , and getting the fresh butter and buttermilk to add to the meal , Mr. Smith took them to the June apple-tree , and gave them just as many red apples as they wanted to eat , and some to take home to Tot . And Dumps told him all about " Old Billy " and Cherubim and Seraphim , and the old man laughed , and enjoyed it all , for he had no relatives or friends , and lived entirely alone -- a stern , cold man , whose life had been embittered by the sudden loss of his loved ones , and it had been many weary years since he had heard children 's voices chatting and laughing under the apple-tree . After the lunch , which his guests enjoyed very much , Mr. Smith had a little donkey brought out for Dilsey to ride , and , taking Diddie behind him on his horse , and Dumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was but one saddle , so Dilsey was riding " bareback , " and had to sit astride of the donkey to keep from falling off , which so amused the children that merry peals of laughter rang out from time to time ; indeed , Dumps laughed so much , that , if Mr. Smith had not held her tightly , she certainly would have fallen off . But it was not very funny to Dilsey ; she held on with all her might to the donkey 's short mane , and even then could scarcely keep her seat . She was highly indignant with the children for laughing at her , and said . " I du n no wat yer kill'n yerse'f laffin ' ' bout , got me er settin ' on dis hyear beas ' ; I ai n't gwine wid yer no mo ' . " Major Waldron was sitting on the veranda as the cavalcade came up , and was surprised to see his little daughters with Mr. Smith , and still more so to learn that they had walked all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but being a kind man , and not wishing to check the germs of love and sympathy in their young hearts , he forbore to scold them , and went with them and Mr. Smith to the gin-house for the runaway . On reaching the pick-room , the children went in alone , and told Uncle Pomp that his master had come for him , and had promised not to punish him ; but still the old man was afraid to go out , and stood there in alarm till Mr. Smith called : " Come out , Pomp ! I 'll keep my promise to the little ones ; you shall not be punished in any way . Come out , and let 's go home . " And Uncle Pomp emerged from his hiding-place , presenting a very ludicrous spectacle , with his unwashed face and uncombed hair , and the dirty cotton sticking to his clothes . " Ef'n yer 'll furgib de ole nigger dis time , marster , he ai n't neber gwine run erway no mo ' ; an ' , mo'n dat , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git up sooner in de mornin ' ; he is dat , jes sho 's yer born ! " said the old negro , as he came before his master . " Do n't make too many promises , Pomp , " kindly replied Mr. Smith ; " we will both try to do better ; at any rate , you shall not be punished this time . Now take your leave of your kind little friends , and let 's get towards home ; we are losing lots of time this fine day . " " Good-bye , little misses , " said Uncle Pomp , grasping Diddie 's hand in one of his and Dumps 's in the other ; " good-bye ; I gwine pray fur yer bof ev'y night wat de Lord sen ' ; an ' , mo'n dat , I gwine fotch yer some pattridge aigs de fus ' nes ' wat I fin 's . " And Uncle Pomp mounted the donkey that Dilsey had ridden , and rode off with his master , while Diddie and Dumps climbed on top of the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-bonnets and calling out , " Good-bye , Mr. Tight-fis ' Smith and Uncle Pomp . " CHAPTER XV . THE FOURTH OF JULY . " The glorious Fourth " was always a holiday on every Southern plantation , and , of course , Major Waldron 's was no exception to the rule . His negroes not only had holiday , but a barbecue , and it was a day of general mirth and festivity . On this particular " Fourth " the barbecue was to be on the banks of the creek formed by the back-waters of the river , and was to be a " fish-fry " as well as a barbecue . All hands on the plantation were up by daylight , and preparing for the frolic . Some of the negro men , indeed , had been down to the creek all night setting out their fish-baskets and getting the " pit " ready for the meats . The pit was a large hole , in which a fire was kindled to roast the animals , which were suspended over it ; and they must commence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get everything ready by dinner-time . The children were as much excited over it as the negroes were , and Mammy could hardly keep them still enough to dress them , they were so eager to be off . Major and Mrs. Waldron were to go in the light carriage , but the little folks were to go with Mammy and Aunt Milly in the spring-wagon , along with the baskets of provisions for the " white folks ' tables ; " the bread and vegetables and cakes and pastry for the negroes ' tables had been sent off in a large wagon , and were at the place for the barbecue long before the white family started from home . The negroes , too , had all gone . Those who were not able to walk had gone in wagons , but most of them had walked , for it was only about three miles from the house . Despite all their efforts to hurry up Mammy , it was nearly nine o'clock before the children could get her off ; and even then she did n't want to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was driving the wagon , had to add his entreaties to those of the little folks before she would consent at all ; and after that matter had been decided , and the baskets all packed in , and the children all comfortably seated , and Dilsey and Chris and Riar squeezed into the back of the wagon between the ice-cream freezer and the lemonade buckets , and Cherubim and Seraphim in the children 's laps , and Mammy and Aunt Milly on two split-bottomed chairs , just back of the driver 's seat , and Uncle Snake-bit Bob , with the reins in his hands , just ready to drive off -- whom should they see but Old Daddy Jake coming down the avenue , and waving his hat for them to wait for him . " Dar now ! " said Mammy ; " de folks done gone an ' lef Ole Daddy , an ' we got ter stuff ' im in hyear somewhar . " " They ai n't no room in hyear , " said Dumps , tightening her grasp on Cherubim , for she strongly suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for Daddy . " Well , he ai n't got ter be lef ' , " said Mammy ; " I wuz allers larnt ter ' spect ole folks myse'f , an ' even dis wagin goes , why den Daddy Jake 's got ter go in it ; " and , Major and Mrs. Waldron having gone , Mammy was the next highest in command , and from her decision there was no appeal . " How come yer ter git lef , Daddy ? " asked Uncle Snake-bit Bob , as the old man came up hobbling on his stick . " Well , yer see , chile , I wuz er lightin ' uv my pipe , an ' er fixin ' uv er new stim in it , an ' I nuber notus wen de wagins went off . Yer see I 'm er gittin ' er little deef in deze ole yurs uv mine : dey ben er faste n't on ter dis ole nigger 's head er long time , uperds uv er hunderd years or mo ' ; an ' de time hez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights ; but dey gittin ' out'n fix somehow ; dey ai n't wuckin ' like dey oughter ; an ' dey jes sot up dar , an ' let de wagins drive off , an ' leave de ole nigger er lightin ' uv his pipe ; an ' wen I got the , an ' went ter de do ' , den I hyeard er mighty stillness in de quarters , an ' , bless yer heart , de folks wuz gone ; an ' I lookt up dis way , an ' I seed de wagin hyear , an ' I ' lowed yer 'd all gim me er lif ' some way . " " Dem little niggers 'll hatter stay at home , " said Mammy , sharply , eying the little darkies , " or else dey 'll hatter walk , caze Daddy 's got ter come in dis wagin . Now , you git out , you little niggers . " At this , Dilsey and Chris and Riar began to unpack themselves , crying bitterly the while , because they were afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk fast enough to keep up with the wagon ; but here Diddie came to the rescue , and persuaded Uncle Bob to go to the stable and saddle Corbin , and all three of the little negroes mounted him , and rode on behind the wagon , while Daddy Jake was comfortably fixed in the space they had occupied ; and now they were fairly off . " Mammy , what does folks have Fourf of Julys for ? " asked Dumps , after a little while . " I du n no , honey , " answered Mammy ; " I hyearn ' em say hit wuz ' long o ' some fightin ' or nuther wat de wite folks fit one time ; but whedder dat wuz de time wat Brer David fit Goliar or not , I du n no ; I ai n't hyeard ' em say ' bout dat : it mout er ben dat time , an ' den ergin it mout er ben de time wat Brer Samson kilt up de folks wid de jawbone . I ai n't right sho ' wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fightin ' or nuther . " " It was the ' Declination of Independence , ' " said Diddie . " It 's in the little history ; and it was n't any fightin ' , it was a writin ' ; and there 's the picture of it in the book ; and all the men are settin ' roun ' , and one of ' em is writin ' . " " Yes , dat 's jes wat I hyearn , " said Uncle Bob . " I hyearn ' em say dat dey had de fuss ' Defemation uv Ondepen'ence on de fourf uv July , an ' eber sence den de folks ben er habin ' holerday an ' barbecues on dat day . " " What 's er Defemation , Uncle Bob ? " asked Dumps , who possessed an inquiring mind . " Well , I mos ' furgits de zack meanin ' , " said the old man , scratching his head ; " hit 's some kin ' er writin ' , do , jes like Miss Diddie say ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' yer ma kin fin ' hit fur yer , an ' ' splain de zack meanin ' uv de word ; but de Defemation uv Ondepen'ence , hit happened on de fuss fourf uv July , an ' hit happens ev'y fourf uv July sence den ; an ' dat 's ' cordin ' ter my onderstandin ' uv hit , " said Uncle Bob , whipping up his horses . " What 's dat , Brer Bob ? " asked Daddy Jake ; and as soon as Uncle Bob had yelled at him Dumps 's query and his answer to it , the old man said : " Yer wrong , Brer Bob ; I ' members well de fus ' fourf uv July ; hit wuz er man , honey . Marse Fofer July wuz er man , an ' de day wuz name atter him . He wuz er pow'ful fightin ' man ; but den who it wuz he fit I mos ' furgot , hit 's ben so long ergo ; but I ' members , do , I wuz er right smart slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ole marster , yer pa 's gran'pa , to er big dinner wat dey had on de Jeems Riber , in ole Furginny ; an ' dat day , sar , Marse Fofer July wuz dar ; an ' he made er big speech ter de wite folks , caze I hyeard ' em clappin ' uv dey han 's . I nuber seed ' im , but I hyeard he wuz dar , do , an ' I knows he wuz dar , caze I sho'ly hyeard ' em clappin ' uv dey han 's ; an ' , ' cordin ' ter de way I ' members bout'n it , dis is his birfday , wat de folks keeps plum till yet , caze dey ai n't no men nowerdays like Marse Fofer July . He wuz er gre't man , an ' he had sense , too ; an ' den , ' sides dat , he wuz some er de fus ' famblys in dem days . Wy , his folks usen ter visit our wite folks . I helt his horse fur ' im de many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knowed some uv his niggers ; but den dat 's ben er long time ergo . " " But what was he writin ' about , Daddy ? " asked Diddie , who remembered the picture too well to give up the " writing part . " " He wuz jes signin ' some kin ' er deeds or sump'n , " said Daddy . " I du n no wat he wuz writin ' erbout ; but den he wuz er man , caze he lived in my recommembrunce , an ' I done seed ' im myse'f . " That settled the whole matter , though Diddie was not entirely satisfied ; but , as the wagon drove up to the creek bank just then , she was too much interested in the barbecue to care very much for " Marse Fofer July . " The children all had their fishing-lines and hooks , and as soon as they were on the ground started to find a good place to fish . Dilsey got some bait from the negro boys , and baited the hooks ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white and black , perched upon the roots of trees or seated flat on the ground , watching intently their hooks , which they kept bobbing up and down so fast that the fish must have been very quick indeed to catch them . They soon wearied of such dull sport , and began to set their wits to work to know what to do next . " Le 's go ' possum-huntin ' , " suggested Dilsey . " There ai n't any ' possums in the daytime , " said Diddie . " Yes dey is , Miss Diddie , lots uv ' em ; folks jes goes at night fur ter save time . I knows how ter hunt fur ' possums ; I kin tree ' em jes same as er dog . " And the children , delighted at the novelty of the thing , all started off " ' possum-hunting , " for Mammy was helping unpack the dinner-baskets , and was not watching them just then . They wandered off some distance , climbing over logs and falling into mud-puddles , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the trees , looking for the ' possums , and thereby missed seeing the impediments in the way . At length Dilsey called out , " Hyear he is ! Hyear de ' possum ! " and they all came to a dead halt under a large oak-tree , which Dilsey and Chris , and even Diddie and Dumps , I regret to say , prepared to climb . But the climbing consisted mostly in active and fruitless endeavors to make a start , for Dilsey was the only one of the party who got as much as three feet from the ground ; but she actually did climb up until she reached the first limb , and then crawled along it until she got near enough to shake off the ' possum , which proved to be a big chunk of wood that had lodged up there from a falling branch , probably ; and when Dilsey shook the limb it fell down right upon Riar 's upturned face , and made her nose bleed . " Wat you doin ' , you nigger you ? " demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . " I dar ' yer ter come down out'n dat tree , an ' I 'll beat de life out'n yer ; I 'll larn yer who ter be shakin ' chunks on . " " In vain did Dilsey apologize , and say she thought it was a " ' possum ; " Riar would listen to no excuse ; and as soon as Dilsey reached the ground they had a rough-and-tumble fight , in which both parties got considerably worsted in the way of losing valuable hair , and of having their eyes filled with dirt and their clean dresses all muddied ; but Tot was so much afraid Riar , her little nurse and maid , would get hurt that she screamed and cried , and refused to be comforted until the combatants suspended active hostilities , though they kept up quarrelling for some time , even after they had recommenced their search for ' possums . " Dilsey do n't know how to tree no ' possums , " said Riar , contemptuously , after they had walked for some time , and anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kin , " retorted Dilsey ; " I kin tree ' em jes ez same as er dog , ef'n dar 's any ' possums fur ter tree ; but I ca n't make ' possums , do ; an ' ef dey ai n't no ' possums , den I ca n't tree ' em , dat 's all . " " Maybe they do n't come out on the Fourf uv July , " said Dumps . " Maybe ' possums keeps it same as peoples . " " Now , maybe dey duz , " said Dilsey , who was glad to have some excuse for her profitless ' possum-hunting ; and the children , being fairly tired out , started back to the creek bank , when they came upon Uncle Snake-bit Bob , wandering through the woods , and looking intently on the ground . " What are you looking for , Uncle Bob ? " asked Diddie . " Des er few buckeyes , honey , " answered the old man . " What you goin ' ter do with ' em ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his search . " Well , I do n't want ter die no drunkard , myse'f , " said Uncle Bob , whose besetting sin was love of whiskey . " Does buckeyes keep folks from dying drunkards ? " asked Dumps . " Dat 's wat dey sez ; an ' I ' lowed I 'd lay me in er few , caze I 've allers hyearn dat dem folks wat totes a buckeye in dey lef britches pocket , an ' den ernudder in de right-han ' coat pocket , dat dey ai n't gwine die no drunkards . " " But if they would stop drinkin ' whiskey they would n't die drunkards anyhow , would they , Uncle Bob ? " " Well , I du n no , honey ; yer pinnin ' de ole nigger mighty close ; de whiskey mout hab sump'n ter do wid it ; I ai n't sputin ' dat -- but wat I stan 's on is dis : dem folks wat I seed die drunk , dey nuber had no buckeyes in dey pockets ; caze I ' members dat oberseer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' he runned , he did , fur ter git ' way fum de things wat he seed atter him ; an ' he jumped into de riber , an ' he got drownded ; an ' I wuz dar wen dey pulled ' im out ; an ' I sez ter Brer John Small , who wuz er standin ' dar , sez I , now I lay yer he ai n't got no buckeyes in his pockets ; and wid dat me ' n Brer John we tuck'n turnt his pockets wrong side outerds ; an ' , less yer soul , chile , hit wuz jes like I say ; DAR WA' N'T NO BUCKEYES DAR ! Well , I 'd b'lieved in de ole sayin ' befo ' , but dat jes kinter sot me on it fas'er ' n eber ; an ' I do n't cyare wat de wedder is , nor wat de hurry is ; hit may rain an ' hit may shine , an ' de time may be er pressin ' , but ole Bob he do n't stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckeyes in his pockets . But I seed ' em gittin ' ready fur dinner as I comed erlong , an ' you chil'en better be er gittin ' toerds de table . " That was enough for the little folks , and they hurried back to the creek . The table was formed by driving posts into the ground , and laying planks across them , and had been fixed up the day before by some of the men . The dinner was excellent -- barbecued mutton and shote and lamb and squirrels , and very fine " gumbo , " and plenty of vegetables and watermelons and fruits , and fresh fish which the negroes had caught in the seine , for none of the anglers had been successful . Everybody was hungry , for they had had very early breakfast , and , besides , it had been a fatiguing day , for most of the negroes had walked the three miles , and then had danced and played games nearly all the morning , and so they were ready for dinner . And everybody seemed very happy and gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's torn dresses and dirty faces that she could not regain her good-humor all at once ; and then , too , Dumps had lost her sun-bonnet , and there were some unmistakable freckles across her little nose , and so Mammy looked very cross , and grumbled a good deal , though her appetite seemed good , and she did full justice to the barbecue . Now Mammy had some peculiar ideas of her own as to the right and proper way for ladies to conduct themselves , and one of her theories was that no white lady should ever eat heartily in company ; she might eat between meals , if desired , or even go back after the meal was over and satisfy her appetite ; but to sit down with a party of ladies and gentlemen and make a good " square " meal , Mammy considered very ungenteel indeed . This idea she was always trying to impress upon the little girls , so as to render them as ladylike as possible in the years to come ; and on this occasion , as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations present , she was horrified to see Dumps eating as heartily , and with as evident satisfaction , as if she had been alone in the nursery at home . Diddie , too , had taken her second piece of barbecued squirrel , and seemed to be enjoying it very much , when a shake of Mammy 's head reminded her of the impropriety of such a proceeding ; so she laid aside the squirrel , and minced delicately over some less substantial food . The frowns and nods , however , were thrown away upon Dumps ; she ate of everything she wanted until she was fully satisfied , and I grieve to say that her papa encouraged her in such unladylike behavior by helping her liberally to whatever she asked for . But after the dinner was over , and after the darkies had played and danced until quite late , and after the ladies and gentlemen had had several very interesting games of euchre and whist , and after the little folks had wandered about as much as they pleased -- swinging on grape-vines and riding on " saplings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , " and tiring themselves out generally -- and after they had been all duly stowed away in the spring-wagon and had started for home , then Mammy began at Dumps about her unpardonable appetite . " But I was hungry , Mammy , " apologized the little girl . " I do n't cyar ef'n yer wuz , " replied Mammy ; " dat ai n't no reason fur yer furgittin ' yer manners , an ' stuffin ' yerse'f right fo ' all de gemmuns . Miss Diddie dar , she burhavt like er little lady , jes kinter foolin ' wid her knife an ' fork , an ' nuber eatin nuffin ' hardly ; an ' dar you wuz jes er pilin ' in shotes an ' lams an ' squ'ls , an ' roas'n yurs , an ' pickles an ' puddin' 's an ' cakes an ' watermillions , tell I wuz dat shame fur ter call yer marster 's darter ! " And poor little Dumps , now that the enormity of her sin was brought home to her , and the articles eaten so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boa-constrictor , and the tears fell from her eyes as Mammy continued : " I done must er heap er chil'en in my time , but I ai n't nuber seed no wite chile eat fo de gemmuns like you duz . It pyears like I ca n't nuber larn you no manners , nohow . " " Let de chile erlone , Sis Rachel , " interposed Uncle Bob ; " she ai n't no grown lady , an ' I seed marster he'p'n uv her plate hisse'f ; she nuber eat none too much , consid'n hit wuz de Fourf uv July . " " Did n't I eat no shotes an ' lambs , Uncle Bob ? " asked Dumps , wiping her eyes . Illustration : " SWINGING ON GRAPE-VINES AND RIDING ON SAPLINGS . " " I do n't b'lieve yer did , " said Uncle Bob . " I seed yer eat er squ'l or two , an ' er few fish , likely , an ' dem , wid er sprinklin ' uv roas'n yurs an ' cakes , wuz de mos ' wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wuz too much , " said Mammy , " right befo ' de gemmuns . " But Dumps was comforted at Uncle Bob 's moderate statement of the case , and so Mammy 's lecture lost much of its intended severity . As they were driving through the grove before reaching the house it was quite dark , and they heard an owl hooting in one of the trees . " I see yer keep on sayin ' yer sass , " said Daddy Jake , addressing the owl . " Ef'n I 'd er done happen ter all you is ' bout'n hit , I 'd let hit erlone myse'f . " " What 's he sayin ' ? " asked Diddie . " Wy , do n't yer hyear him , honey , er sayin , " Who cooks fur you-oo-a ? Who cooks fur you-oo-a ? Ef you 'll cook for my folks , Den I 'll cook fur y ' all-l-lll ? " " Well , hit wuz ' long er dat very chune wat he los ' his eyes , an ' ca n't see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wuz him , I 'd let folks ' cookin ' erlone . " " Ca n't you tell us about it , Daddy ? " asked Dumps . " I ai n't got de time now , " said the old man , " caze hyear 's de wagin almos ' at de do ' ; an ' , let erlone dat , I ai n't nuber hyeard ' twus good luck ter be tellin ' no tales on de Fourf uv July ; but ef'n yer kin come ter my cabin some ebenin ' wen yer 's er airin ' uv yerse'fs , den I 'll tell yer jes wat I hyearn ' bout'n de owl , an ' ' struck yer in er many er thing wat yer do n't know now . " And now the wagon stopped at the back gate , and the little girls and Mammy and the little darkies got out , and Mammy made the children say good-night to Daddy Jake and Uncle Bob , and they all went into the house very tired and very sleepy , and very dirty , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CHAPTER XVI . " ' STRUCK'N UV DE CHIL'EN . " It was several days before the children could get off to Daddy Jake 's cabin to hear about the owl ; but on Saturday evening , after dinner , Mammy said they might go ; and , having promised to go straight to Daddy Jake 's house , and to come home before dark , they all started off . Daddy Jake was the oldest negro on the plantation -- perhaps the oldest in the State . He had been raised by Major Waldron 's grandfather in Virginia , and remembered well the Revolutionary War ; and then he had been brought to Mississippi by Major Waldron 's father , and remembered all about the War of 1812 and the troubles with the Indians . It had been thirty years or more since Daddy Jake had done any work . He had a very comfortable cabin ; and although his wives ( for the old man had been married several times ) were all dead , and many of his children were now old and infirm , he had a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , too , his master cared very particularly for his comfort , and saw that Daddy Jake had good fires , and that his clothes were kept clean and mended , and his food nicely cooked ; so the old man passed his days in peace and quiet . The children found him now lying stretched out on a bench in front of his cabin , while Polly , his great-granddaughter , was scratching and " looking " his head . " We 've come for you to tell us about the Owl , Daddy , " said Diddie , after she had given the old man some cake and a bottle of muscadine wine that her mother had sent to him . " All right , little misses , " replied Daddy ; and , sitting up on the bench , he lifted Tot beside him , while Diddie and Dumps sat on the door-sill , and Dilsey and Chris and Riar and Polly sat flat on the ground . " Well , yer see de Owl , " began Daddy Jake , " he usen fur ter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in de night ; an ' one time he wuz in his kitchen er cookin ' uv his dinner , wen hyear come de Peafowl er struttin ' by . Well , in dem days de Peafowl he nuber had none er dem eyes on his tail wat he got now ; his tail wuz des er clean blue . " " Did you see him , Daddy ? " interrupted Dumps . Illustration : " ' STRUCK'N UV DE CHIL'EN . " " No , honey , I ai n't seed ' im wen he wuz dat way ; dat wuz fo ' my time ; but den I know hit 's de truf , do ' ; his tail wuz er clar blue dout'n no eyes on it ; an ' he wuz er pow'ful proud bird , an ' , ' stid er him ' ten'in ter his bizness , he des prumeraded de streets an ' de roads , an ' he felt hisse'f too big fur ter ten ' ter his wuck . Well , de Owl knowed dat , an ' so wen he seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in de kitchen er cookin ' , it kinter hu't his feelin 's , so he tuck'n holler 'd at de Peafowl , " ' Whooo cooks fur you-oo-a ?

' " Now he jes done dat out'n pyo ' sass'ness , caze he knowed de Peafowl felt hisse'f ' bove cookin ' ; an ' wen de Peafowl hyeard dat , he ' gun ter git mad ; an ' he ' lowed dat ef'n de Owl said dat ter him ergin dey 'd be er fuss on his han 's . Well , de nex ' day de Owl seed him comin ' , an ' he ' gun fur ter scrape out'n his pots an ' skillets , an ' ez he scrope ' em he holler 'd out , " ' Whoo cooks fur you-oo-a ?

" " The rattlesnake ? " asked Diddie , in horror . " Hit 's true , des like I 'm tellin ' yer , " said Daddy ; " hit wuz de rattlesnake ; an ' dey 's de bes ' doctors dey is ' mongst all de beases . Yer may see him creepin ' ' long the de grass like he do n't know nuffin ' , but he kin doctor den . " " How does he doctor , Daddy ? " asked Dumps .

" The children begged his pardon , and promised not to interrupt again , and Daddy Jake continued his story . " Yes , de rattlesnake doctored on him , an ' atter er wile he got so he could see some uv nights ; but he ca n't see much in de daytime , do ; an ' as fur de Peafowl , he shuck an ' he shuck his tail , but dem spots is dar tell yit !

" But now , as it was getting late , Daddy said he was afraid to stay out in the night air , as it sometimes " gun him de rheumatiz , " and wound up his remarks by saying , " Tell yer ma I 'm mighty ' bleeged fur de cake an ' drinkin 's , an ' weneber yer gits de time , an ' kin come down hyear any ebenin ' , de ole man he 'll ' struck yer , caze he 's gwine erway fo ' long , an ' dem things wat he knows is onbeknownst ter de mos ' uv folks .

" The children were very much awed at Daddy 's forebodings , and Dumps insisted on shaking hands with him , as she felt that she would probably never see him again , and they all bade him good-night , and started for the house . " Miss Diddie , did you know ole Daddy wuz er trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's cabin . " What 's er trick nigger ? " asked Dumps . " Wy , do n't yer know , Miss Dumps ?

Did n't yer hyear wat he said ' bout'n de snakes ? an ' de folks all sez ez how ole Daddy is er trick nigger , an ' dat 's wat makes him do n't die . " " Well , I wish I was a trick nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lordy , Miss Dumps , yer 'd better not be er talkin ' like dat , " said Dilsey , her eyes open wide in horror . " Hit 's pow'ful wicked ter be trick niggers . " " I do n't know what 's the matter with Dumps , " said Diddie ; " she 's gettin ' ter be so sinful ; an ' ef she do n't stop it , I sha' n't sleep with her . She 'll be er breakin ' out with the measles or sump'n some uv these days , jes fur er judgment on her ; an ' I do n't want ter be catchin ' no judgments just on account of her badness . " " Well , I 'll take it back , Diddie , " humbly answered Dumps . " I did n't know it was wicked ; and wo n't you sleep with me now ? " Diddie having promised to consider the matter , the little folks walked slowly on to the house , Dilsey and Chris and Riar all taking turns in telling them the wonderful spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " trick-bags . " CHAPTER XVII . WHAT BECAME OF THEM . Well , of course , I ca n't tell you all that happened to these little girls . I have tried to give you some idea of how they lived in their Mississippi home , and I hope you have been amused and entertained ; and now , as " Diddie " said about her book , I 've got to " wind up , " and tell you what became of them . The family lived happily on the plantation until the war broke out in 1861 . Then Major Waldron clasped his wife to his heart , kissed his daughters , shook hands with his faithful slaves , and went as a soldier to Virginia ; and he is sleeping now on the slope of Malvern Hill , where he " Nobly died for Dixie . " The old house was burned during the war , and on the old plantation where that happy home once stood there are now three or four chimneys and an old tumbled-down gin-house . That is all . The agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of her husband and home , broke the heart and sickened the brain of Mrs. Waldron ; and in the State Lunatic Asylum is an old white-haired woman , with a weary , patient look in her eyes , and this gentle old woman , who sits day after day just looking out at the sunshine and the flowers , is the once beautiful " mamma " of Diddie , Dumps , and Tot . Diddie grew up to be a very pretty , graceful woman , and when the war began was in her eighteenth year . She was engaged to one of the young men in the neighborhood ; and , though she was so young , her father consented to the marriage , as her lover was going into the army , and wanted to make her his wife before leaving . So , early in ' 61 , before Major Waldron went to Virginia , there was a quiet wedding in the parlor one night ; and not many days afterwards the young Confederate soldier donned his gray coat , and rode away with Forrest 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bringing the sad , sad story --  A riderless horse : a funeral march : Dead on the field of glory ! " After his death her baby came to gladden the young widow 's desolate life ; and he is now almost grown , handsome and noble , and the idol of his mother . Diddie is a widow still . She was young and pretty when the war ended , and has had many offers of marriage ; but a vision of a cold white face , with its fair hair dabbled in blood , is ever in her heart . So Diddie lives for her boy . Their home is in Natchez now ; for of course they could never live in the old place any more . When the slaves were free , they had no money to rebuild the houses , and the plantation has never been worked since the war . The land is just lying there useless , worthless ; and the squirrels play in and out among the trees , and the mocking-birds sing in the honeysuckles and magnolias and rose-bushes where the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the happy slave-voices used to sing " Monkey Motions , " and the merry feet used to dance to " Cotton-eyed Joe , " weeds and thick underbrush have all grown up , and partridges build their nests there ; and sometimes , at dusk , a wild-cat or a fox may be seen stealing across the old play-ground . Tot , long years ago , before the war even , when she was yet a pure , sinless little girl , was added to that bright band of angel children who hover around the throne of God ; and so she was already there , you see , to meet and welcome her " papa " when his stainless soul went up from Malvern Hill . Well , for " Mammy " and " Daddy Jake " and " Aunt Milly " and " Uncle Dan'l , " " dat angel " has long since " blowed de horn , " and I hope and believe they are happily walking " dem golden streets " in which they had such implicit faith , and of which they never wearied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all scattered ; some doing well , some badly ; some living , some dead . Aunt Sukey 's Jim , who married Candace that Christmas-night , is a politician . He has been in the Legislature , and spends his time in making long and exciting speeches to the loyal leaguers against the Southern whites , all unmindful of his happy childhood , and of the kind and generous master who strove in every way to render his bondage ( for which that master was in no way to blame ) a light and happy one . Uncle Snake-bit Bob is living still . He has a little candy-store in a country town . He does not meddle with politics . He says , " I do n't cas ' my suffrins fur de Dimercracks , nur yit fur de ' Publicans . I ca n't go ' ginst my color by votin ' de Dimercrack papers ; an ' as fur dem ' Publicans ! Well , ole Bob he done hyearn wat de Book say ' boutn publicans an ' sinners , an ' dat 's ernuff fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; pretty soon he 'll hatter shove off fur dat ' heb'nly sho ' ; ' an ' wen de Lord sen ' atter him , he do n't want dat angel ter cotch him in no kinwunshuns ' long wid ' publicans an ' sinners . ' " And so Uncle Bob attends to his store , and mends chairs and tubs , and deals extensively in chickens and eggs ; and perhaps he is doing just as well as if he were in Congress . Dilsey and Chris and Riar are all women now , and are all married and have children of their own ; and nothing delights them more than to tell to their little ones what " us an ' de wite chil'en usen ter do . " And the last I heard of Aunt Nancy , the " tender , " she was going to school , but not progressing very rapidly . She did learn her letters once , but , having to stop school to make a living , she soon forgot them , and she explained it by saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dem readin 's , he wuz sich er onstedfus ' man , an ' gittin ' drunk , an ' votin ' an ' sich , tell I furgittin ' wat he larnt me ; but dey 's er colored gemman fum de Norf wat 's tuck him up er pay-school ober hyear in de ' catermy , an ' ef'n I kin git him fur ter take out'n his pay in dat furmifuge wat I makes , I ' low ter go ter him er time er two , caze he 's er membah ub de Zion Chu'ch , an ' er mighty stedfus ' man , an ' dat wat he larns me den I 'll stay larnt . " And Dumps ? Well , the merry , light-hearted little girl is an " old maid " now ; and if Mammy could see her , she would think she was " steady " enough at last . Somebody , you know , must attend to the wants and comfort of the gray-haired woman in the asylum ; and Diddie had her boy to support and educate , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is doing what Uncle Snake-bit Bob told the Sunday-school children that God had made them to do ; for Dumps is doing " DE BES ' SHE KIN .
