RIVER DRIFTWOOD . AT the head of tide-water on the river there is a dam , and above it is a large mill-pond , where most of the people who row and sail keep their boats all summer long . I like , perhaps once a year , to cruise around the shores of this pretty sheet of water ; but I am always conscious of the dam above it and the dam below it , and of being confined between certain limits . I rarely go beyond a certain point on the lower or tide river , as people call it , but I always have the feeling that I can go to Europe , if I like , or anywhere on the high seas ; and when I unfasten the boat there is no dam or harbor bar , or any barrier whatever between this and all foreign ports . Far up among the hills the ocean comes , and its tide ebbs and flows . *Then the tide goes out , the narrow reaches of the river become rapids , where a rushing stream fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a good deal of skill to guide a boat down safely . Where the river is wide , at low tide one can only see the mud flats and broad stretches of green marsh grass . But when the tide is in , it is a noble and dignified stream . There are no rapids and only a slow current , where the river from among the inland mountains flows along , finding its way to the sea , which has come part way to welcome the company of springs and brooks that have answered to its call . A thousand men band themselves together , and they are one regimen t ; a thousand little streams flow together , and are one river ; but one fancies that they do not lose themselves altogether ; while the individuality of a river must come mainly from the different characters of its tributaries . The shape of its shores and the quality of the soil it passes over determine certain things about it , hut the life of it is something by itself , as the life of a man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be the first spring which overflows steadily and makes a brook , which some second spring joins , and the third , and the fourth ; arid at last there is a great stream , in which the later brooks seem to make little difference . I should like to find the very beginning and head-water of my river . I should be sorry if it were a pond , though somewhere in the ground underneath there would be a spring that kept the secret and was in command and under marching orders to the sea , commissioned to recruit as it went along . Here at the head of tide-water it first meets the sea , and then when the tide is in there is the presence of royalty , or at least its deputies . The river is a grand thing when it is river and sea together ; but how one misses the ocean when the tide is out , for in the great place it filled the stream from the hills , after all , looks of little consequence . The river is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the few roads were rough , and railroads were not even dreamed of . The earliest chapter of its history that I know is that it was full of salmon and other fish , and was a famous fishing-ground with the Indians , who were masters of its neigh boring country . To tell its whole story one would have to follow the fashion of the old Spanish writers whom Garcilasso de la Vega says he will not imitate , in the first chapter of his Commentaries of the Yncas , - that delightful composition of unconscious pathos and majestic lies . When his predecessors in the field of literature wished to write on any subject whatever , he solemnly tells us , they always began with a history of the globe . One can not help wishing that he had not disdained to // follow their example , and had given his theories , which would have been wildly ahead of even the fancies of his time , in general , and full of most amusing little departures from the truth when he came down to details . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is but seldom , as yet , that people really care much for anything for its own sake , until it is proved to have some connection with human-kind . We are slow to take an interest in the personality of our neighbors who are not men , or dogs , or horses , or at least some creature who can he made to understand a little of our own spoken language . Who is going to he the linguist who learns the first word of an old crow 's warning to his mate , or how a little dog expresses himself when he asks a big one to come and rout his troublesome enemy ? How much we shall know when the pimpernel teaches us how she makes her prophecies of the weather , and how long we shall have to go to school when people are expected to talk to the trees , and birds , and beasts , in their own language ! What tune could it have been that Orpheus and Amphion played , to which the beasts listened , and even the trees and stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us back the gift , or shall we owe it to the successors of those friendly old saints who talked with the birds and fishes ? We could have schools for them , if we once could understand them , and could educate them into being more useful to us . There would be intelligent swordfish for submarine divers , and we could send swallows to carry messages , and all the creatures that know how to burrow in the earth would bring us the treasures out of it . I should have a larger calling acquaintance than ever out-of-doors , and my neighbors down river would present me to congenial friends whom as yet I have not discovered . The gods are always drawing like toward like , and making them ac quainted , if Homer may be believed , but we are apt to forget that this is true of any creatures but ourselves . It is not necessary to tame them before they can be familiar and responsive ; we can meet them on their own ground , and be surprised to find how much we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn some of our customs ; we should be wise if we let them tame ns to make use of some of theirs . They share other instincts and emotions with us beside surprise , or suspicion , or fear . They are curiously thoughtful ; they act no more from unconscious instinct than we do ; at least , they are called upon to decide as many questions of action or direction , and there are many emergencies of life when we are far more helpless and foolish than they . It is easy to say that other orders of living creatures exist on a much lower plane than ourselves ; we know very little about it , after all . They are often gifted in some way that we are not ; they may even carry some virtue of ours to a greater height than we do . But the day will come for a more truly universal suffrage than we dream of now , when the meaning of every living thing is understood , and it is given its rights and accorded its true value for its life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed by him ; its material shape is the manifestation of a thought , and to each body there is given a spirit . The great gulls watch me float along the river , curiously , and sail in the air overhead . Who knows what they say of me when they talk together ; and what are they thinking about when they fly quickly out of sight ? Perhaps they know something about me that I do not know of myself yet ; and so may the musk-rat , as he hurries through the water with a little green branch in his mouth which will make a salad for his supper . He watches me with his sharp eyes , and whisks into his hole in the sunny side of the island . I have a re // spect for him ; he is a busy creature , and he lives well . You might be hospitable and ask me to supper , musk-rat ! I do n't know whether J should care much for you if I were another musk-rat , or you were a human being , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd mark in the fur on the top of your head , and that is something . I suppose the captive mussels in your den are quaking now at hearing you come in . I have lost sight of you , but I shall remember where your house is . I do not think people are thankful enough who live out of the reach of beasts that would eat them . When one thinks of whole races of small creatures like the mussels which are the natural and proper food of others , it seems an awful fact and necessity of nature ; perhaps , however , no more awful than our natural death appears to us . But there is something distressing about being eaten , and having one 's substance minister to a superior existence ! It hurts one 's pride . A death that preserves and elevates our identity is much more consoling and satisfactory ; but what can reconcile a bird to its future as part of the tissues of a cat , going stealthily afoot , and by nature treacherous ? Who can say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chain ? One thing is made the prey of another . In some way our present state ministers to the higher condition to which we are coming . The grass is made somehow from the ground , and presently that is turned into beef , and that goes to make part of a human being . We are not certain what an angel may be ; but the life in us now will be necessary to the making of one by and by . There is a wise arrangement in this merging and combining . It makes more room in the world . We must eat our fellows and be eaten to keep things within a proper limit . If all the orders of life were self-existing , and if all the springs that make up the river flowed down to the sea separately and independently , there would oe an awful confusion and chaos still ; but this leads one to think of the transmigration of souls and other puzzling subjects ! I shall have to end with an ignorant discourse about the globe instead of having begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , leads to the sea , and from any port one can push off toward another sea of boundless speculation and curious wonderings about this world , familiar , and yet so great a mystery . There are a thousand things to remember and to say about the river , which seems to be of little use in the half dozen miles I know best , after it has made itself of great consequence by serving to carry perhaps a dozen or twenty mills , of one kind and another . Between its dams it has a civilized and subjected look , but below the last falls , at the landing , it apparently feels itself to be its own master , and serves in no public capacity except to carry a boat now and then , and give the chance for building some weirs , as it offers some good fishing when the alewives and bass come up , with bony and muddy shad , that are about as good to eat as a rain-soaked paper of pins . I think its chief use is its beauty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be It is the eastern branch of the Piscataqua , which separates the States of Maine and New Hampshire ; and I , being a lawless borderer , beg you to follow for a raid on the shores , not for pillaging the farms and cattle-lifting , but to see the trees and their shadows in the water : the high , steep banks where the great pines of Maine thrive , on one hand , and the gently sloping Southern New Hampshire fields fringed with willows and oaks on the other . When you catch sight of a tall lateen sail and a strange , clumsy craft that looks heavy and low in the water , you will like to know that its ancestor was copied from a Nile boat , from which a sensible old sea-captain took a lesson // in ship-building many years ago . The sail is capitally fitted to catch the uncertain wind , which is apt to come in flaws and gusts between the high , irregular banks of the river ; and the boat is called a gundalow , but sometimes spelled gondola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piscataqua and its branches , and the sight of them brings a curiously foreign element into the New England scenery ; for I never see the great peaked sail coming round a point without a quick association with the East , with the Mediterranean ports or the Nile itself , with its ruins and its desert and the bright blue sky overhead ; with mummies and scarabei and the shepherd kings ; with the pyramids and Sphinx - that strange group , so old one shudders at the thou , ht of it - standing clear against the horizon . A hundred years ago the northern country was covered for the most part with heavy timber , and the chief business at Berwick was receiving this from the lumbermen , and sending it to Portsmouth to be reshipped , or direct to the West Indies , to be bartered for rum and tobacco and molisses , which might be either brought home at once , or sent to Russia , to be exchanged again for iron and sailcloth and cordage . Not forty years ago there were still twenty gundalows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but two , and long after that the packet boat went regularly every other day to Portsmouth . Until the days of the railroads , most of the freight came by water , and the packet skippers were important men . I have always wished to know something more of the history of the quaint little packet storehouse , which until within a year or two stood in the mill-yard , just below the falls . It was built of heavy timbers , as if it might some day be called upon to resist a battering-ram . The stories were very low , and the upper one projected over the water , with a beam to which was fastened a tackle and fall to hoist and lower the goods . It was a little building , but there was a great air of consequence about it . It was painted a dark red , which the weather had dulled a good deal , and it leaned to one side . Nobody knew how old it was ; it was like a little old woman who belonged to a good family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember a great many valuable people and events which everybody else had forgotten . It was the last of the warehouses that used to stand on the river-banks , and I was sorry when it was pulled down . The old wharves have almost disappeared , too , though their timbers can still be seen here and there . It sometimes takes me a whole afternoon to go two miles down river . There are many reasons why I should stop every now and then under one bank or another ; to look up through the trees at the sky , or at their pictures in the water ; or to let the boat lie still , until one can watch the little fish come back to their playground on the yellow sand and gravel ; or to see the frogs , that splashed into the water at my approach , poke their heads out a little way to croak indignantly , or raise a loud note such as Scotch bagpipers drive out of the pipes before they start a tune . The swallows dart like bats along the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white butterfly float by , and reach out for it ; it looks so frail and little in the river . When the cardinal flowers are in bloom I go from place to place until I have gathered a deckload ; and as I push off the boat it leaves the grass bent down , and the water-mint that was crushed sends a delicious fragrance after me , and I catch at a piece and put a leaf in my mouth , and row away lazily to get a branch of oak or maple leaves to keep the sun off my flowers . Cardinals are quick to wilt , and hang their proud heads wearily . They keep royal state in the shade , and one imagines that the other flowers and all the weeds at the water 's edge take // care to bow to them as often as the wind comes by , and pay them honor . They are like fine court ladies in their best gowns , standing on the shore . Perhaps they are sending messages down the river and across the seas , or waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whittier 's high-born Amy Wentworth and her sailor lovcr , for they seem like flowers from a palace garden , that are away from home masquerading and waiving ceremony , and taking the country air . They wear a color that is the sign of high ecclesiastical rank , and the temper of their minds would make them furies if they fought for church and state . They are no radicals ; they are tories and aristocrats ; they belong to the old nobility among flowers . It would he a pity if the rank marsh grass overran them , or if the pickerel weed should wade ashore to invade them and humble their pride . They are flowers that , after all , one should not try to put into vases together . They have , like many other flowers , too marked an individuality , and there is more pleasure to be taken from one tall and slender spire of blossoms by itself , just as it is pleasanter to be alone with a person one admires and enjoys . To crowd some flowers together you lose all delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of the mass of color or of their perfume ; and there are enough bright flowers and fragrant flowers that are only beautiful in masses . To look at some flowers huddled together and losing all their grace and charm is like trying to find companionship and sympathy by looking for a minute at a crowd of people . But there is a low trait of acquisitiveness in human nature . I pick cardinal flowers by the armful , and nothing less than a blue-and-white ginger pot full of daisies is much satisfaction . But to most people one tree , or flower , or river is as good as another , and trees and flowers and rivers are to be found without trouble , while there are some who would never know who has lived beside my river unless it were told here . That says at once that their fame at best is provincial , except for peppery little Captain John Paul Jones , who gathered the ship 's company of the Ranger from these nein hboring farms . Old people , who died not many years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth , with his sword point scratching the ground ; a little wasp of a fellow , with a temper like a blaze of the gunpowder whose smoke he loved . One can imagine him scrambling up the shore here to one of* the old farmhouses , as short as a boy , but as tall as a grenadier , in his pride and dignity , and marching into the best room , in all the vainglory and persuasiveness of his uniform , to make sure of a good fellow whose looks he liked , and whom he promised to send home a gall ant hero , with his sea-chest full of prize-money . And afterward he would land again at one of the stately old colonial mansions that used to stand beside the river , at the Walhingford house , by Madam 's Cove , or at the Hamilton house , and be received with befitting ceremony . There were many fine houses in this region in old times , but only one still lingers , - this same Hamilton house , - which seems to me unrivaled for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air which I have found it hard to match in any house I have ever seen . It is square and gray , with four great chimneys , and many dormer windows in its high-peaked roof ; it stands on a point below which the river is at its widest . The rows of poplars and its terraced garden have fallen and been spoiled by time , but a company of great elms stand guar ( i over it , and the sunset reddens its windows , and the days of the past seem to have come back , when one is near it , its whole aspect is so remote from the spirit of the present . Inside there are great halls and square rooms with carved // wood-work , arched windows and mahogany window-seats , and fire-places that are wide enough almost for a seat in the chimney - corner . In the country about I have heard many a tradition of the way this house was kept ; of the fine ladies and gentlemen , and the great dinner-parties , and the guests who used to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight evening at the turn of the tide . In those days the wharves that are fast being washed away were strong enough , and there were warehouses and storehouses and piles of timber all along the river . The builder of the house was a successful man , who made a great fortune in the lucky West India trade of his time ; he was poor to begin with , but everything prospered steadily with his business interests , and one owes him a debt of gratitude for leaving so fine a house to delight our eyes . A little way up the shore there was formerly a shipyard , and I know of four ships that were built there much less than fifty years ago . My grandfather was part owner of them , and their names , with those of other ships , have been familiar to me from my babyhood . It is amusing that the ships of a family concerned in navigation seem to belong to it and to be part of it , as if they were children who had grown up and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chan , ed owners even , its fortunes are affectionately watched , and to know that a ship has been spoken at sea gives a good deal of pleasure beside the assurance that the cargo is so far on its way to market at Canton or Bombay . I remember wondering why the smooth green bank , where the dandelions were so thick in spring , should be called the shipyard by my family , and even why any one should call that corner of the town the Lower Landing , since nothing ever seemed to land , unless it were the fleets that children built from chips and shingles . It is a lovely , quiet place , and I often think of an early summer morning when I was going down river in a rowboat . The dandelions were sprinkled all over the short green grass , and high on the shore , under a great elm , were two wandering young musicians . They had evidently taken the wrong road , and discovered that this was a long lane that led only to the great house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been entertained , for they seemed very cheerful ; one played a violin , and the other danced . It was like a glimpse of sunshiny , idle Italy : the sparkling river and the blue sky , the wide green shores and the trees , and the great gray house with its two hall doors standing wide open , the lilacs in bloom , and no noise or hurry , - a quiet place , that the destroying left hand of progress had failed to touch . One day I was in one of the upper rooms of the Hamilton house in a dormer window , and I was amused at reading the nonsense some young girl had written on the wall . The view was beautiful , and I thou , ht she must have sat there with her work , or have watched the road or the river for some one whom she wished to see coming . There were sentimental verses , written at different times . She seemed to have made a sort of scrapbook of the bit of wall , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; so I knew that it was 1802 , and in the summer , that she used to sit there in her favorite perch . This is one of her verses that I remember - " May you be blest with all that Heaven may send , Long life , good health , much pleasure in a friend ; May you in every clime most happy be , And when far distant often think of me . " It was very pleasant to catch this glimpse of girlhood in the old house . I wondered how she liked life as she grew older , and if the lover - if that were a lover - did think often enough of her , and come back to her at last from the distant climes . She could have // wished him nothing better than much pleasure in a friend . I do not know the history of many members of the family ; Colonel Hamilton and his consort are buried under a heavy monument in the Old Fields burying-ground , and at the end of the long epitaph is the solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange sight if one of his heavily laden little ships came up the river now ; but I like to think about those days , and how there might have happened to be some lumbermen from far inland , who were delighted to gossip with the sailors and carry back up into the country the stories of their voyage . When the French prisoners of war came into Portsmouth , I have beard old people say that there was a great excitement , and as the ships came in they looked like gardens , for the Frenchmen had lettuces for salads , and flowers groxving in boxes that were fastened on the decks ; and it was amusing to hear of these prisoners being let out on parole about the country towns , in Eliot and Newington and Kittery , and all up and down the river . Perhaps more than one of them found their way to the hospitable families in Berwick , and were entertained as became their rank and fortunes . In an old house in Eliot there is a little drawing made by one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a carnation , with the quaintly written request that charming Sally will sometimes think of the poor Ribi*re , who will never forget her . It is all that is left of what must have been a tender friendship between this gallant young Frenchman and my grandmother . I found it once among her copy-books , and letters from her girl friends , and love-letters from my grandfather which he sent home to her from sea . She was very young when the poor Rib&amp;re was so sorry to part from her , for she married at eighteen ( and died at twenty-five ) . I knew very little about her until I found in the garret the little brass-nailed trnnk that had kept her secrets for me . I am sure she often made one of the company that used to come up the river to take tea and g* home by moonlight . She was a beautiful girl , and everybody was fond of her . The poor Rib*re sat beside her in the boat , I have no doubt ; and perhaps it was in the terraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked the flower he painted , and no doubt he carried it away with him when he was set free again , and was not a prisoner of war any longer . There was formerly a bright array of clerical gentlemen in the river towns , and it would be most amusing to collect the anecdotes which the old people of the last generation delighted to tell of them . Not to speak of the well-known Portsmouth divines , and of Dr. Stevens , of Kittery Point , there was the Reverend Mr. Litchfleld , of Kittery , who was called the fisher parson , and his neighbor , Parson Chandler , who might have been called the farmer parson , for he was a celebrated tiller of the soil , and his example was a great blessing to the members of his Eliot parish . The fields there slope to the south and west , and the grass grows green sooner than anywhere else in the region , and the fruits of the earth grow and ripen quickly . He taught his neighbors to improve upon the old fashions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he was driving from Portsmouth to Berwick , in his early manhood , with Daniel Webster for company , and when they passed this clergyman 's house Mr. Webster said that he should be perfectly satisfied if he could be as great a man as Parson Chandler ; and judging from the stories of his wisdom and eloquence , the young lawyer 's was no mean ambition . Mr. Litchfield , of Kittery , spent much of his time on week days in the apostolic business of catching fish ; and he was a man of rare wit and drollery , with a sailor-like serenity and confidence in everything 's coming out right at last , // and a true mariner 's readiness and intentness when there was work to be done . Once , at a conference in Portsmouth , the preacher failed to come , and some one had to furnish a sermon in his place . it fell to Mr. Litchfield 's share ; and old Dr. Buckminster said , when the discourse was ended , - it being extemporaneous and very eloquent , - " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting to find that many of the clergymen of that day seem to have been uncommonly practical men . One fancies that they all preached the better because much of their time was spent in a way that brought them in close contact with people 's every-day lives , it was no ideal human nature , studied from sermons and theological works , and classified and doomed at the recommendation of the old divines . One can believe that it was not abstract generalities of a state of sinfulness so much as particular weaknesses and short-comings that they condemned from their pulpits . Parson Litchfield could preach gallantly at some offender who stole from and lied about his lobster-pots when he took his text from Ananias and Sapphira , and Parson Chandler could be most impressive and ready with illustration when he chose the parable of the sower for the subject of his discourse . In Berwick there was a grave and solemn little man , whom all his great parish long remembered admiringly. the church where the whole town centred was at the Old Fields , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that anything , is left of it but a bit of paper I found one day , on which is written the names of the men who built it , and the sums of money and bundles of shingles or pieces of timber that each contributed . I do not know why this should have been so superstitious a neighborhood , but there seems to have been a great deal of trouble from ghosts , and it was the duty of the ministers to drive them away , or to " lay " them , as they called it then . An old man told me once that the parsons made a great secret of it . They met together in a room , which nobody was allowed to enter ; so whether it was a service with mysterious rites , or they only joked together , and thought it well to keep up the reverence in the rustic mind for the power of the priesthood , nobody knows to this day . There is still standing at the Landing a house that has always been said to be haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have risen again defiantly . It formerly stood very near the shore of the little harbor , if one may give that name to what was simply the head of navigation on the river . The family who built and owned it first all died long ago , but I never go by the house without thinking of its early history in those days , when the court end of the little town was next the river , and the old elms shaded the men who were busy with their trading and shipping , and the women who kept up a stately fashion of living in-doors , and walked proudly to and fro in the streets dressed in strange stuffs that had been brought home to them from across the seas . There was a fine set of people in the little town , and I*erwick held its head very high , and thought some of the neighboring towns of little consequence that have long since outgrown it and looked down upon it in their turn . It even has given up its place as the head of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only South Berwick now ; but I like to call it Berwick here , as it has a right to be called , for it was the oldest settlement , and the points of the compass should have been given to the newer centres of civilizatioii which were its offshoots . The oldest houses are , with one or two exceptions , by far the finest ones , and the one of which I have spoken still keeps up as well as it can the pride as well as the name of its first owner . One can not help being interested in this maa , // who was one of the earlier physicians of the town , and also bad a hand in the business that was connected with , the river . I have heard that he came from Plymouth in Massachusetts , and was a minister 's son ; hut if ever a man 's heart gloried in the good things of this life it was his , and there was not a trace of Puritan asceticism in his character . His first house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some terraces that still remain , hordered with rows of elms , and overlooked the river ; hut that was burnt , and afterward replaced by another , which was for some mysterious reason huilt at the foot of the terraces near the water . The doctor was said to he a very handsome man , and he dressed uncommonly well , delighting himself with fine broadcloth cloaks with red linings and silk facings ; and his visits to his admiring patients were paid on horseback , as was the cnstom then , hut he always rode an excellent horse , and dashed about the country in great splendor . He made an elaborate will , entailing his property in English fashion . lie waited to see how much General Lord or the other rich men of the town would pay toward any subscription , and then exceeded the most generous . He even asked bow much the richest man in the town was taxed , and paid of his own accord a larger sum than he ; and he somehow contrived to keep up year after year this appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thou* , h those who knew him best were sure he must be poor , the pride that went with it forbade familiarity and sympathy alike . There has always been a tradition that his first wife came to her death by foul means , and there is a dislike to the house , which seems never to be occupied for any length of time , even after all these years . The people in the neighborhood believe , as I have said , that it is haunted , and I have often heard stories of the strange cries , and the footsteps that sometimes follow you if you go up the hall stairs in the dark . The doctor himself died suddenly , though he has often been seen since in a grand brocade dressinggown and close velvet cap . His business affairs had naturally become a good deal tangled , but no one knew how much so until after his death . For several years he had been in the habit of carrying back and forth a little padlocked box when he went to Portsmouth , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was brought home from the bank , and broken open , it was found to contain only blank bits of paper . His wife , whom the old people in town still remember , must have had a hard time of it in the house on the wharf after she was left a widow ; but she was still the grande dame , and when she went into society her old laces and silks and her fine manners made her the queen of her company . She gave no sigh of disappointment at her altered fortunes , and as long as the doctor lived , and after he died , she was as serenely magnificent and untroubled as he . The Guard could die , but it never surrendered , and the old prestige was kept up bravely . She lived alone , and might sometimes have needed many of the good things of life , for all one knows ; but she was always well dressed , and kept up all possible forms of state , and was rigorous in observing all rules of etiquette . By way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she allowed a stranger the use of one of her rooms for a short time , and this person used to hear a bell ring in the morning , after which Madam Hovey would move about in her room ; then she would go down-stairs , breakfast being apparently announced ; and so on , through the day . There was often a bell heard tinkling in the parlor ; she would apologize for opening the outer door herself , and when the lodger called , the mistress of the house was always quite at liberty , and seemed to have been awaiting guests in her parlor , with a bit // of lace to mend in her fingers , or some silk knitting , as if she occupied her leisure with such dainty trifles . I.t was some time before the lodger discovered , to her amazement , that there was not a servant under the roof to do my lady 's bidding , but that she still kept up the old customs of the house . Poor soul ! it was not all silly pretense . If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in that beloved mansion where she lived in solitary majesty for so many years , I should not expect to be the guest of the proud doctor 's first companion , whose death is shrouded in mystery , who cries dismally and walks to and fro in the niTht , to beg for pity and help . I should look over my shoulder for the lady in the high turban , with a red India shawl around her shoulders , who stood so straight , and who used to walk up the aisle to her seat in church on Sunday as if she were a duchess . The cries and / the steps behind me would be most annoying , but Madam Hovey , if she also haunts her house , would receive me elegantly . One can imagine her alone in her house at night , with the jar of the river falls and the wind rattling her windows , fearful of her future , and of the poverty and misery old are held in its slinking hands for her . But she carried a brave face in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , and she gave to the towns-people the best of lessons in behavior ; for she was always gracious , and courteous , and fine in her own manners , a highbred lady , who had been in her day a most apt scholar of the old school . My cruises down the river rarely reach beyond High Point , or Pine Point , or the toll-bridge ; but one is tempted to linger there late for the sake of the beautiful view . The salt grass is a dazzling green , if the time is early summer and the tide is partly out , and from the bridge to the Hamilton house the river is very wide . The fine old house faces you , and at its right there is a mountain , which is a marked feature in the landscape on a clear day , when it looks far away and blue in the distance . The great tops of the Hamilton elms look round and heavy against the sky , and the shores of the river are somewhat irregular , running out in points which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foliage for each other . Being at different angles , the light and shade of each are distinct , and make a much finer coloring and outline than could be if the line of the shore were unbroken by so many bays and inlets . It is very pleasant to push the boat ashore in one of these coves , for in the little ravines that lead down to them there are crowds of ferns and wild flowers , and there will be just the place for a little feast at supper time . I know many a small harbor on the eastern shore , where a willow or a birch stands out in front of the dark evergreens , and at one place an oak reaches its long boughs far out over the water ; and when you are once under its shade , and watch the sunset grow bright and then fade away again , or see the boats go round the point from the wide bay into the narrow reach of the river above it , and listen to the bells ringing in the village , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go out into the twilight or the bright sunshine of the summer afternoon . I miss very much some poplars which stood on the western shore , opposite the great house , and which were not long since cut down . riley were not flourishing , but they were like a little procession of a father and mother and three or four children out for an afternoon walk , coming down through the field to the river . As you rowed up or down they stood up in bold relief against the sky , for they were on high land . I was deeply attached to them , and in the spring , when I went down river for the first time , they always were covered with the first faint green mist of their leaves , and it seemed as if they had been // watching for me , and thinking that perhaps I might go by that afternoon . On a spring day how the bobolinks sing , and the busy birds that live along the shores go flitting and chirping and whistling about the world ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the glitter of the unlucky fish he has seized as he goes off again . The fields and trees have a tinge of green that they will keep only for a few days , until the leaves and grass - blades are larger and stronger ; and where the land bas been plowed its color is as beautiful as any color that can be found the world over , and the long shining brown furrows grow warm lying in the sun . The farmers call to each other and to their horses as they work ; the fresh breeze blows from the southwest , and the frogs are cheerful , and the bobolinks grow more and more pleased with themselves every minute , and sing their tunes , which are meant to be sung slower and last longer , as if the sweet notes all came hurrying out togQther . And in the summer , when the days are hot and long , there is nothing better than the glory of the moonlighted nights , when the shrill cries of the insects fill all the air , and the fireflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tide . In October the river is bright steel color and blue . The ducks rise and fly away from the coves in the early morning , and the oaks and maples dress themselves as they please , as if they were tired of wearing plain green , like everybody else , and were going to be gay and set a new fashion in the cooler weather . You no longer drift lazily with the current , but pull your boat as fast as you can , and are quick and strong with the oars . And in the winter the river looks cold and dead , the wind blows up and down between the hills , and the black pines and hemlocks stare at each other across the ice , which cracks and creaks loudly when the tide comes up and lifts it . How many men have lived and died on its banks , but the river is always young . How many sailors have gone down to the sea along its channel , and from what strange countries have the ships come in and brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it is a little harbor , is a good thing , since adventurers come into it as well as go out , and the life in it grows strong , because it takes something from the world and has something to give in return . Not the sheltering shores of England , but the inhospitable low coasts of Africa and the dangerous islands of the southern seas , are left unvisited . One sees the likeness between a harhorless heart and a harborless country , where no ships go and come ; and since no treasure is carried away no treasure is brought in . From this inland town of mine there is no sea-faring any more , and the shipwrights ' hammers are never heard now . It is only a station on the railway , and it has , after all these years , grown so little that it is hardly worth while for all the trains to stop . It is busy , and it earns its living and enjoys itself , but it seems to me that its old days were its better days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places than it used to be . The people of fifty years ago had some things that were better than ours , even if they did not hear from England by telegraph , or make journeys in a day or two that used to take a week . The old elms and pines look strong yet , though once in a while one blows over or is relentlessly cut down . The willows by the river are cropped and cropped again . The river itself never grows old ; though it rushes and rises high in the spring , it never dries up in the autumn ; the little white sail ? s flit over it in pleasant weather , like fluttering moths round the track of sunlight on the water ; one troop of children after another steals eagerly down to its forbidden shores to play .
