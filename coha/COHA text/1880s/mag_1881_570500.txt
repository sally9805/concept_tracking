Vol . ITI. , Ch. 4 . Translated by W. HASKELL , Ph.D . Belief and Thought-The Evidence for the Existence of CodImpersonal Forms of the Supreme-I and not I- O4jections to the Possilility of the Personality of the I ? tflnite . OUR reflections have hitherto been occupied with the nature of finite things and the possible apprehensions of their mutual connection : we have , as yet , hardly attempted to explain the idea of that one Being , which , however , under the name of the Infinite , we regarded as indispensable to any comprehension of the finite . At this point the course of the inquiry must of itself have led to such an attempt ; for , however firmly we may be obliged to put away all expectation of explaining how reality in general is produced , still , in the very act of affirming a dependence of the finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time affirm a continuous relation of reality to reality ; and we must acknowledge it as an admissible problem to determine , as far as possible , the import of this relation . lit would not , however , be for our advantage just here to make further development of this inquiry strictly from the mere metaphysical impulses which have hitherto been our foundation . In the circle of religious thought , we find the results of this inquiry richly developed , and that in a form which can not fail to win our most careful attention , for the very reason that , in addition to theoretical needs , the attempt is made to satisfy the heart and the conscience . We wish to connect our researches with this well known development , taking as the object of our reflections , not the metaphysical // postulate of the Infinite , but rather the complete conception of God , which is intended to satisfy that postulate along with other demands . We must bestow at least a passing notice on the doubt which would just here remind us that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be adequately answered only by the new and peculiar organ of faith . According to our view of the origin of religious truth will be our judgment of the work which remains for scientific investigation . If religion were merely the offspring of human reason , then philosophy would be the one sufficient instrument for its discovery and exposition . If reason is not able of itself to discover the highest truth , if it stands in need rather of a revelation which is either comprehended in a single historic act of God or is unceasingly renewed in the hearts of men ; even in that case , reason must be in a condition to understand the revealed truth , at least so far as to recognize in it the satisfying and convincing conclusion of the upward tending lines of thought upon which it had been impelled by its own necessities to enter , but of which it had not been able to reach to the end . For all religious truth must be a moral good , not an exercise of curiosity . It may , therefore , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reason ; but only so far as they are indispensable satisfactorily to introduce other truths which are intelligible and of great value . The secrecy of a mystery is , of itself , no ground for honoring it . On the contrary , constant secrecy , perpetuated on principle , would be a ground of indifference towards that which thus refused to come into connection with the necessities of our souls . Finally , it would be least of all in keeping with the idea of a revelation to revel in mysteries which are intended to remain mysteries . But then , admitting the existence of mystery in general , what is the knowledge of mystery ? Does not the nature of faith consist in this very thing , that it affords a certainty of that which is beyond the reach of knowledge , a certainty of what it is , as well as of the fact that it is ? And does not all science , at the end of its researches , come back to a belief , the // certainty of which can be neither proved nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths , from which flow all the evidences of other knowledge ? Certainly there is in this rejoinder a kernel of justice ; but the essential difference between scientific faith and religious faith remains no less clear . Scientific faith gives immediate confidence only to general laws which in innumerable conceivable cases show what relations a manifold material assumes under determinate conditions . When it affirms that everything conceivable is like itself , that like causes under like conditions produce like effects , and under unlike conditions unlike effects , that every change is preceded by a cause , all these laws are general truths , which do indeed tell us what must , of necessity , eventually take place when a case of their application occurs , but which have nothing at all to say of a reality which does occur . The essential truths of religion all bear an opposite character . They are assurances of reality , whether of a Being or of an event or of a series of events ; assurances of a reality which , when once it is acknowledged , may , indirectly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which , of itself is not law , but fact . Now those general truths to which the scientific apprehension yields unconditional belief , are at bottom only the peculiar nature of the apprehending reason itself , expressed in the form of the fundamental laws which govern its proceedings ; and we may conceive that reason , being unable to escape from its own being , is overpowered by the evidence of these rules of its thought which it can not evade . But the soul can not attain to a direct consciousness of more than its own being . ft can not have inborn revelatidns of facts which are not iiicluded in itself even though the worth and significance of these facts may be great beyond all comparison . Religious faith should be compared , not with this immediate evidence of the ultimate fundamental laws , but with another element which joins in building up our knowledge , that is , with the intuition which gives to those fundamental laws their significance and to the general laws the cases to which they apply . To be sure , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions as revelations , which can only // be taken as they are . Thus we have neither ground , necessity nor means of ' revealing the reality which gives rise to an impression of color , nor can the judgment show , by the application of any conceivable labor , how this color is to be regarded . It is , and is as it is , by the immediate revelation which is made to our sight . Now something like what we here experience under the influence of physical excitements we may pass through under the immediate inworking of divine power within the soul : faith would be the apprehension of the supersensuous fact revealed to us by this inworking . Herein , too , lies a truth , and more than in that first comparison . But every sensuous impression is , of itself considered , only a mode of our existence , of our condition . Of itself it gives no knowledge of an actual condition of things , of itself alone it forms no experience . Yet again , it is only our thought which possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comparing or connecting them , or explaining their given connections , constructs from them the knowledge of a fact . We could hardly help viewing the inworkings of God upon the soul in the same manner . The cognition of a fact can not be regarded as anything immediate , which the soul receives ready made , without activity on its own part . Only the occasion can be given it to produce that cognition by the exertion of this activity , and only in that process does any appropriation of truth consist . As the sensuous perception , of itself , only supplies an impression , so this inworking would produce only a feeling , a frame of mind , a manner of being impressed ; this experience would amount to a revelation only through a work of the reflective faculty , which might analyze its content and bring it to a connected system of ideas which should be clearer and more easily attached to our conceptions of the real world . This can not always happen . Much of this inner life of the believing soul must always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , the least valuable part of our faith which lies thus beyond the power of expression . Rather the best , the fairest and most fruitful which we can experience will always transcend the formulas of knowledge , and will really exist in us only in the shape of this living activity . It can not be our business to interpret this wealth of inner // experiences , either that part of it which rises above knowledge , or that which is too minute to be transformed into knowledge . Only that can hold our attention which not only the individual in his raptures sees without being able to express , but which every one can communicate to others as a possible common good ; and we must be able either to establish it as truth or as convincing probability on grounds whose strength every human reason must acknowledge , or else confirm it by refuting the objections which threaten to discredit our faith as a possible solution of the enigmas which press us . In the arguments for the existence of God , re*tson once sought to solve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its faith . To this mode of proceeding it would be unreasonable to object that it sought to exhibit the Supreme , which according to its own supposition is unconditioned , as at the same time a necessary and conditioned result of truths whose validity , since they are made to enter as grounds of belief , ought to precede and outweigh that of the reality which is proved by them . This fault has not always been avoided , it is true ; but these arguments , like all researches which work backward from results to causes , can only be intended to reach our knowledge of the principle from the given consequences of that principle ; and , even in regard to this , they presuppose the unconditioned validity of a truth which binds together the whole world , and which allows us to conjecture the principle of all things in it . The carrying out of this undertaking , however , seems to have shown that the human understanding has not received with sufficient fullness those data of reality of which it stood in need , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accurately and fully to attain the end for which it is striving ; and that this is the case , even without taking into account the accidental errors in which it has been involved on the way on account of its inability to criticise its own desire . With just a few backward glances , we now fix our eyes upon the circle of thought which our earlier reflections have already given us sufficient occasion to enter . From the accidental and conditional nature of everything // which belongs to the world , the cosmological argument leads at once to the existence of a necessary and unconditioned being ; and it regards only an absolutely perfect being as capable of being unconditioned . We give the name of accidental to that which happens in connection with the working out of a purpose , as an undesigned additional consequence . For the means which we are compelled to use , besides the qualities by which they serve our purpose , always possess other qualities which have no value to us or which positively hinder the attainment of our object . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of account ; and these peculiarities , on their part , act with an energy restrained only by the general laws . In speaking of the course of nature , inasmuch as we believe that an intelligent plan underlies its succession of events , the term " accidental " applies to all that which is regarded only as an inevitable result of the means and laws by which nature at a given moment acts , and not as a part of nature 's plan itself . Being thus destitute of aim and purpose , the accidental has only grounds and causes by which it is produced in connection with actual results . Apart from this connection , however , the simple fact of being or happening can , of itself , be in general neither necessary nor accidental . For that which is then signified by the term " accidental , " the fact of being , when that which is either might not be at all or might be otherwise than it is , is not a peculiar and , of course , imperfect mode of being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but any one of the events which go to make up the sum total of reality is accidental in the sense that we can conceive of its not being , or of its being otherwise than it is . The only thing , indeed , which is necessary , and whose non-existence is inconceivable , is a conditioned event which , as a result , is determined by that which produces it , as an effect is determined by its cause , or as a means by its end . On the other hand , the conception of a separate being , altogether unconditioned , yet endowed with necessary existence , is wholly impossible . If , then , accident is so often denied as an element in the constitution of the world , and necessity is so eagerly claimed for it , the reason is that both terms have lost their proper signification // and become expressions of value . Accidental then means that which exists , indeed , but has no motive which can justify its existence ; necessary means not that which must be , but that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deserve unconditional existence . Only in this sense can we claim that the highest governing principle of the world is one whose existence is necessary . On the contrary , it would lead to an entire misunderstanding and to confusion of ideas , to represent God riot only as really existing , but as existing of necessity . All religious needs are fully satisfied by the proof of his actual existence . To attempt to show his necessity would be not only a needless overstraining of our claims , but would involve the contradiction of making God dependent upon some higher power which would include the constraining cause of his existence . Similar remarks apply to the other part of the cosmological argument . Perfection can be unequivocally affirmed only when it denotes an agreement between the nature of an object and a standard to which that nature is bound to conform . Hence only the want of an obligatory performance constitutes imperfection : but that is not imperfect which merely in a general way lacks some conceivable excellence . That in this case also we speak of imperfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has lost its proper meaning of conformity to a given standard , and been transferred to the independent signification of that which is directly praiseworthy , and in itself desirable . Now if anything fails to satisfy the demands of its own nature , we may perhaps have reason to assume that it has been prevented from attaining the aim of its being by some external force ; but the bare absence of some conceivable beauty or excellence does not show the dependence or conditionality of that which is , in this sense , imperfect . Much less is unconditional existence the exclusive right of the most excellent ; it can belong to the indifferent and the small as well as to the significant and the great . So , then , from the conditionality and conditional necessity of all individual reality in the world , the cosmological argument can only infer a final reality which , without being conditioned by anything else , simply is , and simply is what it is , and may // at the same time be looked upon as the sufficient ground through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this understanding of the evidence now makes it clear that of its own force it does not attain to the religious conception of a God , but only to the metaphysical conception of an unconditioned being , it would not be able so much as to establish the unity of that unconditioned being . It is perhaps possible that , in its further development , the demand for some sort of an unconditioned being might be connected with a demand for his unity . But the argument before mentioned has shown no such connection ; and thus it does not contradict the assumption of an indefinite number of world-beginnings or of actually existing beings . On the contrary , man , in his study of the world , will hope to find in this very multiplicity an explanation of the manifold phenomena of the world much more easily than in the unity of the supreme Principle . The teleological argument seeks to attain to a certainty of the real existence of God from the evidences of design in the world . This argument , in order to carry conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have long ago seen , it can only satisfy with various degrees of probability . It would first have to show that there is in the world a connected adaptation of means to ends which can not rise from a purposeless combination of forces , but must have risen from an intelligent design . But we have seen that , even where there is a conscious purpose , the adaptation to an end is only realized by the use of means , and that what is willed follows as a necessary consequence from the connection of these means . We have seen , too , that even the connection of the means with this result is possible only when the connecting purpose works alike on every one of those means with a blind force which , according to general laws is able so to move that on which it acts as to bring it into the desired connection with the rest . Hence , though it is highly improbable , it is always possible that a course of natural events , without design , should of itself have taken all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have taken in order to bring about the adaptation to a given end ; and thus the claim first set up can not be fully met. // We succeed no better in fulfilling the second demand , which was to show that the adaptation of means to ends not only presents itself here and there , but that it pervades the world harmoniously and without exception , so that not only do the acts of intelligence happen in accordance with it in a general way , but the unity of one supreme purpose embraces all . How far does the actual knowledge which we have derived from experience fall short of this proof ? How much appears altogether obscure , aimless , or even a hindrance to purposes which might otherwise be supposed ! The few brilliant examples of a harmony which even we can at least partially discern , examples which are most abundantly furnished in the kingdom of living creatures , may perhaps , where faith in God has been already won , strengthen it in the conviction that , even in that which we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be working out its purposes ; but the empiric knowledge of the adaptation of means to ends in the arrangement of the world affords no sufficient means of gaining a secure faith in the first place . Of itself alone , this knowledge would be much more likely to engender a polytheistic belief in a multitude of divine beings , each ruling a separate province of nature according to his individual character , and their various modes of government uniting to produce a certain general concord , to be sure , but not a universal harmony . Not merely lack of experimental knowledge but internal difficulties still further hinder us from fulfilling the third demand , which was to show that the creative Wisdom , in the carrying out of its purposes , never experiences opposition and is moreover never compelled to the production of that which is of no value to its purpose , only under these conditions could the Wisdom be at the same time almighty . But observation shows us much which our limited knowledge , at least , can only regard as an incidental result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing nature of the material which is to be fashioned . Even in our general reflections we can not form a clear conception of a purpose without thinking also of an independent material in the elaboration of which that purpose finds its realization . Thus all our // consideration of the adaptation of means to ends leads us only to the idea of a governor of the world , instead of that of a Creator which we were seeking . Finally , how far we are from satisfying the fourth demand , the demand for proof of the unconditional worth and holiness of the aim which we p*ain1y see pursued in the government of the world , may be seen by a glance at the development of the doctrines which have sought to satisfy it . Be it that philosophy has often set before us as supreme , unconditionally holy purposes manifest in the government of the world ; many things in which the living sensibility perceives no value , be it that , in the evils of the world and the consistency with which the bad is developed , popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world between God and the devil , while consoling themselves over the apparent discord by the belief that this , too , has a solution beyond the reach of human insight . But that which is beyond the reach of human insight , though it may be an object of faith , yet can not be adduced as an argument for that which it is designed to explain . Thus the teleological argument is destitute of any binding force , however great and unmistakable may be its efficacy in summing up the best of our knowledge of the world for the strengthening of our conviction . Perhaps if we attempt less at once , we shall accomplish more on the whole , and the fundamental thoughts which animate these arguments may be made valuable in another way . The cosmological argument , in its pursuit of the full conception of God , proceeded too quickly to affirm the supreme perfection of the unconditioned before it had securely established his unity , a thing which the thought of the conditionality of all things or even the thought of a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the adaptation of means to ends , for this is of doubtful value , but the general fact that there is a course of events in which occurrences are connected according to general laws , must have led to the necessary unity of the fundamental principle of the world . But we will not repeat this consideration , to which we have already attended , and have devoted anew the beginning of these researches . We believed that we had found the impossi // bility of any pluralistic view of the world which pre-supposed a multitude of independent , real , original beings , and yet believed itself able to produce an order of events from their reciprocal action according to general laws . When plunged in the depth of contemplation in carrying out such a theory , we might say as much as we pleased that from the many one truth might result , and that for the many , each of which at first existed in a world by itself , there was yet the possibility of a union in which they should come to exercise a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conceivable apart from the original essential unity of all reality , a unity whose activity , after it works and because it works , may appear as a working which is united according to law through a general truth , and introduced truth relations between the individual elements . After this unity of the unconditioned and of all finite limitations had been established , we might seek to determine its conception by the more significant predicates which transformed it from the conception of an infinite substance to that of the one living God . Tbat which has sought to aid the teleological argument in this attempt seems to me more energetically expressed in the despised form of the ontological argument , though to be sure , on account of the scholastic setting in which it was unfortunately placed , the fact is little recognized . That the conception of the most perfect of all beings includes reality as one of his perfections , and that therefore the most perfect being is a necessary being , is so manifest a fallacy that , after Kant 's incisive refutation any attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reflection , Anselm had discussed the thought that the greatest of which we can conceive , if we think of it only as conceived , is less than that same greatest if we think of it as existing . No one will succeed in developing a logically convincing argument out of this consideration any more than out of the other ; but the manner in which it is taken up seems to reveal another leading thought which seeks expression through it . For what would be the result if that highest perfection of which we had thought merely as a thing thought of , were less than some reality ? Why should this thought disturb us ? Manifestly , because it is an immediate certainty that the greatest , // the fairest , and the most valuable must be reality , and not mere thought ; because it would be of itself intolerable to think of an ideal that it was a conception which the thought , indeed , in its working had wrought out , but which in reality had no existence , no power , arid no importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing which we proceed to infer as a logical consequence of its perfection ; but , without going through the form of an inference , we immediately feel the impossibility of its not being , and all appearance of establishing it by reasoning serves only to place the immediateness of this certainty in a clearer light . Were there no greatest in fact , there could be no greatest in thought ; and it is quite impossible that what is greatest in thought should not exist in fact . We may yet make many other attempts to exhibit the intrinsic necessity of this conviction as something which can be logically proved ; they will all fail . We can not establish by thought , we can only feel , that anything beautiful is beautiful , or that a certain disposition receives the approval of conscience ; only certain easily-understood cases are excepted , in which we take something compounded or derived , or something which is yet not clear , and , by a brief process of logical analysis , subordinate it to something more general with which an immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as little can we now establish from any general truth the right by which we connect with what is valuable that claim to reality . Even the certainty of this claim belongs rather to those inner experiences with which , as with the given object of its labor , the mediate , inferring , limiting activity of our understanding more nearly connects itself . As an immediate certainty of this sort , this conviction lies at the foundation of the ontological argument . It is this , too , which carries the teleological argument far beyond the conclusions which its own insufficient premises would , of themselves , have allowed . For let the sway of intelligently-working , significant moral forces even over a small part of the world be proved by actual experience . In this case the quiet extension of the same process , even to the affirmation of the existence of a wisdom , beauty , goodness , and power pervading all the world without exception , rests not merely on the ordinary log- // 1*5 ical error of generalizing a truth which has been found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a vivid feeling that it is just the proper thing for this most perfect and greatest Being to be perfectly and all-comprehensively real . Yet , at the same time , however strong this conviction may be , and however satisfying to us its evidence , it shares with the other experiences of faith the formal indeterminateness of their content . For it leaves us in doubt what the reality may be which the Highest and Worthiest must possess ; it feels confident of knowing only this one thing , that that which is highest and best must be one with the infinite ; which , in our theoretic*al investigation of the world , we found ourselves compelled to recognize as the true reality . The grounds which justify this attempt to blend the actually existing with the worthy in forming the idea of the living God belong , however , to the intermediate steps of the course of thought which we may with propriety pass over ; the more because the following discussion of the results to which the attempt has led will include also our opinion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which we strive to comprehend the existence of God to call to mind the two impulses from which arose the idea of God and the belief in him . The metaphysical attributes of unity , eternity , omnipresence and omnipotence make him the ground of all reality of the finite ; the ethical attributes of wisdom , righteousness , and holiness , satisfy the desire , in the highest reality to find also the highest worthiness . We have no need to mention in detail these attributes , or to touch upon the vexed questions which hover over their mutual limits ; the only thing which is of decisive importance for us is to attain to a clear conviction respecting the form of existence which has given to this collective idea of all perfection its determinate shape , and at the same time , of course , to many of those attributes their special signification . If this discussion , which is already hastening to its close , could be drawn out at leisure into a systematic and complete statement of the argument , it would be very easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop with certainty the answer which we should have to give to this last question as to the nature of that infinity which we there VOL IV . 13 // found . But , just because it is so easy silently to supply this passage , we would regard the goal to which it would lead , the conception of a personal God , as already reached ; and , against the hesitation which would doubt the possibility of his existence , we would mai ; tain that conception as the only logical result to which our inquiries could lead . This desire of the soul to seize as a reality the highest at which it can guess , can be satisfied by no other form of existence than personality ; nor can any other be allowed to enter the discussion . So firmly is the soul convinced that living , self-possessing , self-enjoying personality is the indispensable condition and the only possible dwelling-place of all good and all good things , and with so much of silent contempt is it filled toward all apparently lifeless existence , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied with the beginnings of its myth-making , in order to transform natural reality to spiritual . But religion has never felt the need of tracing back spiritual activity to blind reality as a firm ground . From this right way , the progressive improvement of the reflective faculty first made a long diversion . Man 's increasing knowledge of the world brought more plainly into view the demands which must be made of our conception of God , if it was not only to contain within itself all that was greatest and worthiest , but to contain it in such a form that it might appear as the creating and controlling cause of all reality . The more refined observation of the spiritual life , on the other hand , revealed the conditions with which the development of personality in us finite beings is connected . Both trains of thought appeared to unite as far as this , that the form of the spiritual life is incompatible with the idea of the highest existence , and the form of personal existence with the idea of the infinite spirit . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting order of the universe , of an infinite substance , of a self.developing idea , more satisfactory forms of existence for the Supreme ; and to think lightly of the form of personal existence which the unprejudiced mind had hitherto regarded as the one thing worthy of notice . Of the infinitely diversified forms which these views have assumed , it is enough for our // present purpose briefly to explain the three already mentioned , so as to show why they are untenable . How noble may be the motives and what the moral earnestness which may lead the mind , in opposition to a crude humanization of the divine Being , to resolve the conception of that Being into that of a moral government of the world , is fresh in memory to this day . Yet Fiebte was wrong when , with inspired words , he set up the sublimity of his own conception in opposition to the ordinary , illiberally conceived idea of the personal God . He believed that in his own conception he possessed the loftiest because he sought it ; but he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this road , if he had just then traveled it to the end . The qhestion how an order of events is conceivable as a supreme principle can not be avoidedi on the plea that a principle can not be expected to give a history of its own origin . He who regards personality as an impossible conception of the Godhead and prefers some other , will , at least , have to show that his own can be maintained against all objection , for he can not make satisfaction for an impossibility by a further assumption of an unproved possibility . Now , of course , the sufficient reason which must ever forbid our setting a system of natural law in place of God lies in fact in the simple thought that no arrangement can be separated from that which is arranged , and still less can it precede it as a conditioning or producing force ; it remains always as a relation of that which is , after and because it is . If , then , it is nothing else than an arrangement , as its name indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek , and which the ordinary conception of God , however unsatisfactory in other respects , rightly defined in this , that it saw in him a real being and not merely a relation . In dealing with these high questions , however , where we are often enough made to feel the imperfection of human speech , names rarely mean exactly what they say , but commonly either more or less . Moreover , it most frequently happens that what we ought either to add , in thought , or take away , can not be united with the rest of their signification without dispute . On this account all the various opinions which we here // recapitulate will complain of our statement of their position that God is a system of natural law , as a misunderstanding . Jn the first place , then , the system of natural law ought not to enter into that setting up of the world over against God which is involved in the ordinary idea of the extramundane Deity . This place must remain vacant , for it is an impossible place which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a relation established by an Orderer , would only betray the inability to understand true reality . For true reality is. vivacity , happening , becoming , through and through , without any residuum of dead substance ; not , of course , an indeterminate activity , but one which , with unvarying consistency , determines itself according to the connection of one purpose . And yet , if we more carefully analyze the import of these enthusiastic conceptions in order to express it , will they not bring us back to the very doctrine which their advocates are so anxious to avoid ? We have already had occasion to show how far from possible it is , by the notion of a natural law of mere phenomena , to avoid assuming a reciprocal action of things or to explain their visible workings . Even if it were clear what was meant by saying that a law ruled , it would still be incomprehensible how things or phenomena came to the point of obeying it . Only an essential unity of all existence could make the varying states of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general system of nature which here takes the place of that law , claiming at the same time to rule the moral world , is open to the same criticism . Nor is it doubtful to us , " but most certain , nay the ground of all other certainty , that there is this moral order of events in the world , that every rational individual has his determinate place assigned and calculated according to his work ; that all his fortunes are results of this plan ; that without it no hair falls from his head and in its sphere of working no sparrow from the roof ; that every good action succeeds , every bad one fails ; and that to those who do but love the good aright , all things must work together for good . " ( Fichte , S. W. V. 188. ) - And yet , how can we think all this ? Or , more correctly , what do we think when we think it ? Could that order of // events ever unite multiplicity into the unity of any determinate relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not present in each individual of the many , and if it were not at the same time sensitive to every event which might take place among the rest and able to force the reciprocal relations of all into the designed form by changing their situations more or less , according to their denarture from this purpose ? This is not a subtilizing construction by which we sought to show how that order is produced ; but it is the analysis of that which we must think in thinking that which is ascribed to that order . And now , after all which we have hitherto discussed at such length , we could not say just how this conception of an order which is influenced by facts , and , according to the influence which it receives and to its nature , reacts up ) n the facts , could still differ from the true conception of a being . To call that , however , merely an order , is a misunderstanding prompted by an opposition which feared erroneous conceptions of Being , and persisted in trying to attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of whose import it is wholly incompatible . If , now , the idea of an active order can not be prevented from going back , in form , to that of an ordering being , the idea of a moral order goes still further . Is it possible to conceive of a Being who , with purposeless activity blindly working on the course of events , irritated by a state of things whose influence he feels , partakes every moment of the improving impulse , through which that universal sway of the good would be secured ? Can we conceive of a Being destitute of skill to assign to each his place , or to calculate upon the work of each , or to discern the good of the good action , or the bad of the bad action ; a Being which could not , with its own living love , will the good and realize it , yet could so mislead us as to appear capable of all this ? The theory is not permitted to refuse an answer to this question ; for , in presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary points of relation without which its own meaning would remain incomplete . But who. ever sought to answer it by devising a purposeless , blind , impersonal mechanism whose impelling motive , however , was the good , would plunge himself deep in those inextricable // sophistries among which the great mind whose wanderings we here deplore , felt compelled to reckon the conviction that reasonality was the one conceivable form of the Supreme Principle of the world . Whether the answer to this question is necessary to establish the life of that Principle , may appear doubtful . T believe that it is necessary . The conviction of the prevalence of that system of natural law may be sufficient for directing our action and for consolation when we see its apparent barrenness of result . But the conception of the Supreme in the form of a personal God is the point to which the religious feeling was led , by the needs of humility and the desire of being able to honor and love , impulses to which that religion of the stern fulfillment of duty has given too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to employ in presenting these views stands at our command for the others which we have mentioned above . The common admission of the essential unity of the fundamental principle of the world connects us only in appearance with the pantheistic adoration of the infinite substance . The ideas which we have formed of the significance of reality remove us , in other respects , so far from the pantheistic circle of thought that no brief explanation of our relation to it is possible . Pantheism admits as existence what we can conceive only as phenomenon . Take , for example , the world of space with its extension , its forms , its increasing activity . Pantheism can conceive of this as an inexhaustible life-force of the Unconditioned , and of a Unity which may find expression in these forms and their changes ; as if it were thereby accomplishing something . But to us all this was only the shadow of a genuine , supersensuous being and happening . Hence pantheism might think it possible to regard the spiritual world as a detached flower on the vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become impossible to conceive of spirit as springing from that which is not spirit ; on the contrary , we felt compelled to look upon all unconscious being and happening as a phenomenon whose form and content is derived from the nature of the spiritual life . Metaphysically , we could admit , as a possible conception of the world , no form of pantheism which did not disclaim all inclination to conceive // of unbounded reality in any other form than that of the spiritual . But religiously we do not share the disposition which is wont to rule the l ) antheistic fancy ; the disposition to lower all that is finite in comparison with the infinite , the inclination to regard all which is of value for the living mind as merely transitory , vain and perishable compared with the majesty of the One , upon whose formal peculiarities of greatness , unity , eternity and inexhaustibility all reverence is concentrated . But this , as well as the cause which prevents us from recognizing the supreme Principle of the world in an infinite , self-conscious Idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible , in passing , to notice the objects of so endless a contest . I can not be conceived except in opposition to a not-I ; hence personal existence can not be affirmed of God without bringing him within the limits of conditionality through another ; and these limits would militate against his existence . At this thought the objections return which are made to the personality of God on the score of theoretical knowledge . In or ( ler to judge of their value , we shall be obliged to examine the apparently clear import of the law which they take as their starting-point . For it is , after all , not without its ambiguity . It may mean to affirm that what is denoted by the name I is comprehensible to the analytic reflection only through its relation to the not-I . It may just as well mean that it is not conceivable that this which is denoted by the term " I , ' can not be made matter of experience unless that opposite is experienced at the same time with it . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an indispensable preliminary condition of the I-hood of that being on which the influence works . The references which our conception required for the explanation of its object , make in general no distinction in regard to its nature . They are not so much conditions of the possibility of the thing as conditions to us of the possibility of conceiving it . But the special nature of the case before us seems to introduce what is not included in the general case . For even in the act oC forming a conception consists the I-hood : and hence that which is necessary to carry out the conception is here at the same time a condition of the thing . The first two explanations // which we gave to the law appear , therefore , to blend in the common affirmation that " I " signifies nothing in opposition to notI , and that it can become matter of experience only in that opposition . Whether we find ourselves able to assent to this affirmation or not , depends partly on the way in which we fix the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I and not-I can not be two ideas each of which owes its whole significance solely to its opposition to the other . In this way both would remain without significance , and , in case neither of them , apart from this opposition , had its own fixed sense , not only would all ground of distinction disappear , but all the significance of the question which of the two opposites had to take the place of the I and which of the not-I , would be lost . Language has given only to the " I , ' an independent name of its own . To the not-I it has given only a negative expression of what " I " includes , without giving any name to what is included in the not-I itself . That being , therefore , to which it is appointed , within the circle of the opposition which has arisen , to be " I , " has the cause of its appointment in its nature , which was manifest before the opposition , although the predicate which it has won while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before the opposition appeared . If , now , this is to remain the meaning of the name , if the being is to be " I " only in the moment when it distinguishes itself from not-I , we have no objection to make to this use of speech , but we would in that case change our own . For it is not our idea , but that of our antagonists , that personality is to be found exclusively where the self-consciousness itself , in thought , sets itself as " I , " over against the not-L We are satisfied , for the establishing of that self-hood which we seek first of all , with just the nature by which , when the opposition rises , the being becomes I ; and we are satisfied with the nature even before the opposition rises . Every feeling of pleasure or pain , every kind of inward enjoyment , contains for us the original ground of personality , that immediate , independent existence which all later developments of self-consciousness may perhaps explain , by oppositions and comparisons of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which they do not produce by these means . // It may be universally true that only he can say " J " to himself who thinks of himself in opposition to a not-I , and distinguishes himself from it . Yet in that case , that he may not mistake himself and confound himself with the not-I , thus his distinguishing thought must be accompanied by a certainty of his own self as an immediate fact of experience , by an independent existence wihich is earlier than the distinguishing relation by which " I " is placed in opposition to not-I We have been already ( I. 270 if. ) brought to the same result in an easier way by another consideration , to which we may be allowed here to refer for the sake of completeness and clearness . We there found that all self-consciousness rests on an immediate feeling of self which can by no means rise from a perception of our opposition to the outer world , but on its own part is the cause of that perception ; so that that opposition can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other difference between two objects . Self-consciousness is only the later effort of the conscious subject to analyze this fact of eiperience by means of knowledge . In this effort the " I " seizes upon itself with all the living power of the feeling , in order to gain an ideal image , and , in this way , artificially to transport itself for purposes of thought , into the circle of objects , where it does not belong . And thus , then , we would take our position in regard to the first two explanations of the law of which we speak so as to grant that " I ' * is conceivable only in relation to a not-I . But we added that it is matter of experience before-hand , outside of any such relation ; and just here lies the possibility that it may later become conceivable in that form . It is not these two explanations , however , but the third , which stands most in the way of that belief in the personality of God which we are seeking to establish . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes appears , we should not need to make it an object of renewed examination ; we might rather regard it as finally established that no mechanism of favoring conditions , however wonderful , would give self-hood to a being in whose nature this independent existence was not implanted as an underivable first principle . We might , therefore , pass over in total silence all those attempts which have been made // to show , by ill chosen analogies drawn from the world of sense , how an activity at first merely directed outward from a being as yet destitute of identity , through the opposition which the world of the not-I makes to it as a surface to a beam of light , is turned back upon itself and thus transformed into the self comprehending light of self-consciousness . In such representations all is capricious , and not a line of the figure employed is valid for the special relation which it ought to explain . That outgoing activity is an unmeaning fancy , the opposition which it is said to find can not be shown *exist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own path by that opposition is quite incomprehensible ; nor do we see how , through this turning back it could change its nature , and , from blind activity , become the personality of independent existence . Apart from these follies , which have ruled the circle of our philosophic thought more than was reasonable , there is an honorable form of the opinion which we are combating . This we find admitting , of course , that independent existence could not be produced by any external influence in a being to whose nature it did not belong , yet busily engaged in trying to prove that , even in one whose nature was capable of it , it could never be developed without the codperation of the external world and its educating influence . For the impressions from the external world which we must await , give us not only all the substance of our conceptions , but also the occasion for all those feelings in which , while yet without a consciously-contrasted relation , to a not-I , the I , existing of itself , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling which a determinate condition of the being , a special phase of its activity or its suffering might not experience in a determinate form of pleasure or pain . But suffering is not possible without an external impulse which excites it , nor can there be activity unless stimulated by some external object which supplies its goal and direction . And , as in particulars , so in the whole . In every individual feeling , the independent existence is master of itself only in part . Whether it is truly and wholly independent , depends on the variety of external impulses which gradually excite // the whole kingdom of its nature and make it capable of enjoying itself . And as in the construction of all personality connected with the presence and influence of an external world , and on the variety and succession of these influences ; per . sonality would be possible for God only under like conditions . It is not enough that we try to weaken the force of this objection by affirming that this educating stimulus is necessary only for finite and changeable existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everlasting unchangeability , as a self-conscious Idea , always possesses its whole significance in undivided unity . This affirmation would be very near the truth ; but it would injure our conception of God in another way , for it would put His being on a level with an everlasting truth , though , to be sure , such a truth as is not only valid , but is itself conscious of its own being . We immediately feel , however , how far this personification of an idea is from the living personality which we are seeking . We are disgusted with the artifice which requires us to admire allegorical statues of righteousness and love ; not only so , but the speculation provokes our opposition at once when it offers us , perhaps , a self-knowing law of identity or a self-conscious idea of God , as the full expression of a personality . Such a conception is manifestly wanting in one essential condition of all true reality , the ability to suffer . Every idea through which , in our imitative apprehensions , we seek fully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of a formula of thought by which we fix , for our own contemplation , the inward connection between the living activities of the real . Reality itself is that which interests itself in this idea , which feels opposition made against that as a disturbance of itself and which undertakes and wishes the realization of that as its own endeavor . Only this kernel which can not be resolved into mere thought , whose sense and significance we only live out in the immediate inward experience of our spiritual being , and always misunderstand when we attempt to explain it from any other source , is the living subject of personality ; and , on this account , personality can never be the peculiar property of an unchangeably valid truth but only of a changeable , suffering , // and retroacting being . Only hastily , as we pass along , can we point out the insuperable obstacles which would lie in the way of the attempt to personify ideas , if the process were carried further for the purpose of determining the relation in which the things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would immediately show that they are as little able to do without supplying a suffering and acting being as is the system of natural law which has been already mentioned . Yet it is wrong to transfer the conditions of finite personality to that of the infinite . For we must beware of seeking , in the strangeness which belongs to the external world inasranch as it is not-I , the source of the power by which it calls forth the development of the " I. " That is only effectual in this , that it gives to the finite spirit incitements to activity which that spirit can not originate from its own naturg . It is part of the conception of a finite being to have its determinate place in the whole , and thus not to be what another is ; yet at the same time , as a member of the whole , it must , in its whole development , be referred to this other and made to harmonize with it . The forms of the activity of finite existence also well up from its own inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions , nor its emotions , nor the peculiar quality of any of its other manifestations is given it from without . But its impulses to action , at all events , do certainly meet it from that external world to which it is brought , by the finiteness of its nature , into the relation of a part , which must keep the time , place , and manner of its development as marked out by the determining whole . No such statement , however , can be truthfully made of the Infinite Being , who comprehends all the finite in himself , and is the ground of its nature and reality . His life stands in no need of an outward impulse , as , with strange departure from the right standpoint , we sometimes think . From the very beginning , the conception of such a being lacks the need which makes that impulse necessary to our conception of a finite being , and which makes its efficacy conceivable . Being under no obligation to harmonize with that which is not himself , he is of himself fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step by which his life is developed . // A faint resemblance , and yet not altogether an unessential resemblance , but , in part , an example of the thing itself , is afforded us by the finite spirit in its course of recollection . At first , of course , the world of our conceptions is stirred to action by impressions from without ; but it widens itself to a stream which , without further impulse from the external world , can produce enough that is new , through the continuous , reciprocal working of its own movements , and in the operations of fancy , in the inventions of the reflective faculty , in struggles of passion , it works out a great part of the living development ; as much , indeed , as the nature of the finite being can receive without a continually renewed examination and fixing of its place by means of the reciprocal action between itself and the whole in which it is included . Thus the falling away of these limits of a finite nature brings to the producing conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-sufficiency of the Infinite . But that conditioning of its life through itself , which the finite spirit can only approximate , takes place in God without limit ; and for him there is no need of opposition to an external world . The question still naturally remains , what in God corresponds to the first impulse which the finite spirit receives from the external world ? But the question itself contains its own answer . For , if it be through an impulse from without that the spirit receives the beginning of the movement which it afterwards carries on through its own force , whence , then , does the external world receive the movement which could make it capable of giving that impulse ? A moment 's consideration is enough to convince us that , in our view of the world , however it may result , we must somewhere and somehow recognize the existing motion itself as an originally given reality , and that we could never derive it from a previous state of rest . And this passing mention may here suffice , where we wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of the nature of time . When we describe the inner life of the personal God , the stream of his thoughts , his emotions , his will , as everlasting and without commencement , as never having been at rest and never having been *et in motion from a state of repose , we re // quire of the imagination no greater work than is demanded of it in every materialistic or pantheistic system . Neither the one nor the other can succeed in explaining the existing course of events without presupposing either an everlasting , uncaused movement of the world-substance , or a determinate movement of the world-elements , which is to be regarded as alsolutely original . And all parties must bring themselves to acknowledge that the division of reality into existence in a state of rest on the one hand , and , on the other , a motion which afterwards takes possession of that existence , belongs to those which are advantageous only for the ordinary undertakings of thought , but which betray their utter unfitness as soon as we attempt to rise above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of the whole . The objections which are commonly made to the possibility of the personal existence of the Infinite did not make us waver in our conviction . But , when we sought to refute them , we felt that we were assuming a position in which only the strangest perversion of all natural relations could by any means place us . The course of development of philosophic thought brought us under the necessity of showing that the conditions of personality which we met in the finite did not fail in the infinite ; the natural connection of things must much more stimulate us to show that the full personality which is possible only to the infinite only is faintly reflected in the finite also ; for the peculiarities of the finite which we are accustomed wrongly to ascribe to its capability of personal existence are not producing conditions of independent being , but hindrances to its unconditioned development . For the finite being works everywhere with powers which it has not given to itself , and according to laws which it has not established , and thus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself alone , but in innumerable others like it . Hence , in its contemplation of itself , that being naturally seems to perceive in itself a dimly-discerned unknown sub . stance , something which is in the " I , ' , but is not the " I " itself , and on which , as its foundation , the whole personal development rests . Hence that questioning , which can never be wholly silenced , what , after all , we ourselycs are , what is our soul , what that obscure element is which is incomprehensible // to itself , which moves itself in our feelings and our passions , but which never rises to complete self-consciousness ? That these questions can arise at all , shows how far personality is from being developed in the degree which our conception of it requires and demands . It can be complete only in the Infinite Being , who , in the full survey of his own nature , never finds anything involved in his suffering or any law of his action which Is nut to him perfectly transparent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position of the finite spirit , which fixes it , as a member of the whole , to a determinate place in the order of the world , leads to this result , that its inner life is awakened by impulses which reach it gradually from without , and that it runs on according to the laws of a physical mechanism which causes the individual conceptions , feelings , and endeavors to crowd and displace each other . Here , therefore , there is a summing up of the whole self in a moment ; but our self-consciousness never gives us a complete , connected picture of our ego , even of its nature at any one moment , much less of the unity of its development in time . We always view ourselves from a one-sided standpoint , on which we are placed by those activities of our inner being which are just then in operation , and by which we are permitted just now to survey but a small part of our being . Upon the incentives which come to us we ever react according to the one-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited sense can we say with truth that we act ; for the most part action goes on in us through the single groups of ideas or feelings to which the physical mechanism gives preponderance at any given instant . Still less are we altogether under our own control in our growth in successive periods of time . Much vanishes from memory , but most of all the particular frames of mind gradually slip from its grasp . Many circles of thought where in youth we were at home we can bring back in old age only as strange phenomena . There are feelings in which we once reveled with enthusiasm , to which we can now scarcely find our way back , or recall a remnant of their former glow , which might cause us to feel again the power which they once had over us . There are strivings which we once thought to form // the most inalienable kernel of our very selves , which , on the changed path by which our later life has led us , appear to us as inexplicable wanderings , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , we have little ground for speaking of the personality of a finite being . It is an ideal , which , like every ideal , is appropriate , in its unconditionality , only to the infinite , and of which we partake , as of all good , only conditionally and therefore imperfectly . The simpler content of this section hardly stands in need of the brief summing up by which we now unite its results to those of previous sections . Self hood , the essence of all personality , is not the result of an opposition which has arisen or is now arising between " I " and " not-I " ; but it consists in an immediate , independent existence , which , on the contrary , forms the ground of the possibility of that opposition where such an opposition exists . Self-consciousness is the interpretation of this independent existence , coming by means of knowledge ; and this also is by no means necessarily connected with the distinction between I and a not-I , which is substantially opposed to it . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why the development of its personal consciousness can take place only through the influences of the totality of the world which is not itself , and thus through the impulse of the not-I ; not because it needed the opposition to something external in order to have an independent existence , but because , in this respect as in every other , it has not the conditions of its existence in itself . This limitation does not meet us in the being of the Infinite ; He alone , therefore , is capable of an independent existence which neither introduction nor further development through anything which is not itself , but , in an inward activity which has neither beginning nor end , maintains himself in himself . Complete personality is found only in God ; what belongs to all finite beings is only a feeble imitation of it . Finiteness is not a producing condition of that which is finite , but a barrier which hinders its full development .                    @
