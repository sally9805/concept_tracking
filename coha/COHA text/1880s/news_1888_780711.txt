txt The Court of Appeals has passed upon the Gilsey House and FifthAvenue Hotel Sunday liquor law test cases by dismissing them . They were argued some time ago under the titles , People ex tel . James IL Breslin , respondent , against Abraham Lawrence , Justice , appellant and respondent , and People ox rel . Charles N. Vilas , respondent , against the same appellant , by Noah Davis for the appellant and Robert G. Ingersoll for the respondents . The proceedings were originally instituted to obtain a judicial construction of section 21 of the excise law of 1873 . The relators were charged each with violating the law by having sold intoxicating liquors to be drank on the premises by a guest on Sunday . They were arrested and arraigned before a Police Magistrate , but subsequently were taken before Justice Lawrence on writs of habeas corpus . The Justice heard the case and dismissed the writs on the ground that both defendants were prevented from selling liquor on Sunday by the terms of their licenses , and that there was no question before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this decision , whereupon the cause was removed by certiorari to the latter court . Afterward that court reversed the order of Judge Lawrence , dismissing the writs and certiorari and remanding the relators to the Police Magistrate on the grounds that the warrants were illegal , because the excise law of 1857 , of which that of 1873 was supplemental , ever forbade hotel keepers to sell wines and liquors to their actual guests on Sunday . Col. Ingersoll in his argument defined beverage to mean " potions drank between meals . " The opinion of the Court of Appeals is Written by Judge Danforth , and " all concur " in his views . This is his opinion : The relator was arrested by virtue of a warrant issued by a Pollee Justice in the city of New-York charging the sale of wines and liquors on Sunday in violation of the statute , anti after pleading not guilty was , upon habeas corpus before Judge Lawrence , remanded to custody . On the application of the prisoner the Supreme Court at General Tenn allowed a writ of certiorari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , a Justice of the Supremo Court of the State of New-York , " requiring him to return to that court the record of the habeas corpus proceedings . lie did so , and upon consideration had the order of Justice ) Lawrence reversed and the Prisoner ordered to be discharged from custody . A notice was then served upon the relator 's attorney , signed " E. Henry Lacombe , Counsel to the Corporation , " and stating that " Abraham it . Lawrence , one of the J notices of the Supreme Court , appeals to the Court . of Appeals from the order of the General Term " above described . The couesel , in support of the appeal iu this court , also describe themselves as " Counsel to the Corporation . " We have considered the case with a desire to reach the question which lies at the bottom of the proceedings , and by construing the Excise act now in force dispose of it matter of public importance , but the respondent meets the appeal , not only on that point , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute by which the jurisdiction of this court is regulated . The argument has not Well successfully answered . The appellant claims that the appeal can stand upon the authority of section 519 of the Code of Criminal Procedure . This section declares that au appeal may be taken from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the following cases , and no other : First  --  From a judgment affirming or reversing a judgment et conviction . . Vecond  --  From ajtuignient affirming or reversing a judgment for the defendant on a demurrer to the indictment , or an order of the court arresting the j udgmun L Third  --  From a final determination affecting the substantial right of a defendant . The last subdivision is the One invoked as embracing the case before us . The appellant is Abraham R. Lawrence , not as RH individual , but iu his judicial character as a " Justice of the Supreme Court . " H He was styled defendant the court below in that character only , and time object of the proceedings in the General Term was to procure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity . We are unable to discover that he had an interest in maintaining the order , or that it affects any right peculiar to Meisel ! . or can he be regarded . as the appellant claims , in the Milt of a representative of parties who may be really interested , and as such " represent the substantial right of all parties who prosecute or defend In his name . ' We find no provision of law or practice which makes him a vicarious agent or officer . On the contrary , the Code of Civil Procedure ( section 2,059 ) vests that function in other officers by de . daring that " au appeal from a thud order discharg. lug a prisoner committed upon a criminal accusation , or from the affirmance of such au order , may be taken ; in the name of the people by the AttorneyGeneral or the District Attorney . " This provision took the place of section 70 , Part III , chapter 14 , sale I. , Article II. , page 573 , Revised Statutes , which made it the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error to ' the court for the correction of errors in case of the discharge by the Supreme Court of a - prisoner from it commitment upon a criminal accusation , Renee the appellant is not only not aggrieved , ho is in no sense entitled to represent those , if any there are , who have cause to complain of the order made by the Supremo Court . The learned counsel for the appellant cites , in support of tine appeal , the People ex rel. , &c.,; vs . Gilmore. ( 88 N. Y. , 626 . ) In that case , although the order was not reviewable on its merits , the appeal was entertained because the court below had , without authority , imposed costs upon the relator , and so much of it was reversed . In the case before us no costs were imposed by the Supreme Court , and neither in that , nor in the other cases also cited , Odunsell 's case , 101 N. Y. , 245 : Lawrence case , 56 Id. , 182 , ) wes the point now before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary to inquire . The objection to the proceeding now before us relates to matter of substance . tiro think it must Prevail , and the appeal is dismissed . J. H. Breslin , proprietor of the Gilsey House , who , with Charles N. Vilas of the Fifth-Avenue Hotel , was pat under arrest in May , 1887 , In order to furnish a test ease in regard to the application of the law of 1857 to the sale of liquors to guests in his house on Sunday , was found in the lobby of the Gilsey House last night in an exceedingly pleasant frame of mind . " The decision iu our favor by the Court of Appeals , " said ho , " is Just what I expected . Of course I am pleased , but I can not say that I am elated , for I never believed that the result would be any different . The whole business was ' put up ' upon us by the Exeise Board . We never at any time sold liquor over the bar on Sunday , but simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might prefer . The decision of the General Term reversing Judge Lawrence , nuts us upon the basis on which we have always stood . The dictum of the Court of Appeals , of course , is final as to the question involved , and we shall now furnish wine to our guests whenever it is required at meals or in their rooms . " Charles N. Vitas of the Fifth-Avenue Hotel was no less pleased with the action of the court , of last resort . " I have not seen the text of the decision , " said he , " but I understand that it affirms in the main the opinion of the General Term that the sale of liquors to guests at a hotel on Sunday , either with their meals or in their rooms , Is not in conflict with the provisions of the act of 1857 . We have never sold liquor over the bar here on Sunday . Tim point that the act 01 1857 has no application whatever to us is once for all settled . Our guests in the future will bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do so with the full sanction of the law . "
