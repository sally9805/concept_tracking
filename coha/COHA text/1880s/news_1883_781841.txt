txt The time is coming , and speedily , when it will be less easy than now to roll up a fortune of a hundred million dollars in this State by " watering " railroad and telegraph stocks .

The lessons it has learned from its Goulds and Vanderbilts have been costly , but they are well memorized . Indignant protests against corporate rapacity are heard on all sides from men who a few years ago looked upon the New-York Central Railroad Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company as semi-benevolent institutions , managed by men who were content to serve the public for a modest recompense .

It spoke out yesterday 1r condemnation of stock watering in emphatic and unmistakable terms . When the Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopts a report in which , among other declarations of similar tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late issue of $13,000,000 of Manhattan Elevated Railway stock constitute a grave offense against the community and should be made a misdemeanor by lal , " the least intelligent reader of the report knows precisely what is meant . Mr. JAY Gomm will have no sort-of difficulty in understanding it , and he can easily picture forth the consequences of such an expression of opinion from the chief commercial body of the City . Unfortunately , the past iniquities of Mr. GOULD and his fellow-offenders can not be adequately punished by laws yet to be made , though the unjust profits of their stock manipulations may be lawfully lessened . But the legislation suggested as a safeguard for . the future in the report of the Chamber of Commerce 's Special Committee on Railroad Transportation ought to be enacted at the coming session . And if a bill having in view the protection of the public from plunder by stock watering should be introduced it will be well for every member of the Legislature to understand that it will be very dangerous to yield to any form of " pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice of the people's.
