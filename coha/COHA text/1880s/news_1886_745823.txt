txt There was a lively fight at the meeting of the Central Labor Union in Clarendon . Hall yesterday , but no bones were broken or eyes blackened , and there was no necessity for the presence of the police , which it had been rumored the authorities intended to send there . The rumor , however , had the effect of making some of the delegates suspicious , and when the meeting had been in session for some time an excited delegate startled the assemblage by shouting out that a detective was in the room , at the same time pointing . out a sharp-eyed man . The Chairman ordered the suspected man . " to the bar of the house , " but he asked the Chairman to wait until the - meeting adjourned , when he would be very happy to visit the " bar " with him , and explained that he was James E. Curran , President of the International Boilermakers ' Union . The trouble began with the nomination of the Chairman . It was the turn of the International Boatmen 's Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union sprung a surprise by nominating an eccentric engineer , a friend of the Home Club , who was declared elected , and the adherents of the Home Club began to smile in anticipation of the victory they had planned to win over the trades unionists in this the last meeting of the Central Labor Union under the old constitution . Then followed the election of a - Grand Marshal and Chief of Police for the parade on . Labor Day . Several nominations were made for Marshal , but all the candidates withdrew or were absent except James P. Archibald , of the Excelsior Club . The union then went into executive session . Archibald was elected by a close vote , and John Devitt was unanimously elected as Chief of Police . The delegates of Typographical No. 6 gave notice that in view of Archibald 's election their union would not take part in the parade . A delegate from the Excelsior Club moved that the resolution offered on the preceding Sunday by John Moran , to undo the action of the Central Labor Union in censuring District Assembly No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reference to the troubles of the cigarmakers , and which had the effect . of breaking up the meeting with a free tight , be taken up for discussion . A motion to lay upon the table was ignored by the Chairman , and almost every man in the hall was on his feet striving with all his lung power for recognition . Finally a trades unionist managed to make himself heard and raised the point of order that the motion to discuss the resolutions were out of order . The Chairman overruled this , and was sustained on appeal . by a vote of 111 to 109 . This made the Home Club men confident , and they resolved to drive the iron home . One of their number asked the Chairman to declare that the Progressive Union of Cigarmakers , having ceased to exist , ought . not to be represented in the Central Labor ? Union . The Chairman promptly complied with the request , saying that by reason of the consolidation of that union with the International Union its delegates were not entitled to seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same effect as would an Anarchist 's bomb thrown into the middle of the hall , except that no one was killed . It raised every man from his seat and the languages were badly mutilated . The choicest specimens of blackguardism were bandied back and forth , - and it looked for a time as if the scenes of a week ago would be repeated in the blackening of eyes and cracking of heads . Finally a delegate was heard appealing from the decision , and the Chairman was overruled by a vote of 125 to 114 . During the taking of the vote James E. Quinn and Hugh Carey ; the managers of the Home Club , stood with books in their hands jotting down the names of every man affiliated with the Knights of Labor who voted against . them , and trying to frighten them into compliance with their will . The trades-Unionists followed up their success with a motion to . adjourn , - Which was ? carried by 12 ( 3 to 120 , an ? . the Central Labor Union was - declared. adjourned ' sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-an uzly mood , while Delegate Jabilnowsky , of the Progressive Union , and the . trade unionists generally wore broad grins on their faces . Typographical Union No. 6 held a meeting late in the day and prepared an address to all trade and labor organizations in New-York and vicinity , " in which they announced that the union would not participate in the parade and picnic of the Central Labor Union for this reason : " That the Central Labor Union has appointed as the Grand Marshal of the parade a person who is an active member of an organization which has shown itself to be antagonistic to the principles of trades unionism . " The address then says that in order to have a parade which will represent the true trades unionists of New-York and vicinity Typographical Union No. 6 invites all the trade and labor organizations of New York and vicinity which believe in a parade marshaled by a representative of a bona fide trade and labor organization to send delegates to Clarendon . Hall on Saturday evening next at 8 o'clock to make arrangements for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
