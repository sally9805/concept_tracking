SECOND PAPER : ACROSS THE ROCKIES IN MONTANA . THE old order of developing new regions in the West is reversed since the railroad era began . Formerly the Country was settled first , and the towns grew up to supply the needs of the rural population . Now the towns are created by speculators far in advance of the farming settlement ; and by the conveniences they afford for selling crops , and buying implements , lumber , and household supplies , they attract farmers to their vicinity . Each new frontier town is an advertisement of the surrounding country , upon the settlement of which it must depend for its existence . The towns-folk are untiring in their praises of the soil and climate , and if you believe them the next grade of human felicity to living in their raw little village is to live upon a farm in the neighborhood . Whatever happens in the way of disagreeable weather , they assure you it is good for the crops . If it snows in May or hails in June , they come up smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops need . The creation of a new town on a line of railroad pushing its track out into the vacant , treeless spaces of the far West , is an interesting process to observe . A speculator , or a company of speculators , look over the ground carefully fifty or a hundred miles in advance of the temporary terminus of the railroad , and hit upon a site which they think has special advantages , and is far enough away from the last town . They make a treaty with the railroad company for a section of land , agreeing , perhaps , to share the prospective profits on the sale of lots . Then they " scrip " the adjoining sections of Government land , or take it up with desert land claims . A large amount of land scrip is afloat on the market issued in pursuance of Indian treaties , Agricultural College grants , old Military Bounty Land acts , and other peculiar features of our complicated Public Land System . The speculator with his pocket stocked with scrip is able to pick out any choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus obtained a sufficient . body of land to operate with , the founding of the new town is trumpeted in the newspapers , and in all the frontier region for hundreds of miles there is a stir of excitement about the coming city . Billings , on the Yellowstone , is a good example of a town made by this process . A few VOL . XXJV. - 67. months ago it had no existence save in the brains of its inventors . The bare prairie was staked out in streets , avenues , and parks , on a scale for a city of twenty thousand inhabitants . A map was engraved , and within a few weeks after the place got its name , the " Billings boom " began to be talked of as far east as St. Paul . Billings lots were advertised in every town from St. Paul to Miles City , and whole blocks were sold in Chicago and New York . The purchasers , as a rule , knew no more about the valley of the Yellowstone than about that of the Congo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot upon a map within a hundred miles of Billings . They heard there was a boom , and were eager to take their chances for profit or loss . It was enough for them to hear the place spoken of as the future metropolis of the Yellowstone Valley . Within sixty days from the time when Billings got a local habitation and a name , lots to the value of $220,000 were sold within its limits , and before thirty days more had elapsed the purchasers had advanced the imaginary value of their holdings from one hundred to three hundred per cent . Charles Dickens once said that the typical American would hesitate about entering heaven , unless assured that he could go further West . Going West is still a potent phrase to stir the blood of the enterprising and adventurous , and the farther West you go the greater seems to be its power . The men who lead the advance of the army of civilization on the frontier skirmish line do not come from the rear . They are always the scouts and pickets . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a rule they are from the one-year-old and two-yearold towns a little further back . Most of the men I met in the Yellowstone country were from Eastern Dakota , or the Black Hills region , or from Western Minnesota . When asked why they left homes so recently friade in a new country , their reply was invariably that they wanted to get further West . We came upon Billings one sunny day in May-dropped upon it , I might say ; for after a ten miles ' drive across a high and windy plateau , the immense dazzling range of the Big Snowy Mountains looming up in front , the ground fell away abruptly and the town // *4 ; * * ) * 4 z U ) H 0 H U ) U ) H H 0 U ) H U ) C ) U ) U ) H 0 U ) U ) 0 H U ) U ) H U ) U ) H U ) H H U ) U ) U ) H U ) U ) U ) H I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . The yellow-pine houses , untouched by paint , glistened in the sunlight like gold . The valley , hemmed in by precipitous cliffs on the north , and by black , bare hills beyond the muddy river on the south , stretched away to the west to distant mountain slopes . Under the shadow of a huge sandstone butte lay the little hamlet of Coulson , now quite out of spirits because of the new town a mile further on . Old Coulson , it is called , though I believe its age is only three years . It has made some money buying buffalo robes of the Crow Indians across the river , and selling shirting , groceries , and whisky to a few herdsmen whose cattle graze in the Musselshell Ranges . Now it must abandon its score of " shacks " and shanties or move them up to Billings . The new town , when I visited it , consisted of perhaps fifty cheap structures scattered over a square mile of bottom-land , but the number may be increased tenfold by the time this article is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in their canvas-covered wagons , waiting for lumber to arrive with which to build houses . Sixty dollars a thousand was the price of a poor quality of green stuff brought from a mill twenty miles up the Yellowstone . All articles of food , except beef , were frightfully dear . Potatoes were eight cents a pound , flour six dollars a sack . I doubt if one in ten of the inhabitants could tell why he had come . The migrating impulse is the only way to account for the movement of merchants , mechanics , farmers , speculators , gamblers , liquor-sellers , preachers , and doctors to a point nearly one hundred and fifty miles from anything that can be called a town  --  a point , too , in a region inhabited only by Crow Indians and a fe*v scattered herdsmen . At the signal that a town was to be created , all these people , of divers possessions and ambitions , moved forward and occupied the site as though they were soldiers marching at the word of command . What a wonderful self-organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul , the milliner from Minneapolis , the Chinese laundryman from the Pacific slope , the blacksmith , the carpenter , the butcher , the beer-seller , the grocer , and all the other constituent parts of a complete community happen to feel the desire , at the same time , to go with their trades and wares to a remote spot in an unknown land ? Billings expects to be a trading center for the stock country between the Yellowstone and the Missouri , and for the Clark 's Fork and Maginnis Mines . It is at the western end of a rich bottom about thirty miles long and from three to seven wide , all of which is 77 ' to be turned into farms by an irrigating ditch . Good crops can be raised without irrigation three seasons out of four on land skirting the river , but the productiveness of the soil will be greatly increased , as well as all fear of droughts removed , by tapping the abundant water supply of the Yellowstone . Divided into small farms , and irrigated , the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fruitful in grain and vegetables as it is now attractive for its striking and beautiful scenery . The Upper Yellowstone Yalley differs greatly in its character from the lower valley . The bottom on which Billings stands is the last ample stretch of tillable land as you go toward the mountains . Further up there is a succession of smaller bottoms closely hemmed in by the graceful contour of steep hills , whose tops are sparsely covered with pines . Now and then there is a stone butte , but these monotonous sentinels of the lower stream grow more and more rare . The last one I remember as conspicuous for its form stands a few miles above the mouth of Clark 's Fork . We named it Ehrenbreitstein from its resemblance to the great fortress on the Rhine . A colony of farmers from near Ripon , Wisconsin , has settled hard by . As one progresses westward , following the course of the river , or striking across the grassy hill country to avoid its bends and bluffs , there are evidences of diminishing rainfall in the beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dusty soil and the scantier herbage . Only along the great level , in the valley hugging the river do the ranchmen try to raise crops without i*rigation . On the cattle ranches in the hills there is no tillage save where a living spring affords a little water for a garden . All the valley land is admirably situated for irrigation ; and the Yellowstone , fed by melting snows , has its highest stage in June and July , when its waters are needed by the thirsty soil . What can be done for the thousands of square miles of rich land between the valleys of the streams in all this wild mountain country is a problem which the future must solve . The soil is excellent for grain and vegetables , yet it can be used for nothing but cattle ranges unless artesian wells can be made to supply the lack of rainfall . For a day 's journey west of Billings the magnificent range of the Snowy Mountains keeps the traveler company . They loom up ahead in the clear air as if hardly ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fifty miles . At the time of my journey their tops were thickly shrouded in snow , and on their sides only here and there a streak of rock was to be seen . There are few Alpine prospects that surpass for grand- // cur and beauty the view of this mighty range . From the heights skirting the valley another range can be seen to the southward-the Prior Mountains , a long , black , regular ridge , with a sheet of snow thrown over its top . The second day out from Billings , the Crazy Mountains , an isolated group , also of marked Alpine character , take the place of the Big Snowies on the western horizon . All these peaks and ridges are virgin to foot of man . Some day , perhaps , there will be cozy hotels at their feet ; and young men with alpenstocks in hand and with sun-blistered faces , and hobnailed shoes , will come down from their summits displaying in their hats , not the Edelweiss , - for this shy , fuzzy flower is nowhere found on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the golden wild-pea blossoms which love lofty and sterile places . The wild flowers of Montana are as abun dant as those of the Alps , and more varied . Choicest of them all , because most delicate and fragrant , is a white , star-shaped , wax-like blossom which grows very close to the ground , and the large golden stamens of which give out an odor like mingled hyacinth and lily of the valley . The people call it the mountain-lily . There is another lily , however , and a real one-yellow with purple stamens-that grows on high slopes in shaded places . The yellow flowering currant abounds on the lower levels , and the streams are often bordered with thickets of wild-rose bushes . Dandelions abound , but do not open in full , rounded perfection . The common blue larkspur , however , is as well developed as in our eastern gardens , and the little yellow violet which in the States haunts the woods and copses is at home in Montana , alike in the moist valleys and upon the bleak dry hill-sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in valleys and on mountain ridges , and in early June there blooms a unique flower called the shooting star , shaped like a shuttlecock . There are a dozen other pretty flowers , but I could not learn their names-among them a low-growing mass the clumps of which are starred over with delicate white or purple blooms . It was a surprise to find the Upper Yellowstone Valley already well settled . In the hundred miles before the road to Bozeman leaves the river and climbs the divide of the Belt Mountains one is rarely out of sight of a ranch . The settlers came in from the west during the last two years , anticipating the building of the railroad . They have already done a good deal of fencing with pine saplings , and their little dirt-roofed log " shacks " are snug and warm , if not roomy . A log stable and a corral for stock complete the array of farm buildings . A little land is cultivated close to the river , and there is unlimited range for stock upon the hills . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of living . Some have drifted all the way from California or Oregon , establishing ranches in one valley after another and selling them to go to a farther frontier . They will soon meet the tide of settlement moving up the Yellowstone from the east . There is only a gap of about three hundred miles to be closed ; and that is by no means a vacant space , for in it are the little towns of Miles City , Junction City , Huntley , Coulson , and Billings . A serious obstacle to the thorough settlement of this region is the Crow Indian Reservation , which stretches along the south side of the river for over two hundred miles , and has an average width of about seventyfive miles . Its area can not be much less than that of Massachusetts , and it probably contains as much land valuable for the uses of man as that State . Upon this magnificent domain live about three thousand Indians . I do not know what the statistics of the Interior Department may be upon which rations and blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population , including the " squaw-men " and half-breeds , at from two thousand five hundred to three thousand . A squaw-man , by the way , is a white man who has an Indian wife and lives with a tribe . The Crows make no use of their land save to hunt over it . In winter they cluster around the agency and subsist on Government beef and flour , killing a few buffaloes for their hides , which they sell , and in summer they roam across the country . They own forty thousand ponies . They are rarely seen in the valley of late , having been scared away by stories of smallpox in the camps of the graders on the railroad line . Some of the shrewder chiefs begin to recognize the inevitable , and say that their people must soon learn to farm and give up their hunting grounds . The Crows have long been friends of the whites , but they are a thievish , begging race , and far below their old enemies , the Sioux , in intelligence , handicraft , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors as chasing , killing , and scalping the Sioux , but they rarely fail to seek the protection of the nearest military post when the Sioux hunting ponies come within a hundred miles of them . In the North-western country , the Indians have of late seldom committed any more serious crime than running off stock ; but solitary travelers still find it prudent to make a display of a magazine rifle , and to keep a // sharp eye on any roving bands they may encounter . The Indian , whether he be Crow , Blackfoot , Flathead , or Sioux , finds it hard to resist the temptation of a good opportunity to secure a horse and a scalp at the same time . The Crows lately gave up the western end of their reservation  --  a strip about forty miles long by sixty wide , containing the recentlydiscovered Clark 's Fork gold and silver mines . This strip fronts on the Yellowstone , and contains some good bottom-land favorably situated for irrigation . The bill ratifying the treaty for the cession was signed by the President on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of the river was dotted at short intervals with the canvas-covered wagons of squatters from the older-settled valleys of Montana , each of whom had his eye on a section opposite , and was waiting for news of the signing of the bill to cross over and take possession . One morning a courier came over the pass from Bozeman with the word that the bill was signed and the land restored to the public domain . Immediately there was a forward movement all along the forty-mile line . It is said that by seven o'clock that evening there was not a single section of good bottom-land unoccupied . When I passed through the valley , six weeks later , most of the new settlers had their logcabins already up , and had fenced a great deal of land . The eager enterprise shown in the instant occupancy of the retroceded portion of the Crow Reservation is an evidence that good land which can easily be irrigated is not abundant , and has a special value in the eyes of Montana farmers . It is probably safe to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of the Yellowstone country , including the main valley and those of the tributary streams , is a region where only by irrigation can farming be successfully carried on , year after year . Narrow strips of land bordering a stream are here and there found moist enough to produce oats and potatoes without irrigating ; but no general culture of the region is possible save where water can be brought upon the soil by artificial means . The whole of eastern Montana is a vast grazing region , creased with little winding valleys sunk two or three hundred feet below the general level , in which farming by means of irrigating ditches is very profitable . Not one acre in one thousand , however , can ever be made to produce crops unless a system of artesian wells is found in the future to be practicable . The place of eastern Montana in the industrial economy of the Union is to raise beef and mutton . Her farmers will never do more than to supply with grain and provisions the herdsmen of the hills and plateaus and the miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high prices always ready to take his products , the Montana farmer will always be more favorably situated than the farmer of Iowa , Kansas , and others of the great agricultural States of the West whose crops must go to the distant eastern cities to find* consumers . Near the mouth of Skull Creek , on the Upper Yellowstone , are the remains of an old Crow cemetery . Upon a rude platform about twelve feet above the ground , lie one on another perhaps thirty bodies , wrapped in blankets and buffalo-robes . The bears have torn down a portion of the platform , and the ground is strewn with a horrible debris of bones , skulls , fragments of garments , and dreadful , half-decayed , shapeless masses covered with vermin . Another platform on a high hill near by we did not care to visit , nor did we go down to the cotton-wood grove by the river to get a closer view of the dark objects hanging like gigantic fruit to the limbs . The Crow custom of placing their dead upon platforms , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt originated in the difficulty of burying bodies with the rude implements of their savage state , at a sufficient depth to protect them from the coyotes , those jackals of the plains . Some religious superstition has probably grown with time around a practice originally purely utilitarian . Hard by the broken platform with its disgusting burden stands the neat little log-cabin of a settler who has fenced in a claim , and counts upon comfort in the near future from his fertile acres and from his herd of cattle on the range among the hills . Two pretty children were playing around the door . The mother was busy with the house-work , and the father stopped chopping wood to show us the peas and beets growing in his garden . Here was a striking contrast between the old and new order of things in the far West . In sight of the moldering corpses of a dying race of savages stood the homestead of the typical American pioneer  --  a hardy , intelligent man , delighting in the robust toil with which he was winning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of his place as a private soldier in the advancing army of civilization . Is it not better that such men , with their wives and children , should occupy the land , than that a few thousand painted savages should roam over it in search of buffaloskins and scalps ? I do not overlook the humanities of the Indian question , but I see no reason why a handful of people should keep // vast regions from settlement , should be exempt from toil , and clad and fed at the public expense , merely because they have red skins . We followed the Yellowstone as far as the Great Bend , where to pursue its course further would have taken us southward through narrow defiles and cafions to the National Park . Thence we crossed the Belt Mountains to Bozeman in the Gallatin Valley . The river for the last two days of our journey was a cold-blue , rapid stream abounding in trout , and drawing its waters from springs and the melting snows in the mountains . The scenery became more and more attractive as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either hand , and making , with their white summits and white-streaked sides , and the dark firs belting their lower slopes , a vivid contrast of color with the turf of the uplands , the vivid light green of the young cotton-woods and aspens , and the Rhine-like blue of the river . Among the mountain groups and ranges the most fascinating and the most decidedly Alpine in appearance is the isolated group of the Crazy Mountains lying north of the river . It resembles somewhat the Shreckhorn and Wetterhorn group near Griindelwald in Switzerland . The Crazies send down no glaciers from their towering rocky sides , but the deep masses of snow which fill the depressions between the shoulders of the different peaks might easily be taken for such rivers of ice as push their way into the Swiss valleys . Skirting the base of the Crazies we were met by one of those sudden and severe storms of wind , rain , and hail so common in the Rocky Mountain regions . It swooped down upon us majestically from the Yellowstone Mountains , a snowy range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it buffeted us for fifteen minutes with mad fury , and then sailed off to the east like a gigantic black bird . While we were struggling in the icy grasp of the tempest , we could see the white crags and pinnacles of the Crazies luminous in vivid sunlight against a sky of perfect azure . The spectacle seemed almost supernatural , so startling and wonderful was its beauty . It was like gazing on the gleaming walls of Paradise from the midst of the storm and darkness of the vexed and toilsome life of earth . Animal life is not abundant in the Yellowstone Valley . Buffaloes rarely cross the river now , but the whole country is strewn with their skulls and bones , and now and then one comes upon the remains of a bull killed by the Indians during the last winter hunting season . There are antelope back in the hills , and the enormous antlers of the elk , which adorn the gable of every ranchman 's cabin , testify to the sport which may be found by striking back from the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacktail deer , they are still so plentiful that a few hours ' tramp of a morning rarely fails to afford the hunter a good shot . The prairie dog still inhabits the whole valley , and you are not long out of sight of a village of these merry , chattering little creatures , who keep tune with their tails to their querulous notes , and provoke you by their impudence to try a shot with your revolver , but always dodge down into their holes in time to escape a bullet . Large herds of cattle graze in the valleys of the Yellowstone and its tributaries , and in the hill country as far north as the Upper Missouri , wherever there are small streams or water holes . Now that the buffalo is fast disappearing , the region would afford pasturage to at least ten times as many cattle as it supports at present . The stock men who occupy it are generally careful , however , not to let this fact be known , as they naturally would like to keep the whole section for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exceedingly profitable business . One hears a great deal said in the Territory of the wealth of the " cattle-kings , " and how they began their careers a few years ago with only a few hundred dollars . The local estimate of the annual return from money invested in a herd of cattle is from thirty to fifty per cent . The life of a stockman is not , however , an idle and comfortable one , as often pictured in the newspaper accounts of the business . Unless he is rich enough to hire herdsmen he must look after his herd constantly . He lives , as a rule , in a wretched dirt-roof " shack , " and passes most of the time in the saddle , seeing that his animals do not stray too far off the range . In the fierce winter storms he must be out driving the herd into ravines and deep valleys , where they will be protected from the wind . No shelter is built for stock in Montana . The dried bunch-grass furnishes abundant winter grazing , and the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four per cent . In the spring each owner " rounds up " his herd , and brands the calves . Every ranchman has his own brand , which he registers in the office of the county clerk , and advertises in the nearest local paper , printed , it may be , one or two hundred miles from his range . The annual drive of bullocks across the plains southward to the Union Pacific Railroad , or eastward to the temporary terminus of the Northern Pacific , takes place in the summer months . Before taking leave of the Yellowstone Valley , along which this article has thus far carried the reader , let me say that the pict // ures I have tried to draw of its scenery are all from observations made in a journey in the brief spring season of May , r882* when the grass was green . After June it is a sere and yellow land , the bunch-grass curing upon the ground and giving to all the landscape a sad , autumnal look . It is a treeless region , too save xvher* the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the dwarf fir clings to the steep mountain sides , making black patches below the snow-line . The beauty of the valley is not , therefore , the beauty of green and wooded valleys like those of the Hudson , the Connecticut , or the Ohio , but the valley has a beauty of its own ,  - -  strange , singular , and often startling by its sharp contrasts between lofty and savage mountain peaks , gigantic walls of rock and gentle slopes and fair , level pastures , basking by the side of swift , limpid streams . The Belt Mountains are crossed by the road leading from the Upper Yellowstone to the Gallatin Valley , at an elevation of five thousand four hundred feet ,  --  a little less than the height of Mount Washington . The ascent is easy and gradual , but the descent is abrupt through a savage gorge , where the narrow path clings to the side of dizzy abysses . Once out of the gorge , you come suddenly into the wide , fertile , and well-settled plain , watered by the Gallatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bozeman in an hour . A western fort , by the way , has nothing warlike in its appearance . There are neither walls nor cannon ,  --  nothing , in fact , but a rectangle of frame structures surrounding a parade ground , neat cottages for the officers , long , ugly barracks for the men , store-houses , stables , etc . The soldiers look like laborers in blue blouses , and the officers , when not on duty , dress in easy n*glig* costumes ,  --  blue flannel shirts , loose jackets and trowsers , and felt hats . They are genial , hospitable gentlemen , but are apt to have the failing of the army in Flanders . As story-tellers they are unrivaled , and few men can get as much amusement out of a pack of cards . A pleasant , social life is often found at a post . The older officers have families , and the presence of ladies and children brings to the garrison the refinements of civilized society . Bozeman , named from the brave Montana pioneer who was killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred inhabitants , and , never having been a mining town , wears a settled and respectable air rare in the far XVest . There are many pretty frame houses with gardens and door-yards , a few substantial brick blocks , two or three churches , a big school-house , and a courthouse with an ambitious tower . Indeed , were it not for the irrigating ditches which run through the place and the lofty snow mountains which bound the horizon on all sides , one might think himself in some Illinois or Iowa county-seat . Strangers visiting Bozeman are always taken by some public-spirited citizen up to a mount of vision west of the town , from whence the whole broad valley can be seen , with its fields of grain , its swift streams , its irrigating ditches glistening in the sunlight like silver ribbons , its cozy little farm-houses , and its encircling rim of gray mountains crowned with snow . It is a lovely prospect , and doubly impressive because of the hundreds of miles of savage , desolate country one traverses to reach it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiter . Nobody serves willingly in the western territories . The man who brings you a pitcher of water , or harnesses your horse , puts on a familiar swagger , as if to show that he is only doing such menial work temporarily , and considers himself just as good as you . The Bozeman waiter came up to the new guest with a patronizing air and asked if he were hungry . The guest replied that he was . " I 'm glad of it , " remarked the waiter ; " I like a hungry man . " The next meal the guest presumed upon his enjoyment of the waiter 's acquaintance to ask , " How are the cakes this morning ? " but the waiter was out of humor and replied in a surly tone , " Darned if I know , I haint tried em . " Our party stopped at a wayside inn one day . There was a hamlet of three or four houses on a creek . The place seemed deserted , but the halting of a team before the log building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man appeared from behind a barn , another from a field , a third from a gulch ; in fact they seemed to rise up out of the ground ; the prospect of a treat , however remote , where liquor is twenty-five cents a drink , never fails to gather a crowd in this thirsty region . One of the party fell into conversation with a man who proved to be a doctor . A rough fellow , wearing leather riding-breeches and an immense dirt-colored felt hat , took a seat on the bar near by and listened intently to the talk . " I suppose your practice here must be largely eleemosynary , " said the traveler to the physician . " Hell ! stranger , " interrupted the cowboy , " that 's a good word . Whar did you git it ? " Apropos of frontier irianners is an incident which can be located , as well as anywhere , at Kurtzville , a log town of seventeen saloons , // one store , and one hotel . A New York gentleman got out of the stage-coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little sherry in a wine-glass . The bar-keeper glared at him for a moment , then reached for a six-shooter and pointing it at the terrified traveler shouted , " Now , I tell you , tenderfoot , you take whisky . You take it in a tincup and you like it . " The stranger took the whisky in the tin-cup , asserted that it was the best he ever drank , and made haste to get back to the coach . The valleys of the three rivers which form the Missouri , the Gallatin , the Madison , and the Jefferson , seen from the hill east of Bozeman form the best developed agricultural region of Montana , and I think the only section of the Territory where broad areas of land can be seen under cultivation . Elsewhere the farms are narrow strips skirting the banks of streams . Not that the good land all lies in belts close to the creeks and rivers , but thus far farming has only been attempted where water could be brought upon the fields without much labor or expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation requiring considerable capital for constructing long main ditches will be introduced , as has already been done in Colorado . Hundreds of thousands of fertile acres lie idle which can easily be reclaimed and made to produce large crops by utilizing the water now running to waste . Montana agriculture thus far is rudimentary and superficial . Men took to it as a business , because the isolation of the Territory and the demands of the mining camps for food and forage opened home markets at exceedingly high prices . When land could be had for the taking , and by a cheap and simple method of irrigation be made to produce sixty bushels of oats , fifty of wheat or three hundred of potatoes to the acre , farming was more profitable than gold mining . The old ranchmen would like to see this state of things continue . They are angry at the railroads pushing into the Territory from east , west , and south , foreseeing that the old era of high prices , free and easy living , vigilance committees and revolver law is doomed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life prevailing in the densely settled portions of the country . One of the results of the construction of railroads through Montana will be to increase the price of land and diminish the value of crops ,  --  a seeming paradox explained by the fact that hitherto no reasonable ratio has existed between the two . A man 's farm has hardly been salable for the amount realized from its annual product . For example , a young man , owning one of the best ranches in the Galla tin valley , recently married in the East ; and as his wife did not like Montana-no woman does until she has lived a long time in the Territory-he sold his ranch for $2500 . A few days after he signed the deed , one of the Bozeman merchants paid him $3500 for the crop of oats he had just harvested . Farming by irrigation is more laborious and expensive than the ordinary method , but it yields much larger returns . A Montana farmer would think he had unusually bad luck if a field of fifty acres did not average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water brought upon the land is believed to have fertilizing properties , although it is usually as clear as spring water . A field farmed by irrigation must be so situated that water can be brought along one side of it in a main ditch , and must have sufficient slope for cross ditches to be run with a plow from twelve to twenty feet apart . If the season is very dry , water must be brought upon the whole field three times ; in an ordinary season once or twice is often enough . The ground must be thoroughly moistened plowshare deep . The farmer goes along the ditches with a spade , making little dams to spread the water , and thus patch by patch he gets the whole surface drenched at last . From Bozeman to Helena is about one hundred miles , and the sparsely settled condition of Montana will be understood when I say , that in the region settled seventeen years ago , with the exception of one little mining village of perhaps two hundred inhabitants , nothing which can possibly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little belt of farming settlement follows the banks of the Missouri for twenty miles below the junction of the three rivers , and a few creeks coming down from the mountain sides are dotted with ranches . The lines of black alders fringing these creeks can be seen ten miles away ,  --  narrow , bright-green ribbons laid across the gray , bunch-grass slopes from the gorges in the foot-hills down to the deep valley of the river . There are striking views of the Belt Mountains on the east and the main range of the Rockies on the west to be had from the high divides between the creeks , and at one point the Missouri can be seen for many miles ,  --  a clear , winding stream embracing countless little green islands . The country is covered with a sparse growth of bunchgrass growing in stands of about a dozen stacks with bare spaces as large as a dinnerplate between . The grass gives color to the valleys , slopes , and hills ; but nowhere is it thick enough to look like an eastern pasture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They look fat and contented , but to // thrive upon the scant grass they require a wide range . As much as ten acres of grazing ground for each animal is the ranchman s usual estimate . Helena is a town of six thousand inhabitants , wedged in a cleft between base hills and debouching upon the plain as best it can among enormous piles of stones and dirt ,  --  the debris of extensive placer mines . Scarcely have the miners spared room enough for the road to get into the town among their hidec*us heaps and holes . An unclean business this placer mining , carried on in mud and dirty water and leaving ghastly gashes and scars on the face of the country . The town is the outgrowth of a prosperous mining camp ,  --  the Last Chance gulch , from which it is said more gold has been taken than from any other single locality in the world . Its situation as the nearest point in the mining region to the head of navigation on the Missouri River at Fort Benton made Helena a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year s supply of goods during the brief season of navigation . Thus it got a start as the chief commercial town of the territory . It still keeps the lead , and will continue to keep it unless the railroads should develop a larger town in the Yellowstone Valley . Ugly to the eye , with its scrambling , shadeless streets clinging to the steep hills ; its narrow , crooked , ill-built business thoroughfare , and its blotch of a Chinese suburb , Helena is , nevertheless , an attractive place . The traveler can enjoy his ease in a comfortable hotel , read the news morning and evening in intelligent , wellprinted daily papers , take his choice of seven churches on Sunday , read the new publications in a public library , supply his needs at stores as large and as well-stocked as are found in cities ten times as large in the east , and enjoy the society of people who add to culture that stamp of originality of character so common in the far West , and so rare in old communities . The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has metropolitan airs . It does its own thinking without reference to Chicago or New York , and has its own code of morals , which includes the toleration of public gaming-houses on the most eligible corners of the main street . People speak of " the States , " as of some fardistant country in whose affairs they take but slight interest . The height of human felicity , in their opinion , is to live in Montana and " strike it rich " on a quartz lead . The highest title to distinction is to be an old resident . The red-faced miner or ranchman in a big clay-colored sombrero , who brings down his fist upon the bar and says , " I am an old Montanian , " feels as genuine a pride as did 777 the Roman citizen of old when he boasted of a share in the empire of the world . To have come into the territory in 1862 is an honor here as great as a lord 's title in England . The cordial hospitality shown to strangers by the better class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acquaintances are easily made ; and the traveler who lately was glad of a chance to unroll his blankets at night on the floor of a ranchman 's cabin finds himself entertained at bountiful tables , and surrounded by the accessories of a tasteful and comfortable home life . It is a thousand miles across vast , desolate spaces to the nearest city ; but here are pictures , books , pianos , and luxurious furniture . The only noticeable difference in the talk of social circles observed by one fresh from the east , is that the current news and political discussion of " the States " are of slight interest here , and are rarely mentioned , and that local affairs , including the heroic days of the Vigilance Committee , are much dwelt upon . You will very likely learn that the prominent lawyer or banker who sits next you at dinner , was a leading vigilant and helped hang a dozen robbers and murderers . The papers give but a meager telegraphic summary of events in the world outside Montana , and the St. Paul and Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have few readers . Hemmed in by mountains and separated from the well-settled portions of the west by wide areas of vacant country , Montana has thus far been a region apart , and has worked out her own destiny without much help from beyond . Soon the territory will be traversed from east to west by eight hundred miles of railway . Population will pour in and the little mountain community , grown to the dimensions of a State , will assimilate with the nation at large . We crossed the main divide of the Rockies at Frenchwoman 's Pass , about fifteen miles north-west of Helena . The pass gets its name from a woman who was murdered by her husband in the early days of Montana settlement , and over it runs the main road between Helena and the Upper Missouri country , and the valleys watered by the tributaries of the Columbia . We went up the pass in fine style , - four handsome horses and the best driver in Montana , " Gib , " a graduate of the Overland Mail service , a powerful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish bull-fighter , but with a soft voice , and an admirable dignity and quietness of manner . He talked to his horses *n low tones , never a loud word or an oath , chiding or encouraging them as they deserved , and they seemed perfectly to understand every word he said . When we came to narrow places in // the road , overhanging precipices , where two teams could not pass , his voice rang out like a bugle in a high , piercing cry to warn teamsters who might be out of sight around a corner , not to advance further . Less musical , perhaps , than the modulated shout with which the Venetian gondolier turns a corner , the cry of the Rocky Mountain driver , flung back from lofty peak or cafion wall , is nevertheless much more thrilling . Gib 's leaders were adorned with a great number of ivory rings attached to the martingales ,  --  the private property of the driver and a badge of distinction on the road . All the farmers ' " whips " ornament their leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory rings on the martingales . The teamsters gave way to the great man as we passed , and even the stages yielded half the road ,  --  a courtesy accorded to no ordinary outfit ,  --  and the drivers hailed Gib in tones of respectful comradeship . The ascent of the eastern slope of Frenchwoman 's Pass is not at all difficult . A fair road climbs up through a forest of firs between masses of rock and over brawling torrents . Through rifts in the forest there are here and there views of the broad Prickly Pear Valley and the Belt Range beyond , and of nearer rounded summits of the Rockies ,  --  huge hemispheres of granite and snow . At the top of the pass is a broad green meadow-like expanse , flecked with patches of snow all summer , and rimmed around with the dark firs . Upon the very ridge-pole of the water-shed , where a melting snow-bank divided its favors between two tiny rivulets , one running to the Atlantic and the other to the Pacific , we halted and opened a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a fellow traveler at the foot of Gray 's Peak in Colorado . Flowers grew in abundance among the **26;953;TOOLONG , bluebells , yellow violets , wind-flowers , and half a dozen other species . The road from the summit wound down over green slopes , and through woodland patches , following the course of the Little Blackfoot Greek for two hours ; then across windy ridges until the deep , broad valley of the Deer Lodge River burst into sight . A great difference was observed between the vegetation on the two sides of the Main Divide . The Pacific Slope shows a much richer flora ; the grass is better and more abundant ; many shrubs and flowers flourish that are not seen east of the range ; the forests o1 fir and pine descend farther into the valleys ; streams are more frequent , and have a greater volume of water . Evidently the warm , moist currents of air from the Pacific Ocean striking against the Rockies leave much of their moisture before they reach the valleys of the eastern slope . In thirty miles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of settlement we saw were four log-houses , a saw-mill , and a flock of sheep . Plenty of room here for people who want to lead a pastoral life on sunny green slopes near mighty forests , by swift , clear streams , with snow peaks cutting the blue sky and nature furnishing whole acres of dwarf sunflowers and larkspur for flower gardens . Not so far from the good things of civilization , either ; for what is that ten miles away in the valley ? Church spires , surely , and pretty white houses in a mass of green . Yes , it is the village of Deer Lodge , prettiest of the Montana towns . Near acquaintance does not lessen its beauty . Its twelve hundred inhabitants support excellent schools in buildings that would do no discredit to a New England town . They live in neat houses , and have gardens and lawns xvatered by clear , full streams , and boast of the best weekly newspaper in the territory . Their valley lies about four thousand feet above the sea level , and is rather cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barley , and potatoes are produced . Montana potatoes , by the way , are of prodigious size and of corresponding excellence . Until you have eaten them you do not know what the potato is capable of . From Deer Lodge my route led westward fifty miles over high grassy hills , past placer mining camps where the face of the country for miles has been gashed and scarred-all of the soil washed away in the eager search for grains and nuggets of gold , and nothing left but sand and heaps of bowlders . Hideous little villages squat on the brink of these excavations , or sprawl out , hot and dusty , in the bottoms of the gulches , populated chiefly by saloon-keepers and Chinamen . In the single street of one of these villages , where we stopped for dinner , lay a big rock , an obstruction to teams of fifteen years ' date , no doubt . The loungers at the store got into a dispute about its probable weight ; bets were quickly made ; crowbars and a truck were brought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting , the rock was put upon a scale and weighed . The losers paid their bets , business at the saloons became brisk for a time , and the excitement promised to last the dull town for the rest of the summer . The country both sides of the Deer Lodge River is all good pasture land , save where gashed by the gold grubbers for a day 's journey west . Then the stream takes another name , and is called the Hell Gate , and runs for another fifty miles through a magnificent mountain gorge , the narrow valley and the // steep declivities being heavily timbered with the red fir and the Rocky Mountain pine ( Pinus Jonderosa ) . If the reader has seen the valley of the French Broad River in North Carolina , below Asheville , he will have a tolerably correct idea of the Hell Gate defile , save that the Montana forest has no hardwood trees , and the somber evergreen hue is only relieved , close to the stream , by the light tint of the pinking aspens . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel across the treeless country of Dakota and Eastern Montana . We passed a caravan of Mormons , who had come five hundred miles from Utah with wagons and wives to work on the railroad . We met bands of Flathead Indians bound for Camas Prairie to gather and dry the camas root : picturesque at a distance in their motley garb of blankets and skins , but dirty and ugly on near acquaintance . All were mounted , even to babies of three years old , who guided their ponies-by rope halters tied around the lower jaw-with as much skill as the old bucks and squaws . The squaws looked after the spare ponies , of which there was always a numerous drove , and the patient nags that trotted along , dragging the tepee poles , while the braves rode ahead , silent , disdainful , and in early June , to rest in the frontier village of Missoula , which thrives on the trade of the Bitter Root Valley-best of the farming valleys of West Montana-on the necessities and vices of a military post , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellers on the Jocko Indian Reservation twenty-five miles distant . Here the river takes a third name , and , after it receives the Bitter Root , is styled the Missoula , and runs with wide and hurrying current westward to join the Clark 's Fork of the Columbia .
