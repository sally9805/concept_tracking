Oi* extreme of bigotry , whether as manifested in the massacre of St. Bartholomew 's eve , or as in the action of the Parlement de Toulouse against the Calas family , is so cruel that it is universally condemned by civilized humanity ; the other extreme has been cuffed by Rabelais , Moli ? are , Tasso , Boilean , Swift , and the other satirists to such an extent as to make it needless to more than quote their names against it . The bigotry of the medical profession in America appears m no way related to either of these extremes ; it actuates men who officiate on boards of health , who work in hospitals , who preach in all their deeds the gospel of humanity ; they have dropped the robe and the doctor 's hat ; the cane and the black suit even have disappeared ; these " tatters and rags of superannuated syrnbols , ** after various modifications to suit the spirit of the age , have vanished . When the regular physician refuses to consult with an irregular for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the command of the medical society , which decides that such action is necessary to " establish distinctions in the public eye ' " between regularity and irregularity . What , then , are the principles of medical regularity ? Are they themselves beyond the comprehension of the public ? The principles of medical regularity are founded upon the relation of the physician to science . History shows that the culture of science has greatly improved the healing art , and experience has taught us the necessity of organizations for caring for this culture ; we have learned by experience that the more remote claims , of science are apt to be sacrificed to the selfish individual ends which the struggle for existence forces upon us all ; hence , as man has organized in society to protect // his higher interests from the dangers of individual selfishness , from barbarity , so the medical profession has formed , associations for the purpose of protecting itself and humanity from the injury which neglect of the claims of science surely causes . Taught by the same experience , we have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any dogma ; we have found that if the dogma were true , making it an object of special care or reverence takes it out of democratic relations with other truths , and so injures it at the same time that it injures us by influencing us to unduly neglect or favor other fruths . Here then are the simple principles upon which a claim to medical regularity is properly based , and in accordance with these principles , a regular physician is a member of an organization whose aim is the culture of science or truth as a whole . That these fundamental truths are not universally recognized is proved by a writer in a recent number of this review , who defines a regular physician as " a graduate of a regularly chartered medical college . " Many diploma factories . are regularly chartered , but the graduates of such institutions may have learned nothing of medicine . The same writer illustrates the influence which a dogma , true or false , may exert upon the relation of a physician to science . In speaking of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hahuemann believed , his followers believe , that the Almighty having given us medicinal substances , which , when taken into the system , produce in every instance each a distinct and separate action , he at the same time gave us a law for the application of those substances in the cure of disease . " Most botanists , geologists , and zoillogists teach us that God gave us animal and vegetable life in a very primitive condition ; that from this beginning he permitted life to evolve and specialize itself ; that in this process there was a most complex action and reaction between life and its environment , which has been going on for uncounted ages . Saying nothing as to the truth of this hypothesis , it is obvious that one can not be impartial in judging it if there exists in his mind an a priori belief in a God-given law of similars , for it is not possible to believe that the fauna and flora of successive geological ages have varied in every respect , in themselves and in their relation to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the law of simi.l&amp;rs. // But to return to the consideration of medical regularity . IL is obvious that professional organizations formed upon these principles have nothing to do with trade matters ; iu this relation the medical mau would be governed by the laws which rule all other traders . Medical organizations have no right to interfere with honest trade laws , nor with matters of individual opinion ; they can exact only such a loyalty as the State demands from Quakers and Jews . It is not good statesmanship to interfere with laws of trade , nor to foment bigotry by interfering with individual rights of opinion . We claim , then , that the physician has a right to trade where , when , and with whom he pleases , subject only to the laws of trade ; that in his relation to science he owes it allegiance as a whole . When this duty is confided to a regular medical organizatioui he should loyally support that body in performing it ; but if the organization , in violation of a compact with the public as expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved , neglects its proper functions or invades the individual rights of members , he should oppose it as earnestly as he should support it in doing its duty . isii us , instead of Our medical codes , as we shall see , furn these simple principles , a confused and meaningless system of laws embodying a certain amount of false sentiment , opinion , and tradition ; before we examine the code , however , let us consider briefly the chief cause of this condition of things . We have said that the principles underlying the relation of the physician to humanity are established by experience - we mean , of course , established as truths . It takes a long while , as every student of history is aware , to establish such principles as rules of action . Great principles , as plain as facts can be , have always been obliged to undergo long and bitter contests with organized tradition and opinion before being recognized as laws of action . This contest is just beginning in the medical profession in America-principles , the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , standing in direct opposition to the inheritance of traditions which we , with the other professions , have received from the clerics of the middle ages . The university has been the trustee of the educated guild with which we have shared the title of liberally educated men , and in support of which we have gained much of the habit of intellectual dishonesty that has influenced us in forming our codes . // It is a difficult position for the medical profession , this membership in the old intellectual aristocracy and this direct contact with modern science , as is seen by comparing the standards of liberalism of the systems of education peculiar to each . Fortunately for the purpose of this comparison we can quote an expert 's testimony as to the nature of the liberality of our ancient educational chivalry : " The English universities and the American colleges were also designed , from an early period , to educate gentlemen as well as scholars . But inasmuch as in the earlier , and , in that respect at least , bettor days , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legislator or magistrate , a diplomat or soldier , the same education was deemed suitable for all who aspired to what we have called a public position . These liberal studies were not thought unsuitable even for the duties and station of a merchant , especially of one who might be a prince among his fellow-merchants in generous tastes , wide information , courtly manners and refined accomplishments . " So much for the liberalism of the party headed by " Der kleine grosse Mann Hans Metaphysikus. ** Contrast this idea of liberalism with that naturally resulting from the teachings of the " new education . " Here there is no bigoted claim for any particular class of studies : all search for truth is recognized as liberalizing ; here there is no effort to define or to form an aristocracy of culture , for the new education recognizes the teaching of experience , and prizes the " liberalizing " effect of the struggle of life , including , as it does , efforts for home , country , and society . Not books nor schools alone , but work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness of his individual environment and teaches him to recognize the more generous aims of society , makes him liberal . All may be gentlemen by this code* which is not technical . It can treat privilege lightly , for it furnishes principles defining the rights of man and men , and points to experience , not tradition , as their source . The principles underlying our relation to the public , as we have stated them , are direct results of the same teachings of science ; the principles as stated by our codes are as directly the results of the traditions and opinions fostered by the university , and shared by us with the rest of the " liberal " gnild . Misled by these traditions , the medical profession in England and America regards the culture of science as a sort of university function , and not a practical , daily duty . The profession has // lost sight of the fact that the practitioner needs to be scientific in practice as the artist needs to be artistic in the same relation . Without this quality , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the artist who ceases to act according to the principles of art . Thus influenced , the medical profession here and in England has allowed a wide chasm to form between the practitioner and the scientific worker . This fact is well illustrated by the nature of much of our effort at reform in medical education ; for instance , the Johns Hopkins University agitated the subject of educating scientific professors for medical schools with the object of elevating the nature of professional work . It was chivalrous , this idea of renouncing its business and riding into the abyss ; but the days of miracles are past , and it is probable that she would merely have broken her neck . We must cut adrift from the system which has caused us so much damage , and adopt methods of instruction in accordance with the teachings of modern science ,  --  methods more like those which in Germany have gone a long way toward making the members of the profession a body of scientific workers , capable of producing scientific professors , and supplying them with scientific support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , having the improvement of teachers in view , or like that of Harvard , affecting pupils only , are of doubtful value . Members of the medical profession should realize the dangers of pleasant palliation , and the need of a scientific diagnosis as a preliminary to scientific treatment . The professional organism is diseased , and our bigotry is but one of the symptoms of the disorder . In studying it , we find it connected with a constitutional vice , made strongly evident by the divorce between practice and scientific work . This condition , on the other hand , exerts a most pernicious influence upon medical education ; it is a sort of vicious circle , where each individual symptom aggravates the others , and where all the conditions are to be met only by constitutional remedies . Thus purging our medical organizations of bigotry would naturally relieve them of the police duty which now occupies so much of their time and effort , and favor the performance of their proper function , the culture of science . A sound professional organism and a healthy professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of necessity , soon lead to the emancipation of the // profession from a wardship under the university , which , more than any one cause , has dwarfed the medical profession in America . In this connection it is well to remember that we have a form of government which , more than any other , represents the public . Now , the public can understand and appreciate action based upon fair principle ; it can not and will not understand nor support actions based on technicalities , and resulting in manifest injustice and inhumanity . These considerations may well make us doubt those who seem to think that our profession suffers from popular misapprehension and indifference ; we should remember that there is a charlatanry of savants* An illustration of the violation of the principles underlying the relations of the physician to the community is afforded by any one of our State medical codes , with the exception of that of New York ; the medical society of that State is the pioneer in the cause of medical liberalism . Most of the other States have adopted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains much the same matter , but stripped of the verbose platitudes that luxuriate in the national code . This , together with the fact that the profession in that State has for more than eighty years been under the direct control of men thoroughly imbued with academic liberalism , leads us to select it in proof of the general statements as to the causes and effects of medical bigotry which we have made . The Massachusetts code consists of ninety-nine lines , as *riuted by the society . These are divided into eight paragraphs , the first of which states in four lines the intention of the code . It is " intended to furnish certain principles and rules of action " for the " guidance and convenience " of the members of the Massachusetts Medical Society . The second paragraph , four lines , enters boldly upon the task , and defines the principles of our relation to science as follows : " A physician should lend his influence to encourage sound medical education , and to uphold in the community correct views of the powers and the limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no principle in this paragraph , excepting this , that a physician should mind his own business ,  --  a very good princi-. plc for an individual to act upon in personal matters , but a very poor principle for a trustee to act upon too literally . Now , the State has made us trustees in this relation to science , as our charter shows . Some physicians imagine that " to encourage // sound medical education " implies fulfilling our duties in relation to science ; but medical education is unsound in an unsound medical community , as the local respect for Harvard Medical School proves . The fact that the school is impoverishing itself by constructing a costly new school-building , while it is suffering from the want of funds to procure a fairly competent faculty , is a sign of itself that the soundness of its instruction is rather conventional than real . Others imagine that " to uphold in the community correct views of the powers and limitations of medical science and art " is fulfilling our duty in relation to science . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising soundly and honestly ,  --  a good thing , no doubt , but good for all traders as well as physicians . The principles underlying our duty to science obviously have many relations to the future of humanity . A scientific fact may be of no practical benefit , excepting to a future that can not reward the discoverer of to-day . Is not this our real claim to special consideration in the present ? But what relation have the " correct views in the community as to the powers and limitations of medical science and art " that is not essentially a relation of the present day ? Further , the correct views may be conventionally correct - correct only in the community iu question . But of the ninety-nine lines of the code these are the only ones devoted to our relation to science , excepting the preamble and fourteen lines devoted to the " relations of the physician to quackery . " The remaining portion of the code is devoted to our relation to trade , or , more correctly speaking , to minute regulations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not governed by conventionalities , but the statements of our relations to science contained in the code are so governed . jiave we then no relations to humanity excepting those trade relations which the code seems to squint at in stating our relations to science ? The next paragraph treats of the relation of the physician to medical business . Having found so much good trade matter in the former paragraph , we may find valuable statements of our relation to science here . The essence of our trade relations as stated by the code is as follows : " The relation of practitioners of medicine to families and households is not like that of tradesmen to their customers . The kind of competition which might be considered honorable in business can not exist between physicians without diminishing their usefulness and lowering the standing of the medical profession . " It seems like another instance of strabismus . Our // relation , " not like that of tradesmen , " reminds of that duty which medical organizations were instituted to care for , and which differs from ordinary trade duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the paragraphs perhaps were changed by wicked nurses ; but fair competition in science would not diminish our influence , it would not lower our standing , it would elevate it . No ; evidently the paragraph belongs to the title ; the trouble is caused by endeavoring to state our relation to business as no trade relation , as a relation of " sentiment " ; that is , so far as families and households are concerned . With single ladies and gentlemen having no relations , no faindies , no households , the physician has a right , according to the code , of dropping all sentiment . Prof. Huxley , in speaking of more important matters , said : " In a matter of this kind there is no advice better than that of Dr. Johnson , ' Above all things , sir , clear your mind of cant . ' And there is a good deal of cant about education , and I think a cant in respect to the medical profession is a notion vague and misty to the last degree-still powerful-that the medical profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more paragraph from the code and we are done with it ; it defines the " relations of the physician to quackery** ( relations to quackery , relation to science and bvsiness ) , and reads as follows : " In every community there are minds naturally inclined to quackery , which has flourished in every age . It grows by being noticed , and thrives best under opposition . It is commonly unwise to employ argument against it . But a physician should lend his influence to establish a distinct line between the regular practice of medicine and the practice of quackery , and should avoid any act which might tend to weaken such distinction either in the professional or in the public mind . " The exegesis of this paragraph commences : " Thus , he should not consult with an irregular practitioner ( see by*laws ) . ** We claim to have discovered in the code ignorance of our relation to science , confused sentimentalities concerning our relation to trades . A quality worse than either is shown in this hypocritical assumption that regularity is a virtue opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn between regularity and quackery which will not divide the regulars against themselves . We love regularity too well to enjoy seeing its would-be friends endeavor to support it by a false assumption . Is not quackery a personal quality , a vice to which all human nature is subject , and is not regularity // in this connection a technical quality that a pure and upright man may not possess , and still be fit to labor with the regular practitioner for the relief of humanity ? Does medical bigotry ever appear more ridiculous than , when stripped of its modern respectable exterior , it is seen as it really is , too ignorant to understand its own aims ? Professional training and culture do not enable us all to see this technical affair , regularity , in the same light , but the difference of opinion should not lead us to quarrel in a manner that does injury to that portion of the public which supports the views differing from our own . Such action would be paralleled by an attempt to punish every metaphysician , who does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we can not establish medical regularity without such means , we may conclude that it is no way worth establishing . But it is not the cause ; it is the men who support it by bad methods who are at fault . The code as it is does not owe its nature to the quality of medical regularity , but to the folly of certain " stalwart " regulars who have made it . But let us leave the code to the scavenger . It may be thought by some that our practice is better than our theory , that our by-laws are better than our code : we will glance briefly at a few proofs that this is not the case . Some of the by-laws relating to ethics and discipline are as follows : " Any fellow may be punished by censure , disfranchisement , or expulsion , or be deprived of his privileges on conviction by a board of trial , upon charges of the following description , made to the President of the society in writing , and signed by three or more fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the society . For the breach of any by-law of the society , for which censure , disfranchisement , expulsion , or deprivation of privileges is made the penalty . " For any conduct unbecoming and unworthy an honorable physician and fellow of this Society . " Any physician engaged in the practice of medicine or surgery in this commonwealth , who has not received such a medical education as is required by By-law I. , and any one guilty of practices forbidden to fellows ( I. ) shall be deemed an irregular practitioner , and it shall be disreputable and unbecoming ( VII. ) for any fellow to advise or consult with any such irregular practitioner , or in any way to abet or assist him as a practitioner of medicine or surgery . " The public may find it difficult to understand the import of these remarkable statutes . In the sixteenth century the first would have been understood as a warning against free thought and free speech upon certain technical questions . Does it mean // anything else to-day ? As for the second , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpedient in the present state of public opinion to connect too directly certain crimes as defined by our statute and the penalties which it is customary to visit upon those committing them . The nature of the conduct " unbecoming and unworthy an honorable physician and Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society " needs considerable explanation for lay apprehension . In one case that I am acquainted with , dining with an Eclectic Medical Society constituted such conduct ; in another case it was associating in business with a homeopath , although both parties particularly stipulated that there should be no compromise in medical opinions ; in a third case the expression of certain ideas by a physician , while acting as counsel for a fellow-member before the society s board of triaL Any of these offenses are liable , at present , to lead to expulsion from the society . Expulsion makes a man an irregular , and as such the fellows are forbidden to consult with him . In the act of expulsion his name is liable to be associated with those of members expelled for offenses criminal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been advertised to the public as dishonorable , and refused before the same public the privilege of meeting his acquaintances in consultation , of course the malice of the society has exhausted itself ; it can only hope that its tricks will succeed , that the end so directly sought will be realized . But we are all honorable men ; it was the stupid board of trial , the two or three bigots who preferred charges , the personal spite of the president or his toadies , that caused the resulting wrong ,  - -  all of which shows that poor human nature should not be tempted by such codes and by-laws . Fortunately the law , itself a creature of technicalities , can not interfere in the technicalities of a sister profession ; so the abuses will operate until we learn by experience to dread their influence , and to care for those solid principles upon which only a consistent and honorable course of action can be based . Already many members despise the society by-laws and the clique which manages to administer them . Though some members are conservalive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing down and rebuilding , and others are young and dread giving offense to the politicians who run the machine ,  --  for the politicians have influential positions in college , hospital , school , and community , and can injure in many ways a young man who makes himself obnoxious ,  --  though these and other obstacles oppose the march // of reform , progress is inevitable . In the meanwhile the absence of all scientific work characterizes our society , chartered solely to care for our higher interests , to protect the interests of science from the daily incroachments of our individual selfishness . Read the preamble to the charter which the State granted the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1781 . " As health is essentially necessary to the happiness of society , and as its preservation or recovery is closely connected with the knowledge of the animal economy , and of the properties and effects of medicines ; and as the benefit of medical institutions , formed on liberal principles , and encouraged by the patronage of the law , is universally acknowledged , the fellows and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politic and corporate , by the name of " The Massachusetts Medical Society . " Here are the principles stated by the men of 1781 ,  --  men who were accustomed to deal with principles ,  --  men of the time of Washington , Jefferson , and Franklin . In the hundred years that have passed since their day the people have grown greater and freer ; among them there has been a notable increase of intellect . nal freedom , a notable decrease of bigotry . Let any one compare the principles stated in the preamble of our charter , written in 1781 , with the rules and regulations of our code written in 1880 , and say if there has been anything like a parallel movement in our profession . Yet we , as members of the professional guild , have enjoyed a sort of monopoly of " liberalizing studies , " while the people , iliuminated only by a few great principles , have spent their time in 4aily works of peace and war . Verily , principles are better than traditions . Finally , if it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of this bigotry so evident in our codes and bylaws , that it is not the nature of the system of higher study which has dominated in America for the last century , but the lack of training and thorough education in general , we would not dispute the proposition very earnestly ; we merely affirm that the men who have formed our codes and by-laws , and managed our society , have been good university men , flue specimens of their class . We see the results ; as students of sociology we study into the causes . To us in this capacity , Fisher Ames and the writer of " The Failure of Universal Suffrage , " are types of the same dyspeptic , hysterical conservatism which has influenced the good and highly respectable individuals who have substituted the senseless rules of our code for the generous principles of our charter .
