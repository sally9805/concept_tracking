txt The House Committee on Commerce held a very interesting session to-day for the further consideration of the Reagan Inter-State Commerce bill . The speakers were Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , and President F. B. Gowen , of the Philadelphia and Reading Road . Mr. Adams made an argument in favor of the establishment of a Railroad Commission . The Commerce Committee should , in his- opinion , report an administrative measure , and not merely a declaratory one . He submitted a bill embodying his views . The one seminal principle of railroad investigation , he maintained , is the establishment of a commission , with a reliance upon public opinion in relation to the commission 's work . He assured the committee that if a commission were appointed ; and intrusted with the duty of investigating complaints and making reports of their investigations to the persons interested and to Congress , they would find the solution of the whole difficulty so easy and so satisfactory that they would wonder how they had ever thought of any other plan . He spoke not as a doctrinaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ad 10 years experience in the Railroad Commission of Massachusetts . He compared his feelings when first appointed with those which the Chairman , Mr. Reagan , must have had when he was made Postmaster-General of the Confederate States . " But , " said he , " I soonfoundthat I did not need a constable to back me. ? All the power I could use was the power to investigate , and then say , thou art the man . ' " Public opinion would do the rest . The result of the appointment of a commission in Massachusetts had been that there was now less complaint arising from the State 's railroad system than from any other part of the State 's industrial machinery . " You may say , " he continued , " that our experience with commissions has not been satisfactory ; but while Governments exist you must carry them on by men , and if you say that you do not dare to make a commission for fear that its members will be corrupt , if in 40 , - 000,000 of people you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I will say that our Government is near its end . You must use men , you cu n't get angels , for they are not in the market , and if you get men so strong that their reports will arouse public opinion , the railroad problem is solved . The solution of the problem will be accomplished by the mere existence of a commission strong enough to make its presence felt . " Mr. Adams showed how in England and in Massachusetts the establishment of commissions caused the roads to settle the difficulties themselves , so that the commissions had hardly nothing to do . The moment the commission 's power and presence were asserted the difficulties disappeared . Mr. Reagan remarked that the bill was executive as well as declaratory , and that it would be wise to supplement the bill by a commission . Mr. Adams then said he would estabish a commission , and at the same time declare a few elementary principles , but he would have the railroad legislation of the future built up from the results obtained by a consideration of concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles had been violated . Mr. Reagan said that the committee had been influenced in its work by concrete cases made subjects of complaint by individuals and trade organizations . Mr. Adams said that under a commission , the railroads themselves would remove these causes of complaint . He would like to see the legislative organization of the trunk lines legalized and a railroad clearing-house recognized by law , with a commission existing to represent the Government . The main point of his argument was that the investigations and reports of a commission would create a public opinion which would induce the roads to remove existing causes of complaint without compulsion . President Gowan said he represented a road which carried more tons of freight than any trunk line which depended upon local business and which had been injured by trunk lines . A. great deal of the existing trouble arose , he said , because trunk lines had taxed local traffic to enable them to carry through freight for almbst nothing . It was wrong to prohibit drawbacks which were openly announced , but secret drawbacks should not be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective use of its rolling stock , and in attaining this object the road might justly , in some cases , charge more for short hauls for retail trade than for long hauls in the interest of wholesale trade . A road might justly offer low rates to manufacturing firms on its line to enable them to secure , by low bids , great contracts given out by States or the National Goveinment. fpr in this way local business was built up and all parties benefited . Drawbacks ? applied exclusively to places to which goods are shipped  --  ought not to be prohibited , for the laws of competition require them ; - but great difficulty had arisen , not because of discrimination against places , but because of discrimination against individuals . " The roads , " said be " have carried cheaper for one man than for another over the same distances . Corruption has caused this great injustice . It is not special rates to places which have caused complaint , but special rates to men . Twenty million barrels of oil were produced last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which 11,000,000 went to foreign conatries . While the general rates of the trunk lines were $1 40 to New York , the Standard Oil Company was allowed to send over the same lines for 86 cents. - Other shippers could not compete with it under these circumstances , and it absorbed refinery after refinery , becoming a huge monopoly . Its opponents built a pipe line 104 miles long to meet the Reading Road . It was ready for use June 1 , and by it an outlet was provided by which they could escape the tyranny of the Standard Company and the trunk lines , for we Promised to give the same rates to all shippers . Four days later the trunk line representatives met and reduced their oil rates to 20 cents for the Standard Company , and 30 cents for others . A further reduction was afterward made to 15 cents , and 5 cents of this was paid for the Standard Company 's cars . " Mr. Gowen showed that this rate was much less than the cost of transportation . Such discrimination injured the stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other traffic .
