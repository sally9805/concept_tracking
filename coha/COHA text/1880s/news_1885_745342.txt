The next day Miss Saith , the Captain of the army , informed the Burgos. ; that this was a free country , and that man could worship God according to the dictates of his conscience and as he thouulit best ; that the Salvation Army was a religious body , striving to save the souls of men , and that if its ! tatters thought the attention of the sinner could be attracted by their marching and playing the tambourine on Sunday they were going to do it , the Burgess and the Town Council to the contrary notwithstanding . The Burgess told Miss Saith that he thought there would be trouble if she attempted to parade on Sunday , but she replied that she dio n't care what happened  --  she was going to parades . When the fact became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parade a conflict between the Salvationists and the authorities was predicted , as Chief of Police Lewis gave it out that he would arrest them all if they attempted:to violate the Town Council 's order .

About 10 o'clock the army , under the leadership of Miss Saab , came out of their quarters and formed in marching older in the main street .
