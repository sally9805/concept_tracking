txt The Western distillers will doubtless succeed to-morrow in organizing , at Chicago , the Western Export Association , that expired by limitation on the 1st of last May . Since that date there have been several attempts made to revivify the organization . They came to naught , however , owing to the fact that one house  --  Monarch , of Peoria ? refused to go into the pool . Now all differences are happily settled . This afternoon a meeting was held in the Chamber of Commerce . There were present representatives of all the local distilling firms and distilleries whose goods come to this market . Mr. II . B. Miller , that encyclopedia of Information regarding the liquor interest , from Riverton , III. , was there , and it was his master hand that did the lion 's share or the arrangement of details . Ho came with the positive promise of all the Peoria houses to go Into the pool . The old system of the Western Export Association to regulate the whisky market was to have all the distilleries run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to pay so much per bushel on every bushel mashed over half capacity , and the excess of production was sent out of the country in the shape of export alcohol . The system arranged this afternoon is simpler . Every house in the pool is to run no more than 40 per cent . capacity , and If this is not sufficient to keep the price at a satisfactory figure , a further cut of 10 per cent , will be made . The complex  --  system of assessments has been abandoned , us it is plain to the distillers that the desired decrease in production can easily be obtained , and fair prices will naturally result . The business of to-day 's meeting was only preliminary and superficial , as the matters discussed will be settled at the Chicago meeting , beginning to-morrow . There is no doubt , however , that the plans proposed to-day will be unanimously adopted , and the Western Export Association will he born again . The intention is to keep the market price of whisky at about SI 18 per gallon while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distillers can make a little money , but not much .
