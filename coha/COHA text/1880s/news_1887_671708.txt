txt Some days ago it was discovered that the Missouri Pacific Railroad had been for some time paying for its ties ten cents each more than the market price . It has not yet clearly appeared how many ties had . been bought at this rate . The first reports were probably exaggerated . But at all events enough money had been acquired by persons engaged in the management of the road , at the expense of its stockholders , to cause removals and changes to be made ; clan the exposure was effected . Now , if we are to believe the reports of a St. Louis paper , another swindle of considerable extent has been perpetrated upon the stockholders of the same road by the sale of passes . The passes were issued for the use of men employed by the road , and supposed to be traveling in its service . They were sold to whoever chose to buy them at rates less than the regular fare , but nevertheless highly remunerative to the sellers , who had paid . nothing for them . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprive the official at the head of the road of any chance of future employment if he were a " railroad man " employed on a salary . As everybody knows , the person in control of the Missouri Pacific is not a railroad man , but a stock jobber , and has been making ducks and drakes of his own property , if that term can be applied to a man who began life with nothing , and is neither known nor believed to have earned any money since . He is known to have acquired a great deal of money , and he is believed to have acquired much of it by means which indicate either defects in the law or neglect of duty on the part of the officers appointed to enforce the same . The truth is that he has never shown the slightest capacity as a railway manager or any marked interest in the proper work of a railway manager . Whoever builds a new road or buys an old one , and by enlarging its income and cutting down its expenses makes it profitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholders , but to the public . He must necessarily be a man of ability , and the more extensive and complicated the enterprise the greater the ability he is forced to display in order to manage it successfully . The stock jobber 's methods of making money have nothing at all in common with those of such a man . The stock jobber im- mediately in question has been at-the head of a number of railroads ; which resemble each other in having been " gutted . " when he had . done with them . Managing ? a railroad . is one thing and rigging the stock- market is ? another . For the latter all ' that is necessary is to induce a belief that securities which are , in fact , about to rise are about to fall , and vice versa , and the advantage that a stock jobber at the head . of an enterprise has over a stockjobber outside of it is that he can alter what would be the natural course of the enterprise , so that the most careful and best informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a gambler playing with dice that he has loaded or cards that he has packed . Plain people would . be more apt to describe this process of money getting as lying in order to steal . We need not quarrel with this definition . The point is that a man who is engaged in this occupation has no time or talents available for managing railroads , and . as little taste as aptitude in that direction . Making money by earning and . saving it , for one 's self or for others , is hard and slow work . But making money by taking it away from those who have it without giving them any equivalent may be a ; speedy and exciting operation . It is not always safe , and it requires some ability to distinguish those forms of it which are prudent from those which are hazardous , though this ability may be possessed rather by the eminent jurists who counsel the stock jobber than by the stock jobber himself . But whatever ability may be involved in larceny , either petty or grand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not the ability that successfully directs productive enterprises . This is a distinction that seems to be extensively lost sight of . A man who has got together a million dollars , and is still at large , is commonly spoken of as a man of business ability , and the estimate of his ability increases as the square of his millions . It is necessary that he should keep out of jail in orderr , to command continued admiration for his intellect . Men who two years ago were filled with envious respect for the shrewdness of JAKE SHARP now venture to describe him as an old fool. , When a man of his kind is at the head of an enterprise it is natural and inevitable that his subordinates should be affected by his example and should be brought to believe that the way to make money is not to ? earn it but to procure it by trick and device . Petty larceny may be expected . to flourish in all the departments of a business founded . upon grand-larceny , and to be taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
