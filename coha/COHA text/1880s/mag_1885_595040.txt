INNS OLD AND NEW . I WELL remember my first stay in an old English inn : the little dining-room , simple but not mean , its low , dingy ceiling , with the natural grain of its wood coming out through the filmy paint ; the fare substantial and wholesome , served by a little miss who seemed steward , waiter , and clerk all in one ; the prints on the walls depicting hunting scenes in the style of some remote pre-chromo age , with foxes in improbable yellow panting in the vain endeavor to elude hounds in impossible brown ; the little windows of small VOL . XXX. - 62. seamy panes looking forth on the village street , where all was quiet save when a squire 's gig or a farmer 's wagon for a moment rolled by . Inns such as that dusky little inn at Stratfordon-Avon used to be common in England . A few still linger in such favored hamlets as have escaped the grime of mining and the din of whirring wheels and steam-whistles . George Stephenson was the magician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world , and gave us in its stead the great modern hotel . Its existence was not warranted until the locomotive , making travel quick and cheap , provided the large number of travelers necessary to fill great hotels . Before railway days the highways , like the narrow way of wisdom , showed here and there a traveler , and for these the inn was ample enough . Here the wayfarer could , if he wished , form pleasant acquaintance with his host and fellow-sojourners . They could even form friendships , a thing which sounds strangely to our modern ears , accustomed as we are to be merged among hundreds of guests in a vast caravanserai , with its strange contrasts of gregariousness and solitude ; scarcely aware , perhaps , of the proprietor 's name , and often admiring the smooth mechanism of a service which moves with automatic certainty and promptness without overheard command . In olden times the magnates of counties , the judge on circuit , the town solicitor or conveyancer , used to receive a homage at his inn which has become one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local celebrity now goes to an enormous hotel and finds himself reduced to a numeral among numerals : " 339 goes south at 6. io " ; " 512 wants the Boston directory . " English lords come to America and are mistered . Dukes receive scarcely more attention than commercial travelers . Sentiment may sigh at the abolition of inns and their jovial Bonifaces , but picturesqueness and individuality in these things at least are doomed . Factory principles must now be applied in the lodging , sustenance , and attendance bestowed on the vast streams of travelers which the locomotive , the steamship , and the steamboat have called forth . In Great Britain the inn stood on the highroad , where the stage-coach could easily stop . Hence we find in that country the new great hotels near the railway stations . John Bull sensibly holds that if steam-carriage is economical it should be made available to the ful // lest extent possible . He therefore brings his rails into the heart of a city , and on the spot , or over against it , builds him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , is beside the Exchange ; and in that town , in Glasgow , York , Sheffield , Liverpool , and London , the best hotels are at the railway statiGns . The architects of these buildings contrive to render them free from the noise of trains ; and as British railroads are operated without the whistling and bell-ringing so common in America , one can enjoy some peace and quietness in a British railroad hotel . AMERICAN HOTELS. - CONSTRUCTION . HOTELS in America are the best and most splendid in the world . The existence of an immense traveling population willing to pay the tariff of good houses , the cheap land available in many cities , the prevalent love of display , and the exigencies of an extreme and variable climate , have all contributed to this result . Hotel-designing has become a profession apart , and several eminent architects do very little other professional work . This branch of design demands , besides special knowledge growing out of the wants of hotel management , increased care in every direction wherein the good planner of residences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel exceed those of a dwelling , so do the penalties of its bad design and workmanship entail more grievous results . Hotel architecture has its special difficulties . In large cities land is very costly , so story must be speedily added to story , that much room may be provided , and the investment begin to pay a return at the earliest possible date . Hence the risk in case the land is made land , or the foundation rests upon anything but rock , that the lofty structure may settle unequally , with momentous derangement and loss . A hotel contains a labyrinth of flues , pipes , and wires , any break in which may be deadly to hapless guests and servants . Besides , the cracks and crannies of a huge building settling down invite rats and mice , pests impossible to banish when once in possession . Therefore , after securing a good position for a hotel , the principal thing is to have a thoroughly solid foundation . Next , the basement should be well cemented , and all the courses of the drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated and frequent examination . Modern hotels of the best type have solid brick partition walls from ground to roof , dividing room from room . The walls conduce to safety in case of fire , and , with well-deafened floors , help the im portant cause of quiet . Whoever would see the American hotel , as far as architecture goes , in its utmost development , must cross the continent and visit the Palace at San Francisco . That vast house is built on the continental plan of having a large interior court accessible by carriages . This court is covered with glass , decorated with plants , and enlivened with music . To provide against the risk of earthquake , the structure is a thing of massive iron bolts and bands . Comparative cheapness of land has enabled the architect to make every room spacious , and each has bath , closet , and dressing-room attached . Every external room has a bay-window . Pneumatic tubes connect each floor with the office , for the rapid dispatch of letters and parcels . Yet , with all the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Palace , too , proves to have overpassed in dimensions the limits within which a sense of comfort is possible . Many travelers prefer houses less large , where the obliteration of the individual is less oppressive . FIRE . THE risk of fire has engaged the attention of hotel architects very seriously of late years . In truth , many leading houses throughout America , built twenty or thirty years ago , are mere fire-traps . It is better here to expend capital liberally at the first in every possible provision against disaster than to depend on makeshift appliances which , when emergency arises , demand discipline , intelligence , and abundant means of safety ready to hand . An excellent and common plan for safety is to drill the porters and hallmen regularly as a fire company . Thus , when flames have to be fought , the work is done by disciplined men . All the corridors of new hotels are commanded by hose attached to water-pipes on each floor . This safeguard , when steam is kept up day and night , is the most efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels , is to make the local fire department thoroughly acquainted with.the building . When a hotel is built with unity and clearness of design , much is done to render it safr from fire . With corridors broad and long , so that all or a large part of each floor can be commanded by a watchman , a fire is unlikely to remain long undetected . The marking out of staircases by red lights is an important aid , too , in case of fire . In construction , the use of brick arches for ceilings , and the division of the wings of a building by wooden doors brightly tinned , are // frequently employed to insure safety . Still , with staircases and elevator-shafts , which must remain open , with finishings and furniture of wood , and , beyond all , the risk of deficient water supply and of panic , I see much wisdom in the choice of travelers who seek rooms near the ground . Simplicity of design , I may incidentally say , also reduces the liability to theft and other breaches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern city , one was built thirty years ago , and enlarged from time to time by annexation of adjoining houses ; its corridors are short , tortuous , and on varying levels . The other is new , and was built all at once , on modern principles ; its corridors are extensive and ample . Both hotels are , of course , liable to theft and other offenses ; the new house , however , although much the larger , has much less trouble from this source than the other . Guests at a large hotel unintentionally form an effective police force . Their presence has an effect like that of the passersby in a street , when a gas-light is the sole defense of premises stored with valuable goods . PLUMBING . As TO plumbing , that subject so full of woful interest in this age of diphtheria . Experience has proved that baths and water-closets can be attached to bedrooms withov*t injury . The conditions are careful workmanship on good methods and frequent examination . An immense quantity of water is used in a hotel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary houses . Physicians tell us that the germs of typhoid and diphtheria may enter the system in food and drink . Therefore , the great distance between sinks or closets and the places where the meals are prepared and served , may explain why hotels enjoy an immunity from the diseases mentioned which is denied to good residences . Water supply is an important point just here , and in lofty city hotels it is well to connect each floor separately with the street main . Thus , taps in the uppermost floor have none below them in unduly favorable competition for supply . All well-designed hotels have gas , watbr , and waste pipes so arranged that throughout their whole course they are easy of access . The same channels may contain speaking-tubes and electric wires . Along the margins of the corridors of the newest houses there may be observed continuous hoard-strips uncarpeted ; these cover troughs holding pipes and Wires . From floor to floor , upright shafts serve the same purpose . When 579 a leak or break occurs , section after section is opened until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair is discovered . These permanent ways should always be ample in size , that additional pipes or wires may easily be laid . The electric light as introduced requires its special cables , and if gas comes to be used as fuel , it will demand its special series of pipes . wARMING . GAS , as burnt in pretty grates of incandescent asbestos , introduced by the gas-companies , does away with the nuisance of coalashes , and , except in extremely cold weather , should serve even in the most northern latitudes . The late Doctor Siemens proposed abolishing London fogs by the use of gaseous fuel prepared as illuminating gas is now at large special works . Recent improvements in the production of this so-called water-gas may lead to its introduction as fuel in our hotels . Warming a large hotel in the Northern States or Canada is a difficult matter . It may have say six or seven floors , and since the inexorable tendency of heated air is to rise , it is practically impossible to keep the ground-floor comfortable in winter without overheating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircases by partitions provided with doors . This plan , however , is too inelegant ever to be popular . In a hotel of six stories , heated by hot air , the ducts do not usually go above the fourth floor , the fifth and sixth being warmed by convection alone . If the building is loftier , the same proportions are observed . In some of the smaller cities of the Union , an altitude of hotel-building has been perpetrated which only metropolitan land-values can excuse . The risks in case of fire , the darkness of inner rooms , the difficulty of maintaining an even temperature in winter , all decide in favor of a moderate height for hotels . Of the various methods of warming a hotel , experience has shown that direct radiation from steam-pipes is best . Hot water can not very well be introduced into a large building , and hot air supplied from furnaces or from steam-pipes in a basement is not easily regulated , has an unwholesome dryness , and frequently betrays its origin in a disagreeable way . Stale tobaccosmoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor . Every room in modern hotels has its fire-place . No other means of heating affords people the satisfaction derived from an open grate . Economically considered , fireplaces are very commonly badly designed and placed . Sometimes we find them built against an outer instead of a partition wall , // as if their mission were to heat the external atmosphere . Their perversion of fuel is exaggerated when they are constructed immediately under their chimneys , yielding the least possible warming effect in a room . In an improved form they come somewhat out from the wall ; thus increased efficiency is attained without sacrifice of the charm all find in glowing coals . Since all the chimney-flues of a hotel except those from the working department are used only in cold weather , it appears to me that they should be built wholly or in part of some other material than non-conducting brick . Metallic flues of suitable design and decoration might usefully conduct a noteworthy quantity of heat now wasted into rooms and corridors . economizer of fuel in our long winters , and a sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable in admitting fresh air to crowded ball-rooms and banquet-halls . While gas is with us , I wonder some enterprising manufacturer of fixtures does not devise ornamental hoods and tubing to lead away the hot air from the flame , laden as it is with carbon dioxide and other deleterious substances . In two New York hotels the plan is adopted in some measure , and the results are most satisfactory . The most complete example of the kind within my knowledge is the new Infirmary in Edinburgh , where every gas-flame , like every coal-flame , is provided with its chimney . SECURING QUIET . VENTILATION . THE open fire-place conduces somewhat to ventilation , but in a less degree than is commonly imagined . Above the level of the top of the grate the vitiated air is comparatively warm and light ; there it is apt to remain injuriously pocketed . To exchange it for pure air , either a window must be opened , which leads to unpleasant draughts , or under the best methods special ventilation flues near the ceiling and floor are provided to exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im*portant than plumbing ; in fact , good systems of both require to be planned together . I have seen gorgeous moquette carpets , splendid mythological frescoes , and furniture of the most elaborate kind , through an atmosphere laden with odors from boiling vegetables . Worse than these odors are the subtle germs of disease which disjoined waste-pipes and untrapped drains may scatter through air breathed by people unwarned of danger by any appeal to their olfactories . The best means of ventilation is that which brings tainted air through ducts directly into a furnace fire . So-called natural draughts are untrustworthy , and , in our North American climate , come down very often when they ought to go up . The pull of a strong fire , with a lofty chimney , may be relied upon at all times . To neutralize poison is much better than to dilute it . Should a hotel be too large for this plan to be feasible , ventilation by steam-power employed to drive fans is the next best resource . The principal need for ventilation in a hotel arises from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more reason than hotel-keepers to rejoice in such cheapening of the electric light as might make it generally available . It would be a great ONE of the inevitable annoyances of a hotel is noise , and I do not think that the war against it has been waged seriously enough . The liberal use of rubber on staircases , landings , chair-legs , and truck-wheels has done much , and thickly padded carpets have done yet more , to quell the noise attending late arrivals and early departures . Still the nervous man hears noises that have no excuse for being , and that might be avoided by further improvement . First of all , why not make the doors leading from a corridor to a room much less pervious to sound than at present ? This might be done by placing in a thick , hollow door some light deadening material , such as batting or saw-dust . Or a pair of doors could be substituted for a single one . This method 15 now adopted in our recently built hotels , in the room having a compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a second one , hinged to the wall of the compartment . This serves two good ends , that of quiet and that of doubly secluding the conveniences ; the compartment having a door of its own at right angles to the other two , and opening into the spacebetween them . Pairs of doors are now commonly employed also between the rooms forming a suite . It has appeared to me for some years that an improved method of communicating between the rooms and office of a hotel is feasible , which would besines other advantages help the cause of quiet . By the ordinary system , when it is uncertain whether a guest is in his room or not , a servant must be sent to inquire . Or ig say , No. 419 wishes to know when the trains leave for Albany , the servant must first answer the electric bell , and repeat the long journey to the room , bearing the information desired . In very large hotels , such as the Palace in San Francisco , or the Grand Pacific in Chicago , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attendant . In his care are the things most commonly wanted - stationery , iced water , directories , and time-tables . A speaking-tube connects each local attendant with the office . Instead of the systems now in use , I propose the introduction of a telephone in every room , connected with a special department in the office . The telephones need not be so elaborate and costly as those required for long city circuits . If attached to flexible wires , a sick or lazy user might speak through one of them in bed . A guest , without leaving his room or causing the special clerk to move from his office , might have his questions answered with as perfect economy of time as though the two stood face to face . The electric service might well include a small bell fixed , say , at the head of the bedstead , to give a guest notice that the office wished to speak to him . Its use would also serve to call him up for an early train . In this way none but the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a very large proportion of messages could pass through the wire instead of , as now , requiring a slow , noisy , and somewhat uncertain human vehicle , who gossips and wears out carpets . From notes taken of the various calls to which a hall-man responded in the course of a day , I estimate the saving of time by the use of this system to be nearly twenty per cent . Surely , with the creating of so large * field as that here indicated for the telephone , not qnly in hotels , but in other large buildings , those who own it might easily be induced to abate their terms of royalty . The nearest existing approach to the system proposed is that of the speaking-tubes , known as the oral annunciator . Its limitations , however , as to carrying distance , prevent its use in large hotels . It is cumbrous , and more liable to get out of order than a series of wires laid with a little slack , so as to yield in case the containing building settles down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public rooms of hotels very noisy . Electricity might lend itself here to an improvement , by lighting an incandescent lamp . A luminous beam would call clerk , hall-man , or porter on the watch for its appearance , quite as effectively as the alarm-bell , which is heard by so many for whom it has no message . WORK-ROOMS . THE working department of a hotel comprises boiler-room , engine-room , butcher 's shop , store-room , kitchen , wine-room , laundry , and workshops . All but kitchen and laundry must be in the basement , except , perhaps , the store-room . The kitchen and laundry should either be in a separate building with extraordinary means of ventilation or in the attic . It is always washing-day in a hotel , and heated air from wash-tubs and ranges ascends , and bears with it offense and injury . In modern hotel kitchens and laundries , mechanical appliances greatly reduce drudgery . Vegetables and fruit are peeled and grated , peas and corn shelled , cherries pitted , eggs whisked , meat chopped , roasts turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful engines furnish electric light , and are used to manufacture ice for the table and to chill brine for circulation through refrigerators . In the laundries all washing but that of fine linen-wear is effected by machinery with the aid of soap made from kitchen grease . Powerful centrifugal and rubber wringers press out moisture , and mangling is performed by cylinders heated with steam , so that linen is dried and ironed at one operation . A drying-room for such articles as are not mangled is superheated by exhaust steam from the engine ; in this room work is done in a tithe the time required with outdoor exposure . Shirt-fronts , collars , and cuffs are glossed under a mechanical pressure much more severe than the most muscular Bridget could exert . All large hotels are now provided with their own workshops for prompt execution of repairs and systematic renovation . Keys can be replaced , panes of glass inserted , leaks of gas and water stopped without the delay necessary in sending to a tradesman 's shop . Upholsterers are constantly engaged in the renewals of carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovate , say , an entire floor , with carpets , curtains , and lambrequins . Painters at every opportunity are busy keeping walls , ceilings , and wood-work bright and fresh . Their work is now chiefly done in oilcolors , more wholesome and lasting than kalsomine . The shop staW as it is called , commonly includes engineers , plumbers , gas and steam fitters , upholsterers , silversmiths , and an electrician , all being under the direct control of the proprietor . APPOINTMENTS . As TO the furniture and decorations of hotels , great improvement has been made of late years . Time was when gaudiness reigned in hotel-parlors , and bareness made the rooms forbidding . This is fast passing away , and travelers of the best class now find pretty commonly at the best hotels such appointments and decorations as surround them at home . The most enterprising proprietors now place // good pictures and well-selected bric- ? z-brac in their parlors . These , with pleasant writingdesks , what-nots , and book-stands , are finding their way into the newly built houses . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managers do well to consult their taste when contracting for carpets , curtains , and upholstery . The opinion of a tradesman , even when he is competent , is apt to be unduly influenced by gainful considerations . To maintain the uniformity of a carpet laid on a particular corridor , it is usual to keep an extra piece on hand for repairs . So also when a parlor or reception-room is fitted up ex*pensively in , say , the style of Louis XV. , with everything to match , it is customary to keep the future necessity for renewals in view ; for gasglobes are very liable to spontaneous fracture . ink will be unaccountably spilled , curtains singed , and other such accidents happen to destroy the completeness of appointments . MANAGEMENT . LET us suppose a hotel well placed , well built , and well furnished . We have scanned its walls for evidences of settlement and found none , or the effects have been rectified . We have poured peppermint abundantly down drain-pipes , sniffed at all the connections , and found neither break nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rats , and heard none . We have boiled onions in the kitchen , made soap in the laundry , and , with intervening doors wide open , have found only pure air upstairs . We have sounded the fire-alarm and brought a hose and ladder to the door in satisfactorily few seconds . We have overladen the elevators , worked them swiftly , and found them unaffected by the strain . We have adopted every means of safety and comfort known for the protection and enjoyment of the traveler . Next comes the question of management . The proprietor of a hotel should , first of all , be a gentleman , for many of his guests will be gentlemen , and he must manage his house to meet their approval . For all that the immensity of modern hotels has put landlord and guest asunder in comparison with old inn-keeping days , the popularity of a landlord continues to be a fact , and a pretty valuable fact . A stated circle of customers appreciate his welcome as they arrive at his house travel-worn and weary . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitations , or give information as to the credit and standing of local people in commercial and professional life . At times angry disputes will be referred to him , and he must settle them with judgment and suavity . A landlord should not only be a gentleman , but also a good man of business . The chief end of a hotel is to pay , and he should never lose sight of that . He has to meet heavy fixed charges , and control large expenditures . He must thoroughly understand his business in all its branches , and know how to observe and check dishonesty , waste , and extravagance . He has to select and supervise servants , and direct the purchase of all supplies , including the new machinery and devices constantly brought out with the alleged intention of saving his money . He should know the art of entertainment and the science whereby his business can beincreased through the holding of conventions , the extension of excursion facilities , and the like . Whether his house is in the city , or by the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spout up for the healing of the nations , he should know how to put his guests in the way of enjoying the things of use , beauty , or interest whith have attracted them to his door . He should be a good man in emergencies ; know exactly what to do , and do it , when fires break out , thefts and outrages on propnety are com- - mitted , or any one under his roof develops insanity or infectious disease . Men who combine all these good points of character , ability , and manner are exceedingly rare ,  --  not as rare , perhaps , as good poets , but about as rare as very good public speakers . STAFF . IN the organization of his service , the hotelproprietor recognizes only his staff of superintendents . These are the head clerk , steward , head waiter , housekeeper , chef , head porter , and head laundress . Each of these officials engages his or her subordinates , and is responsible for their efficiency and good conduct . These superintendents need to have good points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond , the good landlord , they are rare enough to command veryliberal salaries . Some people who keep house economically marvel at the cost of living at hotels , losing sight , among other considerations , of the price of efficient supervision , a service which their families receive gratuitously . In large hotels the proportion of salaries to wages is about one to four . The explanation of the cost of hotelkeeping consists , too , in the waste inevitable when a very large number of servants are employed in a vast building , where the close , personal , interested oversight of a private house is impossible . Again , I think it will be admitted that the fare at good hotels is more various and expensive than that at good // homes . In the fluctuating character ot the business , and in the inordinate variety and quantity supplied at table , must also be found the reason why four to five dollars per day is usually charged by American hotels , in the presence frequently of active competition . When a residence is bought or leased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its occupants . A hotel , however , may not , on an average , be more than half full the year round . A fraction much smaller than one-half represents the occupancy of hotels at summer or winter resorts . Even well-placed houses in great cities have their dull season of from two to four months , during which receipts do not meet expenses . The modern method of numbering hotelrooms has been well devised . Thus , in new houses , No. 346 is over 246 , and under 446 . All three rooms are alike in size and outlook . The number of the floor is told in the first number of the room : 246 is on the second floor , 346 on the third . As in numbering the houses in streets , 245 is opposite 246 , and so on . A new servant thus is soon able to find a particular room , and a guest is much less likely to lose his way than if the strictly consecutive plan of numbering were in use as of old . The new system lends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are becoming more and more popular every year . When a large excursion party arrives at one of our new hotels , the members of it go directly to their rooms as fast as the elevators can take them . Each is provided beforehand with a card stating the number of his or her room ; the first figure denotes the floor , and a hall-man , stationed at each landing , points each comer to the room sought , which is found with its door open . The register and other books are written up in advance from lists mailed to the manager . In every hoteloffice the room-clerk has spread out before him a diagram of the rooms , all duly numbered , with particulars of their size , their conveniences , and the doors which may connect them together as suites . THE TABLE . WHEN I have seen the lengthy bill of fare so commonly furnished at large American hotels and thought of the waste entailed , I have often believed that a reformer might succeed , by establishing , say in New York , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small , good variety that one finds at the smaller London hotels of the best class - a variety well cooked and served , through the cooks ' attention not being dissipated among a multitude of dishes . At two restaurants in New York , on Broadway and Fifth Avenue respectively , one gets an excellent table d'hdte dinner of this kind at the reasonable charge of one dollar and twenty-five cents , which includes a pint of yin ordinaire . The best hotels , it gives me pleasure to state , are fast moving in the direction of simplicity of bill of fare . In New York the leading house on the American plan does not provide its table with much more than one-half the variety of dishes one may have offered at second-rate , pretentious concerns throughout the country . The dietary , too , in America is unquestionably improving . Fruit and vegetables are consumed much more plentifully than before quick trains transported them cheaply and canning ecame a prodigious business . Baked joints and fowl , so often parboiled and sodden , are giving place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gridiron , thank goodness , has well-nigh driven the frying-pan out of the kitchen , and wholesome broiled steaks and chops have taken the place of the hard , greasy meats that spoiled so many digestions in the past . Pie , too , is going , and its exodus has had much to do with the genesis of fat . But hot bread and cakes still hold their own , and the baleful ice-pitcher remains , active for stomachic mischief . Porridge , however , is more easily had at a hotel in New York than in Edinboro ' , and , with cracked wheat , has gone abroad throughout the Union , crossed the Rockies , and visited the Pacific slope , doing good all the way . Salt fish , salt meat , and pork are now little used . Fresh fish and oysters are consumed very largely , and , exchanged for the game of distant backwoods and prairies , are carried from lake and sea to the most interior cities and towns of the continent - another blessing due to the rugged old Englishman who first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ! Under the influence of improved diets and the custom of taking a vacation during the heated term , we are glad to learn from statisticians that the physique of our people is improving , and that they are living longer than their predecessors did . Adipose is being deposited on lanky forms , and although Brother Jonathan can scarcely yet be depicted as a plump person , he bids fair to become such if he keeps on adopting common-sense measures in food and rest . LARDER AND KITCHEN . HAVING frequently wondered at the unvarying excellence of the beef at the leading hotels of New York , I* made it my business one day recently to call on the butcher who // supplies the principal houses . He makes two very different kinds of contracts supplement one another nicely . His customers are hotelkeepers and prison-superintendents . Thus the difficulty is overcome which , in the restricted market of a small city , prevents a butcher from supplying a hotel with as many choice cuts as it wants . He may not be able to find sale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by cultivating the trade of the criminal classes , is enabled to cater satisfactorily to the best travel in the country . The sleek millionaire at the Astor and the haggard burglar wearing out his days at Blackwell 's Island both dine off the same ox ,  --  different portions of it , however , for the con*tract prices are in the one case twentyeight cents and in the other eight to twelve cents per pound . In the daily practical working of a hotel , the main point is the seeing that all supplies , from the time they are received until consumed , are properly accounted for . The routine of the commissariat is something like this : The larder being duly stocked , the chef is told how many guests there are for breakfast . Experience teaches about at what hours they will come into the diningroom , and just about what proportions of fish , steak , chops , omelettes , etc. , will be asked for . These , in the case of a large business , are prepared a little in advance of demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Other meals are arranged for in the same way . At dinner , when the range of time for service exceeds an hour , it is usual to go on preparing the dishes as the repast is in progress . When the first joints are served up , a second batch is being cooked , and so on . To secure the best results with asparagus , spinach , and such like vegetables , it is usual to keep on boiling fresh supplies every few minutes . Good hotel-caterers provide for the extra demand when salmon , spring lamb , or strawberries first appear , and never permit " All out , sir , " to be said at their tables . THE EUROPEAN PLAN . THE cuisine of few hotels conducted on the American plan with the table d'hl*te is as good as that of the best restaurant-hotels managed on what is called the European system . In some of the best of the hotels of this sort , such as the Brunswick , in New York , and Young 's in Boston , every dish is cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ordering , as the American plan can not . Its influence in legitimately curtailing an order is as decided as that of size on courage . It is usual at restaurant-hot*ls to serve larger quan tities of each dish than at hotels on the American plan , so that , should Benjamin travel with his wife , and put up at Parker 's or the Buckingham , his double portion may suffice the twain , and his bill may be even less than if he went to the Vend6me or the Fifth Avenue . The most lucrative hotels in America , however , continue to be those having the fixed daily charge which can be popularly paid . Some large houses , like the Palmer in Chicago and the Murray Hill in New York , combine both plans , and find the American preferred . Since the guests of restauranthotels do not take all or perhaps any of their meals at their hotels , these houses often become dependent on chance custom for a measure of their support , a kind of patronage having its vicissitudes . Wet , stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred to four hundred dollars per day . Very costly has been the purchase of the reputations of the best of these concerns . The Brevoort attained its enviable name , among other excellences , by its coffee , which , at great expense , was made freshly every ten minutes during the hours of business . WHERE THE MONEY GOES . AN analysis of the cost of conducting a hotel on the American plan may be of interest . The house whose figures are given will fairly serve as a type of its class , and the expenses are given in ratios for 1883 . Interest on the capital invested in land , buildings , and furniture ; the assessments and taxes ; heating , light , salaries , and wages for the least busy season of the year , together make up a fixed daily charge . Adding to this the cost of provisions , the total expense of the hotel divided by the least number of guests at any time of the year within it is a figure we agree to call one . During the busiest month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying more servants , and expending more for fuel and light . Compared with the dullest month , the average guest then costs fifty-eight hundredths as much . We will now easily understand a point already *referred to , namely , the great disadvantage in hotel-keeping when the average number of guests falls much below the capacity of a house . Hence the importance of cultivating its business in off seasons , of then organizing excursions , conventions , etc . All this , too , bears on the question of rates , and how they can best be adjusted to yield the largest possible return . Comparing small things with great , there are many considerations operative in railroad tariffs which obtain in those of hotels . In the house which has been // selected for analysis of expenses , the business varies very much during the four seasons of the year . In summer transient travel pays good rates , but there is usually , even then , room available for excursion parties , which can be attracted by a reduction of terms . Like his friend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than none , and is glad to take it by the creation of a new department of business . In off seasons a number of families and individuals may make his house their home ; and in fixing prices , beginning at the lowest for the least desirable quarters , care is taken not to go below the extra cost which an extra guest entails . Nor is sight lost of the fact that all classes of guests base their computations on the minimum rate , and wish to pay no more than such an advance upon that as may correspond with the difference between the accommodation they desire and the accommodations of the cheapest kind . If the minimum rate be made too low , much income will be lost derivable from the class of patrons who are able and willing to be liberal in payment . Let us now take a glance at the expensesheet for the year , which may exhibit some ratios of interest . Provisions cost eighty per cent . more than wages . Of provisions , meats were twenty-six per cent. ; poultry and game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and fruit , seven per cent . Fuel cost one and nine-tenths as much as gas , and water only onesixth as much . Ice cost one-fourt*enth as much as coals , and the replacing of broken china and glass , worn-out linen and carpets , one-ninth as much as provisions . So far from wholesale buying being always advantageous , I know that this house has raised certain prices on itself . Its demand in a restricted market for the earliest fruits and vegetables , the best meats , butter , and eggs , has told upon cost ; and wereitto evaporate some fine morning , many competing housekeepers would re joice . The same thing occurs at summer and winter hotels in country districts ; in such cases the main supplies have to be brought from the great cities to which the best provisions go , and where large competitions prevent exorbitant prices being asked . NEW YORK HOTELS . WITHOUT doubt , New York has the best hotels in America , one reason being that the metropolis is the greatest labor-market in the country . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealthy city of the republic , it naturally attracts the best servants . At the Windsor , even when the ihouse is full , there are more servants than guests , yet the great staff of employees is controlled with ease . New York has trade societies of hotel cooks , bakers , butchers , and waiters , which can readily replace undesirable servants . As a rule , maintaining a high standard of character and efficiency among their members , they are held in much esteem . Hotel-keepers compared with householders have little trouble with servants , chiefly for two reasons . The hotel-servant has a definite duty , or small round of duties , which , once mastered , can be efficiently performed . No combination of cook , laundress , chambermaid , waitress , and scrubber is required . Again , the servants have definite hours for duty , after which they are free ; and freedom is a boon dealt out very sparingly to the ordinary domestic drudge . Besides , too , a large regiment of servants working and living together , provides each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of value , and one which solves the vexatious question of followers . Contrast this with the ceaseless toil and almost complete isolation of the ordinary domestic , and cease to wonder at the calm manner of a man who may have under his charge three to five hundred servants . The very extent of the staff lends aid to its management , as applicants for employment are constantly enrolling their addresses in a little book on the proprietor 's desk . That little book is usually labeled " Next . " Whisperings as to its contents have their effect in checking vicious tendencies and caprices , and in controlling impulsive resentments . The elaborateness of modern furniture and appointments , the refined nicety which demands constant painting , scouring , and washing , the increased detail of service and attention , have all combined within recent years to augment the number of servants required for a hotel of given size . In thirteen years , business for business , the pay-roll of the most lucrative house in New York has lengthened out one-third . TIPS . A FEW words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abundance of money and a desire for good attention from servants can not be prevented from feeing them . Hence arises a calculation by the landlord , that as his servants ' places are " worth " so much a month to them , their wages may very properly be reduced , or even a premium exacted , as is commonly the case with hotelporters . This gives the servants , in turn , a quasi right to tips , so that at last , as a visitor to a popular watering-place told me last sum- // mer , the five dollars per day becomes simply an initiation fee , no attendance worthy the name being bestowed without extra payment . Competition alone can solve this question . The landlord who amply pays his staff and enforces their efficiency without tips will have an element of attraction to advertise more potent than electric light or nightly music . SUMMER HOTELS . MORE astonishing than any city hotel for management are the huge concerns one sees at Saratoga , in the Catskills , or at the beaches near New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new staff of servants every year , and they are usually remote from the markets for labor and provisioning . Their business is spasmodic , and in large part so very transient in character as to be plaintively termed " processional . " Yet they are often conducted admirably by a stretch of enterprise truly American . Sometimes a partnership of three or four is required for the work done in the city by a single landlord . Frequently these houses are managed by the proprietor of a city hotel , who transfers a portion of his staff thither during the heated term , when the cities have scant travel . This meets the difficulty of service in some measure . Or a particular landlord may conduct a summer resort in the mountains of the North and a winter hotel amid the orange-groves of Florida . Since *87o the development of summer hotels in the vicinity of our chief cities has been remarkable . Their rapid multiplication has told on the patronage of resorts at a distance , for men of business like their families to be near enough for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit . Hotels of this description , which may almost be called suburban , have been largely promoted by steamboat and railway interests . So , also , have hotels in the White Mountains and along the smaller lakes of the North . It is part of the mission of an astute passenger agent of a railroad to get such points included in the long-excursion tickets offered for sale every summer throughout the country . APARTMENT-HOUSES . LET us return for a few moments to the large hotel of the cities . We shall find there a number of permanent patrons , who seek the advantages of good fare and attendance without the care of personal supervision . They are usually bachelors , widowers , or married couples with small families or none . Their demands , as a class , have chiefly led to the building of the apartment-houses which are now discovering the sky in our great cities . Hotels designed to accommodate travelers can but imperfectly meet the wants of a class of patrons who desire not only the advantages of an architecture adapted to multiple tenancy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privacy and quiet of home . Of late years the class who , in New York and Boston , used to live permanently in hotels , are more and more finding their way into apartment-houses of greater or less excellence . It is only habit and prejudice which have so long kept Anglo-Saxons and their American descendants to the perpendicular-wall theory of homes . Germans , Frenchmen , Italians , and Scotchmen live comfortably in flats , and why may not men of other race ? The extremely high value of land in New York , and the preparation many of its citizens have had in hotel and club life , have made that city the pioneer in apartment-building on this continent . Within twenty years hundreds of vast structures have been erected for apartments , doubling and trebling the population accommodated on the land , and affording comforts impossible in the narrow , high residences of ordinary design . Swift elevators replace staircases , and a central boiler warms an immense block . The corridors are kept clean and lit at night by a service common to all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newest and best of these structures contain apartments two stories in height , securing for the upper floor an increase of privacy and quiet . In some of them each apartment has a kitchen of its own . In others , a single large general kitchen provides for all the residents , either in public or private dining-rooms . Where the private kitchen is retained , I am informed that the number of servants required is one-third fewer than necessary in an ordinary house . It is curious to note how long the organization of labor . has been delayed in its application to domestic life . Time was when flax and wool were spun , linen woven , beer brewed , and men 's clothing made at home . Now these employments are carried on under wholesale methods , with all the gain attending the use of machinery and the specialization of labor . I take it that cooking , laundering , and such general service as that which attends to a boiler , to an elevator , and to an office , might with equal advantage be conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , if they wish , elaborate private residences ; but people of moderate and small means can find in combining their resources much more comfort than in the // present isolated home , with its retail harassments . As developed in some measure from the hotel , the apartment-house may look for some hints of value to its congener . From a hotel experience of some years , I would say to projectors of such structures , Insure that your house will be fully occupied before you build it . One of the chief losses of a hotel arises from fluctuating and discrepant custom . If meals are to be provided , supply them at an advance on cost , so that the question of loss may not arise . The profits can be divided periodically among the contributors thereto on some easily devised and equitable plan . In construction , in organization of service , the apartment-house can not do better than embody the plans and methods of good hotels . One suggestion I would make , which might well be adopted in both hotel and apartment houses , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it occurs , when large numbers of people are gathered under one roof ; that an individual may develop contagious disease of a malignant type , say small-pox . Now , to isolate the patient is scarcely possible ; to remove him may be very dangerous ; and hence risks may be run of an alarming kind . My suggestion is to have in every hotel and apartmenthouse a special room , designed with the supervision of a competent physician , where such a patient as I have described might be safely nursed and treated . Special wastepipes , ventilating shafts , and walls of glazed tile might form part of the plan , which carried out would do not a little for the recovery of the stricken one . With respect to safety in case of fire , I have observed in the latest-built apartment-houses in New York balconies , in some cases continuous , erected to incidentally serve as means of escape . Highly ornamental , they are in vivid contrast with the hideous skeleton work in iron which one sees around so many lofty buildings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while diminishing risk in case of fire , serve to invite marauders . As practically embodying many elements of the coöperative principle , it is instructive to note that the apartment-house has been developed rather from the business motive to adapt hotel methods to home life , than from the speculative tendencies of cooperative philosophers . As improvements go on in the organization and design of apartment-houses , it may be fairly expected that they will loom up more and more on the streets and avenues of our great cities , as the pressure of population makes the single household more laborious and costly to maintain .
