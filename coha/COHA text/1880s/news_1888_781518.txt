txt It is a very interesting bill , this bill for the improvement of rivers and . harbors which is now before the House . There is no page of it that is not rich in specimens of queer legislation . A few days ago , we turned . to page 25 and made brief quotations from the engineers ' reports concerning certain rivers for which appropriations are made on that page  --  the Elk , the Big Sandy , the Guyandotte , and the Little Kanawha. all in West Virginia . But ' , we overlooked . one stream in the group , the-Buckhannon . It is fitting that this stream should enjoy ' the favor of logrolling legislators , for it is a logroller itself . The commerce which floats upon its foaming waters and . grinds along upon its boulders is exclusively a commerce of logs . The Government began to " improve " the Buckhannon four years ago , and the report of the engineer ' in charge , Major JAMES C. POST , shows so clearly what kind . of a stream it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has undertaken to do in it , that we quote a few paragraphs : " This river the Buckhannon rises in the southeastern part of the State West Virginia , and flowing in a northerly direction empties itswaters into the Tygart 's Valley , a tributary of the Monongahela River . The region through which it flows is rugged and mountainous , and is covered by a forest , much of which contains timber of the largest size and of the most valuable varieties . The river forms the only , outlet for this timber , but in its present ebstruoted condition the timbers can only be brought out in short lengths , and ? even then much of it is destroyed by being accumulated in log jams or worn out by the continued blows and friction against the boulders lying in the bed of the river and restricting the channel . " The Buckhannon River is forty-seven and one-half miles long from the Three Forks to its mouth . In this distance there is a fall of 375 feet , which is very unevenly distributed , the river being nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in others there is a fall of fifty feet to the mile . It is obstructed by numerous islands , upon which there is a large growth of underbrush , and by huge sandstone boulders , some of them containing as much as 500 cubic yards . The islands divide the channel into two or more parts , and these with the barriers of boulders , cause logjams and prevent the timber from reaching a market . " The improvement undertaken was the opening of channels through these obstructions by blasting and breaking of the rocks , clearing the islands , and removing the log jams that . had been formed . Ten islands , containing twelve and three-quarter acres , were cleared , and eleven log jams , which ? completelv closed the river , were cut up sufficiently to permit the next high water to carry the logs out . " The work of removing the boulders was commenced just below what is known as Gould 's or Limber 's Mill , about nine miles above the town of Buckhannon . At this point a channel was ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 feet in width by breaking up 9,245 cubic yards of rook . A similar channel was begun at Tenny 's obstructions , some three miles above Gould 's Mill , but the amount remaining on hand was only sufficient to remove 1,051 cubic yards at this point , and but little was accomplished . The total work done was , therefore , clearing 10 islands , cutting 11 log jams , and breaking up 10,296 cubic , yards of rock . " It was estimated that before a , channel for the logs could be made there must be broken " 78,850 cubic yards of rock and boulders , " at a cost of $23,955 . The report of the overseer was not less interesting than that of Major POST . Its character may be indicated by the following extracts : " The first obstruction above Buckhannon is at the falls , seven miles . From the falls to Burner 's Mills , a distance of one and a quarter miles , the river is very rocky . The rooks are not large , yet they often cause log jams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mile there are quite a number of boulders , running from ten to forty cubic yards . * * * From the boat crossing the river is very rough , the rocks forming almost a solid breastwork for 300 feet ; then the rocks are more scattered , the whole obstruction extending for about half a mile . * * From the mouth of the run for about five miles the river is full of small islands and rooks . The cost of removing the rooks is much increased , as it will be quite difficult to transport tools and explosives . The mountains on either . side are very high and rough . This brings um within one mile of Bean 's Mill , and the worst place on the river . For one mile the river is full of boulders , and in that distance there are three very short bends , making it necessary to remove all the rocks . " Not a word about even raft or skiff navigation , for the good . reason that the Buckhannon is no place for rafts or skiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can live in its waters , even after the rocks shall have been blasted out and the way smoothed over the milldams that cross it . Is this the kind of commerce forthe encouragement of which the public money should be spent ? The entire surplus revenue would not make the Buckhannon navigable for anything but logs and fish . But somebody who owns the timber asks the American people to blast a channel for him , and through Congress they nave consented - to do it , just as they have undertaken to spend $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 for the benefit of real estate speculators in . Sabine Pass , in the vicinity of which there are neither inhabitants nor commerce . Such jobs as this inevitably beget others of the same kind . The last River and Har-. bor act required the engineers to make an examination of the Big Rapids of St. John 's River , Maine . This is another logrolling project . Major JARED A. Sblrrn said in his report : " Boulders are very numerous , fairly filling the bed of the river , and varying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain several cubic yards . The land belongs mainly to non-residents . The great boulders cause the logs which are driven down the river to collect in jams , and it is evidently to save exPense in the driving of logs that the improvement is largely , if not mainly , desired . The logs are manufactured into lumber in New-Brunswick . " He declares that the stream is " not worthy of improvement at public expense . " But if the Government blasts a channel for the lumbermen of the Buckhannon , why , should it not do the same for the lumbermen of the St. John 's ? We shall expect to see the St. John 's in next year 's bill . . And there is . Pond . River , in Kentncky ; ' Which Major POST ( the explorer of the Buckhandeleted 6 lines If Buckhannon , why not Pond River ' We predict that Major POST will be overruled and that the log rollers of Congress will eventually serve the log rollers of the wooded banks of the Pond as they have served those in West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Limber 's milldam to Bean 's mill .
