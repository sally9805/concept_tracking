RUNNING THE RAPIDS OF THE UPPER HUDSON . HAVE you ever run a rapid ? Have you ever rushed through a wilderness on a torrent ? Perhaps you have made a trip through some river of Maine , where you sat in a light birch canoe while two Indians steered you through the foam and waves . You have not forgotten the rush , the roar , the daring . But what was your part in that glorious time ? Your role resembled that of the blankets . The taciturn savage guided you with the certainty of fate ; he took you within touch of the most manly adventures , and brought you back to the pursuit of VOL . XXI. - 63. humdrums . Meanwhile you sat through them all , perfectly safe , perfectly idle , perfectly worthless . And now , having flown with his wings , you crow over your achievement . This is not exactly the exploit to fill a man with the utmost joy and pride . I mean , by shooting a rapid , to take your life and your boat into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocky stream unknown to you , This will make your spirit bound higher than the flight of a bird . Every minute is a climax . It stops your breath in the chill of approaching death ; it fires your THE CAMP AT NIGHT . // blood in the heat of frantic toil and it stirs your heart with the frenzy of triumph ,  --  and still more deeply with gratitude for selfpreservation . To shoot a rapid is to live a new life . For then both mind and body are roused to their utmost activity . Imagine yourself rushing down an unknown stream filled with large rocks that break a swift , crooked , strong current . Each instant brings you to circumstances entirely unforeseen ; your decisions must be made instantaneously ; and your execution must be fearless in the most fearful dangers , and skillful in the most surprising difficulties . The choice of your course demands an accurate judgment of various elements . You must read the signs of hidden rocks in waters both slow and swift , both deep and shallow . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over different kinds of beds . You must foresee the probable direction of currents beyond your situation . You must estimate the speed of the current and the chances for stemming it while you work across the stream to a passable channel . You must also reckon the chances of shooting down diagonally across the current before it dash you on the rocks bordering your channel . And these problems , as well as many others , come to you with almost the quickness of thought . Then , after your choice is duly made it is often impossible to execute it ; for the currents you have just descended may have placed you too far to the right or the left . Moreover , the immediate course must be chosen with regard not only to the immediate dangers , but to those also that follow . The actions of guiding the canoe are simple in themselves a stroke or a back-stroke right or left . But intensity of purpose lends your body its greatest energy , and makes every stroke the ultimate of physical activity . Shooting a raj ) id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halcyon on his own ground . Here you sweep quietly under the arching trees ; there stop an instant at a rock with quiet eddies ; then start off again on the swift shoot ; dart here and there as in an aimless flight ; course it straight down stream ; then fly to the fall , and , with a quiver , plunge under foaming waves . Then , as you rise like the halcyon from his bath , be not surprised if your spirit exult in such triumphs of the wing , and sing shrill songs of victory . Moreover , still deeper feeling stirs the mind . The old comparison of life to a stream takes new force on a rapid . You feel at once the irresistible march of events toward an unknowii future . You feel as a double being , half a subject of fate and half an agent of your own salvation . Your course of conduct has that absorbing interest felt in common life only at eventful moments . For every act , if good , is a means of self-preservation ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect come together , almost without the intervention of time . Your excitement is intense , your glee is painftilly keen , yet a graver mood comes now and then with the solemn undertone of death ringing in your ears . So you rush through this epitome of life , filled with pleasures and perils ; and at its close , in a quiet pool , memories of the passage fill the mind with joy and gratitude . My adorable companion in such trips deserves more than the record of her name . The Allegro is a canoe of the S/widow model built by Everson . This design possesses such undeniable advantages over those of previous invention , that it makes canoeing much more safe , agreeable , and easy . It thus promises to extend the sport among many who heretofore have hesitated to attempt it . The Shadow has the same general dimensions as those of the A/au/zYus , viz. , fourteen feet in length , and twenty-eight inches beam on deck ; but she has some important changes in the details of the model and of the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two inches , as may be seen by the figure of her cross-section* Her beam on OUTLINE AND CROSS-SECTION OF THE SHADOW CANOE . // 859 her bearings is therefore about thirty-two inches ; and her floor is quite flat , and runs well forward and aft . These changes give her greater stiffness and buoyancy , and make her draw but little water . Her sheer is but seven inches , yet this is found to be quite sufficient , and her stem and stern-posts are cut away somewhat ; she thus escapes much of the tiresome opposition of a head wind , and turns more readily under the paddle . I have altered the Skadow somewhat to fit her still better for running rapids . Her flat floor is excellent in giving her stiffness , and keeping her well up on top of the water . I cut away her stern-post to make it rise as the stem does , and I reduced her keel to a half inch ; this saves her from being caught by cross-currents , and enables her to turn quickly . A canoe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " flat keel , " with a deep adjustable keel-made in three pieces for stowing below  --  to be put ou when cruising in ordinary waters . The bow should flare off aloft much more than that of the original S/urdow , to save her from diving under too much when meeting the curling swells at the foot of every shoot . Such a model , in my opinion , unites qualities that are particularly desirable in this country , where rapids are so prominent a feature of the most delightful routes . As " carries " are another important feature of our canoeing , lightness is indispensable . This is coupled with great strength in the latest invention , the veneer canoes built at Racine , Wisconsin . Thus much of my companion , whose enthusiasm for adventure , whose docility of temper , and whose beauty I can not recall without a twitter of emotion . The choice of a route ought not to embarrass any one . For when you begin this free cruising , the whole world seems made for canoeing . Sea and lake offer wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest and plain ; and mountain streams hurrah to you for a breathless race down a torrent . This latter challenge I accepted from the Hudson-not from the old river where it sinks into the sea , but from its roaring , turbulent youths among the mountains ; The Boreas , the North , the Rocky , the Cedar , and the Indian rivers are his frolicking family . They escape from the peaks of the Adirondacks , and rush with foam and tumult at the head of the Hudson . And the dignified old river you know below Albany is all confused by their antics , and obliged to join their turmoil . For twenty A WARNING . // miles or more , down to the Glen , the Hudson is a torrent over narrow , rocky beds , among bold mountains . It is so furious in a freshet that only the most reckless lumbermen venture on its rapids . Swift but somewhat smoother waters commence at the Glen , and continue ten miles , to Thurman . Here still waters begin a course of fifteen miles , interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Landing . At this point the river enters six or seven miles of rapids among the mountains ; then it flows on swiftly about fifteen miles to Fort Edward ; and to Albany , about fifty miles , it pursues a quiet course , now and then interrupted by a slight fall , dam , or rapid . Thus , the river offers twenty-five or thirty miles of actual rapids among wild mountains ; and also some quiet stretches among fertile plains and comfortable civilization . But the upper Hudson , though rough , is not so large as to require a pilot familiar with its eddies , rocks , and shoots . We began our descent of the Hudson at the highest navigable waters . We were two : one was the captain of the Roszlie , a Nautilus canoe of willful disposition ; the other was the captain of the Allegro , a canoe of angelic mold and motive . We had crossed the Adirondack wilderness from the Fulton chain of lakes via the Raquette to Blue Mountain Lake , and had carted our canoes to Fourteenth Dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drove past the hotel to the shed , our advent brought everybody to the doors and windows , and enlisted a straggling regiment of men and boys , who came after us through the rain for a nearer view . But we had become hardened to adulation . Our canoes were the first that had entered the wilderness . We had held , for the inquisitive , levees , matine'es , soire'es , s3ances , conversaziones , at all times of day and night , on beaches , roads , bogs , and logs , till we were inured to admiration and curiosity . So the crowd made but little impression on us at first . But when our intention to rwn the rapids was avowed , and the possibility and the impossibility of the enterprise were delivered at us , all at once the crowd became very interesting . After hearing their chorus of conflicting statements , we systematically buttonholed the most intelligent by-standers , and pried into their secret thoughts . One old log-driver , who had run rafts every freshet for thirty years , believed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another man of experience thought that our canoes would be distributed in jack-straws as relics of metropolitan insanity . Still another thought we could go down if we carried around the Spruce Mountain rift , the Horse Race , and the other rough places . On the other hand , some believed we could succeed . We questioned these minutely about the falls , the rifts , and the most dangerous localities along the way . Then , after the shower had passed , we drove off a short distance down the river . Men in wagons and on foot followed us to see the " NOT MUCH HURRAH HERE . " // launch . But as the day was nearly spent , we disappointed them by camping for the night . They returned early next morning , however , and waited an hour or two for our departure . One man , who had arrived after our launching , pursued us two miles , and then followed three miles farther , to see us run the rapids .. We stowed most of our cargo in the after-hatch , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid catching on rocks and swinging around . It was a bright September morning , fresh with a strong west wind . So we began our runTHE HORSE RACE . ning of the rapids with inspiriting weather , with a good depth of water under the dancing ripples , and with hearty good wishes from our interested companions on the shore . The scene was quite striking to any one who had the time to see it . As for ourselves , we were at once too much occupied to give more than a glance at the surroundings . High mountains rise on each bank , wild , dark , and inhospitable . The forest is scarcely broken , excepting by a few bald peaks . The narrow gorge of the river is hardly touched with civilization , nothwith // standing the railroad and an occasional cabin . The banks are lined with huge bowlders ; the hed of the river is filled with great rocks ; and the water is broken into countless currents , eddies , and shoots . The two little crafts , comely and fragile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time nor disposition for such sentiments ; we begin at once our combat with the elements , and already feel the energy and daring required for the exploit . We are at the head of the Spruce Mountain rift . It is considered the most dangerous place on the river . Every year , some of the log-drivers are drowned in its furious currents . Then the waters present to view a sea of foaming waves rushing at headlong speed . Their roar drowns every other sound . The great , sharp swells then met in the swiftest water are likely to capsize or swamp a boat ; hut , on the other hand , the wide , deep channels between the rocks offer plenty of sea-way and many chances for a safe passage . If you upset , there is generally plenty of water to swim in ; and a strong man , who is cool and skillful , can save himself even in those tumultuous currents . At the present time , with average water , navigation is much more difficult , and , perhaps , as dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course of bare rocks and foaming shoots . The high rocks are half out of water , and many of the low ones are scarcely covered . The bowlders are often but a few yards apart , and sometimes but a few feet . Consequently , the channels are very narrow and crooked , and in some places too narrow even for a boat only twenty inches wide . If the current were gentle , it would still be very easy to pick your way among these passages ; for you would have time to choo e a route and to follow it . But the curr nt of the Spruce Mountain rift , and of the Horse Race below , is not less than ten or twelve miles an hour in a freshet . In this ordinary water the average speed is much less , per haps half ; but the velocity of the shoots . and narrow channels is fully as great . White capped waves roll up below every rock under water , and foaming currents shoot right and left from every bowlder that divides the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat are so numerous that you wonder if she can possibly go through . The dangers from an upset into this kind of water are that you might get your limbs broken by catching between the bowlders , you might be caught on a rock and held under by the pressure of the current , or you might be knocked senseless by hitting your head on the rocks . The water is much more wicked for being too shallow for swimming and too deep for wading . Nevertheless , there are many favorable circumstances to aid you . If you manage your boat well , you will probably go through without breaking her or upsetting . The bowlders are large and smooth , and therefore not likely to punch through the planks ; every swell is not able to capsize or fill the boat ; and a quick eye and a steady hand will save her from nearly all the worst places . If you aw spilled our you have many chances to swim ashore , or else drift there . Certainly , you will prefer to float ; and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters will kindle your whole being to white heat . But we often live by luck ; why not here ? As some German of practical experience has observed , it 's a dangerous . thing to live , any way . The waters ahead are narrow shoots between rocks . Some of the bowlders , high above water , are easily seen ; others quite low are shown by a foaming wave rolling out from each side as the waters divide others , again , just covered , are marked hy a white-capped swell below them . The deepest , clearest water is known by the high , . sharp , and regular swells on its . surface . The channels between the rocks are from three to ten feet wide ; and , at intervals of a few yards , they turn right or left in swift , tortuou shoots . We are drifting down a smooth stretch , but straight toward a white-capped swell . It rolls up some feet below the rock A QUEST FOR PROVISIONS . // that makes it ; so , after deciding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the paddle , and send the canoe safely by it . But I sit so low in the water that I can not see far ahead , to choose a route ; and we b*gin to go quite fast in this current . So I back water to slow her , for fear of running suddenly into some impassable place . Besides , she turns more readily at low speed , and I avoid rpck after rock quite surely as we glide along . Now and then we are completely surprised . Certain smooth pieces of water in a rapid show a good channel . I took that short quiet stretch for such a place , and steered toward it ; but now I find it is the eddy below a great flat rock that hides the swell . So I back water with all speed . I then turn to the right through some rougher water . Farther down I see a breast-work of rocks and bre* kers extending from the left shore nearly across the stream . There is no passage there ; I must cross to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down stream ; for , if she lies across the current xvhile drifting , a rock may catch the keel and capsize her instantaneously . The current here is not the swiftest : so I back water vigorously to stop her descent on the rocks below . She gradually obeys , and soon creeps up stream a little . Then I turn her stern just a little across stream to the right , and continue hacking . She thus moves slowly across the river , but never gets broadside to the current . When we have reached a point right above the clear channel , I give a stroke or two on the left to turn her straight down stream , and in a moment we go on again between the rocks and the white-caps . But we are scarcely in this channel before I see that the main body of water is in the center of the river bed , and that we can not pass among the rocks right ahead . The current here is too swift to stem by backing . As , however , the nearest channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is some distance below , I turn her bow somewhat across the current and make a bold rush down stream . But the channel ahead is only four or five feet wide ; and if I steer badly there will be a wrecked canoe in about ten seconds . We fly past rocks , and over others just below the keel . The water is dangerously shallow . In this critical course every stroke must be IN CALM WATER . carefully calculated . I dipped my paddle too deep that time and lost a stroke ; for it The next stroke must make up the loss . struck a rock and shot out of the water as The current is all the time bearing us if flung upward by a treacherous hand . toward the rocks this side of the channel , // and it seems doubtful that we can cross the current far enough to enter . I turn her a little more across stream , pray that the water may be deep enough to float her keel above rocks , while she drifts almost sidewise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dash on , and reach the head of the channel ; but she lies so much across the stream that she must certainly strike bow and stern on each side of the entrance . It is almost hopeless , but 1 lay all my strength on a back stroke on the right , and then a forward stroke on the left makes her just clear her bow as she darts down the shoot . It would be a good plan to rest now and get breath again . But here is where the rapids begin in earnest . The river falls very perceptibly ahead ; the rocks increase ; the current is swifter and more broken . Here we are on the worst rift of the Hudson . I can give but a glance at each obstacle ; but that glance is my utmost effort to see and comprehend the situation . Then my mind seems supernaturally keen in deciding , and every nerve is flooded with electric power . My strokes are jerks . The canoe darts here and there as if mad . There is not an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just miss a rock here , gain a channel there ju t wide enough to pass the boat like an arrow through a hole ; she strikes her keel , but goes on ; or she scrapes one side of her bottom on a rock , and rolls partly over as a startling admonition . We come to a line of rocks and swells too suddenly for escape ; a rock just covered with water right ahead is the lowest leap ; we put on all speed and steer straight for its round crown . She rides up it on her keel ; I keep my balance and sympathetically tremble for the boat while her momentum carries her over it till far past her midships ; then she hangs by the stern . But she is safe , and I soon shove her off for another race . Surely such good luck can not last all through the Spruce Mountain rift . At last we find ourselves in a channel so crooked and obstructed that I must pause to study the situation , although the hesitation may be fatal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a rock lies in the middle of it , about two boatlengths below the entrance . As this is the only chance , here goes ! I drive her at full A STEAMING SUPPER . // speed , right down at the rock . She can not be turned in this short distance ; she flies as straight as an arrow to her destruction . But I swing my left arm across my chest and enter the port blade of the paddle diagonally into the water on the starboard side . Her high speed makes the oblique blade press against the water and haul her sideways , several feet to starboard . She shies from the rock in a single bound . I can scarcely breathe , and my blood boils with excitement . As she glides into the pool below the shoot , I let her drift about in the eddy , while the paddles rest across the combing . Now for the first time I have an opportunity to look around . Where is the Rosalie. ? I had passed her stranded on a rock at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her off . As this was not an uncommon trick with her perverse nature it gave me no anxiety ; I sent the captain a nod of encouragement and went on my way rejoicing in a Shadow canoe . Looking up the rift now from its foot , I wonder how a boat ever got through it whole ; and I feel like patting the Allegro on the back for her success . I suppose the Rosalie is hidden from view by the numerous bowlders studding the bed of the river , and making it look like a barren field of rocks with foaming waves between . As the day is nearly done , I land on the beach to make camp and await the Rosalie . I had gathered a large pile of wood for a camp-fire , and still the Rosalie was not visible , even from the point above . Then I leveled a place on the sand for laying our boats , and wondered if there would really be only one to occupy it . Finally I kindled the fire ; and then went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . When I returned , the other captain was just wading to the beach , and pulling the Rosalie by the nose . " Hurrah ! " I exclaimed , as I dropped the ax and sticks , and hurried to the water . I saw at a glance that something had happened . " There 's not much hurrah here , " said he , shivering with great animation . " Why ? What 's the matter ? " " She struck a rock up here , and capsized quick as a wink . The water was deep and I went all under . When I came up , my paddle was gone too far for me to get it . I 'm v-very sorry ,  --  but this ends my trip . " As he said this , he hitched up his trowsers with emphasis . VOL . XXI. - 64 . " Oh , well ! " I replied , " I can soon make you a paddle that will answer . " " Yes , I know ; but my time is about up , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the train on Monday , and go home . " We soon had the boats placed side by side on the beach , about two feet apart , and propped up to lie level . We then took out their cargoes , and removed the hatches and back-boards to leave the well empty for a bed . A small mattress of cork shavings and a blanket were arranged on the bottom . Then a piece of unbleached sheeting , oiled , seven feet by nine , was spread over the boats on poles , in such a way as to form a tent covering the wells . Better beds , and a better camp for storm or sunshine , need not be offered to tired men . We soon had a good supper stowed away , and the wet cargo of the Rosalie hung on poles about the fire . After toasting ourselves an hour , and discussing the maneuvers of canoes in rapids , we turned in for a long night of sound sleep . As the next day was Sunday , we still prolonged the period of rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rail . She traveled as freight the rest of the way to New York , about 200 miles , for eighteen dollars . Why railroads should make such exorbitant charges on light canoes is a matter for disgust , wonder , and war . The Allegro resumed her course in good spirits on Monday morning , notwithstanding the loss of our companion . She was eager for more rapids , more exploits on the wing . We were not long in reaching the " Horse Race , " below Riverside . That rift is the most rapid on the river . Its name suggests its motion , but not by any means its wild and tumultuous course . Perhaps Mazeppa 's Race would be better , if one holds to the analogy . The mountains on each hand are bold , high , and dark with forest or with barren rocks . The scene is gloomy , inhospitable , even without the dismal voice of the torrent . As I approach the head of the rift , I can not see the foot , for the river falls with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of me and stand up in the canoe to get a view . There are plenty of rocks ahead-with white-capped swells . But the water is evidently deeper than I found it on the Spruce Mountain rift , not quite so much broken by rocks , and the channels are somewhat wider . Moreover , I see the rift has no actual falls at the lower end , but a rapid descent of foaming swells among hidden rocks . That lively place // must be entered at a given point ; and that point is just below a rough-and-tumble passage that may derange all my calculations . Here will be sharp work ! I run her up to the shore , to stow the baggage differently , that I may kneel in the after end of the cockpit ; she now raises her head more out of water , is more easily turned , and on my knees I can see farther ahead , and also exert much more strength on the paddle . The usual difficulty of choosing the course is increased by a glare of sunlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe about , and makes it hard to steer just where the greatest accuracy is necessary . Moreover , it makes the surface of the water wonderfully deceptive just where the greatest dangers are concealed . You judge of rapid water by the appearance of its surface . The face of a river is full of character . Here it sleeps , while curling dimples come and go with dreams of sylvan beauties resting on its breast . There it awakens to merry life . Further on , where the combat rages , every feature is in the tumult of passion . And a practiced eye reads all this as he runs , and governs his course accordingly . The head of a rift is often smooth , with a wedgeshaped " apron " marking the course of the channel . The central , main part of the rift is a confused mass of eddies , white-capped waves , and swift shoots . The foot is a swift rush of deep water marked with high , sharptopped swells quite regular in succession . The deep pool below is quiet , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , which vary much according to the geological formations , a rapid is full of important details . Every hidden rock marks the surface in a way that shows the depth of water and the velocity of the current . A rock in a deep , slow current figures the quiet surface with delicate lines and small eddies ; in water a little swifter , it makes a round , smooth hood of water over its head , and small ripples below ; in a rapid , strong current , it makes a foaming , crested wave and an eddy setting upstream ; and , in a steep descent , it throws the water into high , tumultuous seas . Thus you estimate the nature of the water by signs , forms , and colors of waves and eddies , that are quite reliable guides . But the high wind to-day changes everything . On still water it rolls up waves that belong to a deep , swift channel ; on swift , clear shoots it makes white-capped waves that indicate large rocks ; and on rocky courses it tumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to move about the stream , like sunken monsters seeking prey . So the course is full of surprises . I suddenly find a huge bowlder right ahead , where I believed there was clear water . I get to a line of breakers where I expect to strand , but glide through rough , deep water . I lie back in imagined safety while running down a uniform shoot , but all at once find a huge rock close to my side . Nevertheless , the eye soon becomes accustomed to the change of signs , and estimates the colors and forms on a new scale . But at last I am near the end of the Horse Race . I have not approached the last swift rush of water in the right place ; in avoiding some heavy seas in midchannel , I kept too near a large eddy , setting upstream below a rock , and the upward current striking the bow turned the canoe almost about , and so took her out of the course . A glance at the tumultuous breakers and high swells ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and hard , and , with the help of good luck , dart into the main channel . Here the rush almost takes my breath . For a moment destruction seems perfectly certain . The current is a mass of foaming waves over rocks . But the water is deeper than I thought from its broken and discolored surface . We rush on , through swells that roll the canoe from one side to the other , wash her decks , and toss us about in the most startling manner . The race was swift , though short , and we glide out at last on the still pool below with the elation and gratitude of victors . The sentiments are strangely stirred in such a trip alone , down an unknown rapid . The feeling of danger , the isolation in wild surroundings , the intense mental and physical activity , all unite to form a very exceptional experience . There is no time for ennui and ordinary loneliness . You are too keenly sensitive , too profoundly moved , for anything commonplace . The dominant feeling is gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less strong is the yearning for companionship . Pride over the achievement is not unknown , and affection for your canoe wells up again and again as you quietly paddle her through still waters or anxiously drive her through new dangers . As I shot down the rift and under the bridge at the Glen , I kept thinking : " Oh , for some one to tell it to-some boy , just in // his prime ! " So I landed , and , instead of cooking my solitary meal , I went to a house in search of dinner and a pair of ears . I was at once fully supplied in both regards at a full table . Then we all went down to the river to see the Allegro . As I narrated her exploits on the rifts , the boys ' eyes dilated with wonder and heroworship . When I reembarked , one of them said : " So your friend went home , eh ! But you 're goin ' to grit her through , ai nt you ? " That boy would have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I would certainly have accepted such an offer . But I soon pushed oW and resumed my solitary yet delightful cruise . That evening , as the sun went down in a glowing sky , I wandered again through corn-fields and an orchard in search of some human being and some potatoes . An aged woman , preparing supper in a farmer 's kitchen , listened to my requests for food , but gave me little encouragement . The farmer 's wife at last came to the door and explained that the hens had failed , that the bread had disappeared , and that the potato-bug was the only responsible party in that township ; but I must have had an atmosphere of canoe about me , for , after a few minutes , she kindly divided her stores and gave me six eggs , half a bag and five l ) potatoes . I picked up some apples in the orchard , and returned to my boat on the bank of the river . In the evening , as I was eating my supper by the camp-fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been attracted by the blaze , and had come to know where it was . My explanation re-assured them , and finally we had a pleasant chat by the fire . He urged me to come to his house for the night ; but , failing in this kindness , he insisted that I should come up for breakfast . So , after all , I did not spend a lonely evening . The next morning , at breakfast , our visit was still more social . The old farm-house was in neater trim and the ladies were more cordial than before . We were scarcely seated at table before I realized that I had entered no common situation . Mine hostess , in the kindness of her heart , had prepared a bountiful , excellent , and varied breakfast . I had come to it with the greatest zest of social and physical hunger . Every condition , therefore , promised one of those phenomenal meals that are the joy of a canoeist and the pride of any healthy man . Now mine host was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head and face of the Andrew Jackson type , showing keen perceptions and a persistent will . We commenced with broiled chicken , and the comfortable silence of serious minds . But soon he said : " Well , now , you follow books , and know how to judge them ; and I 'd like to find out just the truth on one thing : Is n't Pope the greatest poet that ever ljved ? " I had to relinquish my succulent second joint , and venture on the most perilous passage of my cruise . For I know more of rocks and rapids , and care more for them , than for books . So my opinion could scarcely fulfill my host 's expectations in regard to its infallibility . Yet how could I disappoint his literary interest ? I did not . " Wont you have some more baked potatoes ? Now I want a poet to teach me something new . That 's why every line of Pope satisfies me . What do you think of Homer ? I ca n't get much interested in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , it takes two men and a boy to see to the top of him . " I never before was so devoted to a bare chicken-bone . I nibbled and scraped so assiduously that I found time for only a word or two . " Have some more baked potatoes . Now , really , Shakspere , he is no doubt a great genius ; but I ca n't find so much real sense in his plays as in Pope 's works . What do you think of him ? " The steaming buckwheat cakes gave me a momentary diversion ; but the feast of reason soon resumed its supremacy . We had Burns and Pope , Byron and Pope , Longfellow and Pope . Then came Darwinism , predestination , Beecher , the Southern questions , the new political party , and Edison 's inventions . But I struggled manfully through it all , and at the end I felt a full measure of success . The family accompanied me to the shore to see the Allegro , and get a glimpse of her independent , roaming life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I stowed in the locker potatoes , apples , and green corn , and regretfully shoved off for further adventures . These hap-hazard peeps through backdoors are one of the most entertaining features of a canoe cruise . You have the keenest relish for the companionship and the hospitality ; and you see characters in their plain realities , without the mask of ceremony . The Hudson about Thurman changes // from a wild mountain torrent to a stream of charming pastoral character . The valley here and there expands a little , and gives room for bits of cultivation among varied hills and dales . The gloom of the forest is broken by a few fields and a farm-house that are very welcome to the eye . The hills often shut the course of the river from view with bold points and narrow passes , quite like a miniature of the grander Highlands . The islands in the broad stream are picturesque with arching elms . The shores are varied with mossy rocks under golden beeches ; with fields where brown stouts of buckwheat peep over the bank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The placid river was a long gallery of autumnal pictures . I floated a day through its gorgeous halls of crimson , gold , and green , flooded with sunlight ; I drifted as idly and as quietly as the fleets of leaves that came and went with the zephyr . After the rush and nervous combat on the rapids , these tranquil beauties and these dreamy hours were inexpressibly delightful . The roar of Hadley 's Falls broke the spell , and announced one of the most interesting episodes in the cruise . As I paddled down the rift to the head of the falls , a number of ladies ' in the boarding-houses along the shore caught sight of the Allegro , and came down to see her . A young man helped me carry her around the falls , and launch her in an eddy or little bay behind a point of rocks just at their foot . The gorge of the river here is very narrow , crooked , and walled in with precipitous rocks . The current is swift , tortuous , and turbulent . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shoot , where the water almost falls over some rocks , and rolls up crested waves of quite formidable appearance . A few yards below this is a second plunge , rather rougher than the first . Elsewhere the current is deep , and safe enough if it does not dash you against the cavernous walls of rock . The best channel is in the center of each shoot . The ladies watched my operations with close attention while I embarked . I tried to turn her bow toward the middle of the river , and avoid dashing against the left bank of the shoot . But the current bore her bow toward the shore , and pointed her ominously to the rocks . After many vain efforts , I landed and examined the water again at the shoot . Some of the ladies seemed quite pale and agitated ; one of them asked me why I did not put my boat in below the " bad places . " I answered that I liked the fun of running such water . This made the black eyes of one dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not go . I explained the difficulties to be met . Then they were silent while I reembarked . I had concluded to risk a passage on the left side of the shoot , in the shallow water . So I tried again to turn her bow out from the rocks . But the current bore her in . I backed up till the stern was at the very point of the rocks by which the swift current rushed , and then tried to turn the bow out . But I backed too far , for the current caught her , and bore her away sidewise . The ladies exclaimed . For a moment the current seemed to have its own way ; but I soon got control of the canoe , and , with a few sharp strokes , brought her back into the eddy below the point . There I watched the whirl of currents a while , and finally availed myself of their movements to get her bow pointed down-stream . I gave her a shove , and we started . The ladies clasped their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoot , close to the rocks ; but she cleared them , and plunged down with a strange motion , as of falling . She struck her keel a sharp blow on the rock at the foot of the shoot , but she did not capsize . She ran all under the crested wave and gave me a shower on the chest and face . I had just time to get breath again , and clear my eyes , when I found her running with the current against the side of the narrow gorge . A sharp struggle ensued , and I finally got her head turned down-stream again . The second shoot was close at hand . Each side of the gorge throws a sharp wave from the bank toward the center of the shoot . These two waves meet at an acute angle , and form two crested walls of water thrown upward with great force . The shoot plunges steeply down , and passes under these waves . Now the only safe passage is directly through the center of this angle . There the boat stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each wave , instead of being raised on one side only by one wave , and thus capsized . As we came into the shoot , I saw that she was too far to the left , and , quickly passing the port blade to starboard , I slid her sidewise to the right . She went down the steep , swift , smooth " apron " of the shoot like a flash . In an instant she dived all under the crested wave , and shook with many sudden turnings and swayings in the strong currents . She // passed not quite in the center of the angle of waves ; for she rolled up one side with a jerk that startled me , but fortunately did not throw me off my balance . A moment later she floated quietly on the pool below the bridge , and turned around with the current while I took breath . Some people on the bridge peered over the railing , and the ladies at the falls waved their handkerchiefs . The passage was short , but swift , and exciting ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hudson returns , at Jessup 's Landing , to the ways of its youth , by plunging down a great fall and then running seven miles as a wild rapid between high mountains . I unwisely followed the counsel of the most prudent villagers instead of the most enterprising , and had my canoe carted four miles down the river to New Bridge . This mistake lost me over three miles of strong , swift water , deeper and safer than the rifts about Riverside and the Glen . But I made up the loss by camping here several days and hunting gray squirrels . The mountains about are delightful hunting-grounds . Every peak commands an extensive view-of the deep gorge where the river foams and roars , of the wide valley of the Hudson rolling through the plain from Glen 's Falls to Troy , and of the Green Mountains along the eastern horizon . Every evening the neighbors collected about my camp-fire for stories . They brought me combs of wild honey and sweet apples to roast . These bright fall days in the woods , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trip . But finally I launched on the last rapids , and soon left the mountains and the rifts for the plain and the still waters of every-day life . The quiet Hudson below Glen 's Falls offered no exciting passages , but this part of my trip was quite as delightful as any other , for the peaceful scenery , the rest on smooth water , and the presence of civilization , were all exceedingly welcome after the rough wilderness . Doubtless they were the more enjoyable because the Allegro awakened , all along the route , amusing expressions of curiosity and many acts of kindness . At Glen 's Falls , a man who passed me on the canal took meforan Indian , and whooped , grimaced , and grunted in the most cordial and savage manner . But I maintained the taciturnity of my tribe , and gravely worked my paddle without replying . Three men in a wagon stopped their oxen , after much hallooing , to look at me and discuss whether I was an Indian or a negro . I concluded that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare . One man , just opening the hatch of a canal-boat , let the hatch-cover right down on his toes , and stood , quite unmindful of the pain , until I had passed out of sight . At Northumberland I left the Hudson and followed the canal on its west bank , to avoid some dams in the river ; and at the same time to follow a more elevated route for better views . The canal offered also a new phase of life , and many pleasant civili-* ties . Toward sundown I paddled up to a canal-boat loaded with lumber , and rested from a long day 's pull by towing alongside . The captain chatted to me while he manned the long tiller ; his wife came up from the cabin to look at the canoe ; and their two children leaned over the rail as near as possible to the Allegro , and almost devoured her with curiosity . The mother and daughter soon returned to the cabin , and then the rattle of dishes almost drove me distracted . In a few minutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ; then the driver on the tow-path was taken aboard and went below into that heaven of feed . But an angel was watching over me all that time . She had suddenly appeared above my head with a tray nicely spread with a steaming supper . She was very pretty , with her little hands weighed down with her load , her matronly bearing , and her evident pleasure in extending her hospitality . I was too much overcome to refuse such an offer . So I set the tray before me on the deck , and between bites told her stories of the rapids . The boat and its people seemed so attractive that I chartered them all to take the Allegro on board for the night . She was soon placed in a hollow between the piles of lumber , covered with the tent , and opened to receive calls from all hands . Then the family took me still more into their circle . As we went into their cabin , and I inspected their diminutive but neat quarters , I thought it compared favorably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , stores , and furniture were all within reach of a central seat . After a chat I bade them good-night , and went on deck to turn in . The silence of a misty night was scarcely broken by the tread of the horses on the tow-path . Now and then the man at the helm called out to the driver in a slow , sleepy voice . The boat , as well as everything else , // seemed in perfect rest ; but when the headlight glared on a bridge or a tree it seemed as if Nature were on a silent march to the rear . I soon fell asleep , after a long day of labor at the paddle ; but the night seemed almost a dream ; for I knew that we traveled , yet felt not the slightest motion ; that some one watched over our progress , although he rarely spoke ; and , more than all , I enjoyed again the delightful feeling of home in the little floating world that had received me . I turned out just before sunrise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise . The scene was entirely veiled by fog . But this soon formed into large clouds that rolled about the great valley , and finally ascended the eastern hills , and let the sun pour down . Thus the knolls and plains were full of pretty lights and shadows on fields of corn and pumpkins , orchards bending with fruit and cozy farm-houses . Blue peaks stoo ( l up around the horizon ; and a clear sky at last vaulted as bright a world and as happy a day as ever the sun shone on . The little girl sat close beside me with her patch-work , and mingled her musical babble with her womanly ways and serious pleasure . And thus we floated slowly and idly through a charming country , while watching the various operations of locking and weighing the boat , and other peculiar scenes of canal life . As we advanced , the country became still fuller of human interests . The sound of flails floated over the banks , the hum of villages grew louder and more frequent . Then the smoky breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce ! Here I launched again , bade good-bye to my kind hosts , and regretfully ran my last course down to Albany . In that quiet scene , where man and his unromantic life of labor have whitewashed nature , the rush , the roar of the rapids , and the isolation of the wilderness , all seemed a dream . I had run the rapids in an egg-shell , as it were . But now it was not without apprehension that I confided myself to a smoking , steaming palace to go on down the river . I had to see the Allegro ignominiously swung up to beams , above the reach of curious passers , and descend from my halcyon life to the humdrums of existence . Wondering men looked up at her and speculated on her voyage , and praised her beauty . I thought : " You admire only her comely form ; but I love her lightsome mastery over waves , her free runs with the wind , her confiding* intimacy with sea or lake , river or torrent , and with all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her stanch friendship tried in flood and field , by night and by day .
