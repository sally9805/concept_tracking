txt Wesley Van Zandt , a young man who was arrested last night and taken to Janesville to-day , has become notorious throughout several States for the large number of wives he possesses . Although only 30 years old he is known to have six wives living , and he has not been divorced from any of them . His last victim is the daughter of Ira Jones , a wealthy farmer near Waupaca . He represented himself as a stock buyer , and made his headquarters at Mr. Jones 's house , ingratiating himself into the affections of the lady members of the household . Miss Jones , a. bright girl of 18 , had just returned from school , and he soon won her affections . While she was in Milwaukee with a party of frieuds he came here and they were secretly married . The girl 's father , at first very angry , finally concluded to make the best of it , and was preparing to give them a farm . But just at this time the officers came down on young Van Zandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw their man in a buggy starting out for a. drive . One of them seized the horse by the bridle and the other attempted to arrest Van Zandt , but the latter put the whip to the horse  --  which knocked one officer down  --  and made a dash for liberty . The officers gained on him so rapidly that he left his horse and took to the woods , where , after a long chase , he eluded his pursuers . He evidently remained in the neighborhood several days , and managed to get word to his wife , who joined him , and they left the country by driving across to Wautoma . His wife , however , soon found that her husband was a villain , and wrote home for money , so that she could return . The officers thus obtained a clue to his whereabouts , and he was arrested . He has been identified as a man who forged Government postal orders in Indiana two years ago , and is believed to have participated in the recent Ashland Bank robbery . - Van Zandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year past has been in Kenosha , where his father now lives .

Had he been caught by the people of Magnolia , who were very much incensed , he would have been roughly handled . He went to Marengo , Ill. , and lived with his wife until September . He is said to have abused her shamefully . When he deserted her he did probably one of the boldest thing I ever heard of . From Morris , Ill. , he wrote a letter to her parents , using mourning paper and envelope , and stating that his wife had died , inclosing a newspaper with a death notice which he had inserted . " One day in June last , " continued the Marshal , " Miss Barrett , or rather Mrs. Erwin , returned to her parents ' home near Janesville . Imagine the surprise of her relatives and friends , who for two months had thought her dead .

" Van Zandt had no visible means of support , and his living was made by his swindling people by various schemes . His brother was also arrested for forgery on Wednesday , and is now in the Janesville Jail .
