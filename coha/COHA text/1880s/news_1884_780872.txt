txt The selection of a minister by the Mennonites , who worship at Weaverland , East Earl Township , this county , a few days ago , was an occasion that excited much interest in the neighborhood , and as early as daybreak the roads leading to the church at Weaverland were filled with carriages moving slowly through the deep mud . By 8 o'clock 300 vehicles were standing about the plain edifice and 1,200 men and women were packed inside . There were 20 candidates for the ministry , all of whom were assembled in the church . The preliminary religious services in German and English were conducted by the Rev. Christian Bombeyer , Bishop Baby , and Bishop Shenk , and a dozen other reverend gentlemen made appropriate remarks . At the conclusion of Bishop Shenk 's sermon , the Rev. Messrs . Landis , Hartzler , and Buckwaiter took 20 books , with clasps exactly alike , to an ante-room , where they put in one of the books a slip of paper containing the words " Ein Diener des Wort . " The books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row on the table . Each one of the candidates selected a book and retired to his seat . Bishop Martin arose and a solemn hush fell upon the great congregation . He approached the candidates and opened the books one after the other , until he reached the eleventh man in line , from whose book , when opened , fell the slip that bore the words giving him the title of a minister of the Gospel . The man who held the book was Menno Zimmerman , of Earl Township , ' who is 30 years old . The ceremony of opening the books lasted 15 minutes , and during that time the scene was impressive , men and women weeping aloud all over the church . The candidates showed evidence of intense excitement , all but Zimmerman , who was apparently cool and less concerned than any in the great crowd in the church .
