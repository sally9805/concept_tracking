txt The attempt to set fire to a tenement house in Canal-street night before last was almost as singular as it was dastardly . The incendiary had laid his plans with great care , and if they had succeeded every clue to his authorship of the crime would have been destroyed . That the lives of forty or fifty people against whom he can have had no grudge would also have been destroyed is a detail upon which the criminal seems to have bestowed no attention whatever . The cynical indifference with which the incendiary contemplated this possibility , which of course must have occurred to him , is . the frightful feature of his crime . It is the same element which makes so horrible the crimes of train wreckers and agitators by dynamite . It exhibits what the statute of this State calls " a depraved mind , regardless of human life . " When death is the result of this disposition the statute rightly imposes the penalty of murder , even though the wretch may not have had the express intention of killing anybody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the lives of people , .. are deliberately endangered should not be much more seriously punished than it is under our law , even when the lives do not happen to be taken . A ' man who has attempted to explode a cartridge of dynamite among a crowd of people , or to wreck a train , or to burn up a tenement house for the sake of collecting the insurance on his own chattels contained therein , is obviously a person whose existence is a continual menace to his neighbors . The statutes relating to such crimes as these take altogether too exclusive a cognizance of results . It would be no more certain if the fire in Canal-street had burned according to the plans of the man who set it than it is now that that man could not , with due regard to the public safety , be suffered to go at large . So far as the protection of sc ( ciety is concerned it is as necessary to punish him as if his crime had been completed by the burning of the building with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel penalty for society to inflict in such a case , but simply an obvious precaution for society to take . Several circumstances combine to point out the Italian barber who occupied the room in which the fire broke out as the incendiary . The most nearly conclusive of these perhaps is the disappearance of the suspected man . It is only fair to say , however , that the crime is one not at all characteristically Italian . Our Ital- ian residents commit considerably more than their numerical proportion of violent crimes . The crimes , however , by which they swell the records are the results of sudden passion . They are crimes following quarrels or proceeding from jealousy or spite . They are not as a rule mercenary crimes . To burn down a building full of innocent people as a means to the end of swindling an insurance company is an offense for the like of which we believe no Italian has thus far been arraigned in our courts . If it turns out that the Italian barber is really the incendiary , the nature of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country than to his nationality .
