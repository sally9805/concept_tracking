I forgot to give you the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western first mortgage bonds in the Chemical Bank . Put them in at two millions ; and unencumbered real estate  --  say five millions . Musgrave . Musgrave Yes , sir . ( Speaking aside as he proceeds . ) I 'm certain there 's another great operation under weigh . I wonder if it is the Henrietta Mining and Land Company . But , Lord bless me , I know about as much of what old Nicholas Vanalstyne is doing as the body-servant of a general does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds . Musgrave goes to it , putting the tube to his ear . ) Hello ! ( listens , and then speaks into telephone ) . The order was for five thousand shares at one forty-seven and an eighth . What ?

Kindly tell the servant to show Dr. Wainwright directly to this room when he calls . Musgrave . Musgrave Yes , sir . Trifles ! In over thirty years I have laid by a little more than six thousand dollars by rigid economy , and the Vanalstynes made half a million by one little turn in the market last Friday . ( Exit into apartment door . ) Van. , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . What 's this ? ( Suddenly looking at a letter . ) Gertrude 's handwriting ! Addressed to my real name !  --  and here ! ( Breaks it open , and reads . ) " This letter will surprise you ; but not so much , nor so terribly , as it surprised me , to learn , for the first time , to-night , your true name ; and  --  I can hardly write the words  --  the fact  --  that you  --  have  --  a  --  wife ! I have been your wife , and I am the mother of your child ; the blessing of Heaven upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the curse of Heaven was hanging over me so darkly !

( Enter Musgrave up l. c . ) Musgrave . Musgrave I have finished the inventory , sir , and struck the balance . ( Giving him paper . ) Van. , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr. ( taking it ) . Musgrave , tell Watson Flint &; Co. to buy me an option . ( Musgrave makes notes )  --  Chicago , Santa F and California  --  buy three  --  at current rates  --  five thousand shares . ( Nicholas Vanalstyne appears above the screen r. c. a. , New York Herald in his hand . ) Vanalstyne . Nicholas Vanalstyne Here , here , what the devil are you doing that for ?

( Musgrave crosses , folds screen , and places it behind desk . ) Vanalstyne . Nicholas Vanalstyne But that 's gambling , my son . Sell an option on Nebraska and Montana ; I 'm going to water that stock to-morrow . Never gamble , my son ; it is n't right . Squeeze the shorts , that 's business . While you 're about it , I may as well have a little fun with the boys on the street myself . Make it ten thousand for each of us , Musgrave . Musgrave . Musgrave Yes , sir ! ( Exit up l. , closing door . ) Vanalstyne . Nic holas Vanalstyne I see by the paper this morning that the Wall Street lambs are buying Nebraska and Montana very freely . ( Returns and sits at desk . Reads . ) " Nicholas Vanalstyne , the greatest operator now in the street , says that it is only a question of time when this stock will be a sure dividend at eight per cent . " Did I say time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity . ( Reads . ) " The room-traders , who threw over Louisville and Nashville , were completely fooled by the fact that ' old Nick ' Vanalstyne had been telling them the honest truth . " The boys on the Stock Exchange will never understand the strictly truthful principles on which I conduct my business affairs . I never made a big haul yet , except by telling the honest truth . I only lie between times . " Truth crushed to earth will rise again . " I know exactly when to let her rise ; that 's all . When I 'm lying , I let ' em rob each other . The plaintive wail that goes up from Wall Street , whenever I corner it , is a touching tribute to the sincerity of my character . " Damn old Vanalstyne !  --  he 's been telling us the truth again . " Van. , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . Here is the inventory of our securities , available and unavailable . ( Rises and exits to Old Nick at desk r. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N icholas Vanalstyne Ah ! ( taking it , r . ) . Hello ! Forty-eight millions already out as collaterals ; balance available only twenty-two millions . My son . ( Turns in chair , and looks at Young Nick . ) Some other big fish is swimming in these waters , and there are n't any signs of where he is yet . Some great operator is going against us in this Henrietta mine deal . I have felt his hand at every move in the game , but I ca n't see him . He 's working in the dark . I did think it was my old enemy , John Van Brunt ; but our lawyers have got him in Chancery . Whoever it is , we 've got to move very carefully ; my balance to work on is getting narrow . I got this infernal Henrietta mine on a three-hundred-dollar bluff , in a friendly game of poker . I incorporated the game  --  I mean the mine  --  for twenty millions capital ; bought the whole town , including two newspapers and an opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , not to mention the branch lines and a steamship company , to say nothing of six million acres of public land grants . The Henrietta Railway and Mining Company now pervades and ramifies the entire country  --  from Ohio to California . It has become the financial focus of the solar system . I only had ace , high and a Jack ; drew to a bob-tail flush ; fifty-cent ante . Van. , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . A few of these letters need your personal attention . ( Crosses to his father , giving him letters . Old Nick takes the letters , looking them over .

( Vanalstyne , Jr. , makes notes . ) " Buy six more country members , and charge to my account . " ( Looks at another letter . ) Schauspil , the art dealer , has a new painting by Meissonier . Write to him for me , Nick . Tell him I 'll give him thirty dollars a square inch . There 's six per cent . in Meissonier at that ; no sounder stock in the market . Van. , Jr .

( Musgrave comes c. with writing-pad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vanalstyne , Jr . ) How much did we make out of him on the last deal ? Van. , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . About ninety thousand . Van . Nicholas Vanalstyne I see the poor devil died yesterday . We 'll make that good to his widow . Musgrave . Musgrave Yes , sir ; I 'll remind you of it . A telegram just come , sir . ( Gives Vanalstyne a telegram and sits at desk up c. , making a note . ) Van . Nicholas Vanalstyne A cable from your sister Mary in London .

But how the deuce did he learn anything about the Henrietta Mine ? We must let him in for a few thousands . If we do n't , he 'll give us away to the whole congregation ; and the leading pillars of our church are also pillars of the Stock Exchange . ( Turns half to Musgrave . ) Write to the Rev. Dr. Murray Hilton . ( Dictates . ) " Will meet you at Friday evening prayers . " ( Pause . ) That 'll do , Musgrave . ( Turns to desk . Exit Musgrave to apartments l. c. , closing door . ) Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . By the way , Governor , Mrs. Cornelia Opdyke  --  Vanalstyne . Nicholas Vanalstyne Mrs. Opdyke !

I control that railroad absolutely , and I 'm going to freeze out the parson . This is a little flyer on my own account . Let her have the stock . I am buying an option . The Reverend Dr. Murray Hilton thinks he 's got the inside track by having the widow 's soul in charge ; but if I can get control of her fortune , his chances of securing her person are not flattering . ( Goes to desk r . ) It may cost me a million dollars ; but I 'll get that ( smacks lips ) widow . ( Sits r. at desk . ) Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . Well , my dear father  --  ( laughing slightly )  --  as I said before , I have n't the slightest objection to a young and pretty stepmother .

( Vanalstyne , Jr. , glances at him suddenly . ) You start at his name . Let me feel your pulse . ( Crosses to Young Nick , l . Takes his wrist . ) You have another Wall Street operation on hand . Your pulse has n't been twice alike , two days in succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You New York business men have invited Death into your own houses . The telephone and the stock indicator have enabled His Sable Majesty to move up town with the rest of the fashionable world ; he used to content himself with wearing out your souls and bodies at your offices . Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . I think you attribute my trouble to the wrong source , Doctor . My father , for instance ; he is the largest operator in the street , but he is always in perfect health . Wainwright . Dr. Parke Wainwright Your father was bred in the county . His nerves were as firm and as cold as steel before he ever came to the city . These Leviathans of the Money Market all come from quieter scenes of labor in their youth . Wall Street has never yet bred its own giants . The furnace-bred young men of New York are pigmies in the hands of such men ; mere bundles of nerve , that burn themselves like the overcharged wires of a battery . Notice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them fizzles convulsively and goes out . Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . I understand . Do you think that I am in any real danger ? Wainwright . Dr. Parke Wainwright You are doing what hundreds of young men are doing in this city to-day : Wearing your life out in the greatest gambling hell on earth . There is death in the street . Monaco is nothing . The gains and losses are settled every day . You dream on your chances night and day for weeks . Fighting the tiger !  --  bulls and bears are much fiercer animals ; the tiger is an angel of mercy . Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . I shall take the rest I need as soon as I can find time . Wainwright . Dr. Parke Wainwright You 'll find plenty of time for rest if you wait in the grave . Epitaph for a New York man : " He has retired from business . " ( Crosses to Young Nick at desk and stands at back of chair . ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that pertains neither to your health nor to my own profession  --  except in an accidental way . I was called to the bedside of a very sick woman last night . She was in a high fever and delirious . This morning she became conscious , though still very weak . Her name is Gertrude Reynolds . Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . Gertrude Reynolds ! Well ! Wainwright . Dr. Parke Wainwright What I heard during her delirium and what she said to me afterwards is a professional confidence , and yet I  --  I  --  Vanalstyne , Jr . Nicholas Vanalstyne , Jr . I will relieve your embarrassment . ( Turns and looks up at Doctor . ) Gertrude Reynolds has discovered my real name , and the fact that I am a married man ; she has letters in my handwriting , and she threatens to send those letters to my wife . Wainwright . Dr. Parke Wainwright You have heard from her yourself . All I intended , all I could have done , was to put you on your guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this woman . That , of course , is your own affair and hers . But your wife loves you , Vanalstyne , with her whole heart ; I know how deeply she loves you . Gertrude Reynolds is bitter , beyond all reason and control . I can hardly blame her , for she is herself a mother . But what she threatens to do would be a crime against a sincere and devoted woman . If anything can be done to protect your wife from the ruin of her domestic happiness , I shall assist you to the utmost of my ability . ( Crosses to c. and goes to mantel , r . Agnes runs in suddenly , r. c . ) Agnes ! Agnes . A gnes Doctor Wainwright ! H  --  s  --  h ! ( Putting her finger to her lips , then aside . ) I was caught that time . Bertie saw me .

Agnes When I first ran into your room the other morning , to put the rosebuds on your table , I  --  I did n't intend to look at anything ; but I  --  I could n't help just  --  just glancing around , you know . There was a whole row of pictures on your mantelpiece , and  --  and others all over the room . They were pictures of actresses  --  and  --  and dancers , Bertie , dear . Bertie .

Bertie Vanalstyne Henrietta is the most famous ballet-dancer in New York . All of us have her picture . We get them from the photographer for fifty cents apiece , but we have to pay her business manager five dollars apiece for her autograph . I suppose it 's cheap enough , for no two of ' em are alike . Agnes Agnes ( com es l. of chair ) . Have you ever seen Henrietta off the stage ? Bertie . Bertie Vanalstyne Often .

Agnes ( long pause ; she looks around cautiously , as if making up her mind , then suddenly kisses him on top of his head ) . Thank you . Bertie . Bertie Vanalstyne Welcome . Agnes . Agnes Now , there 's one thing more I want to speak about . I 'm to be your wife , you know , and I can talk seriously to you . Your father is very angry with you because you wo n't give your attention to business . Bertie . Bertie Vanalstyne I know he is . He left word for me last night to meet him in this room as soon as I got up . Father says that I do n't know any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A kitten that is n't more familiar with business principles than I am would starve . Agnes . Agnes Business is very easy , Bertie .

You may do what you please with it ; but it ought to last long enough for you to establish yourself in a decent position where you can make your own living . Beyond this , sir , you shall have no part or parcel of my property either while I am living or after my death . Bertie . Bertie Vanalstyne Father !  --  I  --  ( half choking )  --  I 'm sure I 'm  --  I 'm  --  very grateful to you  --  for  --  for giving me anything ; and for  --  for  --  all you 've given me before .
