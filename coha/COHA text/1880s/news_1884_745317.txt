txt The dullness in the House of Representatives may give way to-morrow , or at least before many days , to a bitter party dismission , which will be provoked , probably , by a proposition to appoint a select . committte to suggest some remedy for abating the abuse of the " leave to nrint " which has grown up in Congress . At the close of the last session , Mr. J. D. Taylor . of Ohio , appears to have made a speed on the Mexican Pension bill , which was , in fact , a speech iecorporated in the Record on a leave to print , the only remarks made in the House occupying only a column of the Record , while the full speech fills three pages . In the printed speech Mr. Taylor lays upon the Democrats as a whole , and upon Mr. A. J. Warner in particular , the blame for the failure of various pension measures , and especially of the Mexican Pension bill . Mr. Taylor referred to the charge made by Democratic newspapers that the Democratic House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Taylor undertook to explain this , saying that the House passed , early in the session , a large number of special acts pensioning soldiers , which were sent to the Senate and remained there a long time without being acted on by the Senate . The Committee on Pensions in the Senate was composed of nine Senators , five of whom were Republicans , and four were Democrats . For a long time Senator Sabin , of Minnesota . was absent , and this left the Pension Committee four and four . " The Record , " said he , " will show the absence of Senator Sabin and the further fact that during his absence pension bills were reported adversely by the Democratic sub-committees and that no progress was made in passing pension bills . This hitch in pension legislation was removed by the resignation of Senator Sabin , who was still absent , and the appointment of Senator Wilson , of Iowa , in his place on the Pension Committee , since which time every pension bill that could be reached . including those reported upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate . The Senate has not only passed these bills , but it spent several weeks in maturing the bill now before this House , which provides not only for Union soldiers , their widows and orphans , but for Mexican soldiers and their dependents as well . " . Bot Mr. Taylor was not content to stop here ; he pitched into Gen. Warner for having opposed the Mexican Pension bill on its merits , and said : " On behalf of the soldiers of the Union army . and on behalf of their helpless widows and children , who have so earnestly appealed to us for relief , I want to enter my protest against the action of his committee . He is the Chairman of the Select Committee on Payment of Pensions . Bounty , and Back Pay . to which was referred the most important legislation of this session , touching the soldiers and their dependents , and I regret to say that this committee has proved the graveyard of all this important legislation . It never reported but one bill , and this was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Warner , it is said , is excited about these statements , and has aroused some feeling among his friends , who have agreed that in order to force gentlemen to say what they wish to say in the open House it will be necessary to revise the rulers permitting the printing of remarks not delivered .
