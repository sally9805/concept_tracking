txt Gen. B. F. Butler was beaten to-day in the suit brought against him by the National Soldiers ' Home , the jury after being out 40 minutes bringing in a verdict against the General for $113,537 50 , the amount which it is claimed was not accounted for when he ceased to be Treasurer of the Home , with interest . Gen. Butler opened his defense this morning by giving a description of the method of government of the Home and the system of auditing accounts , claiming that his accounts as Treauerer were audited and approved by the proper authorities . He told how this $15.000 , the sum at issue , was sent to Gen. Tilton and the purposes for which it was to be used , and said : " It was the policy of the Government to allow such of the inmates of the various branches of the Home as could work to do so , and means for so doing were provided at Togas by the establishment of a shoe shop . The use of $15,000 for this purpose having been authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to Gen. Tilton , and credited by him to the ' shoe shop account , ' which was not the correct way to enter it , as Mr. Carney , the expert accountant who had charge of the books , notified him . It should have been credited to the general aeccount of the Home . However , it had been accounted for by two drafts amounting to $15,000 , given by the firm of Pitkin &; Thomas , who had purchased shoes from the Togas shop . He had no intimation that anything was wrong until 1882 , and he could not understand now how this $15,000 could be charged against him . Still , if the jury should find him liable for the money he should pay it . He should still claim a set-off for the amount due for his services as Treasurer . His original intention was to render these services gratuitously and make no charge to his fellowsoldiers for disbursing the millions that passed through his hands , but after Congress took charge of the Home and assumed the responsibility of its management he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and he should therefore have no hesitation in charging the Government for his services . " Gen. Butler called but one witness , and even this led to a spat between the General andJudge Carpenter , the Judge explaining that if Gen. Butler proved all that he offered to prove in his opening argument it would constitute no defense , and he would so instruct the jury . The General offered to prove that he had paid over to the Home every dollar that came into his hands , and Judge Carpenter ruled that such evideuce was irrelevant and could not be admitted . Gen. Butler took exception and rested his ease . The court then instructed the ; MIT , if they believed the evidence , to find a verdict for the plaintiff for $15,000 and interest from March , 1885 . There was no doubt from the evidence that Gen. Butler had failed to account for $15,000 in his accounts . It was another question whether he was bound to account for the money . It was too complicated a question for the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved in favor of the plaintiff and against " Mr. Butler , " " as I understand that distinguished soldier prefers to be called in court . Let the jury distinctly understand , however , that nothing has been preseuted iu this case which in the slightest degree reflects on the integrity of Mr. Butler or any one else . " The case will now go to the United States Supreme Court on Gen. Butler 's exceptions . After the verdict had been announced Gen. Butler said to some of the bystanders " I 'll bet $5,000 that that verdict will not stand when the case . gets before the United States Supreme Court . I have practiced law for 46 years and know a little something about it . "
