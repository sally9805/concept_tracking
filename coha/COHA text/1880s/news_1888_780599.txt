txt The Democratic Convention completed its work to-day by nominating Allen G. Thurman to be VicePresident , and by adopting a platform which places the party squarely abreast of President Cleveland and . the Ways and Means Committee in the fight for tariff reform . The little group of obstructionists - who had conspired to rob the President and the Democratic majority in the House of the hearty support to which they were entitled and which the party desired to give were beaten last . night at the closing session of the Resolutions Committee and the opening sentence of the platform , when read from tho desk this morning , revealed to everybody their defeat . The platform had . been prepared with especial reference to the prominence and importance of the tariff issue . No long preamble was permitted to try the patience aif the hundreds of delegates who longed to hear from the official report a confirmation of unofficial statements as to the nature of the committee 's decision . At the very beginning , the President 's message was indorsed and . declared- to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the makers of the Mills bill was commended . The cheers with which Mr. Watterson was greeted showed clearly , but not for the first time , the attitude of Ohe convention toward the policy in behalf of which he and his faithful allies in the committee had fought for 20 hours . The hearty and . long-continued. applause which the phrases relating to the message and the bill called forth was not less significant . It will be seen that while the declarations which had been stubbornly opposed . by the " combine " in committee are set forth at the beginning of the platform . the principles there approved are afterward stated at greater length . When the later paragraphs were reached the applause was renewed . " Judged by Democratic principles , " the committee says , " the interests of the people are betrayed when , by unnecessary taxation , trusts and combinations are permitted to exist which , while unduly enriching the few who combine , rob the body of our citizens by depriving them of the benefits of natural competition . " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . prsased to hie place in the New-York delegation Mr. Edward Cooper , the leading member of one of the seven firms or companies which have combined during the last two or three years to exact a fixed high price for iron and steel beams and the only delegate to this convention *whose name is recorded in opposition to the tariff declarations of the platform . Mr. Cooper procured this solitary prominence by means of an announcement made by the Chairman later in the day . Mr. Watterson informed the convention that the ' pLatform had been adopted . by the unanimous vote of the committee . When he moved its adoption by the convention there was not a whisper in the negative ; but after the supplementary resolutions had been passed the Chairman told the convention that the assertion as to the unanimity of the committee was incorrect , because Mr. Cooper , the member of the committee from New-York. dissented as to a part of the platform which had been read and accepted . The short speech made by Mr. Watterson immediately after the report of the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates seemed to catch easily the meaning of his jocular reference to the contest between himself and Mr. Gorman in committee , and everybody was in good humor when the Maryland Senator came forward with smiling face to explain that the platform was in strict accord with those which had preceded it , and was one on which every Democrat could stand . Mr. Gorman knows when he has been beaten , and is wise enough not to exhibit the wounds received in battle . When the additional resolution urging the early passage of the Mills bill was read . the applause was even greater and more demonstrative than when the opening phrases of the platform were heard . As in the first case so in this , there was no negative vote . The resolution relating to home rule for Ireland was passed with enthusiasm and without dissent . There may have been in the hall some credulous persons who had heard and given weight to foolish rumors on Wednesday night about promising schemes for the defeat of Mr. Thurman , the nomination of Gray , or the selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of these came to the session of to-day in doubt as to the name which should complete the ticket . the little banners waving from the standards of almost all of the State delegations must speedily have shown them what was soon to take place . Duplicates of the bandana with which the veteran Democrat of Ohio was wont to emphasize his arguments in the Senate and on the stump were seen in all parts of the crowded auditorium . From the Indiana standard still hung the Gray streamer which marked devotion to a lost cause , but it was only a symbol . Some of the speeches by which candidates were nominated were very tiresome . Few candidates have been more unfortunate in a leading champion than was Thurman . When Tarpey of California was chosen to present Thurman 's name his shortcomings encouraged frequent interruptions from the friends of Gray , who were suspiciously numerous in the galleries . Raines spoke with considerable force for Thurman . Voorhees pleaded . in behalf of Gray that Ohio was already lost ; and that the party could not win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did all that could have been done for Black , but really gave up the fight when he read Black 's telegram . As time passed ou and . the list of speakers was prolonged the audionce became impatient for a vote , and the remarks of several ambitious but unattractive speakers were unceremoniously cut short . The first State was called at 1:35 P. M. The first 13 States , in alphabetical order , gave Thurman 133 , Gray 90 , and Black 27 . As the call proceeded votes for Gray or Black were rarely given . The States hastened to the support of the man who must win . When the last of them was reached , a red handkerchief was tied above the ' gray on the standard of Indiana , and : all the standards were grouped over the ' ' heads of the New-York delegation . The : vote was 684 for Thurman , 105 for Gray , - 81 for Black . Black was withdrawn . Colorado went over to Thurman and the one dissenter in Ohio was converted . Gray was then withdrawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously . The vacant place on the ticket had been filled . This conveliti on has been marked throughout by good order . If there have been acrimonious discussions they have been concealed in the rooms of the Committee on Resolutions . So far as the : nomination of Cleveland was concerned the convention was held simply to ratify the practically unanimous chdice of the party 's rank and file . With this greatest of party problems solved in advance one could not expect those very demonstrative expressions of enthusiasm and loyalty which are made when the forces of two or more great political leaders contend for the prize . Still , it is true that whenever . the President has been named , the delegates have responded heartily , and in one or two instances their applause hasbeen all that the followers of the most popular of unelected candidates could desire . There has been no lack of praise for the man and his nerve in the speeches that have been made . Delegates have untiringly eulogized him for his courage , his honesty , and the cleanliness of his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of it may have been suggested by the exigencies of politics , but these considerations are the consolation of the cynic . The contest for the second place has been carried on without resort to discreditable methods . The friends of Gray appear to have used . against Thurman no arguments except those which were based upon his advanced age and physical infirmities . On the other hand Gov . Gray can not complain of any personal attacks upon himself except , perhaps , in one instance . The bitterest remarks which have been published concerning these two . candidates are those which were printed here to-day in the leading Democratic papers as coming from Mr. Barnum . Possibly the usually genial Chairman of the National Committee had been soured tem-porarily by the result of the platform con-test . He is reported  --  and the interview is one of considerable length  --  to have said that he was opposed to the renomination of dead men , but even a dead man on the ticket would be preferable to Gray , because in his opinion Gray has not sufficient ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attributed to Mr. Barnum , and the reporter permits him to repeat his arguments , against adding to the tariff platform of 1884 any commendation of the message or the Mills bill . According to this interview Mr. Barnum has discovered some great Vice-Presidential qualities in the Hon. Don M. Dickinson . Mr. Barnum will be remembered as one of the gentlemen who advocated the renomination of a President while honvas unwilling that the party should commend or even mention in its campaign platform that President 's avowed policy as to the greatest issue before the country . It is a curious idea that a party can gain more votes for its Presidential candidate by formally discrediting his policy or by pointing out that this policy is a dangerous one than by making that policy its own . Now that harmony has been reached . with reference to the tariff resolutions , no member of the committee desires to tell the story of the committee 's tribulations . There have been attempts to discipline faithless members , especially North of Nebraska and O'Day of Missouri , both of whom were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as by very positiveplatforms , but these will in all probability be pursued no longer . Mr. O'Day , a well-known railroad man . asserts that he was told that the President desired that Gorman should be elected Chairman ; that there was submitted to him a platform said to have been prepared by Scott and Cooper , with the approval of the President ; and that upon the understanding that Gorman would permit a , platformsupporting the message to be made if he should be selected . Senator Vest advised him to vote for Gorman . Senator Vest has been interviewed , and the statements of the - two gentlemen do not exactly coincide . But a resolution of the Missouri delegation censuring Mr. O'Day has been laid on the table . The facts are that the obstructionists , by sharp practice . secured in the committee votes from several States which were opposed to them , and that their defeat-was caused by the application efirreasistible pressure from delegations as soon as the real condition of affairs was understood , and by the threats of tariff-reform members that the dispute should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expert manipulators , and their opponents were trustful and drowsy for a time . That an apparently representative committee could vote to ignore the message and the Mills bill was a thought that had not entered the heads of a majority of the delegates . With regard to what the platform says about civilnervice reform , a member of the committee , who proposes to be an advocate of the reform , remarks that it would be possible to treat satisfactorily more ' , than one great issue at a elms : The tariff overshadowed ail other subjects and the tariff reformers had . their hands full without taking up the other matter . It may be added that practically nothing has been said in the hotels and delegation rooms about reform in the civil service . If the interest of delegates in the subject is to be measured by the attention devoted to it in convention , that interest is scarcely perceptible or has been temporarily obscured by other matters which appear to them to be of great and pressing impartance.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
