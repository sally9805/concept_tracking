txt A bill is now , before the Assembly which is of no light interest to the citizens of the State . New-York , among all the States of the Union , has had the great good . fortune of a natural nark and game preserve . Following the enlightened example of California and the United States Government . it has in effect set aside a mountainous district in this State to be a people 's park , sanitarium , and game preserve for future . generations . This and similar legislation in this country have excited great attention throughout the world . It is an intelligent effort to give to the common people what has hitherto been the luxury of the rich and the noble . Even as the Princes and gentry of other countries have their game preserves and . magnificent parks , so the splendid Sequoias Park in. the ? Sierras and the marvelous Yellowstone Caton and the Adirondack Mountains are to be reserved . for the health and enjoyment of the American masses during all coming years . There was a peculiar fitness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that in the most ancient fossil ages the first land in America which arose above the primeval ocean was the Laurentian range , and that the peaks of the Adirondacks , which now give such pleasure to the tourist and the hunter , were the first projections above the waters . A district of country , perhaps a hundred miles in length by seventy-five in breadth , was an island then , and , in the midst of our civilization , is an island still . Railroads have gone around it , and not cut through it ; canals have not touched it , towns have not been built in it , and . scarcely a good road constructed through it . It seems to have been left by Providence as a sanitarium and game preserve . The air is of singular salubrity there , game is still found in considerable quantities , and the whole is fitted in its health and beauty to be an unequaled pleasure ground for the masses . This wonderful blessing to the people of New-York is now threatened with a new danger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwood trees of the " forest primeval " have escaped destruction because of the difficulty of conveying them to market . Now , however , the lumbermen are penetrating the solitudes of those ancient forests with railroads , which will convey tourists in the Summer and lumber in the Winter . Everywhere the forests will be desolated before them , the underbrush is burnt by the locomotive sparks , . and the trees are ruthlessly cut wherever the logs can be conveyed to the rail . The beauty of this unequaled pleasure ground is being destroyed , and game flees away before this invasion . Already the Chateaugay Railroad Company has extended its line past Loon Lake to Saranac Lake , the heart of the wilderness . It expects , during the coming Summer , to extend its construction to the solitary shores of Lake Placid , the crown and jewel of the whole region . The shores of that beautiful lake have only been preserved from the lumberers by a syndicate of the landowners . The Schenectady and Ogdensburg Railroad Company proposes to build another line this Summer directly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Adirondack Railroad has almost reached . PAUL SMITH 'S on . the north , and . another road from Carthage and Jefferson County will soon cut into the forest in St. Lawrence County . It will be seen that work such as this will soon make the Adirondack pleasure ground , a thing of the past . There is only one way to meet this danger , and that is through such an act as is now before the Assembly in Albany . The State is fortunate enough to own lands directly over the lines of most of these proposed roads . This act , introduced by Mr. FLA. = and approved by all our authorities on forestry , simply forbids all railroad companies from constructing or operating any part of their lines across lands owned by the State within the New York forest preserve . If this law be lost in committee , or do not pass both houses , the coming Summer will find the lovely solitudes on the banks of the Saranac Lakes , the Tuppers , Racquet Lake , and the Fulton chain invaded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lovers of the Adirondacks , if they would save this beautiful region for the people , must strike now while this bill is before the Legislature .
