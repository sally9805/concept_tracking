annual message of President Lincoln at the open * ing of Congress in Desubjects of importanceI cember , 1861 , treated many foreign relations , the condition the finances , a reorganization of the Supreme Court , questions of military administration , the building of a military railroad through Kentucky to east Tennessee , the newly organized Territories , a review of military progress towards the suppression of rebellion . It contained also a vigorous practical discussion of the relations between capital and labor , which pointed out with singular force that " the insurrection is largely , if not exclusively , a war upon the first principle of popular government  --  the rights of the people . " In addition to these toplcs , it treated another question of greater importance than all of them , but for the present in so moderate a tone , and with such tentative suggestions , that it excited less immediate comment than any other . This was the question of slavery . It had not escaped Mr. Lincoln 's notice that the relations of slavery to the war were producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical changes of opinion . His revocation of Fr&amp; mont 's proclamation had momentarily checked the clamor of importunate agitators for military emancipation ; but he saw clearly enough that a deep , though as yet undefined , public hope clung to the vague suggestion that slavery and rebellion might perish together . As a significant symptom of this undercurrent of public feeling , there came to him in November a letter from George Bancroft , the veteran Democratic politician and national historian ; a man eminent not only for his writing upon the science of govern- 2 It will be remembered that in announcing editorially " Abraham Lincoln : A History , " November , i886 , it was stated as follows : When " tbe military portion of this history is reached in magazine publication , care will be taken to avoid as much as possible the repetition of details already given in THE CENTURy 'S war series , while fully presenting that part of the military narrative in which is explained the re ment , but who as a member of President Polk 's cabinet had rendered signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately presided at a meeting in New York called to collect contributions to aid the suffering loyalists of North Carolina . As it happened on all such occasions , the inflamed popular patriotism of the hour sprang forward to bold speech and radical argument . Even the moderate words of Mr. Bancroft on taking the chair reflected this reformatory spirit : If slavery and the Union are incompatible , listen to the words that come to you from the tomb of Andrew Jackson : " The Union must be preserved at all hazards . " . . . If any one claims the compromises of the Coi*stitutioi* , let him begin by placing the Constitution in power by respecting it and upholding it i In the letter transmitting these remarks and the resolutions of the meeting to Mr. Lincoln , Mr. Bancroft made a yet more emphatic suggestion . He wrote : Your administration has fallen upon times which will be remembered as long as human events find a record . I sincerely wish to you the glory of perfect success . Civil war is the instrument of Divine Providence to root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result , unless the consequences of the war shall effect an increase of free States . This is the universal expectation and hope of men of all parties.4 Such a letter , from a man having the learning , talent , and political standing of its author , is of itself historic ; but Mr. Lincoln 's reply gives it a special significance . November i8 , *86z , he wrote : I esteem it a high honor to have received a note from Mr. Bancroft , inclosing the report of proceedings of a New York meeting taking measures for the relief of Union people of North Carolina . I thank you and all others participating for this benevolent and patriotic movement . The main thought in the closing paragraph of your letter is one which does lation of the President to these events . " In order to avoid all possibility of misunderstanding , this statement is here repeated . It is expected that , with the excisions referred to , the work will extend through twelve or thirteen numbers more of the magazine. - EDITOR OF THE CENTURy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i86i. 4 Unpublished MS. 1 Copyright by J. G. Nicolay and John Hay , s886 . All rights reserved . // not escape my attention , and with which I must deal in all due caution , and with the best judgment I can bring to it. * This language gives us the exact condition of Mr. Lincoln 's mind on the subject of slavery at that time . He hoped and expected to effect an " increase of free States " through emancipation ; but we shall see that this emancipation was to come through the voluntary action of the States , and that he desired by this policy to render unnecessary the compulsory military enfranchisement which Fr&amp; mont had attempted and which his followers advocated . The prudent caution and good judgment which President Lincoln applied to the solution of this dangerous problem becomes manifest when we reexamine its treatment in his annual message mentioned above . Not referring directly to any general plan or hope of emancipation , he nevertheless approached the subject by discussing its immediate and practical necessities in phraseology which gave him limit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , not merely to quote the whole passage , but to emphasize the sentences which were plainly designed to lead Congress and the country to the contemplation of new and possible contingencies . Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled " An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary Purposes , " approved August 6 , i86i , the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited and numbers of the latter , thus liberated , are already dependent on the United States , and must be provided for in So/ne way . Besides this , it is not impossible th t some of the States will pass similar en ct ; nents for their own benefit respectively , and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal . In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States , according to some mode of valuation , in heit , pro ta ; zto , of direct taxes , or upon some other plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , on such acceptance by the General Government , be at once deemed free ; and that , in any event , steps be taken for colonifing both classes ( or the one first mentioned , if the other shall not be brought into existence ) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them . It might be well to consider , too , whether the free colored people already in the United States could not , so far as individuals may desire , be included in such colonization . The war continues . In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection , 1 have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle . I have , therefore , in every case , thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary 1 Unpublished MS. 2 " Congressional Globe , " Appendix , Dec. 3 , i86s. object of the contest on our part , leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents , instead of putting in force , by proclamation , the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports . So , also , obeying the dictates of prudence , as well as the obligations of law , instead of transcending , I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes . If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed , its propriety will be duly considered . The Union must be preserved ; and hence , all indispensable means must be eenployed . We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures , which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal , are indispensable.2 Apparently these propositions covered the ssmple recommendation of colonization , an old and familiar topic which had friends in both free and slave States ; but the language , when closely scanned , is full of novel suggestions : that the war has already freed many slaves ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will impartially consider any new law of Congress increasing emancipation for rebellion ; that he will not hastily adopt extreme and radical measures ; but that , finally to preserve the Union , all indispensable rnea ; zs must be employed . These declarations , an fact , cover the whole of his subsequent treatment of the slavery question . Congress was too busy with pressing practical legislation to find time for immediately elaborating by debate or enactment any of the recommendations thus made . It is not likely that the President expected early action from the national legislature , for he at once turned his own attention to certain initiatory efforts which he had probably carefully meditated . He believed that under the pressure of war necessities the border slave-States might be induced to take up the idea of voluntary emancipatiortif the General Government would pay their citizens the full property value of the slaves they were asked to liberate ; and this experiment seemed to him most feasible in the small State of Delaware , which retained only the merest fragment of a property interest in the peculiar institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bell , Lincoln , and Douglas , the electoral vote of Delaware had been cast for Breckinridge in the presidential election of s86o ; but more adroit party management had succeeded in effecting a fusion of the Bell and Lincoln vote for member of Congress , and George P. Fisher had been elected by a small majority . It is of little importance to know the exact shade of Mr. Fisher 's politics during the campaign : when the rebellion broke out he was an ardent Unionist , a steadfast friend of // Mr. Lincoln , and perhaps more liberal on the subject of slavery than any other border State representative . He entered readily into Mr. Lincoln 's views and plans , which were to induce the legislature of Delaware to pass an act of gradual emancipation of the 1798 slaves which it contained by the census of i86o , on condition that the United States would pay to Delaware , to be distributed among its slave owners in proper ratio , the sum of $400 for each slave , or a total of $719,200 . Mr. Lincoln during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafts of two separate bills embracing the principal details of the scheme . By the first , all negroes in Delaware above the age of thirty-five years should become free on the passage of the act ; all born after its passage should remain free ; and all others , after suitable apprenticeship for children , should become free in the year 1893 ; also , that the State should meanwhile prevent any of its slaves being sold into servitude elsewhere.1 The provisions of the second draft were slightly different . Lincoln 's manuscript explains : On reflection I like No. 2 the better . By it the nation would pay the State $23,200 per annum for thirty-one years . All born after the passage of the act would be born free . All slaves above the age of thirty-five years would become free on the passage of the act . All others would become free on arriving at the age of thirty-five years until January , 1893 , when all remaining of all ages would become free , subject to apprenticeship for minors born of slave mothers , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , Mr. Fisher undertook to propose and commend the scheme to his influential party friends in Delaware , and if possible to induce the legislature of that State to adopt it . One of the drafts prepared by Mr. Lincoln was rexvritten by the friends of the measure in Delaware , embodying the necessary details to give it proper force and local application to become a law of that State . In this shape it was printed and circulated among the members of the legislature , then holding a special session at Dover . The legislature of Delaware is not a large body ; nine members of the Senate and twenty-one members of the f-louse constituted the whole number . No record remains of the discussions , formal or informal , which the proposition called forth . The final action , however , indicates the sentiment which prevailed . The friends of emancipation probably ascertained that a hostile majority would 1 Unpublished MS. 2 Delaware Senate Journal , Special Session , i86i62. 3 " Congressional Globe , " March 6 , 1862 , p. 1102. vote it down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proslavery members , unwilling to lose the opportunity of airing their conservatism , immediately prepared a joint resolution reciting the bill at full length and then loading it with the strongest phrases of condemnation which their party zeal could invent . They said it would encourage the abolition element in Congress ; that it evinced a design to abolish slavery in the States ; that Congress had no right to appropriate a dollar for the purchase of slaves ; that they were unwilling to make Delaware guarantee the public faith of the United States ; that when the people of Delaware desired to abolish slavery within her borders they would do so in their own way ; and intimated that the " suggestions of saving expense to the people " were a bribe , which they scornfully repelled . A majority of the twentyone members of the House passed this joint resolution ; but when it came to the Senate , on the 7th of February , four of its nine members voted " aye , " four voted " no , " and one was silent or absent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 2 This seems to have closed the legislative record on the subject . Mr. Lincoln was doubtless disappointed at this failure to give his plan of compensated gradual abolishment a starting-point by the favorable action of the State of Delaware . But he did not abandon the project , and his next step was to bring it , through Congress , to the attention of the country and the States interested . On the 6th of March he sent to the Senate and the House of Representatives a special message , recommending the adoption of the following joint resolution : Resolved , That the United States ought to cooperate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery , giving to such State pecuniary aid , to be used*by such State in its discretion , to compensate for the inconveniences , public and private , produced by such change of system.3 His message explained that this was merely the proposal of practical measures which he hoped would follow . He said : The point is not that all the States tolerating slavery would very soon , if at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally made to all , the more northern shall , by such initiation , make it certain to the more southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy . I say " initiation " because , in my judgment , gradual , and not sudden , emancipation is better for all . . . . Such a proposition on the part of the General Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal authority to interfere with slavery within State limits , referring , as it does , the absolute control of the subject in each case to the // State and its people immediately interested . It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them . In the annual message last December , I thought fit to say , " The Union must be preserved ; and hence , all indispensable means must be employed . " I said this , not hastily , but deliberately . War has been made , and continues to be , an indispensable means to this end . A practical reacknowledgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would at once cease . If , however , resistance continues , the war must also continue and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it . Such as may seem indispensable , or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle , must and will come.1 To this pubhc recommendation he added some cogent reasons in private letters to influential persons . Thus , three days after his message , he wrote to the editor of " The New York Times " : I am grateful to the New York journals , and not less so to The Times " than to others , for their kind notices of the late special message to Congress . Your paper , however , intimates that the proposition , though well intentioned , must fail on the score of expense . I do hope you will reconsider this . Have you noticed the facts that less than one-half day 's cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware , at four hundred dollars per head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for all in Delaware , Maryland , District of Columbia , Kentucky , and Missouri at the same price ? Were those States to take the steps , do you doubt that it would shorten the war m'ore than eighty-seven days , and thus be an actual saving of expense ? Please look at these things , and consider whether there should not be another article in " The Times . " 2 So again , to Senator McDougall , who was opposing the scheme with considerable earnestness in the Senate , he wrote privately on March is : As to the expensiveness of the plan of gradual emancipation , with compensation , proposed in the late message , please allow me one or two brief suggestions . Less than one-half day 's cost of the war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware at four hundred dollars per head . Thus : All the slaves in Delaware by the census of ii6o are 1798 $100 cost of slaves $759,200 One day 's cost of the war : $2,000,000 Again , less than eighty-seven days ' cost of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in Delaware , Maryland , District of Columbia , Kentucky , and Missouri . Thus : Slaves in Delasvare 2,798 alaryland 87,188 District of columbia 3,181 Kentucky 225,490 Missouri 114,965 432,622 $400 Cost of slaves $173,048,800 Eighty-seven days ' cost of the war $174,000,000 Do you doubt that taking the initiatory steps on the part of those States and this District would shorten the war more than eighty-seven days , and thus be an actual saving of expense ? A word as to the time and manner of incurring the expense . Suppose , for instance , a State devises and adopts a system by which the institution absolutely ceases therein by a named day-say January m , 1882 . Then let the sum to be paid to such State by the United States be ascertained by taking from the census of m86o the number of slaves within the State , and multiplying that number by four hundredthe United States to pay such sums to the State in twenty equal annual installments , in six per cent . bonds of the United States . The sum thus given , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as onerous as would be an equal sum raised now for the indefinite prosecution of the war ; but of this you can judge as well as 1.2 It was between the dates of these letters that President Lincoln made the most important personal effort to secure favorable action on his project of gradual abolishment . At his request such members of Congress from the border slave-States of Delaware , Maryland , West Virginia , Kentucky , and Missouri as were present in Washington came in a body to the Executive Mansion on March io , where a somewhat lengthy interview and discussion of this subject ensued , the substance of which was authentically reported by them . In reading the account of the interview , it must be remembered that Lincoln was addressing the representatives of such slave States as had remained loyal , and his phrases respecting his attitude and intention towards slavery were not intended by him to apply to the States whose persistent rebellion had forfeited the consideration and rights which the others could justly claim . In explanation of his message the President recited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from army operations among loyal or partly loyal communities , and the irritating conflicts of opinion produced thereby in the Northern States . Disclaiming any intention to injure or wound the loyal slave States , and recognizing that the right of emancipation was exclusively under their own control , he had proposed this offer in good faith-not as a threat , but as the shortest and easiest way to end the war by eliminating its cause and motive . He did not ask an immediate answer , but pressed it upon their serious consideration , and hoped that after earnest conference and inquiry their views of duty and the interests of their constituents might enable them to accept it 1 " Congressional Globe , " March 6 , 8862 , page 1102. 2 Unpublished MS. // voluntarily and in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made.1 It is not to be wondered at that his auditors were unable to give him affirmative replies , or even remote encouragement . Representing slaveholding constituencies , their natural attitude was one of unyielding conservatism . Their whole tone was one of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had not failed to note that in his annual message of December * , and his special message of March 6 , he had announced his determination to use all " indispensable means " to preserve the Union , and had hinted that necessity might force him to employ extreme measures ; and one of them asked pointedly " if the President looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of this scheme . " His answer was frank and direct . Mr. Crisfield of Maryland writes : The President replied that he had no designs beyond the action of the States on this particular subject . He should lament their refusal to accept it , but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it . Unless he was expelled by the act of God or the Confederate armies , he should occupy that house for three years , and as long as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear , either for her institutions or her interests , on the points referred to.2 The day on which this interview was held , Roscoe Conkling introduced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had recommended in his message of the 6th , and debate on the subject was begun . The discussion developed a wide 1 An extended quotation from the abstract of the President 's remarks as written out by Mr. Crisfield , representative from Maryland , will be read with interest : " After the usual salutations and we were seated , the President said , in substance , that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation with us in explanation of his message of the 6th ; that since he had sent it in , several of the gentlemen then present had visited him , hut had avoided any allusion to the message , and lie therefore inferred that the import of the message had been misunderstood , and was regarded as inimical to the interests we represented ; and he had resolved he would talk with us , and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion . The President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound the sensibilities of the slave States . On the contrary , his purpose was to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in a terrible , wasting , and tedious war ; immense armies were in the field , and must continue in the field as long as the war lasts ; that these armies must , of necessity , he brought into contact with slaves in the States we represented , and in other States as they advanced ; that slaves would come to the camps , and continual irritation was kept up . That he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints : on the one side , a certain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army - persons were frequently found who , participating in these views , acted in a way unfriendly to the slaveholder ; on the other hand , slaveholders complained that their rights were interfered with , their slaves induced to abscond and protected within the lines . These divergence of views among representatives . Moderate Republicans generally supported the resolution ; even somewhat extreme antislavery men , such as Lovejoy in the House and Sumner in the Senate , indicated their willingness to join in the liberal compensation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to relinquish their portion of the disturbing and dangerous evil . Since it was not a practical measure , but simply an announcement of policy , the opposition was not strenuous ; a few border State representatives and the more obstinate Democrats from free States joined in a somewhat ill-natured dissent . The resolution was passed on the following day ( yeas , 89 ; nays , 31 ) . The action of the Senate was very similar , though the debate was a little more delayed . The resolution was passed in that body April 2 ( yeas , 32 ; nays , ro ) , and received the President 's signature on the ioth of April , 1862 . By his initiative and influence Mr. Lincoln thus committed the executive and legislative departments of the Government to the policy of compensated emancipation ; and there is no doubtthat , had his generous offerbeen accepted by the border States within a reasonable time , the pledge embodied in the joint resolution would have been promptly redeemed . Though it afterwards turned out that this action remained only sentimental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a very important practical measure . In its long contest for political supremacy , complaints were numerous , loud , and deep ; were a serious annoyance to him , and embarrassing to the progress of the war ; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the Government in the States we represented ; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that at some day the border States would unite with them and thus tend to prolong the war ; and he was of opinion , if this resolution should be adopted by Congress and accepted by our State*s , these causes of irritation and these hopes would be removed , and more would be accomplished towards shortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved by Union armies . That be made this proposition in good faith , and desired it to be accepted , if at all , voluntarily , and in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made ; that emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of the States , and must be adopted or rejected by each for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Government , any right to coerce them for that purpose ; that such was no part of his purpose in making this proposition , and he wished it to be clearly understood . That he did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer , but he hoped we would take the subject into serious consideration , confer with one another , and then take such course as we felt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us . " There followed after this much informal discussion , also reported in brief by Mr. Crisfield , for which there is not room in this note . The whole will be found in McPherson , " History of the Rebellion , " p. 210 ci seq . 2 McPherson , " History of the Rebellion , " p. 211. // slavery had clung with unyielding tenacity to its foothold in the District of Columbia , where it had been the most irritating eyesore to Northern sentiment . Whatever might be conceded to the doctrine of State sovereignty , antislavery men felt that the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal flag ; on the other hand , proslavery men saw that to relinquish this claim would be fatal to their determination to push it to a national recognition and existence . Hence the abolition or the maintenance of slaver yin the District of Columbia had become a frequent issue in party politics . The prohibition of the slave trade in the District was indeed effected in the great compromise of i8*o ; but this concession was more than counterbalanced by the proslavery gains of that political bargain , and since then the abolition of slavery itself in this central Federal jurisdiction seemed to have become impossible until rebellion provoked the change . Under the new conditions antislavery zeal was pushing its lance into every joint of the monster 's armor , and this vulnerable point was not overlooked . The Constitution placed the District of Columbia exclusively under the legislation of Congress , and by their rebellious withdrawal from their seats in the two houses the Southern members and senators had voluntarily surrendered this citadel of their propagandism . President Lincoln had not specifically recommended abolishment in the District in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a purpose when lie was a member of Congress in 1849 , and it was well known that his views had undergone no change . Later on , the already recited special message of March 6 embraced the subject in its larger aspects and recommendations . Thus , with perfect knowledge that it would receive executive sanction , the House on April i i ( yeas , 92 ; nays , 38 ) and the Senate on April 3 ( yeas , 29 ; nays , T4 ) passed an act of immediate emancipation of the slaves in the District of Columbia , with compensation to the owners , to be distributed by a commission , the whole not to exceed an aggregate of $300 per slave . The act also appropriated the sum of $ 00,000 for expenses of voluntary emigration to Hayti or Liberia . President Lincoln signed the act on the *6th of April , and in his short message of approval said : I have never doubted the constitutional authority of Congress to abolish slavery in this District and I have ever desired to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Hence there has never been in my mind any question upon the subject except the one of expediency , arising in view of all the circumstances . . . . I am gratified that the two principles of compensation and colonization are both recognized and practically applied in the act.1 Certain omissions in the law , which the President pointed out , were remedied by supplementary enactments , which among other safeguards and provisions added to the boon of freedom the privilege of education by opening public schools to colored children . SIGNS OF THE TIMES . BEFORE enough time bad elapsed to judge of the probable effect of Lincoln 's offer of compensation to the border States , a new incident occurred which further complicated the President 's dealings with the slavery question . About the middle of May he was surprised to learn from the newspapers that General David Hunter , whom he had recently sent to command the Department of the South , had issued an order of military emancipation . Reciting that the Department of the South was under martial law , the order declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are altogether incompatible . The persons in these three States - Georgia , Florida , and South Carolina - heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared free . " So far as can be judged , General Hunter was moved to this step by what seemed to him the requirements of his new surroundings and the simple dictates of natural justice . He was a warm personal and political friend of President Lincoln , was entirely free from motives of selfish ambition , and was not a man who would suffer himself to be made the instruinent of a political combination . Of strong antislavery convictions , his duty as a soldier in the service of the Union was as single-hearted and as sacred as that of a crusader sent to rescue the Holy Sepulcher from the Infidel . In his eyes rebellion and slavery were intertwined abominations to be struck and conquered simultaneously . XVhen he took command of the Department of the South he found himself surrounded by new conditions . The capture of Port Royal in the preceding November had been followed by the flight of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to Warsaw Sound , a distance of sixty or seventy miles , in the hands of the captors . This was the region of the famous sea island cotton plantations , in which the slaves outnumbered the whites nearly five to one . In their sudden flight the whites were compelled to abandon their slaves as well as their homes , and a large negro population thus fell immediately to the care and protection of the Union army . 1 " Congressional Globe , " April i6 , 1862. // The exercise of common humanity forced the military administration of the department beyond mere warlike objects . The commander , General Thomas W. Sherman , issued an address 1 to the white inhabitants , inviting them to return and reoccupy their lands and homes , and continue their peaceful vocations under the auspices and protection of the Government of the United States . Except in a very few instances the friendly invitation was defiantly refused . They not only preferred ruin and exile , but did such mischief as lay in their power by ordering their cotton to be burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees would seize them , send them away , and sell them into slavery in Cuba . Such was the distrust excited by the falsehood , that a month after the capture of Port Royal but about 320 blacks had ventured into Sherman s camps ; nearly all these were decrepit , or were women and children , there being only sixty able-bodied men among them.2 For the present the slaves made most of their abrupt holiday . But their scanty clothing wore out , the small stock of provisions on the plantations was exhausted . At the time of their masters ' flight much of the cotton crop was still in the fields . In the increasing demand for this product it became an object for the Government to collect and preserve what was left ; and this work , begun under the joint orders of the War and Treasury departments , set on foot the first organization of the colored population for labor and government . Military orders divided the country into districts , with agents to superintend the plantations , to enroll and organize the blacks into working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to pay them for their labor . Private philanthropy also gave timely and valuable assistance . Relief societies , organized in Boston , New York , and Philadelphia , collected funds and employed teachers , some fifty of whom reached Beaufort the 9th of March , 1862 , and began a much-needed work of combined encouragement , guardianship , and instruction , thus replacing the elements of social government which the slaves bad lost by the withdrawal of their masters and mistresses . The control of the captured and abandoned cotton and other property fell to the Treasury Department , and in this connection Secretary Chase , at the President 's request , gave the educational enterprise his official sanction and supervision ; later on , the War Department assumed and continued the work .

War Records . from the first to rely upon " contrabands " for information and assistance , and to a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only wages for the actual service performed , but necessary food and shelter for the destitute , and with the return of the spring season furnished them , so far as possible , seed and implements of husbandry , and encouraged them to renew their accustomed labor in the gardens and fields of the abandoned plantations , in order to provide for , or at least contribute to , their own maintenance . Under this treatment confidence was quickly established . In two months the number of blacks within the Union lines increased from 320 to over 9ooo. * When General Hunter took command of the Department of the South , this industrial and educational organization of the blacks was just beginning . Military usefulness was of the first importance in his eyes , particularly as his forces were insufficient for offensive movement . It was not unnatural that , seeing the large colored population within his lines , much of it unemployed , his thoughts should turn to the idea of organizing , arming , and training regiments of colored soldiers ; and assuming that the instructions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment without delay . It was amid all these conditions , which at that time did not exist elsewhere , that General Hunter issued the already recited order announcing that slavery and martial law were incompatible , and declaring free all slaves in his department . The presence of the Union army had visibly created a new order of things , and he doubtless felt it a simple duty to proclaim officially what practically had come to pass . The mails from the Department of the South could only come by sea ; hence a week elapsed after the promulgation of Hunter 's order before knowledge of it came to the President through its publication in the New York newspapers . The usual acrimonious comments immediately followed : radicals approved it , Democrats and conservatives denounced it ; and the President was assailed for inaction on the one hand and for treachery on the other . Lincoln 's own judgment of the act was definite and prompt . " No commanding general shall do such a thing , upon my responsibility , without consulting me , " he wrote in answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand . Three days later ( May 19 , 1862 ) the President published a proclamation reciting that the Government had no knowledge or part in the issuing of Hunter 's order of emancipation , that neither Hunter nor any other person had been authorized to declare free the slaves of any State , and that his order in that respect was altogether void . The President continued : // I further make it known that whether it be competent for me , as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy , to declare the slaves of any State or States free , and whether at any time , in any case it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the Government to exercise such supposed power , are questions which , under my responsibility , I reserve to myself , and which I can not feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field . These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps . While the President thus drew a sharp distinction between the limited authority of commanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own hands , for future contingencies , he utilized the occasion for a forcible admonition to the border slave-States . Reminding them that he by recommendation , and Congress by joint resolution , had made them a formal tender and pledge of payment for their slaves if they would voluntarily abolish the institution , he counseled them in words of parental wisdom and affection not to neglect this opportunity of financial security to themselves and patriotic benefit to their country . He said : To the people of those States I now earnestly appeal . I do not argue ; I beseech you to make the arguments for yourselves . You can not , if you would , be blind to the signs of the times . I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them , ranging , if it may be , far above personal and partisan politics . This proposal makes common cause for a common object , casting no reproaches upon any . It acts not the Pharisee . The changes it contemplates would come gently as the dew 's of heaven-not rending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much good has not been done by one effort in all past times as , in the providence of God , it is now your high privilege to do . May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.1 The " signs of the times ' were indeed multiplying to a degree that ought to have attracted the notice of the border States , even without the pointing finger of the President . How far the presence of the Confederate armies , embodying a cohipact proslavery sentiment , had up to that time interfered locally with the relations of master and slave xve have no means of knowing ; we do know that before the end of the rebellion the conditions of war-military necessity - brought even the rebel Government and the unconquered slave communities to the verge of emancipation and the general military employment of the blacks . But Northern armies , embodying a compact antislavery sentiment , stationed or moving in slave communities , acted on the " institution " as a disturbing , relaxing , and disintegrating force , constant in operation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether in Kentucky or Virginia , Missouri or Mississippi , the slave gave the Union soldiers his sympathy and his help ; while for services rendered , and still more for services expected , the soldiers returned friendship and protection , finding no end of pretexts to evade any general orders to the contrary . From the army this feeling communicated itself sometimes directly to Congress , sometimes to the soldier 's Northern home , from which it was in turn reflected upon that body . The antislavery feeling at the North , excited by the ten-years ' political contention , intensified by the outbreak of rebellion , was thus fed and stimulated , and grexv with every day 's duration of the war . Conservative opinion could not defend a system that had wrought the convulsion and disaster through which the nation was struggling . Radical opinion lost no opportunity to denounce it and attack its vulnerable points . Of the operations of this sentiment the debates and enactments of Congress afford an approximate measure . During the long session from December 2 , i86r , to July 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point , while the affirmative propositions of which slavery was the central and vital object were of themselves sufficiently numerous to absorb a large share of the discussions . Leaving out of view the many resolutions and bills which received only passing attention , or which were at once rejected , this second session 2 of the Thirty-seventh Congress perfected and enacted a series of antislavery measures which amounted to a complete reversal of the policy of the General Government . At the date of the President 's proclamation quoted above calling attention to the " signs of the times , " only a portion of these measures had reached final enactment ; but the drift and portent of their coming was unmistakable . In the restricted limits of these pages it is impossible to pass them in review separately or chronologically ; nor does the date of their passage and approval always indicate the relation in which they engrossed the attention of Congress . The consideration of the general subject was , we may almost say , continuous , and the reader will obtain a better idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the importance and scope of the several acts and sections as related to each other . First . One of the earliest forms of the discussion arose upon the constantly recurring question of returning to slave-owners such runaways as sought the protection of the Union camps , and regarding which various command 1 // ers had issued such different and contradictory orders . It has already been stated that the President left his officers full discretion on this point , because it fell properly within the necessities of camp and police regulations . The somewhat harsh and arbitrary order No. 3 , issued by General Halleck in Missouri , provoked widespread comment and indignation ; and though the general insisted that the spirit of the order was purely military , and not political , it undoubtedly hastened and intensified congressional action . By an act approved March 13 , 1862 , a new article of war was added to the army regulations , which enjoined , under usual penalties , that " All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States are prohibited from employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped , " etc . Later , Section 10 of the Confiscation Act1 was virtually an amendment of the fugitive-slave law ; providing that the claimant might not use its authority until he had taken an oath of allegiance , and prohibiting any person in the army or navy from surrendering a fugitive slave , or presuming to decide the validity of the owner s claim . Seco ; zd . No less to fulfill the dictates of propriety and justice than for its salutary influence on the opinion of foreign nations , the annual message of the President had recommended a recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia , and the appointment of diplomatic representatives to those new states . This was duly authorized by an act approved June 5 , 1862 . Similar reasons also secured the passage of " An act to carry into effect the treaty between the United States and her Britannic Majesty for the suppression of the African slave-trade , " approved July ? * , 1862 . That this action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that under the prosecution of the Government , the slave-trader Nathaniel P. Gordon was convicted and hanged in New York on the 21st of February , 1862 , this being the first execution for this offense under the laws of the United States , after their enforcement had been neglected and their extreme penalty defied for forty years . fizird . The third marked feature of congressional antislavery enactment was one which , in a period of peace , would have signalized the culmination of a great party triumph and taken its place as a distinctive political landmark . Now , however , in the clash and turmoil of war it was disposed of , not so much in the light of a present party conquest , as the simple necessary registration of accomplished 1 Approved July I 7 , 1862. facts , wrought beyond recall by passing events , recognized by public opinion , and requiring only the formality of parliamentary attestation . Its title was , " An act to secure freedom to all persons within territories of the United States , " approved June 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had called the Republican party into being , namely , the restoration of the Missouri Compromise , its extension and application to all Territories of the United States , and as a logical result the rejection and condemnation of the proslavery doctrines of the Dred Scott decision , the demand for a congressional slave code , and the subversive " property theory " of Jefferson Davis . These were the issues which had caused the six-years ' political contention between the North and the South ; and upon its defeat at the ballot-box by the election of President Lincoln , the South had appealed to the sword . Four/k . Still advancing another step in the prevalent antislavery progress , we come to the policy of compensated emancipation so strenuously urged by the President . Action on this point has already been described , namely , the joint resolution of Congress , approved April 10 , 1862 , virtually pledging the aid of the Government to any State which would adopt it , and the act , approved April i6 , 1862 , with its amendments , actually abolishing slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The earnestness of Congress in this reform is marked by the additional step that under acts approved May 21 and July i 1862 , certain provisions were made for the education of colored children in the cities of Washington and Georgetown , District of Columbia . Efik . By far the most important of all the antislavery laws of this period , both in scope and purpose , was a new Confiscation Act , perfected after much deliberation , passed at the close of the session , and approved by the President July 17 , 1862 . The act of August 6 , i86i , only went to the extent of making free the slaves actually employed in rebel military service . The new law undertook to deal more generally with the subject , and indeed extended its provisions somewhat beyond the mere idea of confiscation . While other subjects were included , its spirit and object would have been better expressed by the title of " An act to destroy slavery under the powers of war . " In addition to other and usual penalties for treason or rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these crimes should be made free ; that slaves of rebels escaping and taking refuge within th' army lines , slaves captured from rebels or deserted by them and coming under the control of the United States Government , and slaves of rebels found in // any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the Union army , should all be deemed captives of war and be forever free . Six/I ? . Coupled with the foregoing sweeping provisions , intended to destroy title in slave property as a punishment for treason and rebellion , were other provisions , which , under guarded phraseology , looked to the active organized employment of slaves as a substantial military force - which military service should in its turn also , in specified cases , work enfranchisement from bondage . Thus , in certain amendments of the militia laws ljt was enacted that the President might enroll and employ contrabands in such camp labor or military service as they were fitted for , and that their wives , mothers , and children , if they belonged to armed rebels , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r of the Confiscation Act , however , conferred a still broader authority upon the Government for this object . It provided : That the President of the United States is authorized to employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion , and for this purpose he may organize and use them in such manner as he may judge best for the public welfare . This section allowed a latitude of construction which permitted the organization of a few of the earliest regiments of colored soldiers . In tracing the antislavery policy of President Lincoln , his opinions upon some of the prominent features of these laws become of special interest . He followed the discussion and perfecting of the Confiscation Act with careful attention , and as it neared its passage prepared a veto message , pointing out several serious defects , which Congress hastily remedied in anticipation by an explanatory joint resolution . When the bill and resolution were submitted to him he signed both , as being substantially a single act , and , to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approval a copy of the draft of his intended veto message . The constitutional objection and the imperfections of detail in the original bill do not require mention here , but his views on emancipation and military employment of slaves may not be omitted . There is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection . It is wholly prospective ; and it touches neither person nor property of any loyal citizen , in which particular it is just and proper . . . . It is also provided that the slaves of persons convicted under these sections shall be free . I think there is an unfortunate form of expression , rather than a sub- 1 An act to amend the act calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections , and repel invasions , approved February 28 , I 795 , and stantial objection , in this . It is startling to say that Congress can free a slave within a State , and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulty would at once vanish . And this is the real case . The traitor against the General Government forfeits his slave at least as justly as he does any other property and he forfeits both to the Government against which he offends . The Government , so far as there can be ownership , thus owns the forfeited slaves , and the question for Congress in regard to them is , Shall they be made free or be sold to new masters ? I perceive no objection to Congress deciding iii advance that they shall be free . To the high honor of Kentucky , as I am informed , she has been the owner of some slaves by ? scheat , and has sold none , but liberated all . I hope the same is true of some other States . Indeed , I do not believe it would be physically possible for the General Government to return persons so circumstanced to actual slavery . I believe there would be physical resistance to it which could neither be turned aside by argument nor driven away by force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill . . . . The eleventh section simply assrimes to confer discretionary power upon the Executive . Without the law , I have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated as I may at any time deem expedient . And I am ready to say now , I think it is*proper for our military commanders to employ , as laborers , as many persons of African descent as can be used to advantage.2 The number and variety of antislavery provisions cited above show how vulnerable was the peculiar institution in a state of war , and demonstrate again the folly and madness of the slavebolders ' appeal to arms . All the penalties therein prescribed were clearly justifiable by the war powers of the nation and sustained by military necessity . So far the laws had not touched a single right of a loyal slaveholder in a slave State , either within or without the territory held by Confederate arms ; but day by day it became manifest that the whole slave system was so ramified and intertwined with political and social conditions in slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually stand or fall in mass . In short , the proof was more absolute in war than in peace that slavery was purely the creature of positive law in theory , and of universal police regulations unremittingly enforced in practice . It must not be supposed that the discussion and enactment of these measures proceeded without decided opposition . The three factions of which Congress was composed maintained the same relative position on these topics that they had occupied since the beginning of the rebellion . The bulk of the resistance was furnished by the Democratic members , the acts amendatory thereof , and for other purposes , approved July 17 , 1862 , sections 12 and 13. 2 Senate Journal , July 17 , 1862 , pp. 872 , 873. // who , while as a rule they condemned the rebellion , reiterated their previous accusations that the Republican party had provoked it . Now again at every antislavery proposition , no matter how necessary or justifiable , they charged that it was a violation of express or implied political faith , and a stumbling-block to reconciliation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still possible . In a hopeless minority , and with no chance to affect legislation affirmatively even by indirection , they yet maintained the attitude of an ill-natured opposition , yielding assent only to the most necessary war measures , while with sophistical and irritating criticism they were industriously undermining public confidence in the President and his adherents by every party and parliamentary device they could invent . There is little doubt that this action of the Democrats in Congress , in addition to its other pernicious effects , served to render the borderState delegations more stubborn and intractable against making any concessions towards the liberal and reformatory policy which President Lincoln so strongly urged . The statesmen and politicians of the border slave-States were quick enough to pbrceive the danger to their whole slave system , but not resolute enough to prepare to meet and endure its removal , and accept a money equivalent in exchange . Against evidence and conviction they clung tenaciously to the idea that the war ought to be prosecuted without damage to slavery ; and their representatives and senators in Congress , with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antislavery enactments . We may admit that in this course they represented truly the majority feeling and will of their several constituencies ; but such an admission is fatal to any claim on their part to political foresight or leadership . Indeed , one of the noticeable and lamentable features of the earlier stages of the rebellion was the sudden loss of power among border-State leaders , both at home and in Congress . We can now see that their weakness resulted unavoidably from their defensive position . During the secession stage they only ventured to act defensively against that initial heresy , and as a rule the offensive and unscrupulous conspirators kept the advantage of an aggressive initiative . Now in the new stage of antislavery reaction they were again merely on the defensive and under the disadvantage which that attitude always brings with it . In Congress , as a faction , they were sadly diminished in numbers and shorn of personal prestige . They could count only a single conspicuous representative - the venerable John J. Crittenden ; but burdened with the weight of years , and hedged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was timid , spiritless , despondent . The record of the border-State delegations , therefore , during this strong antislavery movement of congressional enactment is simply one of protests , excuses , appeals , and direful prophecies . Against them the positive affirmative progress of antislavery sentiment gathered force and volume from every quarter . Whatever the momentary or individual outcry , it was easy to l ) erceive that every antislavery speech , resolution , vote , or law received quick sustaining acceptance from public sentiment in the North and from the fighting Union armies in the South . The Republican majority in Congress noted and responded to these symptoms of approval , and the radical leaders in that body were constantly prompted by them to more advanced demands and votes . Antislavery opinion in Congress not only had the advantage of overpowering numbers , but also of conspicuous ability . A high average talent marked the Republican membership , which , as a rule , spoke and voted for the before-mentioned antislavery measures ; while among those whose zeal gave them especial prominence in these debates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens and Owen Lovejoy in the House need only be mentioned to show what high qualities of zeal and talent pursued the peculiar institution with unrelenting warfare . To the rebellious South , to the loyal population of the border slave-States , and to the extreme conservatism of the North , particularly that faction represented by Democratic members of Congress , President Lincoln 's proposal of gradual compensated abolishment doubtless seemed a remarkable if not a dangerous innovation upon the practical politics of half a century . But this conservatism failed to comprehend the mighty sweep and power of the revolution of opinion which slavery had put in motion by its n edless appeal to arms . In point of fact , the President stood sagaciously midway between headlong reform and blind reaction . His steady , cautious direction and control of the average public sentiment of the country alike held back rash experiment and spurred lagging opinion . Congress , with a strong Republican majority in both branches , was stirred by hot debate on the new issues . The indirect influence of the Executive was much greater than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite damage to the delicate structure of constitutional government . As it was , antislavery resentment was restrained and confined to such changes of legislation as were plainly necessary to vindicate the Constitution , laws , and traditions which the rebellion had wantonly violated ; but these were sufficiently numerous and pointed to mark a profound // transformation of public policy in little more than a year . Under the occasion and spur which the rebellion furnished , a txvelvemonth wrought that which had not been dreamed of in a decade , or which would otherwise have been scarcely possible to achieve in a century . Four months had now elapsed since President Lincoln proposed and Congress sanctioned the policy of compensated emancipation in the border slave-States . Except in its indirect influence upon public opinion , no definite result had as yet attended the proposal . Great fluctuations had occurred in the war and great strides had been made in legislation ; but the tendency so far had been rather to complicate than simplify the political situation , to exasperate rather than appease contending factions and conflicting opinions . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , could not prolong itself indefinitely . Little by little the war was draining the lifeblood of the republic . However effectually the smoke and dust of the conflict might shut the view from the general eye , or however flippantly small politicians might hide the question under the heat and invective of factional quarrel , President Lincoln , looking to the future , saw that , to replenish the waste of armies and maintain a compact popular support , the North must be united in a sentiment and policy affording a plain , practical aim and solution , both political and military . The policy he decided upon was not yet ripe for announcement , but the time had arrived to prepare the way for its avowal and acceptance . As the next proper step in such a preparation , the President , on the i 2th of July , 1862 , again convened the border-State delegations at the Executive Mansion , and read to them the following carefully prepared second appeal to accept compensation for slaves in their respective States GENTLEMEN : After the adjournment of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing you for several months . Believing that you of the border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of members , I feel it a duty which I can not justifiably waive to make this appeal to you . I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that , in my opinion , if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation message of last March the war would now be substantially ended . And the plan therein proposed is one of the most potent and swift means of ending it . Let the States which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent ever join their proposed confederacy , and they can not much longer maintain the contest . But you can not divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own States . Beat them at elections , as you have overwhelmingly done , and , nothing daunted , they still claim you as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power is . Break that lever before their faces , and they can shake you no more forever . Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration , and I trust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own when , for the sake of the whole country , I ask , " Can you , for your States , do better than to take the course I urge ? Discarding punctilios and maxims adapted to more manageable times , and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case , can you do better in any possible event ? You prefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution and if this were done , my whole duty , in this respect , under the Constitution and my oath of office , would be performed . But it is not done , and we are trying to accomplish it by war . The incidents of the war can not be avoided . If the war continues long , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution in your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion-by the mere incidents of the war . It will be gone , and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it . Much of its value is gone already . How much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war , and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to he wholly lost in any other event . How much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in the war . How much better to do it while we can , lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it . How much better for you as seller , and the nation as buyer , to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been , than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another 's throats . I do not speak of emancipation at once , but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in abundance , and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another , the freed people will not be so reluctant to go . I am pressed with adifficulty not yet mentioned - one which threatens division among those who , united , are not too strong . An instance of it is known to you . General Hunter is an honest man . He was , and I hope still is , my friend . I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be freed . He proclaimed all men free within certain States , and I repudiated the proclamation . He expected more good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would follow . Yet , in repudiating it , I gave dissatisfaction , if not offense , to many whose support the country can not afford to lose . And this is not the end of it . The pressure in this direction is still upon me , and is increasing . By conceding what I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can relieve the country in this important point . Upon these considerations I have again begged your attention to the message of March last . Before leaving the capital , consider and discuss it among yourselves . You are patriots and statesmen , and as such I pray you consider this proposition ; and at the least commend it to the consideration of your States and people . As you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world , I beseech you that you do in no wise omit this . Our common country is in great peril , demanding the loftiest // views and boldest action to bring a speedy relief . Once relieved , its form of government is saved to the world , its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated , and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand . To you , more than to any others , the privilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur , and to link your own names therewith forever . It is doubtful whether the President expected any more satisfactory result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended his previous one . He had had abundant occasion to observe their course in the congressional debates ; the opportunity had been long before them and they had not taken advantage of it ; amid the revolutionary impulse and action which were moving the whole country their inaction on this subject was equivalent to resistance . This effort therefore , like the former one , proved barren : most of them answered with a qualified refusal ; twenty of them 1 signed a written reply on July 14 , which , while it pledged an unchangeable continuance of their loyalty , set forth a number of mixed and inconsequential reasons against adopting the President 's recommendation . They thought the project too expensive . They said slavery was a right which they ought not to be asked to relinquish , that the proposition had never been offered them in a tangible shape , that a different policy had been announced at the beginning of the war , that radical doctrines had been proclaimed and subversive measures proposed in Congress . In short , it was a general plea for non-action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenting from the conservative views of the majority , and promising that " We will , as far as may be in our power , ask the people of the border States calmly , deliberately , and fairly to consider your recommendations . " Two others3 wrote separate replies in the same spirit ; but with only a minority to urge the proposition upon their people , it was plain from the first that no hope of success could be entertained .

Cheering news of important successes came from all quarters - Mill Springs in Kentucky , Roanoke Island in North Carolina , Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee , Pea Ridge in Arkansas , Shiloh in Tennessee , Island No. 10 in the Mississippi River , the reduction of Forts Jackson and St. Philip on the lower Mississippi , the capture of New Orleans in Louisiana , and , finally , what seemed the beginning of a victorious advance by McClellan 's army upon Richmond . In the month of May , however , this tide of success began to change . Stonewall Jackson 's raid initiated a series of discouraging Union defeats , and McClellan 's formidable advance gradually changed into disastrous retreat . No one noted this blighting of a longed-for fruition with a keener watchfulness and more sensitive suffering than did President Lincoln . As the military interest and expectancy gradually lessened at the circumference and slowly centered itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts by day and anxiety by night fed upon the intelligence which the telegraph brought from the Union camps on the Chickahominy and the James . It is safe to say that no general in the army studied his maps and scanned his telegrams with half the industry- and , it may be added , with half the intelligence - which Mr. Lincoln gave to his . It is not surprising , therefore , that before the catastrophe finally came the President was already convinced of the substantial failure of McClellan 's campaign as first projected , though he still framed his letters and telegrams in the most hopeful and encouraging language that the situation would admit . But aware of the impending danger , he took steps to secure such a rei*nforcement of the army , and provide for such a readjustment of the campaign , as might yet secure the final and complete victory which had lain so temptingly within McClellan 's grasp . A part of this programme was the consolidation of an army under Pope . The culmination of disaster doubtless came sooner than bethought possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on June 26 he telegraphed : The case is perhaps a difficult one , but I shall resort to desperate measures , and will do my best to outmaneuver , outwit , and outfight the enemy .

Hope for the best , and I will not deceive the hopes you formerly placed in me.1 This was the language of a man still possessing courage and faith , but the events of the two days following robbed him of both . Early on the morning of the 28th he sent the Secretary of War his memorable telegram already quoted , which was a mere blind cry of despair and insubordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be glad to cover my retreat and save the material and personnel of the army . . . . If I save this army now , I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington . You have done your best to sacrifice this army . The kind and patient words with which President Lincoln replied to this unsoldierly and unmanly petulance , and the vigorous exertions put forth by the War Department to mitigate the danger with all available supplies and reinforcements , have been related . The incident is repeated here to show that the President and Cabinet promptly put into execution a measure which had probably been already debated during the preceding days . The needs of the hour , and Lincoln 's plan to provide for them , can not be more briefly stated than in the two letters which follow , the first of which , written on this 28th day of June , he addressed to his Secretary of State . It was evidently written in a moment of profound emotion produced by McClellan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found a stronger announcement of his determination to persevere unfalteringly in the public and patriotic task before him : My view of the present condition of the war is about as follows : The evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack . In fact , there soon will be no substantial rebel force anywhere else . But if we send all the force from here to McClellan , the enemy will , before we can know of it , send a force from Richmond and take Washington . Or if a large part of the Western army be brought here to McClellan , they will let us have Richmond , and retake Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , etc . What should be done is to hold what we have in the West , open the Mississippi , and take Chattanooga and east Tennessee without more . A reasonable force should , in every event , be kept about Washington for its protection . Then let the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible time , which , added to McClelIan directly or indirectly , will take Richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold , and will substantially end the war .

I think the new force should be all , or nearly all , infantry , principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly.2 This letter was of course not needed for the personal information of Mr. Seward , but was placed in his hands to enable him to reassure those who might doubt the President 's courage and determination . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was addressed to the governors of the loyal States . It ran as follows : The capture of New Orleans , Norfolk , and Corinth by the National forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about Richmond , which place we must take with the least possible delay ; in fact , there will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond . With so large an army there the enemy can threaten us on the Potomac and elsewhere . Until we have reëstablished the National authority , all these places must be held , and we must keep a respectable force in front of Washington . But this , from the diminished strength of our army by sickness and casualties , renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy and success . Rather than herald the misapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation , I have deemed it best to address you in this form .

Later in the day he added to the above : The President approves your plan , but suggests 200,000 , if it can be done as well as the number you mention 1 It is probable that a further discussion , and perhaps also further information of the disaster and despondency on the Peninsula , brought more fully to the minds of President and Secretary of War the gravity of the crisis and the need of decisive action ; for Mr. Stanton sent a third telegram to Mr. Seward , saying : Your telegram received . I will take the responsibility of ordering the $25 bounty out of the nine millions appropriation at all hazards , and you may go on that basis . I will make and telegraph the order in an hour .

All believe that the decisive moment is near at hand , and to that end the people of the United States are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all reinforcements that you may deem needful to sustain our Government . To which the President 's reply announced : GENTLEMEN : Fully concurring in the wisdom of the views expressed to me in so patriotic a manner by you in the communication of the 28th day of June , I have decided to call into the service an additional force of 300,000 men . " It was thought safest to mark high enough , " 1 said Mr. Lincoln in a private telegram to Governor Morgan of New York ; while in another private circular to all the governors he explained his desire a little more fully . 1 Unpublished MS* I should riot want the half of 300,000 new troops if I could have them now .

The enemy having given up Corinth , it is not wonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at Richmond.1 It was doubtless the sudden collapse of McClellan 's Richmond campaign which brought President Lincoln to the determination to adopt his policy of general military emancipation much sooner than he would otherwise have done . The necessity of a comprehensive rearrangement of military affairs was upon him , and it was but natural that it should involve a revision of political policy . The immediate present was provided for in the call just issued for 300,000 volunteers ; but he had learned by experience that he must count new possibilities of delays and defeats , and that his determination , so recently recorded , to " maintain this contest " to ultimate triumph , compelled him to open new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often declared , that in a republic the talisman which wrought the xvonders of statesmanship and the changes of national destiny was public opinion . We now know that in the use of this talisman he was the most consummate master whose skill history has recorded . We are justified in the inference that his foresight had perceived and estimated the great and decisive element of military strength which lay as yet untouched and unappropriated in the slave population of the South . To its use , however , there existed two great obstacles-prejudice on the part of the whites , the want of a motive on the part of the blacks . His problem was to remove the one and to supply the other . For the first of these difficulties the time was specially propitious in one respect . In the momentary check and embarrassment of all the armies of the Union , generals , soldiers , and conservative politicians would tolerate reprisal upon rebels with forbearance if not with favor ; and for their consent to the full military employment of the blacks he might trust to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already so manifest . The motive which would call the slaves to the active help of the Union armies lay ready made for his use - indeed , it bad been in steadily increasing action from the beginning of hostilities till now , as far and as effectively as the Government would permit . // McClellan 's change of base occurred about the ist of July , 1862 . Lincoln 's final appeal to the border States took place shortly afterward , on July i * and his vivid portrayal of the inevitable wreck of slavery in the stress of war doubtless gathered color and force from recent military events . Already , before the border-State delegations gave him their written replies , he knew from their words and bearing that they would in effect refuse the generous tender of compensation ; and he decided in his own mind that he would at an early day give notice of his intention to emancipate the slaves of rebellious States by military proclamation . His first confidential announcement of the new departure occurred on the day following his interview with the border-State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Welles : On Sunday , the i3th of July , 1862 , President Lincoln invited me to accompany him in his carriage to the funeral of an infant child of Mr. Stanton . Secretary Seward and Mrs. Frederick Seward were also in the carriage . Mr. Stanton occupied at that time , for a summer residence , the house of a naval officer , I think Hazzard , some two or three miles west or north-westerly of Georgetown . It was on this occasion and on this ride that he first mentioned to Mr. Seward and myself the subject of emancipating the slaves by proclamation in case the rebels did not cease to persist in their war on the Government and the Union , of which he saw no evidence . He dwelt earnestly on the gravity , importance , and delicacy of the movement ; said he had given it much thought , and had about come to the conclusion that it was a military necessity , absolutely essential for the salvation of the nation , that we must free the slaves or be ourselves subdued , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion where he had mentioned the subject to any one , and wished us to frankly state how the proposition struck us . Mr. Seward said the subject involved consequences so vast and momentous that he should wish to bestow on it mature reflection before giving a decisive answer ; but his present opinion inclined to the measure as justifiable , and perhaps he might say expedient and necessary . These were also my views . Two or three times on that ride the subject , which was of course an absorbing one for each and all , was adverted to , and before separating , the President desired us to give the subject special and deliberate attention , for he was earnest in the conviction that something must be done . It was a new departure for the President , for until this time , in all our previous interviews , whenever the question of eman1 WAR DEPARTMENT , XVASTIINGTON , July 22 , 1862 . First . Ordered that military commanders within the States of Virginia , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use any property , real or personal , which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands , for supplies , or for other military purposes ; and that while property may he destroyed for proper military objects , none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice . cipation or the mitigation of slavery had been in any way alluded to , he had been prompt and emphatic in denouncing any interference by the General Government with the subject . This was , I think , the sentiment of every member of the Cabinet , all of whom , including the President , considered it a local domestic question appertaining to the States respectively who had never parted with their authority over it . But the reverses before Richmond , and the formidable power and dimensions of the insurrection , which extended through all the slave States and had combined most of them in a confederacy to destroy the Union , impelled the Administration to adopt extraordinary measures to preserve the national existence . The slaves , if not armed and disciplined , were in the service of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but thousands of them were in attendance upon the armies in the field , employed as waiters and teamsters , and the fortifications and intrenchments were constructed by them . Within the next four days Congress finished its business and adjourned , the Confiscation Act being an important part of its final work . The President , as we have seen , signed the bill with its amendatory resolution , and the Government was thus brought face to face with the practical duty of enforcing its provisions through military directions and orders in further detail . It has been explained how the Confiscation Act and other laws broadened and multiplied the forfeitures of title to slaves for the crimes of treason and rebellion . We have the evidence of the President 's written comments that he considered these penalties just and the imposition of them constitutional . In the administration of the laws thus enacted there therefore remained to be examined only the convenience of their practical enforcement and the general effect upon public opinion of the policy they established . We have no record of the specific reasoning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the five days following the adjournment of Congress ( July i 7 to July 22 , 1862 ) his mind reached its final conclusions . The diary of Secretary Chase contains the following record of what occurred at the Cabinet meeting at the Executive Mansion on July 21 : I went at the appointed hour , and found that the President had been profoundly concerned at the present aspect of affairs , and had determined to take some definite steps in respect to military action and slavery . He had prepared several orders , l the first Second . That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers , within and from said States , so many their labor . Third . That as to both property and persons of Af. rican descent , accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts , , and from whom both property and such persons shall have come , as a basis upon which compensation cami be ma ( le in proper cases ; and the several departments of // of which contemplated authority to commanders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , authority to employ negroes as laborers ; the third , requiring that both in the case of property taken and of negroes employed accounts should be kept with such degree of certainty as would enable compensation to be made in proper cases . Another provided for the colonization of negroes in some tropical country . A good deal of discussion took place upon these points . The first order was universally approved . The second was approved entirely , and the third by all except myself . 1 doubted the expediency of attempting to keep account for the benefit of the inhabitants of rebel States . The colonization project was not much discussed . The Secretary of War presented some letters from General Hunter , in which he advised the department that the withdrawal of a large proportion of his troops to reThforce General McClellan rendered it highly important that he should be immediately authorized to enlist all loyal persons , without reference to complexion . Messrs . Stanton , Seward , and myself expressed ourselves in favor of this plan , and no one expressed himself against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not prepared to decide the question , but expressed himself as averse to arming negroes.l This Cabinet discussion came to no final conclusion , and we learn from the same diary that on the following day , Tuesday , July 22 , 1862 ,  - -  which was regular Cabinet day ,  --  the subject was resumed . Further conference was had on organizing negro regiments , but Lincoln decided that the moment had not yet arrived when this policy could be safely entered upon . Writes Chase : The impression left upon my mind by the whole discussion was , that while the President thought that the organization , equipment , and arming of negroes like other soldiers would be productive of more evil than good , he was not unwilling that commanders should , at their discretion , arm , for purely defensive purposes , slaves coming within their lines . But on the kindred policy of emancipation the President had reached a decision which appears to have been in advance of the views of his entire Cabinet . Probably greatly to their surprise , he read to them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains and penalties of the Confiscation Act , and while renewing his tender of compensation to loyal States which would adopt gradual abolishment , adding a summary military order , as Commander-in-Chief , declaring free the slaves of all States which might be in rebellion on January i , 1863 . The text of this first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation is here printed for the first time : this Government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of these orders . By order of the President , EDWIN M. STANTON , Secretary of War . 1 Warden , " Life of S. P. Chase , " p. 439 . In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled , " An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion , to seize and confiscate property of rebels , and for other purposes , approved July i , 1862 , and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are herewith published , I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , aiding , countenancing , or abetting the existing rebellion , or any rebellion against the Government of the United States , and to return to their proper allegiance to the United States , on pain of the forfeitures and seizures , as within and by said sixth section provided . And I hereby make known that it is my purpose , upon the next meeting of Congress , to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure for tendering pecuniary aid to the free choice or rejection of any and all States , which may then be recognizing and practically sustaining the authority of the United States , and which may then have voluntarily adopted , or thereafter may voluntarily adopt , gradual abolishment of slavery within such State or States ; that the object is to practically restore , thenceforward to be maintained , the constitutional relation between the General Government and each and all the States wherein that relation is now suspended or disturbed ; and that for this object the war , as it has been , will be prosecuted . And as a fit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States , do order and declare that on the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three , all persons held as slaves within any State or States wherein the constitutional authority of the United States shall not then be practically recognized , submitted to and maintained , shall then , thenceforward , and forever be free.2 Of the Cabinet proceedings which followed the reading of this momentous document we have unfortunately only very brief memoranda . Every member of the council was , we may infer , bewildered by the magnitude and boldness of the proposal . The sudden consideration of this critical qifestion reveals to us with vividness the difference in mental reach , readiness , and decision between the President and his constitutional advisers . Only two of the number gave the measure their unreserved concurrence , even after discussion . It is strange that one of these was the cautious Attorney-General , the representative of the conservative faction of the slaveholding State of Missouri . and that the member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve the result indirectly through the scattered and divided action of local commanders in military departments , was the antislavery Secretary 2 The indorsement on the above paper , also in Liiicoin 's own handwriting , is as follows : " Emancipation proclamation as first sketched and shown to the Cabinet in July , iSfia .

All were astonished , except the two to whom it had been mentioned a week before . None of the others had even considered such a step . But from the mind and will of President Lincoln the determination and announcement to his Cabinet came almost as complete in form and certain in intention on that memorable Tuesday of July as when , two months later , it was given to the public , or as officially proclaimed on the succeeding New Year 's Day , an irrevocable executive act . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly the effect produced upon the assembled council . The manuscript is here reproduced as nearly as the types conveniently permit .

The omissions in this bit of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by President Lincoln 's own narrative , recorded and published by the artist Carpenter , whose application for permission to paint his historical picture of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation called it forth : " It had gotto be , " said he Mr. Lincoln , " midsummer , 1862 . Things had gone on from bad to worse , until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing ; that we had about played our last card , and must change our tactics , or lose the game . I now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation pol1 Carpenter , " Six Months at the White House , " pp. 20-23. 2 On this point the President is reported as saying : " Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks . " ( Carpenter , " Six , Months at the White House , " p. as . ) If these were his words , his memory was slightly at fault . icy ; and without consultation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared the original draft of the proclamation , and , after much anxious thought , called a Cabinet meeting upon the subject . All were present excepting Mr. Blair , the Postmaster-General , who was absent at the opening of the discussion , but came in subsequently . I said to the Cabinet that I had resolved upon this step , and had not called them together to ask their advice , but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before them suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it read . Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no comment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward . Various suggestions were offered . " 1 At this point we interrupt the President 's relation a moment to quote in its proper sequence the exact comment offered by Secretary Chase , 2 as recorded in his diary : I Chase said that I should give to such a measure my cordial support , but I should prefer that no new expression on the subject of compensation should be made ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and more quietly accomplished by allowing generals to organize and arm the slaves ( thus avoiding depredaf on and massacre on one hand , and support to the insurrection on the other ) , and by directing the commanders of departments to proclaim emancipation within their districts as soon as practicable . But I regarded this as so much better than inaction on the subject , that I should give it my entire support.3 The President 's narrative continues : " Mr. Blair , after he came in , deprecated the policy on the ground that it would cost the Administration the fall elections . Nothing , however , was offered that I had not fully anticipated and settled in my own mind until Secretary Seward spoke . He said in substance , Mr.* President , I approve of the proclamation , but I question the expediency of its issue atthisjuncture . The depression of the public mind , consequent upon our repeated reverses , is so great that I fear the effect of so important a step . It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its handt to Ethiopia , instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the Government . ' His idea , " saidthe President , " was that it would be considered our last shriek , on the retreat . This was his precise expression . Now , ' continued Mr. Seward , while I approve the measure , I suggest , sir , that you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by military success , instead of issuing it , as would be the case now , upon the greatest disasters of the war . ' " Mr. Lincoln continued : " The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force . It was an aspect of the case that , in all my thought upon the subject , I had entirely overlooked . The There was nothing in the proposed proclamation of emancipation about arming the blacks . That branch of the discussion , while it occurred at the same time , had exclusive reference to the military order quoted on page 291 , also then under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase , " p. *o. // result was that I put the draft of the proclamation aside , as you do your sketch for a picture , waiting for victory . " Instead of the proclamation thus laid away , a short one was issued three days after , simply containing the warning required by the sixth section of the Confiscation Act . The already quoted military order to make seizures under the act had been issued on the day when the proclamation was discussed and postponed ; meanwhile the Government , by its new military arrangements , sending reinforcements to McClellan , organizing a new army under Pope , and calling Halleck from the West to exercise a superior and guiding control over a combined campaign towards Richmond , seemed to have provided the needful requirements for early and substantial success .
