txt The state of mind of that little company of men who are preparing for Capt . HowGATE 'S campaign against the North Pole , wherein it is proposed to capture that elusive object of geographical search by gradual approaches , is to be envied at this time of meteorological and political heat . With every Summer interest in the subject of Polar exploration revives . It is to the mind as iced drinks and cooling salads to the inner man . Geographical societies , with a fine appreciation for the seasonableness of topics , bring up anew the record of past attempts to overcome the frozen barrier that forever guards the mystery of the terminal facilities of the earth 's axis . They take perspiring audiences among icebergs and Arctic storms , and divert them with a show of the clumsy antics of the walrus and the grim solitude of the Polar bear , while the aurora garnishes the scene with its fantastic lights through evenings that last for weeks . The sufferings and hardships of the dismal business of pole-hunting are forgotten in the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting ice , where the midnight breezes blow " From fields that slumber in eternal snow . " It is expected that the Gulnare will sail in a few days with the first colony that is to be planted within the Arctic Circle , to form a base of operations for the campaign against the North Pole . It will be the first planting ever done in that elevated latitude . The material for a house is to be taken along , to be put together on some eligible lot which is to be had rent free . This habitation is to be constructed with a view to resisting the ferocious winds and weather of those parts , and to securing as large a measure of comfort as the circumstances will admit of . A stock of provisions and supplies is also to be taken sufficient to last for two years . When this little colony has been placed it will be in for an experience the like of which no company of men ever before enjoyed or suffered , as the case may be ; and regarded ' from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not wholly without its attractions and advantages . It may , indeed , be conscientiously recommended to one 's troublesome acquaintances as a thing well worth trying as a change from the humdrum mode of existence with which they and their friends are wearied . Probably the crew and passengers of the Gutizame can not secure themselves against a knowledge of the results of the fierce political conflict at Chicago up to the time of sailing , but they have a hope of departing in happy ignorance of the doings of the Democratic Convention . Then , in a few days they will be beyond the reach of daily newspapers , and for two years the rumors of oppression and deceit , of unsuccessful or successful war , can , no longer disturb them . Once housed in their stanch domicile in the regions of ice , the colonists ' will live in a seclusion more impenetrable than that of dungeons or monasteries . The noise and contentions of the busy world will be shut out by a barrier so wide that not a sound of the hurly-burly will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pass , but its excitement will not touch them , and the result will be unknown in their wild retreat . Policies may be adopted or abandoned , Administrations may rise and fall , and wars may once more change the boundaries on the map of Europe or of Asia , but they will take no note of the world 's mutations during the period of their voluntary exile . There is even a possibility that some of the questions that vex mankind in this and other countries may be settled , the silver dollar made to circulate or to subside to its proper position in the monetary world , and EDISON 'S light fulfill the sanguine promise of its earliest flickerings . And there are conceivable joys in the private housekeeping of the masculine party which is to brave the dread solitudes of the far North . There will be none of the small contentions that the presence of womankind begets and none of the vexations caused by ill-bred children . The servant-girl question will afford them no annoyance . They will have no troublesome neighbors , unless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly weapons without fear of unpleasant consequences . No inconsiderate dogs or vicious prowlers of the backyard will disturb their slumbers and cause a waste of portable property or of temper . Whatever peculiarities of weather they may have to contend with , they will , at least , be secure from sweltering heat and the unseemly sights and foul odors with which it is attended in the City streets . " Far from the madding crowd 's ignoble strife , " they can pursue the even tenor of their explorations and let the world wag as it will . As to those long excursions by sledge or boat whereby they are expected to feel their way toward the Pole , these are matters in which men of science will take a peculiar interest , while common people will take comfort in thinking of them so long as the heated season lasts . When Winter comes they will cease to be interesting , if they are not altogether forgotten for the time . But just at present it is refreshing to turn from the strife of politics and give our thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish it every success .
