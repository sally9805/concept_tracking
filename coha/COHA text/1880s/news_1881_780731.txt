txt A large meeting of tenants upon the estate of Sir John Ennis unanimously resolved to demand an abatement of their rents . In the event of a refusal they will apply to the Land Court . There are upward of 5,000 tenants on the estate . LONDON , Nov. 7 . ? Lord O'Hagan , the retiring Lord Chancellor of Ireland , has been appointed a Knight of St. Patrick . Mr. Parnell , in an interview with two prominent members of the Homo Rule League on Saturday , said the recent judgments at Belfast agreed with his estimates that the rents in Ulster should be reduced to Griffith 's valuation . He believed the reductions in the South of Ireland would not be as large and , consequently , would not satisfy the tenants . Any general reduction of rents to Griffith 's valuation would , because of the extent to which land is mortgaged , deprive landlords of the means of living , and compel the Government to buy out or compensate . This would demonstrate the soundness of the views enunciated by the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly with their landlords . A Dublin correspondent says : " There can he little doubt that there will be many appeals from the decisions of the sub-commissioners under the Land act to the Central Court at Dublin . It is understood that there are legal grounds for impeaching some of their decisions . The land-owners view the great reduction in rents that has been made with alarm , and apprehend that if the same principle is carried out their property will be confiscated to a large extent and numbers of them ruined . They believe that the principle of the commission adopted at Belfast in fixing rent will hold out a premium to the indolent and incompetent farmer and visit the indulgent landlord with a penalty . " LONDON , Nov. 8 . ? A Dublin dispatch says : " A circular has been issued to the Dublin Police , instructing them immediately to report any meeting supposed to be held for League purposes , though held ostensibly for another object , with a view to the arrest of the participators . The Executive is considering what to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the report printed in the Freonan 's Journal , of an interview between him and two prominent members of the Home Rule League on Saturday , is almost wholly inaccurate and misleading . " Police stationed at the door - yesterday of the new offices of the Ladies ' Land League in Dublin took down the names of all who entered with the view to their prosecution . Mr. Andrew Marshall Porter , Queen 's Counsel , will succeed Mr. William M. Johnson as Solicitor-General for Ireland . The Standard this morning says : " In view of the great expense involved , there will be only three more sub-Commissions under the Land act for the present . Nine additional Commissioners have been appointed . " A Dublin dispatch says the now subCommissioners are appointed for one year only , the Government believing that by the expiration of that time the undue pressure of the work will have been removed . Despite the suppression of the Land League , several local branches continue to meet secretly .               @ @ @ @ @ @
