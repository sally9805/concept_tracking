txt During the trial to-day of James Arnold for the murder of his brother-in-law , named Little , at Richmond , Ky. , a few months ago , an exciting scene occurred in court . Little had charged Arnold with forging a note , which caused the difficulty . Several days have been consumed in taking the testimony in the case , and to-day the argument was in progress . The large court-room was densely crowded , largely with ladies . Senator Voorhees had concludedfor the defense , and was followed by C. J. Bronson , closing for the Commonwealth . Mr. Bronson said : " Why do n't the defense produce the note alleged to have been forged . If they had done so , I would have put him in the Penitentiary . Senator Voorhees interrupted him , saying : " You never asked us for the note . " Bronson contradicted this statement , and the two gentlemen were getting angry , when some one cried out : getting They 're going to shoot . " An indescribable panic ensued . Arnold 's brother heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then the brother made for Bronson , with pistol in hand . He was immediately arrested . THE MIMS 'S correspondent had an interview with the brother in jail , and he said he thought an attack was about to be made on the accused , and so he interfered . From the best authorities I learn that several pistols were drawn . Mrs. Little , who was present , was carried fainting from the room . One man jumped out of the window which is 30 feet from the ground . Intense excitement exists to-night , and every one expects a resumption of the difficulty to-morrow . The bar-rooms have been closed and the Police force doubled as precautions against trouble during the night . Bronson concluded his speech with locked doors , and no spectators were allowed inside .
