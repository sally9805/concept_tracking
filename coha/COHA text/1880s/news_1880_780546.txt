txt Democratic politicians who fear that the nomination of Mr. Tilden would place their party at a disadvantage which they could not hope to overcome , and who regard with alarm the indications of Mr. Tilden 's strength , which are constantly appearing , have been laboring for some time to induce the public to believe that he has withdrawn from the canvass . Statements to this effect have been industriously circulated , and they frequently find their way into the newspapers as coming from persons who are on intimate terms with Mr. Tilden . But they are read only to be forgotten , until they are repeated in a differeal ; form . Such a statement appeared in a telegram sent to Philadelphia yesterday . in relation to it , Speaker Randall said to-day tha : Mr. Tilden undoubtedly was still a candijate , and it is universally believed that Speaker Randall can speak with authority on the subject . iE any one in Washington can . It is said that Mr. Tilden did write a letter of withdrawal about two months ago , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the time in this city on important private business . was recalled to Newyork very suddenly for the purpose of receiving the document . It is also said that the Chairman 's influence was sufficient to induce Mr. Tilden to reconsider his determination . There are many persons , however , who do not believe that Mr. Tilden has ever had any intention of withdrawing his name , and so far as can be learned hero from those who ought to know , ho has no such intention at present . These gentlemen say that he will not relax his hold upon the party until compelled . to do so ; that if he does decide to withdraw it will be when the convention meets , and when ho has his forces well in hand . for delivery to some person of his own choice , and that ho could not withdraw now without disgoacefully deserting his many friends and supporters and leaving thorn in a very unenviable position .                    @
