txt According to the Treasury statement , which we publish this morning , the reduction of the public debt during the month of February was , in round numbers , $6,000 , - 000 . This reduction was made possible by the large increase in the Customs revenues , which are about $6,000,000 greater than for the corresponding month last year , while there has also been an advance over last year of a million and three quarters in the internal revenues . The increase in the Customs duties is only the natural consequence of the train of events which has been going on for months past , and requires no special comment . It is only necessary to remark in passing that , so far as can be judged from the reports to date , our imports are increasing principally in articles of luxury , and the inflation and speculation which we have frequently noted are bearing their inevitable fruit in the indulgence of extravagant ? tastes . Whether the country is , on the whole , benefited by a tariff system which limits exports principally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury , is a question which we have not now to consider . We wish rather to direct attention to the manner in which the public debt has been reduced , and to the manner in which it might have been reduced , had not our statutes fixed a hard and . fast rule for the guidance of the Treasury . As a matter of fact , the reduction has taken place in consequence of the purchase of bonds for the sinking fund , to which the payments on account of the arrears of pensions constitute an offset . The bonded debt was reduced in February by nearly $11,500,000 , while the disbursements for pensions have been about $6,000,000 . The payments on the bonded debt leave it at $1,770,000,000 , which is about $27,500,000 less than at the close of the fiscal year . Unquestionably , such a liberal payment of the bonded debt has its advantages . It reduces the annual interest-charge by a million and a half . It strengthens the credit of the Government at home and abroad , and especially abroad , where the generous meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not help but aid the process of refunding the outstanding high-rate bonds , when it shall be-undertaken , as it is probable that it soon will be . And were the financial affairs of the nation upon a safe footing at home , there would be every reason to congratulate ourselves upon this general result . But our financial affairs  --  we can not repeat it too often  --  are very far from being on a satisfactory basis , and of this the Treasury statement itself contains the evidence , which is emphasized by the facts set forth in our Washington dispatches this morning . Side by side with our bonded debt is our demand debt , one-fifth as large in amount , and which remains to-day , and by law must remain , practically at the figure at which it stood when the presentResumption law was completed by the act of 1878 . It is now $346,000,000 . By the original Resumption act , it was intended that this amount should be gradually reduced to $300,000,000 , as the national bank issues were increased ; but by the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required to reissue and keep in circulation all the demand notes of the United States which he should receive . The result of this act has been that , while the bonded debt has been steadily and even lavishly diminished , while surplus revenues , which might very properly have been devoted to the removal of burdensome taxation , have been directed to the purchase of bonds at apremium , the legal-tender notes are the same as before the law went into force which nominally provides for their payment . Under that law , not a dollar of the demand debt has been finally paid . Yet no rational business man will deny that it is this demand debtand not the bonded debt which constitutes any real danger for the credit of the United States , whatever the latter may amount to , as , whatever may be the rate of interest upon it , no one doubts that the Government will for many years to come , always be able to maintain a high standing as a borrower in the money markets of the world . and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occasion to apply to them for loans on its interest-bearing obligations , either for refunding or for any purpose . We have demonstrated our capacity and our purpose to take care of such obligations , and nothing which is likely to occur will shake the confidence which , as a nation , we have won in that direction . But it is far otherwise with our legal-tender notes . These are a peculiarly perilous form of debt , which we obstinately refuse to discharge . We have made a law which empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to " redeem " them in " coin " on demand , but we have coupled with this law another which forbids this redemption to be made equivalent to payment , and we have added still another which is constantly vitiating the character of the coin devoted to the purpose of redemption . For the time being , everything goes on smoothly under this anomalous arrangement . There is no demand for redemption and no occasion to test the capacity to redeem . But the statute remains which gives to every note an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury , as well a 's the other which is constantly increasing the percentage of depreciated silver in the coin reserve . During the last month the net gold balance has decreased by $2,000,000 and the silver has increased by the same sum . The latter now reaches $41,500,000 , or 2712 per cent . of the net cash balance in the Treasury . Under these circumstances , it is not untimely to call attention to the essential error in the employment of the surplus revenues  --  an error sanctioned and made compulsory by the statutes , but therefore only the more serious . Instead of buying interest-bearing bonds at a premium before they are due , the Treas. : - ury should be allowed and required to redeem and cancel the legal-tender notes as far as the revenues are available for that purpose . Until this policy is adopted we shall only drift nearer and nearer to the time when we shall be compelled to choose* between an irredeemable paper currency and one redeemable in silver only .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
