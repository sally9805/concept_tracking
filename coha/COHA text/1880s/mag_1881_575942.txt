FRENCH DOMESTIC LIFE AND ITS LESSONS . OTHER countries may excel France in many ways , such as England in its political attainments , Germany in its erudition and military prowess , America in its enterprise , and , going back to the past , Italy in its art refinement , Spain in its religious fervor , and so on ; hut in no country do we find in full play that equally harmonious compound of human energies , the fruit of which is summed up in the word " civilization . " Perhaps the specialty of the French , if the above // characteristics of other nations are specialties , is to be social ; in other words , to show the world what good can be got out of life without being extraordinarily great in any one direction . In any event , all people of European lineage like to go to France , and they enjoy themselves when they get there . Few care to analyze their enjoyment , either through indifference or because of the complexity of the subject . Those who are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hillebrand , recognize the importance of French social development in relation to that of their own country . The following article is an attempt to add something to this branch of literature , but from an American point of view . I begin by introducing the reader to an ordinary French house in the country , where the national mode of living can be much better studied than in Paris . In the village , behind my friend 's house , stood an old church with a rich , low-toned bell , which every morning at six o clock sounded the matins of the ages of faith the same as in medieval times . This bell commonly awoke me at that hour , whether I would or not ; but I bore it no ill-will on that account . Time with me did not " lag withal . " On arising a pleasant scene drew me to the window , where I could look through the delicate atmosphere upon a fine panorama of mountains , which , with their long , transparent shadows gradually shortening over the sloping ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could read , for there were books alongside of it ; had I a wish to do so I could write , for my room contained every convenience for this , it not being a mere sleeping compartment . One Sunday the above-mentioned holy bell " knolled me to church . " It was a fete day . There was to be a blessing of bread for general distribution , a kind of bread colored with saffron , and of which there was a stack of large round loaves standing in the church in front of the chancel . I have forgotten the name of the saint under whose sanction this ceremony took place . What especially interested me in the matter was the subject of the curd 's discourse , transubstantiation , and more especially the way in which he enforced his argument . His text was taken from the chapter in St. Matthew describing the Last Supper : " Jesus took bread and blessed it , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body . ' " " Transubstantiation must be true , my Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or our Lord was a liar ; and no one can believe that our Lord would lie ! " My friend 's house , which was plain architecturally , , stood on a plot of about eight acres , one half of which was under cultivation and uninclosed , as is usual with farm lands in France ; the rest was devoted to a vegetable garden behind the house , and in front to flowers , shrubbery , walks , and grass , all surrounded by a high stone wall pierced by an iron gate which opened on to the main street leading to the village . This stone wall being a peculiar feature of French landscape , as well as indicative of social peculiarities , I dwell on it for a moment . If you happen to be on the outside of this stone wall , you do not find it an agreeable object , especially when it hampers the view . A promenade , for instance , through the suburbs of a French town , or among the straggling houses of a French village , where nothing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gray stucco or stone wall , is , to say the least , monotonous . Get behind these walls , however , and the scene changes . You find gardens , flowers , fruit and shade trees , ranging in luxuriance and beauty all the way from the Duc de Lu.ynes 's magnificent parterres at Dampierre down to the smallest patch of ground owned by the humblest peasant . Other contrasts suggest themselves . When an American , for // instance , gets within one of these inclosures he is impressed with the air of privacy which prevails there . Privacy is one of those things for which we Americans seem to have an " imperfect sympathy . " We regard publicity as a sort of duty . We take delight in the reflection of ourselves in the public mirror . Self-exposure seems to us to be a matter of pride . We build our houses so that our neighbors can easily look in at the windows . We lay out our grounds and arrange our flower-beds and shrubbery expressly to be seen from the street . Our sentiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we do so much for the public , we naturally draw on the public for our benefit . We tolerate usurpations of private property for public uses , - when not our own . We content ourselves with a public standard of education because it is public . We find intellectual excitement in the judicial exposure of private incompatibilities and vices . We pay for hand labor , but the labor of the brain by which the public benefits we want for nothing . We not only claim the right to know the details of the lives of the men we honor , but we send reporters to ascertain how they die . When a private citizen consents to serve his country , and becomes " public property , " we tear him to pieces morally , - all of which traits , either positively or negatively , are rooted in that indifference to privacy , a respect for which is one real test of civilization . It is different with the Frenchman . His domain , his name , his features , his ideas , his works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred . No one can sell his photograph or caricature him without his consent . The product of his mind is under his own control . He not only cares to keep his premises from being intruded upon , hut no one must look into them to gratify mere curiosity . He resists encroachments , moral as well as material . Whatever sympathy he craves and gives is based on the absolute right to his own personality . In this respect for his neighbor 's individuality may be found the source of the Frenchman 's urbanity . It is likewise the key to certain French legal safeguards , such as the litigation within closed doors of family disputes when these happen to be scandalous , and the prevention of such details appearing in the newspapers . All this is symbolized in France by the stone wall which surrounds domestic life , the germ cell of all that is good in society . Some people may regard this sensibility to privacy as mere selfishness . If that is their opinion , it seems to me that one might say the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquisition on the stone wall I am keeping the reader from my friend 's unostentatious dining-room , into which I introduce him without further parley . This room contained a small round table , a set of chairs , two ranges of book-shelves , some drawings hung on the walls , and opened by a central door on a gravel walk . My friend 's family included himself and wife , a group of children , - a daughter twelve years old and a son six years old , with a niece and nephew of about the same ages as their cousins , - a paternal grandmother , and a maternal grandfather , all living together in the most harmonious relations . I may as well add to this family combination the strangers that were within my host 's gates , for these , in the country , are not infrequent in French houses ; generally invited on account of intimate associations , they are so much at home as to impress one with the idea that they were born there . The family , with their guests , usually assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wh , oever chose to remain in his cosy , well-furnished bedroom , to read , write , or take an extra nap , could do so without impoliteness , and be served at will with tea , coffee , milk , or chocolate without interfering with housekeeping // arrangements . French hospitality , it must be mentioned , takes into account personal habits , tastes , and even caprices . The entertainment of a guest does not hinge on regular or irregular habits or opinions . One of our company would remain in the salon till after midnight , talking , and the following day sleep until noon , which simply made my host regret that sleep deprived him of so much of his guest 's society . In this house the children were generally up first . On coming down-stairs , I would find them in the dining-room , and be greeted by them as if I were a relation . When the elders came in we would shake hands as each made his or her appearance . The moment the children caught sight of " grandp*re " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rose from her chair and received one from him on her brow . The same ceremony was observed on the entrance of " grandmare . " On the table stood a tureen of soupe maigre , coffee , tea , fresh milk , and chocolate , with brioches , which two dishes put in italics I wish were common on the American table . Nothing remains to be added to the details of this early breakfast except that it was enlivened by a desultory chat . When this sort of morning lunch was over we withdrew to our respective occupations . On my arrival my host told me frankly that he was very busy , and that he should be obliged to leave me largely to myself . He had public duties to perform , and was absent most of the day . I too had work to do , and was only too glad of the opportunity of doing it without prejudice to my position as guest . The truth is , apart from any other motive , one gets along better on a visit of any length by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transportable , like that of an artist , one would do well to get up such work as extra reading or correspondence , - both parties , host and guest , being gainers by it . All of this family attended to their business without apparently concerning themselves with their guests . " Madame " every morning made a tour of inspection of the garden and grounds , to trim flowers , look at the chickens , and so on , on which tours I would often accompany her . But this did not consume much time . Her chief occupation in the morning was teaching her children , for which she was well qualified . French mothers in France often - I will not say always - instruct their childrea themselves . Public primary schools are not found everywhere ; and even if they were , the best class of parents in France would not avail themselves of them . I now come to breakfast , the regular breakfast , announced by a bell suspended out-doors at one angle of the house , and which took place at eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The menu of this meal is not important . It is only the manner of serving it , and every other meal in France , which merits special remark . In France to " set the table " means , generally speaking , to put nothing on it but the implements necessary for use , such as plates , knives , forks , glass , and napkins , with carafes of water , wine , and condiments ; add to these the dessert , consisting of fruits and various bonbons , and always an accompaniment of flowers . All meats that require to be carved are cut up on dishes , at a side table , and passed around by the waiter , who likewise changes plates and watches the wants of those who are eating . Vegetables and the solids of the dessert are served in like manner . The result is such an economy of time and labor , such a relief to the heads of the house , such an absence of confusion , such mesthetic enjoyment , owing in the first place to order , and secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you , and especially to untrammeled conversation , that one wonders at the maintenance of the " good old English fashion " of a literally " groaning board , " rattling plates , incessant // interruptions , and general discomfort . The English system of serving meals may be based on a willingness to present the best the house can afford , together with a personal interest in the fullness of the supply , but I am certain that the French system has the advantage of it in quiet , comfort , and refinement . rrhe other peculiarity of the French table , a steady stream of conversation , which renders it unique , I reserve for comment when I reach what I have to say about the French dinner . After breakfast , which was sometimes followed by a half hour 's stroll through the grounds , we resumed our work . For three hours " all was still through the house . " At four o'clock in the afternoon the mail came . Newspapers and correspondence kept us occupied for a time , according to the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the hour for recreation . So regularly was recreation followed up , that I looked upon it as a family tradition . Whether walking , bathing , playing some out-door game , or making an excursion in the woods or on the water , something of this kind always occupied what remained of the afternoon . It is needless to state that everybody was the more ready for dinner on account of it . Dinner in France is supposed to be the one great event of the day . So it is , but not because it is a feeding operation . On the contrary , this French meal is a domestic symposium , in which head and heart take precedence of the stomach . The interest and value of a meal in France depend more on the social than on the culinary element . Old Izaak Walton 's dictum that the company makes the feast , and not the food , is of special significance in France . One rarely sees a Frenchman dining alone , not for the reason that he wants some one to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one to talk to . Conversation , accordingly , renders the French table unique . I am inclined to think that the modern French dinner-table is the substitute for the old salon to which the " feast of reason and the flow of soul " used to be wholly confined . In any event , the chief attraction of the French table nowadays is conversation . How it originates , and what its leading points are , is worth stating . It begins with the prattle of children . French children have a seat at table with their seniors almost as soon as weaned . What attention they receive at table depends , of course , on discipline ; the significant fact is that they mingle with their elders , at the outset of their careers , on what may be called common ground . An expression of sentiments and ideas belonging to successive stages of intellectual growth is encouraged . The effect of this custom is to secure a natural play of emotions and ideas : the child 's mind is stimulated from without ; its eyes are fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children thus treated are not made morbidly sensitive through the machinery of conscience , or distrustful of themselves through doubt of behaving in conformity with some absolute rule of conduct which a child 's mind is not capable of comprehending . It is questionable whether a French child knows what it is to behave as it " ought " to do . If it behaves badly through the innate " old Adam , " right conduct is not due to maxims , but rather to some injunction of obedience which makes the child perceive that it is agreeable or disagreeable to others . Children growing up under such treatment , expressing their feelings and ideas openly and disingenuously , with no restraint on them but that of finding themselves in unsympathetic relations , talk well and act politely bec*use they talk and act spontaneously and naturally . The abuse of this system through parental indulgence 1 The bad side of this custom is probably an over-development of the perceptive faculties , which is very remarkable in some Frenchmen . // may stimulate the child 's vanity , but it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are capable of talking , and of talking well , because there is no inward or outward brake on the natural flow of emotions and ideas . The charm of what they say does not depend on quality of idea or on mode of expression , but rather on latitude of expression . Ideas do not proceed from , nor are they hampered by , preconceived notions of what one ought to say , or believe , to show one 's knowledge , breeding , character , or aspiration . The terms " trifling , " " proper , " " highly instructive , " " light , " " serious , " and so on , either of praise or censure , and denoting what conversation should be to be edifying , have no more application to it than to the music of an opera . In few words , French conversation is not an acquired art , but a special grace , evolved out of peculiar experiences and habits ; it is not didactic or dogmatic , hut a spontaneous utterance , by young and old , of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only restraint upon the conversational facility is politeness . Irritating subjects are kept within bounds by good taste and feeling , if not by principle . Whatever indicates sectarianism is repelled ; susceptibility on account of contrary opinions is considered weakness , and the person who manifests it a bore . Earnestness , eccentricity even , is admired , but not exclusiveness . The mind possessed by one idea , the pedant , the reformer , is never twice welcome . But two sins are regarded as mortal among the French , - dullness and pretension . He or she who " poses , " either in deportment or intellectually , is ridiculed or avoided . If , in sum , the French are " good talkers from infancy to old age , " it is owing to their being cheerful , intelligent , and deferential. 1 A game of cards , named after Boston , Massachusetts , during the investment of this city by the To return to the house of my friend , with whom all these traits were conspicuous . We dined always in fair weather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from annoying insects permitted . Our table was placed on the gravel walk in the shadow of two large altheas which served to screen us from the setting sun . Those who pleased sat with their hats on . Grandm*re was ensconced in a canopy basket-chair , such as bathers use , to shield her from the breeze . Our meal lasted a couple of hours , far into the twilight , and longer still when there was a moon . On one occasion , at the dessert , my hostess favored us with a song of which the chorus involved three smart raps on the table , in time with the music , - such a thumping and rattling of glasses ! On another occasion our talk turned on the subject of ballads , whereupon my host called upon his daughter to sing one of mediowal times , lately brought to light by an eminent savant , the subject of which was Christ , in a mendicant garb , wandering about the world to test the charity of mankind . The words and music of this quaint ballad , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she sang it in the " soft stillness which becomes the touches of sweet harmony , " form , if not a typical incident , at least a charming reminiscence . After dinner came in-door amusements until bed-time . To amuse the children was the first thing . We men folks joined them in a sort of miniature ten-pins on the billiard-table . Afterwards , when mamma came in , she exercised them in a game of questions designed to perfect them in their knowledge of history and geography . At length the bonne appeared , which was the signal for their withdrawal , and they kissed us good-night . After their departure the rest sat down to a game of " Boston , " at which grandm*re was English in our Revolutionary War , at which time it was invented in France . One of its terms , sai. // specially diverted . At eleven o'clock some simple beverage was brought in , and then we parted for the night . This simple melody of existence had its variations . A magnificent walnuttree on the place shaded a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , with two other young ladies who lived near by , frequently came to play this game . This gentleman was about sixty , and he played well ; but , being one of those ardent , impulsive , domineering Frenchmen who do not believe in anybody 's capacity but their own , he made the game a serious affair . On failing to score a point , which was rare , he winced , but said nothing ; let any one on his side do the same thing , and he visited them with a torrent of critical instruction which made one tremble . What struck me most on these occasions was to see a man of his years as lively and youthful , and as much absorbed with the game , as any of the young folks . Another thing struck me even to astonishment , namely , three young women of about twenty , in plain but becoming attire , outspoken , natural , easy , and so much occupied with their game as not to be aware that anybody was looking at them . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The invitation involved a ride back in the mountains to a certain town whose prosperity was largely due to the intercourse of its inhabitants with the United States . Some of its citizens had emigrated to this country , and returned home with ample fortunes . A statue , indeed , was to be inaugurated the following week , on its little public square , in honor of one of these , who had died and bequeathed to the commune a fine hospital . Our party was a merry one . Two of the young ladies , sisters , above referred to , accompanied us . The archness and gayety of these young people ; their joyous exs*re , denotes a supposed phase of the siege . The game is made up from whist and one called reeer clamations at the striking features of the scenery ; their glee , fun , and frolic ; in short , the charm of fresh , innocent , unaffected , impressionable natures , prevailed with me over the beauties of the landscape . In the midst of our jollity grandm*re became somewhat fatigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalet alongside of it under the cliff from which the water fell in one plunge , my host concluded to stop and have her rest there until our return . Keeping on our course , we soon reached the town , nestling at the foot of precipitous mountains bounding one side of the valley , and which , with its quaint architecture and winding streets , had a special interest ; but it was too clean to be picturesque . Repairs were visible , and there was a good deal of fresh paint and whitewash . Mediteval dirt seemed to have been washed off , and there was no dilapidation about it , nor disagreeable odors , all of which probably shows the reaction of the New World on the Old through the more cleanly habits of its Americanized and prosperous inhabitants . A fete day , however , enhanced its attractions . The people , dressed in their Sunday 's best , - which by the bye was not homespun , but consisted mostly of the brilliant products of the modern loom , - thronged the streets , or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what was going on in the streets . The young ladies of our party had relatives in the town , one of whom , an uncle , had died the year before . As they had not been there since his death , they proposed to visit the cemetery . Obtaining the key , we followed them outside the town , where we found the city of the dead , like the mansions of the living , surrounded by silent , towering old mountains . The cemetery was overrun with weeds , and its walls were dilapidated . In one corner , however , stood a plain mural s , fashionable in the time of Louis XIV. , as we see Ps Madame de Sdvignd 's letters . // tablet with a neat iron railing before it , hung with wreaths of immortelles and inclosing a small area of ground decked with flowers . " There , " said one of the sisters in a low voice , " is my uncle 's grave ; " both then went to the grave , knelt down side by side , bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . When we left the cemetery the sun had disappeared behind the mountains . Our homeward ride in the evening light was more grave than gay . My host and his mother stood awaiting our coming at the cascade . On taking their seats in the vehicle , they told us all about a poor girl whom they bad seen in the chalet , bent almost double with an affection of the spine , but who was nevertheless as cheerful as if she had been in the most perfect health . On asking her parents how this affliction had come upon her , they simply replied that they did not know ; " it was the will of le hon D*eu . " The incident excited comment on the great comfort of religious faith in such cases . My host said that it reminded him of Turg*nieff 's vivid description of a similar case in Les Reliques Vivantes . The next day he dispatched a package of dainties , together with a few books , to add something to the enjoyment of the poor girl 's life . Another variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely summer day chanced to be the anniversary of my host 's birth . In other words , it was " papa 's " fete day . We had been occupied as usual until just before dinner , when , as my host and myself were talking together , madame beckoned me to join her behind the house . " Ah ! " exclaimed my host , turning away , " I know what that means . " Obeying the summons , I found madame distributing bouquets to the little group which had assembled there out of sight ; two each to her father , to the four children and the bonne , with two for myself . Forming in procession , with madame at the head of it , we marched along in single file to the front of the house , where papa and grandm*re appeared , seated side by side , the latter in her basketchair . Shouting , laughing , and singing , the old and the young together , we advanced in the highest glee . Mamma first presented her bouquets , and was affectionately embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in turn presented theirs , down to the bonne , all being greeted alike . After this the little boy stood before his papa and recited a fable in French , which was followed by one in English recited by his sister , and the ceremony was over . We then seated ourselves at the table . Is it necessary to add that our dinner was hilarious , and that the day is an ever bright one in memory 's calendar ? The reader may think the foregoing commonplace . Perhaps it is . If so , the fault is more mine than that of the subject . Or , if he is willing to accept it as truthful portraiture , he may charge me with trying to convey a general impression by an exceptional instance . This I can not admit . What I have stated indicates the spirit of French domestic life everywhere . It is characteristic of life in France , from that of the peasant up to that of the aristocrat . It may be different with the purely moneyed or luxurious class , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum up the leading features of French domestic life , - work , play , and affection . In the foregoing example of it my host worked , his wife worked , the grandparents worked , the children worked , and their guests worked - if they had a mind to . But this work was , as Dr. Coan well observes , that which consists in " natural power healthfully exerted . " When work was over time was devoted to recreation , while the whole was gilded by affection ; it is to me living , in the best sense of the term . And so is it everywhere in France , according to facilities , aptitudes , and discipline . In French domiciles generally , // the racket of the machinery of life is not heard ; nor is the machinery kept out of sight by furniture and specious formality . Worn features do not betray an undercurrent of toil , care , and anxiety ; one is not obliged to accept mute repose as recreation , nor forced attempts to say something as successful efforts at pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be complementary colors in French domesticity . Nor are the comforts and enjoyments of life due to money . In the foregoing instance my host was a plain bourgeois , having no exceptional advantage but culture and an income sufficient for moderate wants . rrhe only supplement to this income was the produce of his small estate , which about paid the wages of his servants . Of course in this situation , compared with an American situation on the same social plane , my host had the advantage of a superior class of domestics , lower wages , and a degree of public order externally which is unknown to us . But it is not these advantages , or money , or fine houses , or advanced theories of progress which enable French people to live and live well . The secret of it lies in contentment . French people are tolerably well satisfied with their lot in life and their position in society . Whatever they do to improve these , they do not overstep the limitations of means and education . No Frenchman is anxious to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction ; nor is lie prompted to move out of it by restlessness and ambition . In any event , when he does yield to the temptation of gain or to better himself in any way , he is too shrewd to do it at the expense of mind , body , capital , and family . French life , in the words of Matthew Arnold , exhibits a " serenity and dignified freedom from petty cares " which we rarely encounter . It is now pertinent to assign some of the causes of these social traits . I shall cite but three or four : climate and soil , kinds of labor , system of religious discipline , and the institution of the family , the last mentioned being the most important . Climate and soil have a good deal to do with French social characteristics . The climate of France is a happy mean between the two extremes of temperature ; it is never so cold for any length of time as to make a subsistence precarious and people over-provident , nor ever warm enough to render them indolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and exceptionally fertile ; the products of France are extensively consumed all over the world , while the rivers of the country and its range of seacoast enable them to be cheaply and readily exported . Wealth is therefore easily acquired . The people born on the soil love to stay there , emigration never being the least of two evils . Kind of labor , and its ratio of compensation has much to do with social characteristics . While certain species of labor tend to enfeeble the body and keep man brutal , others strengthen it and add to his refinement . Manufacturing labor seems to be more prejudicial to human development than agricultural labor . The large centres of population which it creates appear to favor degeneracy . People living in manufacturing districts are not so healthy as those who live on farms , with the advantage of more air and sunshine . If the manufacturing class is as thrifty as any other , it does not enjoy the same security for its investments ; no deposit in a bank is so reliable as that which accrues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , are more the victims of commercial and political convulsions . In manufacturing towns , too , is begot that half-knowledge which renders the laboring class discontented as well as turbulent , as we see among the French communists , who are all denizens of large towns and cities . Next after this is the // ratio of compensation for labor in relation to its quality , which is another important social agency . Artistic labor , skilled labor , that which is done with the least waste of mental and bodily vigor , and accompanied with the highest wages , is that which best develops the individual for the advantage of society . In France agricultural labor is of this description , the energy which it calls forth being better indemnified than elsewhere . French crops , on the average , bring in more money to their cultivators than those of any other country do to their cultivators . But the most valuable labor to France , morally and materially , is that which flows from French artistic sentiment , which sentiment is supposed to be a racial advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people enjoy ( of which the source will be indicated farther on ) , coupled with superior material advantages , as above mentioned , and greater educational facilities . French taste and economy issue from this artistic sentiment . The so-called practical habits of the French , their capacity for organization , both of which traits show superior calculation of means to ends , are due to this sentiment . Proofs of French success in this line may be found all the way up from the administration of the kitchen to that of the kingdom . The next cause , purely psychological , which throws some light on the social traits of the French consists of the system of religious discipline under which they have been brought up . This , as every one knows , is the system of Catholicism . I must premise to the reader that , in what follows , I am not advocating that system , but am simply endeavoring to show how certain effects are produced by a mental process which Catholicism illustrates better than Protestantism . Two cardinal principles underlie the systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . In the mind of the Protestant , conscience is the sole authority ; in the mind of the Catholic , conscience is not an authority . The Protestant , thinking for himself , judges his own and others ' conduct ; the Catholic , whatever he may do with others ' conduct , submits his own to his church . These are the two principles with which each , respectively , starts in life . Another detail of Protestant conviction must be stated , which is that man is naturally wicked . The Catholic thinks so , too ; but as his church takes his sins on its back , this thought does not trouble his conscience . We will now trace the effects of these two different theories . The Protestant , in whom conscience presides over " heart , temper , and action , " begins very early to watch his emotions . lie accordingly checks them before they fully ripen . Through an early planting in the mind of the idei* of perversity , his emotions are unduly bridled ; natural , healthy impulses are nipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not maturing , they become dulled , not alone through inward restraint , but through a lack of the sympathetic reaction which proceeds from their contact with those of other people . Emotional habits , so to say , are more or less suppressed or perverted . Conduct of all kinds , consequently , in a mind thus turned in on itself , is tried by a subjective standard . It is difficult , for instance , for a mind thus disciplined to admit the excellence of a superior intelligence . Feeling , abnormally arrested , languishes through insufficient nutriment , or flows powerfully in one direction , the same as when , on pinching the sprays of a grape-vine , its leaves become unusually large . Whatever character may gain in stability by this order of self-discipline it loses in gentleness , delicacy , and geniality . Considered in relation to religious discipline , the value and beauty of this character do not appear until manhood , when the battle of // life has to be fought on an independent ground . The system of Catholicism produces different results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; checks on the emotions come from without , which checks conscience early in life is never aware of . Personal conviction is not the test of one 's own or of other people 's conduct . The self-discipline of an ignorant or impassible nature is not the court of last appeal in estimating an intelligent , sensitive , cultivated nature . Catholicism not leaving the mind free , it is not harassed by doubts , nor does it flatter itself with self-made opinions . Instead of emotional habits being suppressed or perverted by a self-questioning process , they are fostered by outward influences , which , it is true , are brought to bear for ulterior objects , but which nevei*theless leave the emotions to a certain extent free . This freedom is allowed during youth . It is in youth that the emotions take root . Catholicism in the early stages of life brings them out , waters them , feeds them , and protects them from the outside world . Whatever spiritual walls it erects around the emotions , these walls inclose a sufficiently large moral area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vines , leaves , and flowers of the imagination as not to be regarded as barriers to free-will . This method of mental discipline is not for adults , who think for themselves , but it eminently favors in the young the growth of cheerfulness , vivacity , joyousness , and enthusiasm , qualities that are incompatible with a system of restraint which engenders doubt . Certain facts on a large scale seem to demonstrate the truth of the foregoing theory . Protestant nations , with whom conscience is all-powerful , are not remarkable to anything like the same extent as Catholic nations for either social or artistic attainments . France is more noted for social qualities than England , while the same is true of Southern Germany , which is Catholic , in contrast with INorthern Germany , which is Protestant . Again , Italy , Spain , France , Belgium , and even holland , all more or less inspired by Catholic ideas and culture , take precedence in art of any Protestant country . The secret of it is a freer emotional development . In literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - an epoch that grew out of the emancipation of human emotions from absolute theological rule , - Shakespeare and the rest , were the prodnet of the Catholic regime . No one can read Milton without recognizing that his was an emotional nature of the finest stamp in unnaLural conflict with the restraints of Protestantism . I now come to the last of the causes which seem to account for the great charm of French domestic life , - the institution of the family . We Americans have the word family , but not the thing itself ; at all events , the word with us does not convey the same meaning as with the French . Here , again , it is necessary to present a contrast , that the difference may be easily perceptible . The formation of the American family is simple ; scarcely any condition is requisite for parentage but the age of puberty . Any energetic young man may choose his mate ; any young woman may accept for her husband whoever pleases her . Fair opportunity is afforded to each to ascertain the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . It is not incumbent on either party to furnish capital with which to commence the business of life ; nothing is deemed necessary but mutual faith and unbounded hope . As far as any legal or social restraint goes , both parties may morally gratify that natural social instinct which makes one flesh of two complementary halves . Did subsequent knowledge and experience keep alive the sentiment with which a union of this kind is formed , // and so maintain a series of material conditions in harmony with the first step which costs , the American family would be perfect . When children come to the family thus constituted , education begins . The American boy is fairly prepared for manhood ; he is early impressed with the idea that he is an independent factor , and has to make his own way in the world . The girl is prepared for womanhood on the same principle ; she is early impressed with the equivalent and natural idea that she is to choose a husband . It would be unjust to say that these ideas are positively inculcated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social atmosphere which , like exhalations from the ground , seize youth mentally as malaria seizes the body . But even if this were not the case , the degree of improvideiit and unrestrained instincts which obtains with us would be quite sufficient to warrant such conceptions in youthful brains . As far as the conservative influence of property goes in the formation of the American family , none is inherent in its organization . Every American has the right to do as he pleases with his own ; consequently , he has the right to disinherit his children . This principle of personal independence and personal right , indeed , underlies all our activity , and is only to be restricted through the severest experiences . As things now are , property and fortune in the American family are accumulated more for the advantage of the boy than for the girl ; seldom is a girl sure of a cent from her parents on forming a matrimonial alliance . Money is sometimes furnished to the young man to start him in business , while the girl , on entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without it . In France , as soon as the girl is born , the parents begin to save for her dot . Some people think that the American theory , as above shown , begets tire virtue of self-reliance ; they must remem her that excessive self-reliance is the leading characteristic of the savage . The moral restraints growing out of this hap-hazard combination of individuals into a family group are likewise feeble . Parental cares and duties , the material difficulties of living , prevent both father and mother from carefully superintending the education of their offspring . The common-school system , a vast public machine which too largely relieves them of the trouble , takes their place . They are also powerless in the regulation of their children 's associations : girls , in spite of parents , find their own friends , while boys do likewise , and seek their own amusements . One of the proofs of the ease with which this is done is the fact that young people often engage themselves , and indeed marry , without their parents ' knowledge . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is true of literature and religion : children are free to select their own reading and their own spiritual advisers . It is by no means an uncommon thing to see American families divided on theological questions . The law affords but little protection to the American family as a distinct , organized institution . With the exception of the ordinances concerning marriage as a civil contract and certain marital restrictions for the sake of order , the laxity of which is apparent in the facility with which divorces and separations are procured ; the regulation of a wife 's dowry , simply a post-mortem guarantee of support ; and the laws compelling parents to support minors , there is none of any positive importance . Children are not required to support parents , while the principle of paternal authority is of scarcely any significance either in legislation or through tradition . The emancipation of the child is complete on its attaining a legal age . The individual , with us , is the unit of society . Political freedom is made the criterion of social // freedom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . The American family , consequently , is simply an aggregation of human units , with few principles of cohesion except those of natural instinct . One illustration will be sufficient to show this state of things in all its bearings : a man in America may marry a woman , have six children by ber , obtain a divorce on the ground of incompatibility of temper , wed another woman , settle all his property on her , disinherit the children by the first wife , and still move about , unquestioned and unchallenged . In this case are summed up all the evils that flow from " the right to do as one pleases . " Thanks to superior facilities for earning money in this new country , and the ease with which women can procure husbands , the family system , or rather lack of it , is thus far comparatively innocuous . The demoralization which ensues from it will be fully apparent when , through the pressure of population , there arises a worse conflict of rights and interests than is now imminent . In France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated and carefully guarded social compact . It forms the unit of society . Outside of the family individuals are , in a measure , so much refuse material ; the state awards them protection , but their interests and capacities are not considered in the polity of the country as of chief importance . The formation of a family in France is a serious affair . Sentiment has a good deal to do with it , but not the fleeting sentiment of youthful inexperience ; its organization is based on the wear and tear of life for the good of the community . Instead of two young independent factors being allowed to form an irresponsible union , they are obliged to submit to the dictates of experience and good sense . The likings of two parties are heeded and respected , but they are not the ultimate criterion of fitness ; the important things required in the formation of a family are a sufficient amount of capital , giving a guarantee that it will be kept up , also a proper degree of social equality . Unions in France made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is brought about through the management of the dot or dowry question . Hence the formalities of the marriage contract , the moral issues of which are ten times greater than its material issues . In the French family , education begins with children as it does in the American family . But the system of education is radically different . I do not follow up that of boys , in which the difference is less perceptible ; but that of girls , in whom , as it should be , the integrity , beauty , and perpetuity of the family is vested . It is sufficient to state that the French girl grows up almost wholly under maternal supervision ; literally , she is never out of her mother 's sight . It might be supposed that she has a hard time of it , which is not the case . She is not stinted in pleasures or associates . Almost any French family , as far as these go , supply to girls in their teens more real enjoyment in one month than girls anywhere else obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dwarfed by nursery ways , by the formal prescriptions of a governess , or by theories of riding , driving , huiiting , visiting , or voting . She sits at table with her elders from infancy up , listens to their conversation , shares in their amusements , and is never overlooked in their out-door recreations . The French girl grows up an integral part of a system which , it is not too much to say , is specially devised for her benefit . These habits , through which the integrity as well as vigor of feminine nature is preserved , are not so much matters of intellectual direction as they are the combined result of legislation and custom . One of the important principles // of the French family , sanctioned both by law and tradition , is that of paternal authority .. All the stipulations of the marriage contract , in which the property rights of man and wife are equitably adjusted and fully understood beforehand , are made subservient to this cardinal principle . The administration of all family interests in relation to society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises , investments , the location of the family , and who pronounces on the settlement of children by marriage or otherwise . The great idea is this : he is the natural protector and director of the family unit . This supreme authority , the grandeur as well as the abuse of which is apparent in the Mirabeau family , is never lost sight of . If latent and imperceptible , it is always active when the occasion calls for it . It never lapses . At the father 's death it becomes vested in the mother ; and if both die , and there are no grandparents living , it reverts to a family council . The child grows up conscious of and obedient to this authority . The French husband , at the same time , is not wholly " free to do as he likes with his own ; " he can not alienate his property to the disadvantage of his chilcfren , as his freedom of bequest is strictly limited . The value of his power is essentially moral . In relation to sons , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indulge in the wildest dissipation , but he can not marry and thus victimize a new series of existences , before he is thirty , without his father 's consent . Should he do so , he imperils his patrimony and forfeits all claim to respect . Generally speaking , by the time a young man reaches the age of thirty he has sown his wild oats , and is ready to avail himself of family privileges and family protection . The greatest benefit of this family organization enures to the daughter . She grows up in close sympathy with her mother , reverencing her father , and , if conscious of being a matrimonial object , content to let her parents decide for her in this as always before in other matters . The mother is the constant guardian of her daughter 's purity , and in the organization of the family is a guarantee of her intellectual iii tegrity . I say nothing of the conservative effect of religious , observances . More important than these is the protection a French young girl enjoys against current theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Again , she is carefully protected from the fas* cinations of amusements and literature . Three significant channels of mental corruption are accordingly under control in the French family : gossip , the press , and the theatre . As to gossip , which is a much more educational instrumentality than people imagine , the mother , like an engineer on duty , lets on just as much steam as she pleases ; whatever curiosity this may excite , the mother is the judge to what extent it shall be gratified . If newspapers are allowed for perusal , they are of that class , fortunately possessed by the French , that do the minimum of mischief in the way of worldly information . The American reader who finds the best French newspaper uninteresting may judge whether girls would be likely to take to them . There is a good deal more circumspection in relation to novels and the stage . Improper novels do not find their way into the family circle . Perhaps they do surreptitiously , but even then they prove innocuous on taking into account free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whoever frequents French theatres and sees how few " pretty girls " there are in the house , can readily appreciate family discipline in this direction . The French girl , it must be understood , is not excluded from either of these sources of entertainment any more than she is excluded from a dinner ; care only is taken that the healthy intellectual nutriment which gossip , the press , and the // theatre afford shall not be rendered deleterious by social and literary condiments better adapted to stronger palates . Through this system of circumspection the emotional element of a French girl 's nature is confined to the heart rather than to the head ; in other words , the natural current of feeling is not diverted into that engendered by uncontrolled curiosity . The French girl grows up , accordingly , dependent to a great extent on the affections , absorbed in the lives of the persons around her , and hence more confiding in human beings generally . Radicals in France , those who are attacking the established order of things , sneer at and ridicule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue the point with them . One of its effects is to preserve intact the feminine qualities most prized and sought after by men , the high estimate of which is the guarantee of their own civilization and refinement ; and another is to preserve and fortify that spirit of trust in and fidelity to man which is natural to woman , when honorably treated , and which characterizes all epochs of Vigorous social development . The absence of solicitude in these matters anywhere is more due to egoism than to philanthropy . The foregoing sketch of the French family , meagre as it is , may serve to explain both the repose and brightness of French domestic life . The secret of it lies in the solidarity of feeling and interests which its members enjoy . The large and small wheels of the family organization are adjusted so as to keep excellent time . Fathers and mothers , through the wise provisions of the nuptial contract , which anticipates the contingencies of a matrimonial career , are not harried by cares and duties , and have time to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit immensely by parental leisure and freedom from anxieties . Children are not rendered precocious by " glittering generalities , " nor hardened by neglect and the absence of sympathy : the boy has an opportunity to obtain knowledge without worrying about an unknown future , while a girl is not thrown too rudely back upon the chances of a situation which makes marriage , with us , a mere lottery . INone of the parties forming the French family are floating about on an ocean of uncertainty , at once solicitous and reckless of the passing hour . It is a harbor of refuge at all times , to all its members . In it the aged are sure of support in their declining years , while it is a retreat for the prodigal , whose sins are readily forgotten . The French family , in short , is a fold in which human emotions work more naturally for human happiness than is commonly seen elsewhere . A comprehension of the French family organization furnishes a key to a great many phenomena of the national life . It largely helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that patriotic sentiment which has a deeper root than in purely material interests ; that love of country which makes the children of the soil , never too many to be supported on it , unwilling to emigrate from it , and , when they do , which brings them back to it with tenfold ardor ; that capacity for recuperation when reduced by adversity ; that admiration , in fine , which the people of all countries instinctively , and sometimes intelligently , yield to France as a remarkable centre of civilization . 1Jokn Durand.
