LONG before a boy or a girl is required to write composition at school , influences have been at work which affect his or her English for better or for worse . The descendant of men and women who have for generations habitually spoken and written the mother-tongue with correctness and ease will naturally use better English than the child of illiterate parents ; and if he be so fortunate as to have a nurse whose language is not very faulty , a mother who speaks good English herself , and takes pains to give a wise direction to her children 's reading , playmates - if such can be imagined-who are not addicted to slang or ungrammatical expressions , and teachers who are neither prigs nor slovens in their use of language , he will , other things being equal , retain the superiority he had at birth . Not that a well-born and carefully nurtured boy has it all his own way even in the matter of English . His ancestors may have talked or written themselves out , and have left him , like the barren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His facility with words may be a facility fatal not only to thought , but also to strength and directnes , s of expression . A family , on the other hand  --  the Carlyles or the Hawthornes , for examplewhich has for generations dealt with things rather than with words , may at length produce a great writer , in whom the wisdom long amassed in silence finds literary expression ; a writer who , to be sure , has to make exceptionally arduous exertions to acquire complete command of language , but who inherits the energy and the persistency that lead to success in every undertaking . In the matter of education , too , the race may be to those who possess " staying qualities " rather than to the well-equipped , to the tortoise rather than to the hare . One boy who has all possible advantages in his home and his school may fail to profit by them ; another boy may feel his disadvantages so keenly , and will try so resolutely to overcome them , that he can not but succeed-up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be languidly correct , and nothing more , or it may , in an unguarded moment , fall into errors that have the charm of forbidden fruit ; the speech of the un der-cultivated may abound in faults , and yet may have life and movement . Into the hands of the teacher of English come pupils who differ thus widely from one another in everything that can be affected by birth or by early training . Since they began to talk they have been talking English ( good , bad , or indifferent ) as Moliere 's M. Jourdain talked prose , without knowing it ; but they have as yet written nothing except exercises in penmanship and spelling , and brief letters to mother or father , which were read with the eyes of affection , not disposed to be critical . Now , for the first time , they are asked to write an English composition . The conditions under which they are to write differ in different schools . Some teachers leave their pupils great freedom in the choice of topic , in order that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is interested in ; others prescribe a subject , in order that the unpracticed hand may be held close to a definite line of work ; others vary their method , in order to adjust it to the individual needs of each pupil ; and this , when practicable , is undoubtedly the best plan . Whatever the method , the result will probably be the same-failure . Even she whose talk is the life of the school at recess , writes as if she were on her good behavior at a funeral . Even he who takes the lead among his fellows in everything that requires quickness of wit , becomes insufferably dreary the instant he puts pen to paper . If the lively become dull , and the quick-witted sluggish , when they undertake to write compositions , what must be the condition of their less clever companions ? Unhappy pupils of a more unhappy teacher ! That the difficulty of which I have spoken is real and is all but universal will be admitted by every one who has had much to do with the compositions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of the trouble and as to the remedy to be applied . What reason is there , in the nature of things , why a boy who talks well should not write well , if he can be made to us the pen as naturally as lie uses his tongue , or , in other words , to forget himself in what he is writing , as he forgets himself while talking with his playmates ? Why , but because this if is a lion in the way ? // A boy must have written much before he can form his letters without special pains ; and much more before he can set down what he has to say without stumbling over punctuation , spelling , and grammar ; and more still before he can write with facility . Now , so long as a boy has to struggle at every step with difficulties connected with the machinery of writing , so long lie will not give his mind to the thing to be written , not only because his mind is otherwise employed , but also because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance of what he is writing is entirely different from that of one who is obliged to pay attention to penmanship and other minutia connected with the process of putting words upon paper . If the ill success of beginners in English composition be justly attributable to their inability to retain freshness and life while struggling with mechanical difficulties at every step , it is evident that the methods of teaching in our schools are radically defective ; for a sound method would prevent both the sacrifice of substance to form , and that of form to substance . A sound method would teach a young writer that he should not , on the one hand , purchase correctness of expression by dullness , and should not , on the other hand , be interesting at the cost of accuracy in the use of language . Dullness is death ; ignorance of elementary rules stamps a man as illiterate , and illiteracy seriously injures the influence even of a powerful writer with educated men , and impairs it with the uneducated . Many teachers , however , act as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuate correctly than that he should write an essay which it is a pleasure to read . Others , in the fear of killing the life out of a composition , pass lightly over errors in grammar , and leave spelling and punctuation to take care of themselves . Others still  --  and this I believe to be the most numerous class-try to achieve both objects at once , and fail of achieving either , their pupils being usually characterized by a mediocrity of attainment ; they have ceased to he natural and spontaneous , and they are oppressed by the obligation to form their sentences correctly , but do not know how to fulfill that obligation . Boys who have received no instruction in English composition before going to college seem to be better off , on the whole , than those who have had such instruction as is sometimes given . A boy fresh from a single reading of a novel , for example , or from a single representation of a play of Shakespeare , will , if he has been thoroughly interested in the story , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been drilled on every chapter in the novel or every scene in the play . It is possible so to treat the most interesting books as to make them burdensome rather than interesting or stimulating to the youthful mind . I have heard of a boy who came down from his room groaning at his misfortune in having been kept in-doors by his work . " What is the woe this time ? " asked his sympathizing aunt . " Oh , I had to read ten chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield . " In another school a boy was expected to get three hundred pages of Henry Esmond into his mind within twenty-four hours . In still another school the class went through the same book at a snail 's pace , the teacher doing his best to transform a lively narrative into a series of tedious exercises . Instead of calling attention to the main points of the story , to the characteristics of the principal personages , or to beauties of *tyle , he spent his strength on unimportant details , demanding , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage of Viscou ntess Castlewood , including an answer to the important questions whether the first vegetable to hit Father Holt was a cabbage , a carrot , or a potato . In a school of a very different class the study of English authors is made so interesting that pupils who are preparing for colleges which have no examination in English are in the habit of joining the class in this subject for their own pleasure - an anomaly , I believe , in the annals of American institutions of learning . As regards the result of such teaching of English as is given in some of our best schools and academies , I may be pardoned for referring to my own observation . Since 1873 , when Harvard College for the first time held , an examination in English , I have read from four to five thousand compositions written in the examinationroom upon subjects drawn from books which the candidates were required to read before presenting themselves . Of these not more than a hundred  --  to make a gen // erous estimate-were creditable to either writer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one who did makes this report : " Few were remarkably good , and few extraordinarily bad ; a tedious mediocrity was everywhere . " It is this tedious mediocrity which has amazed me year after year . In spelling , punctuation , and grammar some of the books are a little worse than the mass , and some a great deal better ; but in other respects there is a dead-level , unvaried by a fresh thought or an individual expression . Almost all the writers use the same commonplace vocabulary  --  a very small one - in the same confused way . One year , after reading two or three hundred compositions on " The Story of The Tempest , " I found myself in such profound ignorance of both plot and characters that I had to read the play to set myself right again . The authors of these discouraging manuscripts were , almost all of them , " Just at the age twixt boy and youth , When thought is speech , and speech is truth . " They may be justly regarded as the picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best families in point of culture and breeding , and from the best schools we have . They were all boys with blood in their veiiis , and brains in their heads , and tongues that could talk fast enough and to the purpose when they felt at ease . Many of them had enjoyed The Tempest - as who that can understand it does not ?  --  but somehow the touch of pen or pencil paralyzed their powers . If the dreary compositions written by the great majority of candidates for admission to college were correct in spelling , intelligent in punctuation , and unexceptionable in grammar , there would be some conipensation ; but this is so far from being the case that the instructors of English in Americaii colleges have to spend much of their time and strength in teaching the A B C of their mother-tongue to young men of twenty-work disagreeable in itself , and often barren of result . Every year Harvard graduates a certain number of men-some of them high scholars-whose manuscript would disgrace a boy of twelve ; and yet the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to conduct an infant school for adults . Is there any remedy for this state of things ? I venture to say that there is ; but it is one which demands persistent and long-continued work , and hearty co-operation on the part of all who have to do with the use of English in the schools in any form and for any purpose . It requires intelligent supervision at one time , intelligent want of supervision at another time , and watchful attention constantly . It requires a quick sense of individual needs , and ready wit to provide for them as they arise . My plan is briefly as follows : 1 , I would begin as early as possible to overcome the mechanical difficulties of writing , and would use all practicable means and all possible opportunities to do so ; 2 , I would not frighten a boy with " compositions , " so called , till he could form his seiitences with tolerable correctness , and use his pen with freedom ; but , 3 , when he was set to work writing compositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time should be made to take an interest in what he is doing , and should be impressed with the importance of having something to say , and of saying that soniething in an intelligible and a natural manner . ( 1 . ) As to the first point . The work should begin as early as possible . As soon as a child has learned to form his letters without trouble , his attention should be called , not only to spelling , punctuation , and grammar , but also to the choice of words and to the construction of simple sentences . He should be shown what in language is conventional , and what is founded in reason . Whatever is done should be done thoroughily . Children should be obliged to master every point that comes under the head of correctness ; and in this matter the instructor should not spare himself . Some teachers prefer to spend time on the curiosities of language or in the pleasant places of literature rather than in the correction of petty errors ; but unless petty errors are corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be . Knowledge of conventional rules is , of course , of incomparably less importance than is the possession of those qualities in style which give a man the power to influence other men 's thoughts and actions ; but the rudiments of English form a part of every well-organized system of instruction . To omit them altogether , or to postpone them too long , is to act like a // student in architecture who should pay no attention to questions of construction , or should take them up for the first time after he had acquainted himself with the mysteries of the so-called Queen Anne style . Such an architect might forget to leave room in his plan for a necessary staircase , and his chimneys would surely smoke . Such a writer would **robably be lame in his grammar , and would surely not know how to spell or to punctuate . Not that I would , in pursuance of Mr. Benjamin F. Butler 's advice , replace the spelling-book in its former commanding Position in the schools , and compel boys and girls to learn long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; but every one should be able to spell the words that are often on his lips , or often under his eye in the books he studies or reads . Not that I would perplex a young mind with punctuation as a system , or with nice questions between semicolons and colons ; but every one ought at an early age to be taught the difference between the period and the comma , and the principal functions of each ; every one should be taught , too , the general principle that a point serves as a guide to the construction , and through the construction to the meaning , of a sentence . Above all , the time and the energies of the young should ' not be wasted upon formal grammar . " As lie " ( man ) , says Bacon , " hath striven against the first general Curse by the Invention of all other Arts , so hath he sought to come forth of the second general Curse , which was the confusion of Tongues , by the Art of Grammar , whereof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue more ; but most in such Foreign Tongues as have ceased to be Vulgar Tongues , and are turned only to learned tongues . " The misfortune of our schools has been that they have transferred the nomenclature and the system of " the learned tongues " to " the mother-tongue , ** in which , as Bacon truly says , " the use of grammar is small . " The consequ*nce has too often been that the art which , according to Bacon , was invented to relieve man from the second general curse , has become a third curse . Within the last few years , as we all like to believe , this curse has in a measure been lightened . Even teachers of Latin and Greek have ceased to load the memories of boys and girls with rules and exceptions , and are giving the necessary information by the way , as it were , and in a manner that enables their pupils to perceive some relation between the facts of grammar and the language and literature studied . The best instructors in English are moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving far enough or fast enough . It is high time that every vestige of the Lindley Murray system-parsing , analysis of sentences , and the like , as well as grammatical rules and exceptions-was swept out of the schools . Even the names of the parts of speech might be left to take care of themselves , as the names of the letters of the alphabet are left in the case of children who learn to read by words instead of by letters . The main point is , not that a child should know that a given word in a sentence is a noun , another a preposition , another an adverb of manner  --  or whatever it may be called in the treatise in vogue at the moment  --  but that he should understand the meaning of a sentence as a whole . Several hours judiciously used should suffice to teach an intelligent boy the few points of grammar which it is most important to know ; for the assertion that English is a " grammarhess tongue , " though an exaggeration  --  and a harm*u1 one if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form in words are much fewer and the rules of syntax far simpler in our language than in most others . A few nouns form peculiar plurals , a few verbs peculiar participles , and a very few verbs are peculiar throughout ; but most of these exceptions occur in words which everybody uses so often that it is easy to learn the correct forms . A similar remark may be made concerning who and whom , I and me , and the other pronouns . Let a boy be taught to put his pronouns in the proper cases , and to place them where the reference to the antecedents is plain ; to couple singulars with singulars and plurals with plurals ; to observe the distinction between shall and will ; to insert every word that is essential to the sense and to strike out every word that is superfluous ; to put verbs referring to the same time in the same tense ; not to destroy a negative by doubling it ; not to interpolate adverbs between words that form a single expression , as in to blindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , therefore , to God " ( the expression of a well-known // American writer in a moment of excited logic ) - let a boy be taught these things , and lie will be far on the road toward correct expression . Grammatical accuracy is , in my judgment , better taught by example than by l ) recept , indirectly rather than directly . What progress we should see if all the teachers in the schools of every grade were all the time on the watch for errors ! - if they never allowed one to pass in an oral or a written exercise , in notes of lectures , in examination-books , in copy-books , or even in conversation in the school-room ! In the classical schools , teachers of Greek and Latin may do much to help the cause of good English without going out of their way , or of what should be their way . They may insist , for example , that every translated sentence , whether spoken or written , shall be a good English sentence at all points . This is done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrow boys , though they receive little training in their own language by itself , write better English than American boys of the same age and attainments . This is done in France ; and hence it is that every educated Frenchman writes idiomatic French . In this country , too , I am happy to say , attention is beginning to be paid to English by teachers of other subjects . In several quarters , students in Latin or Greek , French or Gernian , are encouraged to make translation a means of enriching their English vocabulary , and enlarging their knowledge of English idioms . The master of one academy within my knowledge does not allow his pupils to make the ordinary word-for-word translation of the Latin ablative absolute . He insists , for example , that the sentence , " Tarquin having been expelled , two consuls began to be created , instead of one king , " or the sentence , " No one will be about to be a thief , we being the aid , " is not an English sentence , is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the instance of the English department , determined very recently to insert the following words in the statement in its catalogue of the requirements for admission to the Freshman Class : " The passages set for translation must be rendered into simple and idiomatic Eno*lish . Teachers are requested to insist on the use of good English as an essential part of the candidate 's training in trans lation . " A requirement of this sort , if strictly enforce*l , can not fail to tell for good upon the candidate 's command of his mother-tongue . The truth is that the study of other languages than our own , whether ancient or modern , may be so pursued as to harm the cause of good English , or so pursued as to be of great service to it . Not a few highschool graduates resemble the young man in one of Mr. James Payn 's novels , " whose education had been classical , and did not , therefore , include spelling . " A teacher wrote to me in grieved surprise at the failure of two of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re-examining the books , I discovered that each of the two boys had been guilty of a sentence like one of those just quoted  --  a sentence such as no English-speaking person who had not had frequent dialogues with the dead languages would have written . On the other hand , translation may be made , as it has been by many famous speakers and writers , a means of enriching the vocabulary and stimulating the powers of expression . Rufus Choate , for example , the famous New England advocate , whose command of language was unsurpassed , made a point of spending some time every day in rendering into English passages from another tongue , returning some times day after day to the same passage , until he had succeeded in giving to his English all the merits of the original . " Translation should , " he is reported to have said , " be pursued to bring to mind and to employ all the words you already own , and to tax and torment invention and discovery amid the very deepest memory for additional , rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated , as they are in some of our schools , not merely as tests of knowledge , but also as exercises in expression . Instead of resembling , as they too often do , the productions of an illiterate mind and an unpracticed hand , instead of undoing in three hours all the good that has been gained in three weeks of instruction in English , I they may be made of real service to the student by giving him practice in stating what he knows in exact and intelligible words . Two years ago I received a report from a superintendent of schools in a city in Ohio , from which it appeared that in that place ten per cent . of the total marks at // examination was given for penmanship , neatness , and accuracy , 9nd that every scholar was obliged to write in ink-au excellent safeguard against slovenliness . Correctness and clearness of expression are all that the teachers of other subjects than the English branches can be expected to find time for ; but these they should attend to , in their own interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of their pupils , and of the mother-tongue ; for a student can not properly be said to know a thing unless he knows it well enough to be able to make a statement about it that shall be intelligible to an intelligent reader . Somewhat more may be done by the teacher who makes it his business to examine a piece of written work as an exercise in English . He may welcome every spark of intellectual life , every picturesque phrase , every happy turn of sentence , every strong word he comes upon , and even expressions that , though open to criticism , are often on the boy 's lips and naturally flow from his pen . He should leave free play to individuality , remembering that an opinion which is a boy 's own is worth more than the most orthodox dogmas taken at second hand . " To sit as a passive bucket , " says Carlyle , " and be pumped into , whether you consent or not , can , in the long-run , be exhilarating to no creature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth ; and which of us can be sure that his private pump does that ? Among the things which teachers of every class should struggle to avoid is what I must be pardoned for calling " schoolmasters ' English . " All those whose business brings them into constant contact with young minds , and who are to a great extent cut off from intercourse with the world of men and women , are apt to attribute undue importance to petty matters , to insist upon rules in cases where the best usage leaves freedom of choice , to prefer bookish and dignified ways of putting things to easy and natural ones . In many schools , for example , boys and girls are taught to put commas between the several parts of the address on the envelope of a letter . The rule would be correct if the words forming the address were written continuously , as in the body of a book ; but the separation of each part of the address from every other part alters the question . Consequently , some of the most careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on monuments in public squares and cemeteries-either put periods at the end of each line or leave out all stops except those which mark abbreviations . Some teachers insist that the relative that should always be used , instead of who or which , where the relative clause serves to restrict the meaning of the antecedent , and that who or which should be used , instead of that , where the relative clause adds something to the meaning of the antecedent , or explains it ; and yet the best authorities , from Addison to Anthony Trollope , obey no such rule , but are guided by the ear in their choice between who and that . A distinction is set up in the schools between each other and one another , according as the reference is to two or to more than two persons ; and yet scarcely a good author can be found who does not use the two forms interchangeably . Another article of the school-master creed holds that a sentence should never end with a preposition or other particle ; as if the most idiomatic writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not abound in such sentences . In the cases that have been mentioned the best usage is against the school-masters ; but even where there is a question between two forms of expression , usage being almost equally divided , a teacher will do well to postpone all discussion of the disputed point till his pupils have mastered those parts of the language as to which good writers are agreed . Still another danger of teachers springs from their disposition to set an undue value on the slavish reproduction by their pupils of what they have heard from the desk . The writing-master regards that as the best chirography which most nearly resembles his own " copperplate , " flourishes and all ; the elocutionist rates most highly the pupil who is successful in imitating his master 's tones and gestures ; and the teacher of English too often has most praise for sentences that resemble his own - particularly if they are free from all faults except that of having no merits . No system is more likely than this to arrest the growth of a young mind and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Cherbuliez , the brilliant Swiss novelist , " is the bane of all art . " Worst of all forms of school-master English are those that come from unwillingness to call a spade a spade . // " I have teen trying for years , " said a school-girl , the other day , " to say I rose at seven , ' instead of got up-got is such a horrid word ! " " Do you say retire instead of go to bed * " Oh yes : I have been taught to avoid common expressions . " That is to say , this innocent young girl had been taught to despise the words of daily life and to affect the vulgar finery and sham delicacy characteristic of those who talk about the culinary department , the hymeneal altar , caskets for the remains of the departed , author of my being , maternal relative , patrons of husbandry , ebonized coursers , liquid refreshments. lower limbs-  --  the same part of the person which is referred to in the rule of a seminary quoted in Longfellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " cross their benders . " It is not well - bred persons who are ashamed to use the brief , simple , definite , ordinary words which naturally come to the lips . It is not the writers of leaders in our best newspapers who indulge in newspaper English , " but the penny-a-liners , the reporters of fires and police items ; and yet the worst parts of " newspaper English " spring from the same fondness for vague words and tawdry circumlocutions which gives rise to the " elegant " diction of teachers like Mrs. General in Little Dorrit . In the course of conversation Miss Fanny , Mrs. General 's pupil , happened to say : " They would n't have been recalled to our remembrance , I suspect , if uncle had n't tumbled over the subject . ' " My dear , what a curious phrase ! ' said Mrs. General . Would not " inadvertently lighted upon , " or " accidently referred to , " be better ? ' " Thank youvery much , Mrs. General , ' return3d the young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I prefer my own expression . ' " This , " continues Dickens , " was always Miss Fanny 's way of receiving a suggestion from Mrs. General . But she always stored it up in her mind , and adopted it at another time . " A teacher very different from Mrs. General was master of the school ( Christ 's Hospital ) where Lamb and Coleridge were taught . Of him Coleridge says : " In our own English compositions ( at least for the last three years of our school education ) he showed no mercy to phrase , metaphor , or image unsupported by a sound sense , or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words . Lute , harp , and lyre , Muse , Muses , and inspirations , Pegasus , Parnassus , and Hippocrene , were all an abomination to him . In fancy I can hear him now exclaiming : Harp ? harp ? lyre ? Pen and ink , boy , you mean ! Muse , boy , Muse ? Your nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ay ! the cloister pump , I suppose . ' " This same teacher , it may be noted in passing , affords a strong proof of the fact that real familiarity with Greek and Latin helps one 's English , for it was he who moulded Coleridge 's taste in both ancient and modern literature , and taught him sound principles of criticism in poetry . ( 2 . ) In the second place , I would not require a boy or a girl to write a formal composition until the elementary difficulties of work with the pen had been in a great measure overcome . If good English has been treated from the very beginning of school life not as a thing by itself , but as part and parcel of every study in which the mother-tongue is used , whether orally or in writing ; if the pupil has been taught to regard skill in the use of his own language as an essential of scholarship , without which a so-called educated man , however extensive his book knowledge , must be deemed a learned dunce ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of writing , but in order to put what he knows on a given subject into a portable form ; if he has written so often and so much as to have overcome the difficulties attendant upon the manual labor of penmanship ; if his errors in spelling have never been allowed to pass uncorrected , and his memory has been forced by constant exercise to master the arbitrary forms of words that are in ordinary use ; if he has been made to see that the rules of punctuation and grammar , though to a certain extent arbitrary , are for the most part helps to the accurate and prompt communication of thought from one mind to another , and that this principle , as carried out in practice by the best authors , underlies all the rules which determine the choice , the number , and the order of words in any piece of writing ; if , in short , a pupil has been led gradually and incidentally to acquaint himself with the essentials of good English -- more will have been done toward teaching him the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing of essays on topics outside of his regular studies-essays which he would have regarded as an imposition , since they were clear additions to his usual tasks , and asbugbears , since the work came so rarely that he did not get used to it . This , which may be called the indirect method of teaching the rudiments of English , has one decided advantage over the direct method , in addition to those already mentioned . The English of an examination book or of a translation appears to the pupil , as it really is , a means to an end , like the English he talks on the playground or at an evening party . The English of a boy 's formal essay , on the contrary , consists mainly of words that serve no purpose , and seem to him to serve none , except that of filling the prescribed number of pages . At an examination , his knowledge of the facts on which each question is based supplies material for his sentences ; and the questions on the paper direct him in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or thinks he has , nothing to say on the subject given out , and he is usually supplied with nothing definite to guide his mind and steady his steps . " Scholars in universities , " says Bacon , " come too soon and too unripe to Logic and Rhetoric , arts fitter for Graduates than Children and Novices ; for these two , rightly taken , are the greatest of sciences , being the Arts of Arts , the one for Judgment , the other for ornament , and they be the Rules and Directions how to set forth and dispose matters ; and therefore , for minds empty and unfraught with matter , and which have not gathered that which Cicero calleth Sylva and Supellex , stuff and variety , to begin with , those Arts ( as if one should learn to weigh , or to measure , or to paint the Wind ) doth work but this effect , that the wisdom of those Arts , which is great and universal , is almost made contemptible , and is degenerate into childish sophistry and ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath drawn on , by consequence , the superficial and unprofitable teaching and writing of them , as fittest , indeed , to the capacity of children . " ( 3 . ) In the third place , compositions , when they are required , should be written so oftei* as to form an important part of school work . So far as is possible under the conditions of the school they should be rhade to flower naturally out of that part of each pupil 's life in which he is most at home , be it work or play . He should be made to understand that the essential part of an essay is thought , well organized and well expressed ; that to comprehend clearly and to feel strongly what one has to say is the indispensable condition of making others comprehend and feel it . A boy should never sit down to write until he has substantially settled his course of thought ; but when he does begin , he should give his whole mind to the work of expressing his ideas in language that can be easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils put their real selves behind the pen . Anxious not to do anything that shall cramp the free play of individual talent , he will at first be so careful not to correct overmuch as to let some elementary faults pass unnoticed . " Many a clever boy , " says Sir Walter Scott , in his Diary , " has been flogged into a dunce , and many an original composition corrected into mediocritv . " The wise teacher of English will give special attention to the acquirement of unity and flow , the qualities which constitutea composition , as distinguished from a disorderly and inharmonious collection of words . To the end of unity , the pupil should be taught that each of his sentences must contain one , and but one , propositionthat is , must say but one thing , and say it as briefly and simply as is consistent with clearness and fullness of statement ; and that each sentence must be so f*'anied as to carry on the thought from what precedes to what follows . The pupil should be taught , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong together by virtue of their common relation to the single proposition which forms the essence of the paragraph and makes it a paragraph ; that a new paragraph must begin when a new part of the subject is entered upon , and that this new paragraph must contain that which comes next in order of thought to the paragraph it follows . If there is method in the arrangement of the words in a sentence , of the sentences in a paragraph , and of the paragraphs in an essay , the essay as a whole will mean something , and something definite ; but if there is no arrangement , it is either because the writer has nothing to say , or because he " blunders about a meaning . " // One good way of clearing a boy 's mind as to the contents of his own essay is to ask him to make an abstract of it in ten lines . He will either fail to do so because there is nothing to make an abstract of , or lie xviii succeed , and in succeeding will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order out of chaos . If a wouldbe fine writer can open his eyes to the fact that his essay has no body , lie is likely to find something to say next time . If a confused writer can be made to bring the meaning of one of his obscure sentences into light , he will express himself more clearly in future ; for he will perceive that he has gained by the change in point of space as well as in perspicuity . In writing , as in housekeeping , to have a place for everything is to save time , temper , and work for all concerned . Unity of composition may be furthered by the practice of assigning definite subjects for essays , and of insisting that pupils shall confine themselves to the exact subject prescribed . The inevitable result of giving out a vague subject is a vague and confused piece of writing , or a composition like those of two school-girls of whom I heard the other day . Being required to write compositions on Friendship , they put their heads together with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , and should at the same time differ essentially from each other . One began thus : " There are two kinds of friendship . " The other opened in a more stately style : " Friendship may be regarded as consisting of two kinds or varieties . " What can a child find to say on Friendship , or on such subjects as are given in an English book on composition published last year : " Home Rule ; " " The Channel Tunnel ; " " What is Poetry ? Expound this subject by obverse illustration . " Ask a boy to write about poetry , or punctuality , or perseverance , or consistency , and lie will write about and about itabout the word , that is to say , not stopping to define it , but repeating it over and over again , and saying things more or less distantly connected with it , in the order in which they occur to his memory ; for his mind can hardly be said to take part in the exercise . He xviii do somewhat better if asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like ? and why ? " " The punctual man wastes more time than the unpunctual , " " Genius is an infiuiite capa city for taking pains , " " Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds , " since each of these texts contains an assertion which may be sustained or refuted by argument , that is , by well-ordered thought . The difficulty , however , with topics of this class is that they can not be satisfactorily discussed without more knowledge than children possess . Even if the teacher supplies the requisite knowledge , boys and girls will not take as much interest in such subjects as they take in facts obtained at first-hand , or in arguments thought out for themselves . They may attain unity ; but it will be a unity in form rather than in substance , the unity of a manufactured article , not that of a natural product . Subjects should be concrete as well as definite , and should be level to the age and experience of those who are to write upon them . A teacher should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows what interests or can be made to interest them , and should choose his subjects in the light of that knowledge , being careful , at the same time , to confine each topic selected within narrow limits . If , for example , a boy has been greatly interested in an industrial exhibition , he may be asked , not to give a general account of the show  --  a demand which would result either in a flight of superlatives or in a reproduction of the catalogue  --  but to give a full and precise account of one thing he has seen , of the latest form of type-writer or of sewing-machine , for example . If he has been reading Irving 's Sketch Book with pleasure , lie may be asked to compare Christmas as he knows it in his own home with Christmas as it used to be in England , or to tell the story of Rip Van Winkle as he would tell it if he were trying to amuse a younger brother . What Carlyle wrote to a young man who talked of writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every boy or girl . " The thing , " said Carlyle , " he will have the chance to write entertainingly upon will be something he specially himself has seen , not probably Shakespeare , I should say , which all the world these two centuries has been doing its best to see . " The essential thing in the subject for a boy 's composition is that it should be one of which his mind will take hold as it takes hold of a game of ball ora story-book . To put him at his ease , he might at first be required to write in his own words the // substance of something read or told to him , or he might be allowed to dictate his compositions ; for as a rule he speaks more naturally than he writes , keeps to the point more closely , and gets along more rapidly . Next in importance among the qualities which a teacher should strive to infuse into the writings of his pupils is that known in the text-books under different names ( as ease , elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothness ) , the quality which renders written words agreeable to the ear and the taste , the quality which is possessed in a pre-eminent degree by Addison and Goldsmith among the dead , and by Cardinal Newman and Mr. Ruskin among the living . This excellence may be purchased-as it is in some of the histories of Irving or of Prescott-at the cost of brevity and vigor . Its absence may be made up for ( with some readers at least ) by picturesqueness and strength , as in Carlyle 's Latter Day Pamphlets ; but even those papers are hard reading for many on account of their deficiencies in this respect . Similar deficiencies , unrelieved by equal merits , greatly diminish one 's pleasure in reading some of the works of Sir Arthur Helps ; and they are fatal to the enjoyment of most books of science by any one not obliged by his calling to dig out the information imbedded in them . I will not say that the text-books on rhetoric ought to give more space than they do to this requisite of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear can not be trained by precepts , and , on the other hand , young writers might , if euphony were too much insisted on , be tempted to sacrifice sense to sound . The teacher of English should , however , recommend novices in composition to read authors distinguished for a flowing style , and should call their attention to chosen examples of the best work of such authors . He should point out to his pupils passages in their own compositions that are obscure or ineffective , because of clumsiness in a form of expression , or want of ease in a transition , or inharmoniousness in a collocation of words . A young writer should be made to understand that to have unity in the fullest sense an essay must have movement as well as method , and that any interruption in the flow of language is a source of difficulty and of irritation to the reader , since it calls his attention from the meaning of a sentence to the words which compose it , or from the line VOL . LXXI. - No. 421-10 of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Pupils should be taught that , to be sure of having movement in their compositions , they must have it in themselves . A writer who stops at the end of every sentence to bite his pen , or to stare at the ceiling , or to talk with a visitor , will never acquire a flowing style . He who is not interested in his own work has small chance of interesting others ; he who keeps interrupting himself can hardly expect that his readers will find continuity in what he has written . Before sitting down to write , a boy should have thought out what he has to say , and should have arranged it in an orderly manner , so that there shall be a beginning , a middle , and an end ; when he does sit down at his desk he can and he should write at a heat . If he does so write , words will follow words , and sentences sentences , and paragraphs paragraphs , naturally and with a certain ease and flow . If between a first draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished composition sufficient time shall elapse to enable him to forget a large part of what he has written , so much the better ; for he will then approach his work like a stranger , and will see , as a stranger would see , where he has failed to express clearly or vigorously what he has tried to say . Lapse of time and change of mood are excellent critics . Finally , a teacher should take pains to give his pupil enough , but not too much , help in his writing , to be a staff , not a crutch , to him . To correct all his errors for him is almost as bad as to make no corrections at all . The teacher should point out faults , but the scholar should be encouraged to find the remedy for himself . Prevailing demerits should be noted , and prevailing merits also , if there be any . In many cases it will be found that a thorough change for the better can not be made without the rewriting of the whole composition ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to the best writers in the class ; for to them no part of the work will be a mere copyist 's drudgery , but it will all serve as training in the effective use of language , as such work has always been to men that have taught themselves to write or have been taught by good teachers . // Another plan is that of Coleridge 's master-a plan which that great writer regards as " imitable and worthy of imitation . He would , " says Coleridge , " often permit our exercises , under some pretext of want of time , to accumulate till each lad had four or five to be looked over . Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk , he would ask the writer why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis ; and if no satisfactory answer could be returned , and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise , the irrevocable verdict followed , the exercise was torn up , and another on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of the day . " It is evident from what I have said all along that I am no believer in the doctrine that a good book or a good essay can be written by one who has nothing to say , or that , in English composition , form is one thing and substance another . Even if it were true that words are the clothing of thought , it would follow that words without thought , however skillfully knit together , however richly embroidered with figures of speech , must still bear the same relation to words with thought that an ingeniously constructed scarecrow bears to the farmer who made it . In the best writers , however , words are not the clothing of thought ; they are thought incarnate ; the language and the idea are united , like soul and body , in a mysterious way which nobody fully understands . More than this . In a great writer the style is the man  --  the man as made by his ancestors , his education , his career , his circumstances , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure a good style by imitating this or that writer ; for the best part of a good style is incommunicable . A would-be imitator may , if he applies himself closely to the work , catch mannerisms and reproduce defects , and perhaps superficial merits ; but the most valuable qualities , those that have their roots in character , he will miss altogether , except in so far as his own personality resembles that of his model . It has been found comparatively easy , for instance , to copy the big words , the antitheses , the balanced sentences , of Dr. Johnson ; but who has his sense and his vigor ? Carlyle 's uncouthness has been caught ; but who has his imagination , his humor , his strength ? Macaulay 's clearness , Goldsmith 's ease , Webster 's massiveness , are precisely those things in each which are most difficult to acquire . One may , indeed , get good from a master of English by unconscious absorption , as one acquires good manners by associating with gentlemen and ladies ; but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired result . There are minds , it is true , which are so thoroughly original that they assimilate from another*s writings that , and that only , which is helpful to them . A writer of this class does not copy the style of the author he has been studying , but he reproduces that style plus something new , or rather combined with something new , so as to form an original product . Thus Keats profited by his study of Spenser and of Milton . Thus Demosthenes , after copying and recopying Thucydides , wrote , not in the style of Thucydides , but in a style of his own into which the strength of Thucydides had passed . Thus Franklin educated himself by a study of Addison , rewriting the best papers in the Spectator from memory , and then comparing his transcripts with the originals ; but Franklin 's style , though resembling Addison 's in some respects , is distinctively his own . A teacher can not be expected to find many excellent writers among the children that pass through his hands ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in their own and in each other 's compositions , not only wherein they have succeeded and wherein they have failed in securing unity in structure and ease in expression , but also how far they have succeeded or failed in putting their individuality into their written words . Not that one young person in ten thousand has anything original to say ; but every human being has a mind of his own , as he has features of his own  --  a mind which expresses itself readily enough in his face and in familiar conversation , and which can be helped to express itself with the pen . To the extent that a young writer works with the purpose to say something of his own , what he writes will have freshness , and will inspire interest in his subject and in him . To the extent that he fails to put himself into his work , he becomes what is known as a hack writer , a mere beast of burden , who serves as a common carrier for the thoughts of other men . Thus far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facilitating com // munication between mind and mind , and it is under this aspect alone that I feel justified in demanding a pre-eminent place for the study in every school , whatever its other objects , whatever its grade , whatever its system of education . I should be the last to deny the pleasures or the advantages of the study of English from the philolooical or from the literary point of view . Few pursuits are more attractive to an intelligent youth than that of following a word through all the stages of its growth to the root out of which so much and so many things have been developed . To master the languages out of which our own has been formed is to add to our knowledge of history , and to enable us to appreciate more highly the beauty and power of the stream which we have traced to its source . If pursued in this spirit , the study of English as a language may be of great value , not only because it supplies valuable information , but also because it broadens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to prove that , on the whole , the study of English in this way has stronger claims upon a student 's attention than has Greek or Latin , French or German , Sanskrit or Hebrew . A stronger case may be made for the study of English literature as such . It is unseemly that anybody ( except , perhaps , a professor of Greek ) should know Homer better than Shakespeare , Lucian than Swift , Demosthenes than Burke . Whatever else may be omitted , every scholar who gets beyond the three R 's should know something of the great English classics . English literature thus studied must not be confounded with the subject that figures under the same name in manuals , or in superfluous commentaries , annotations , criticisms , whether they are those of the teacher or those in " school editions " - talk about a book , which rises like a cloud between it and the student , irritating him as well as obstructing the view . Better leave boys to read good books by themselves than impose on them as a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right way , but whom they are likely to detest if they see him only when he is pinned to the floor of the school-room , like Gulliver in the hands of the Lilliputians . The only points I have space to emphasize are three : 1 . Every book selected for reading should be suited to a scholar 's age , attainments , and tastes-should be , in a word , a book that he is likely to enjoy . 2 . He should be encouraged to read every work through , the first time as rapidly as possible , that he may get the knowledge and the pleasure of it as a whole . 3 . In order to bring his mind to bear on what he has read , he should write upon at least two subjects drawn from the book ; the first calling for a general summary of its contents from a single point of view , the second calling for an intelligent account of one scene or character . Whether , as mere matter of knowledge , the masterpieces of English literature should constitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever his or her calling in life , I will not undertake to say ; but I do regard an acquaintance with the English classics as an important if not an indispensable means of acquiring the art of putting one 's thought into good English . This purpose good authors serve , not only directly by providing suitable topics to be written upon , and by increasing one 's command of language , but also indirectly by stimulating the mental energies , and by affording the keenest intellectual pleasure . Thus understood , English literature ceases to be a merely literary study , and becomes as useful to the man of science as to the man of letters-to Professor Huxley and Mr. Herbert Spencer as to Mr. Matthew Arnold and Mr. James Russell Lowell . Literature is no longer a fund of information which may be weighed against information on other subjects , but it belongs to that kind of knowledge which is power . The primary object , then , of placing English upon a better basis in the schools , and of giving more time and intelligence to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in pure and effective language ; not merely that they may avoid gross mistakes in grammar , and ambiguous or obscure expressions , not merely that they may state facts or opinions in words that can be understood by one who takes pains to understand them , but that they may be able to tell a story or to frame and argument so well that he who runs will stop to read it ; that they may be able to write , not only so as to instruct men , but also so as to please them in the highest sense , and to move them to noble ends . It may be years before the full effects of the reform will be seen ; but then they will be felt in all fields of human activity in which language plays a leading part .
