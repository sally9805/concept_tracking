Lazarus , Emma , 1849-1887 : TO R. W. E. from To R. W. E. ( 1885 ) As , when a father dies , his children draw About the empty hearth , their loss to cheat With uttered praise and love , and oft repeat His all-familiar words with whispered awe ,  --  The honored habit of his daily law ; Not for his sake , but theirs , whose feebler feet Need still that guiding lamp , whose faith less sweet Misses that tempered patience without flaw ;  --  So do we gather round thy vacant chair , In thine own elm-roofed , amber-rivered town , Master and father ! For the love we bear , Not for thy fame 's sake , do we weave this crown , And feel thy presence in the sacred air , Forbidding us to weep that thou art gone . New York , May , 1884.
