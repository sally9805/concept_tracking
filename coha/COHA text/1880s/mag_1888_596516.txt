PEMBERTON LOGAN SMITH returned from Guanajuato five or six days later , bringing his sheaves with him . But his sheaves did not amount to much . He arrived from the railway station in time to join the party at dinner ; and although dining was about at an end , they all waited while he ate his dinner and at the same time gave an account of himself . " What a blessing it is again to get something to eat , " he observed with much satisfaction as Gilberto - " the best waiter I ever came across anywhere , " Mr. Gamboge had declared approvingly - took away his empty soup-plate and filled his glass from a bottle of Father Gatillon 's sound claret . " I staid at Dofia Maria 's , of course , and the old lady did her best for me , I know - but even her best did n't amount to much ; and I ye been getting hungrier and hungrier every day . " " And how about the picture ? " Brown asked . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in this time . " " Oh , the picture ! Yes , I d forgotten about that . You see , when I saw the Bufa again I concluded that it was too much for me . It wants a bigger man , you know - somebody like Orpiment . You really ought to go up and paint it , Orpiment ; it 's a wonderful thing . " This pleased Verona , of course . She highly approved of anything in the shape of an acknowledo-ment of her husband 's superiority . b " That s all very well , " said Orpiment ; " but if you have n't been painting the Bufa , what have you been doing ? And what s gone with all your virtuous resolutions ? " " Well , you see , we did n't half do up Guanajuato - it s a wonderful place ; I think it s the most picturesque place I ever saw . I ye been investigating it . I found some more pictures , for one thing . There s a tremendously good Cena de San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacristy of that little church just across the street from Dofia Maria 's . And I went out to the Valenciana mine , and there is one of the most beautiful churrigueresque church interiors out there that I ever laid eyes on , and we missed that , too , you know . There was lots to do without painting . I could have put in another week easily . " " Did you see anything of the Espinosas ? " Violet asked with a fine air of innocent curiosity . " The Espinosas ! Oh , yes , I saw them . In fact I - as it happened , I saw a good deal of them , " Pem answered in some slight confusion . " Yes , they were very civil to me , " he continued . " You see I had to present the letter that you sent , Mrs. Mauve ; and when they found that I had missed so much that is worth seeing in Guanajuato they took me in hand in the kindest way and showed me everything . It was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come down together on the same train . You see , I found it was quite hopeless to try to paint the Bufa , and as they were coming down I thought I d come down too . What a nice old lady Sefiora Espinosa is , and Don Antonio is delightful . I ye rarely met such pleasant people . " " And how about the pretty girl ? " Brown struck in , although Rose tried to stop him by pinching him . " It s never any good to pinch me , Rose , " Brown explained , when his conduct subsequently was criticised . " Half the time I do n't know what I m pinched for and it only makes me get my back up ; and the other half you do n't get in your pinch until I ye said what you do n't want me to say . If I were you , I d stop it . " " But , Van , indeed it was very unkind in you to speak that way to-night . Do n't you see that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and just suppose you were to make him so uncomfortable that he should break it all off before it s fairly begun . Do n't do anything like that again , I beg of you. ** " For so young a woman , Rose , your matchmaking proclivities are quite remarkable . How do you know that this Mexican girl is sweet ' ? Remember your gambling friend at Aguas Calientes , Rosey , and do n't be precipitate , my dear " ( this was an unfair allusion on Brown 's part , and he had to apologize for it ) . " After all , though , you must admit that Smith did n't // seem to be very badly knocked out by my shot at him . " This was quite true , for Pem had expected some such question , and , being ready for it , he answered with a very fair degree of composure : " You mean the Sehora Carillo . She is charming , of course . I do n't believe that you know , Mrs. Mauve , " he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow ? " " Oh , how perfectly delightful ! " cried Violet . Then , seeing that Rose , Verona , and Mrs. Gamboge all looked shocked , she added , " Of course I do n't mean that it is delightful to have people 's husbands die , or anything like that , you know . But after they are dead , in this part of the world at least , it s delightful to be a widow . A Mexican young girl might just as well be a - a humming-top , for all the good she has of anything , you see . But as soon as she s a widow she can go anywhere and do anything she pleases and have nobody bothering at her at all . It s better than being a young girl in the States , ever so much . And so C6rmen s a widow . Just think of it ! And I did n't even know that she had been married . She s got ever so far ahead of me , has n't she , Rowney ? And I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ! But who did she marry , Mr. Smith ? And when did he die ? Do tell me all about it , please . " And Pem explained that the Seflorita Espinosa had been married about a year after the time that she had left school , and that her husband had died suddenly within two or three months of their marriage . " I do n't believe it was quite a heart-breaking affair , " Pem added . " Her cousin , Rodolfo , you know , told me that old Don Ignacio was a grouty old fellow , and that the marriage had been made up mainly because his hacienda adjoined her father 's , and there was some row about the water-rights which had been going on for years and which they succeeded this way in compromising . Rodolfo was very indignant about the whole business , and I m sure I do n't wonder . Do they do much of that sort of thing down here , Mrs. Mauve ? It s like a bit out of the dark ages . " " But think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the practical Violet ; " and think what a good thing it is to have the matter about the water settled so nicely . You do n't know how important it is to get a thing like that settled . I remember papa and another man had a bad shooting match about a water-right once ; and papa would have been killed , everybody said , if he had n't been too quick for the other man and got the drop on him . And it cost papa ever so much to square things after he d killed the other man ; for the judges knew that papa was rich and they made him pay like anything . I m very glad for C6rmen 's sake that she was able to do her father such a good turn ; and she must be glad too - especially now that it s all well over and she is a comfortable widow . And you say that they all came down with you to-night ? " Yes , and they sent word that they are coming in a body to call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe . And they have a plan on foot for a picnic , or something of that sort , for us at Sefior Espinosa s place out at Tacubaya " " Oh , in that lovely garden ! I used to go out there with Cftrmen sometimes on Sundays while I was at the convent . It 's perfectly delightful ! " Yes , I fancy from what they said about it that it must be rather a nice place . And after the lunch , or breakfast , or whatever they call it , we re to walk across and see the view of the valley from a place that they say is very nice - it s upon a hillside above the Molino del Rey ; just where the battle was fought in 1847 , Don Antonio said . Really , Mrs. Mauve , we all owe a great deal to you for putting us in the way of seeing Mexican life from the inside . " This view of the indebtedness of the American party to its Spanish-American member became general two days later , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special tram-car , and were given a breakfast in his beautiful kuerta that quite astonished them . That Pem approved of the food , Philadelphian though he was , did not , under the circumstances , count for much ; but the hearty indorsement of Mexican cooking on the part of Mr. Gamboge and Mr. Mangan Brown , neither of whom regarded such matters lightly , and whose judgment was not biased by any sudden yielding to the tender emotions , counted for a good deal . It was while they were returning to the city that Mr. Gamboge , after a long , thoughtful silence , thus spoke : " Brown , I shall remember that dish of 10/c - I have learned the name of it carefully , you see - until my dying day . " And Mr. Mangan Brown briefly but feelingly replied , " And so shall I. " As for Rose , she declared that she must be asleep and had dreamed herself into a Watteau landscape ; for such a garden as this was , as she lucidly explained , she believed could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream . Mrs. Gamboge whose tendency was towards the sentimental , wished Mr. Gamboge to come and sit beside her on the grass , beneath a tree near the little brook . And her feelings // were rather hurt because Mr. Gamboge declined to fall in with her romantic fancy , on the ground that sitting on the grass certainly would give them both the rheumatism . And he did n't mend matters by adding that he would have been very glad to please her had they only thought to bring along a gum-blanket . But quite the happiest member of this exceptionally happy party was Mr. Pemberton Logan Smith ; for this young man , while he was not as yet exactly in love , had made a very fair start into the illusions and entanglements of that tender passion . During the four or five days at Guanajuato his intercourse with the Sefiora Carillo had been hampered by the formalities attending new acquaintanceship , and especially by the rule of Mexican etiquette that throws the entertainment of a guest upon the oldest lady of the household . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty widow ; but his ears , and so much of his tongue as the circumstances of the case required ,  --  which was not much , for Dofia Catalina was a great talker ,  --  necessarily were employed in the service of her aunt . But on the present occasion Dofia Catalina naturally devoted herself more especially to Mrs. Gamboge and the two elderly gentlemen , - Violet . rather against her will , serving as interpreter ,  --  and this left Pem free to follow his own inclinations . It was the first fair chance that he had had , and he made the most of it . A further fortunate fact in his favor was that he was the only man of the American party - except Jaune d'Antimoine , who was busily employed as interpreter between his wife , Rose , Verona , and the Mexican young gentlemen - who possessed a colloquial command of Spanish . How Pem did bless his lucky stars now that , being overtaken by a mood of unwonted energy , he had had the resolution to grind away so steadily under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , without much difficulty , he contrived to keep close to the widow all day ,  --  much to his own enjoyment , and , apparently , not to her distaste . She was not like any of the women whom he had known in Spain - where , to be sure , his opportunities for any save most formal acquaintance had been very limited ; and she certainly was unlike her own countryfolk . Even in her lightest talk there was an air about her of preoccupation , of reserve , that was in too marked contrast with Dofia Catalina 's very cheerful frankness to be accounted for merely on the ground of the difference between youth and age ; and that , so far as his observation had gone , was not by any means characteristic of Mexican women either old or young . And from the obscurity of this reserve she had a way , he found , of flashing out rather brilliantly turned expressions of decidedly original thought . When she accompanied these utterances , as she some* times did , with a little curl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance from her dark-brown eyes ,  --  not tender eyes , yet eyes which somehow suggested possibilities of tenderness ,  - -  he found that her sayings , if not increased in point , certainly gained in effectiveness . Altogether , Mr. Smith was disposed to regard the SeiXora Carillo as a decidedly interesting subject for attentive study . Naturally , since they had been so much together during the day , Pem was the widow 's escort when they all set out , in late afternoon , to walk to the point of view that Don Antonio , as he expressed it , would have the honor to bring to their notice . It was a desperately dusty walk , and the American ladies - who had donned raiment of price for the occasion - contemplated the defilement of their gowns in anything but a contented spirit . They beheld with wonder the calmness with which their Mexican sisters-who were equally well dressed , though in the style that would obtain in New York during the ensuing seasonmade no effort whatever to preserve their garments from contamination . " That gros-grain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Gamboge declared , speaking in the suppressed voice that most people seem to consider necessary when airing their private sentimentsin the presence of other people who do not understand a word of the language in which the private sentiments are expressed . " Mine is bad enough , though I m doing everything I can think of to save it . Do just drop behind me a little and see if I m making a very shocking exhibition of my ankles . I m afraid that I am , but I really ca n't help it . These Mexican ladies seem to think no more of getting dusty than if they all were dressed in calico . I ca n't understand it at all . " The Sefiora Carillo certainly paid no attention whatever to the increasing dustiness of her gown . Her early venture in matrimony had not been of an encouraging sort , and since she had come into her estate of widowhood her tendency - as Violet in her free but expressive south-western vernacular probably would have stated the case - was to " stand off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , she discovered that so far from finding this good-looking young Americano repulsive , she positively was attracted by him . For one thing , he struck her was differing in many ways from her own countr ) Tmen ; and she had an instinctive feeling that the unlikeness was not merely superficial . She was sure // that his scheme of life was a larger , broader scheme than that which she had known , and there was a genuineness in his deference to her as a woman that contrasted both forcibly and favorably with certain of her past experiences . In point of fact this Mexican young woman had begun life by being a little out of harmony with her environment . She did not know very clearly what she wanted , but she knew that it was something quite different from that which she had . It was this feeling that had led her to select Violet Carmine for a close friend . She was not at all in sympathy with Violet 's most radical tendencies ; but she found in Violet a person , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own small convictions as to what a woman 's life might be . Even to this friend she had not told that it was her hope , should she ever marry , to be the companion of her husband-not merely his handmaiden , in the scriptural sense . And she was glad now that she had been thus reticent , for her hope by no means had been realized . After that very disillusioning venture into the holy estate of matrimony , this poor C6*rmen found herself entirely at odds with herself and with the world . Had she lived a generation earlier she would have become a nun . It was a subject of sincere sorrow to her that nunneries had been abolished in Mexico by the Laws of the Reform . It was only natural that there should be a certain feeling of pleasure mixed with her feeling of astonishment at her present discovery of a man for whom she had at once both liking and respect . It was agreeable , she thought , to find that there really was such a man in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts did not go . It made very little difference to her , one way or the other , this discovery . The man was a foreigner , and an American at that ,  --  and C6rmen had a good strong race hatred for the Americans of the North ,  --  come into her country only for a little while . Presently he would go home again ; and that , so far as she was concerned , would be the end of him . In the mean time she would please herself by studying this new specimen of male humanity . It was well to hold converse with a foreigner , she thought ; it enlarged one 's mind . So , lagging a little behind the rest of the party , and chatting in a manner somewhat light to be productive of any very marked mental improvement , they walked westward through the straggling streets of Tacubaya - past low houses with great barred windows , past high-walled gardens , the loveliness of which was only hinted at by outhanging trees and climbing vines , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - over to and out upon the hillside above the Molino del Rey . They stopped beside the little pyramidal monument that commemorates the battle . The rest of the party had gone on a few rods farther ; for Don Antonio , with true Mexican courtesy , had acted upon his instinctive conviction that beside this monument was not a place where a party of rightthinking Americans would care to halt . Below them , embowered in trees , was the old Mill of the King that Worth 's forces carried that September day forty years ago ; beyond rose the wooded , castle-crowned height of Chapultepec ; still farther away were the towers and glistening domes of the city and the great shimmering lakes , and for background rose the blue-gray mountains above Guadalupe in the north . To the east , over across Lake Chalco , towered the great snow peaks of the volcanoes . " Upon my soul , I wish I had been born a Mexican , " said Pem , drawing a long breath . " Because the Mexicans happen to be possessors of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are better things for a people to have than landscapes , Sefior ; and some of these better things , if I am rightly told , your people have . " " Well , I must say I do n't know what they are . Just now I ca n't think of anything finer than this view - except the happy fact that you have done me the honor to lead me to it , Sefiorita . " " I could wish that you would not speak in that fanciful manner . It is in the custom of my own country , and I do not like it . I have been told that the Americans do not make fine speeches , and I shall be glad to know that it is so . Pem was rather taken aback by this frank statement of very un-Mexican sentiment . " The Sefiorita , then , does not approve of the customs of her own people , and is pleased to like the Americans ? For the compliment to my countrymen I give to the Sefiorita my thanks . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And why ? " " Is not this an answer ? " C6rmen replied , laying her hand upon the battle monument . Pem felt himself to be in an awkward corner , for the position that his Mexican friend had taken - while not , perhaps , in the very best of taste - was quite unassailable . As he rather stupidly stared at the ugly little monument , thus pointedly brought to his notice , he felt that it did indeed represent an act of unjust aggression that very well might make // Mexicans hate Americans for a thousand years . " As to the customs of my countrymen , " C6rmen continued , perceiving that the particular American before her was very much embarrassed , and politely wishing to extricate him from the trying position that , not very politely , she had placed him in , " some of them are very well . But this of making fine speeches to women is not well at all . Do the men have this foolish custom in your land , or is it only that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was a relief to have the subject changed in any way , but the new topic was one not altogether free from difficulties . Mr. Smith never before had been called upon to defend the utterance of a small gallantry upon ethical and ethnological grounds ; still less to treat the matter from the standpoint of comparative nationalities . " Well , I think that I have heard of civil speeches being made now and then by American men to American women , " he replied . " Yes , I believe that I am justified in telling you positively that speeches of this sort among us may be said to be quite everyday affairs . May I ask why the Sefiorita objects to them ? They strike me as being harmless , to say the least . " " They are idle and silly . It is the same talk that one would give to a cat . I do not know why a woman should be talked to as though she had nothing of sense . It is true , she can not know as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it believed that she knows more than a cat , and still not claim to be very xvise . And so , if the Sefior will permit the request , I will beg that he will keep his handsome speeches for those who like them and that he will say none to me at all . " See , our friends are coming towards us , and we will go back to the town . And the Sefior will pardon me if I have been rude . I should not have said what I did about Americans . I find now that they are not all bad . " There was more in the look that accompanied this utterance than there was in the words . " I have not had a very happy life , and sometimes , they tell me , I forget to be considerate of others and am unkind . But I have not meant to be unkind to-day . " The last portion of Cfirmen 's speech was hurried , for the party was close upon them , and they all were together again before Pem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue this , as he had found it , notwithstanding the awkward turns that it had taken , very interesting conversation . Cfirmen stuck close to her aunt , and was almostsilent , as they walked back to the garden ; and she contrived , as they returned by the tramway to the city , to seat herself quite away from him in the car . Since she so obviously had no desire to speak further , Pem felt that he would be pleasing her best by engaging the estimable Dofia Catalina in lively talk . This was not a difficult feat , for Dofia Catalina was a miracle of good-natured loquacity , who , in default of anything better to wag her tongue at , no doubt would have talked with much animation to her shoes . In view of the fact that he scarcely had been able to get in a word edgewise , he was rather tickled when this admirable woman , at parting , commended him warmly for having so well mastered the Spanish tongue . Pem ventured , at this juncture , to cast a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delighted by finding that his look was returned in kind . " A Mexican woman who does n't like pretty speeches , and who has such a charming way of qualifying her hatred of Americans , and who can see the point of a rather delicate joke , " thought Pem , " would be worth investigating though she were sixty years old and as ugly as the National Palace . And Cfirmen " - this was the first time , by the way , that he had thought of her as C6xmen - " I take it is not quite twenty yet ; and what perfectly lovely eyes she has ! " At dinner that night Mr. Smith was unusually silent . When rallied by the lively Violet upon his taciturnity he replied that he was rather tired . THE BATTLE OF cHuRuBuSco . WHEN the American party played the return match , as Ro'vney Mauve , who had cricketing proclivities , expressed it , by giving their Mexican friends a breakfast in the pretty San Cosine Tivoli , Carmen did not appear . She had a headache that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused . Rose commented upon this phase of the breakfast with her usual perspicuity . " I think that it all is working along very nicely , Van , do n't von ? " They had strolled off together and were out of ear-shot of the rest of the party . " What is working along nicely ? The breakfast ? Ves , it seems to be all right . The food was very fair , and our friends seemed to enjoy themselves after their customary rather demonstrative fashion . " " It is a great trial to me , Van , the way you never catch my meaning . I do n't mean the breakfast at all ; I mean about Mr. Smith and this lovely widow . Is n't it queer to think that she is a widow ? Except that she has a // serious way about her - that has come to her through her sorrow , of course , poor dear ! - nobody ever would dream that.she was anything but a young girl . What a romance her life has been ! " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . First she was traded off by her father for a hydrant , or something of that sort and then she had an old husband - a most objectionable old beast he must have been from what we have heard about him - die on her hands before she was much more than married to him . I should say that the whole l ) usiness was much less like a romance than like a nightmare . And as to this new match that you have made up for her working along nicely , it strikes me that just now it is working along about as badly as it can work . Did n't you see how Smith went off into the dumps the moment that he found his widow had stayed at home ? And do n't you think that her staying at home this way is the best possible proof that she does n't care a button for him ? Smith saw it quick enough , and that was what made him drop right down into dumpiness . So would I , if I d been him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You used to come and take walks with me , Rosey ,  --  in the old days when we were spooning in Greenwich ,  --  when your head was aching fit to split , you precious child . " They were in an out-of-the-way part of the garden , and on the strength of this memory Brown put his arm around his wife and kissed her . After which interlude he added : " So ca n't you see that all your match-making is moonshine ? It 's a case of he loved the lady , but the lady loved not him , ' and you might as well accept the situation and stop your castlebuilding . " " You are a very dear boy , Van , and of course I d go walking with you even without any head at all . But about love-matters you certainly are very short-sighted . You ca n't help it , I suppose , because you re a man ; and men never understand these things at all . But any woman could tell you at a glance that this love affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on splendidly . Even you can see that Mr. Smith is in love with her . Well , I do n't think that she s exactly in love with him yet ; but I am quite certain that she feels that if she does n't take care she will be . That s the reason she had a headache and did n't come to-day . " " What a comfort it would be to Smith to know that ! " Brown remarked with fine irony . " You had better tell him , my dear . " " Yes , of course it would be , " Rose answered , entirely missing the irony . " And I ye been thinking that I would tell him , Van ; VOL . XXXVI. - 102. 74 ' only I thought that perhaps you would n't like me to . I m very glad you wo n't mindfor of course he does n't see , men are so stupid about such things . Suppose we go and hunt him up now , and then you go away and leave us together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him . " " Suppose you tell me first . I 11 be shot if I see much that s encouraging in her shying off from him this way . " " Why , I kave told you , Van . It s because she is afraid that if she sees any more of him she really will fall in love with him ; and of course , after her dreadful experience with that horrid old man , she has made up her mind that she never will marry again . That is the way that any nice girl would feel about it . And of course , if she s 50 much interested in Mr. Smith that she wo n't trust herself to see him , it is perfectly clear that he has made a very good start towards getting her to love him . What we must do now is to help him- " " Steady , Rose ; do n't go off your head , my child . This is n't our funeral . " " It is our funeral . Why , it s anybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think how much we owe to dear Verona for the way that she helped us . Certainly we must help him . And the first thing for us to do is to give him another good chance to have a talk with her . That s all they want at present . No doubt we can do some other things later ; and we will , of course . Why , Van , how can you be so heartless as not to be ready to do everything in your power to help your friend when the whole happiness of his life is at stake ! And think what a good thing it will be for this poor sweet , broken-hearted girl , whose life has gone all wrong , to make it go right again . " Mrs. Brown 's strongest characteristic was not , perhaps , moderation . In the present instance , while her husband was not wholly convinced by her vigorous line of argument , he found her enthusiasm rather contagious . " What are you going to do about it ? " he asked , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage just what has to be done now , getting them together again , you know , this way : You know Don Antonio has on hand an expedition for us to that beautiful old convent that he has been talking about , where there is such lovely tilework , out at Churubusco . We had better arrange things now to go day after to-morrow . And to-morrow Mr. Smith shall send a note to Don Antonio telling him that he is very sorry to miss the expedition , but that he has decided to go up to see a friend in Toluca . He has been talking about that engineer up at Toluca whom he used to go to school // with , so Don Antonio will think it all right and perfectly natural . And that will fix things beautifully . For then she 11 go , of course . " " I do n't see how it will fix anything beautifully for him to go off to Toluca . He wo n't see his widow there . " " 0 you foolish boy ! He wo n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't he would n't be telling the truth in his note to Don Antonio , " - Rose had a very nice regard for the truth ,  --  " but instead of staying at least one night , as of course they will expect him to , he must come right back to Mexico by the afternoon train . And then he can tell Don Antonio , when we all meet at the car , as we did the other day , that he has returned on purpose to join his party ; and that will please Don Antonio - and then it will be too late for her to back out . And if he needs any help to get her off to himself when we are out at the convent , he can depend upon me to see that he gets it ! Is n't that a pretty good plan , Van ? How delightful and exciting it all is ! It s almost as though we were overcoming difficulties and obstacles and getting married again ourselves , is n't it , dear ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it s mainly vigorous imagination let loose upon a very small amount of fact . But we 11 play your little game , Rosey , just for the fun of the thing . Only there s one thing , child , that you must be careful about . You ca n't make your plan go without explaining it to Smith . Now do n't you tell him all the nonsense you have been telling me about the way you think the widow feels towards him . I do n't think it s so ; and since he really seems to be rather hard hit , it is n't fair to set him up with a whole lot of hopes and then have things turn out the other way and knock him down again . Tell him that it is just barely possible that things are the way you think they are , and that your plan is in the nature of an experiment that probably will have no result at all , or will turn out altogether badly - as I certainly think it will . I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put the matter to him this way , at least you wo n't do him any harm . " And Rose , perceiving the justice of her husband 's utterance , promised him that in her treatment of this delicate affair she would be very circumspect indeed . THE first part of the plan thus skillfully elaborated worked to a charm . When the Americans joined Don Antonio and his party on the plaza , to take the special tram-car in waiting for them on the Tlalpam tracks , Rose gave Van a delighted nudge and whispered : " See , she has come , just as I said she would . And oh ! oh ! " - Rose squeezed Van s arm in her excitement with what he considered quite unnecessary vigor - " she has just seen Mr. Smith , and she is , indeed she is , changing color ! Do n't you see it ? Now you know that I was right all along . " Brown , being on the lookout for it , did perceive this sign of confusion on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else , Pem alone excepted , noticed it . Another good sign , as Rose interpreted it , was that while Don Antonio and the rest were running over with voluble expressions of their pleasure because the Sefior Esmit - the first letter and the digraph in Pem 's name was too much for them - had cut short his visit to his friend in Toluca in order to join them in their outing , Cirmen maintained a discreet silence . Pem , not being gifted with Rose 's powers of tortuous penetration , regarded this silence as ominous , until Rose , perceiving that he was going wrong , managed to whisper to him cheeringly , " It s all right . Quick , go and sit by her I " But this friendly advice came too late to be acted upon . Carmen , possibly foreseeing Pein 's intention , executed a rapid flank movement - that Rose thought made the case still more hopeful , and that Pem thought made it still more hopeless - by which she placed herself securely between her aunt and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . Under these discouraging circumstances Pem fell back on his reserve - that is to say , on Rose ; who made a place for him to sit beside her and , so far as this was possible without being too marked in her confidences , said what she could to cheer and comfort him . And , indeed , this young gentleman 's requirements in the way of cheering and comforting were very considerable . He had confided freely in Rose - Rose was a most refreshingly sympathetic confidante in a love affair - after she herself had broken the ice for him ; and the very fact of talking to her about his heart-troubles had done a good deal to give them substance and directness . As the result of several conversations , Rose arrived at the conclusion that if C*irmen had come to the breakfast at San Cosine , and had treated Pem in an every-day , matter-of-fact sort of way , the affair very likely would have been there and then ended . " But when I went to breakfast , and she was not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly realized how dreadfully much I had counted upon seeing her , and what a hold she had upon me generally . And then , while I was wretchedly low in my mind about it all , you came to me like // an angel and told me that perhaps I had something to hope for . I should n't have hoped at all if it had n't been for you . I think that I might even have had sense enough just to let it all go , and started right back for the States . And that would have been the end of it . But now that you have encouraged me , I m quite another man . I shall fight it out now till she absolutely throws me over , or till I marry her . " In the matter of family , Mrs. Brown , " Pem went on , his Philadelphia instincts asserting themselves , " the marriage is a very desirable one . Her people have been established in America even longer than mine . Her cousin tells me that they trace their ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolosa line , you know ,  --  and they are connected with some of the very best families of Mexico and Spain . So , you see , there is no reason why I should not make her my wife . If it can be done , I m going to do it ; and if it ca n't  --  well , if it ca n't , there wo n't be much left in my life that s worth living for , that s all . " When Rose reported this conversation to her husband he listened with an air of serious concern . " You ye shoved yourself into a tolerably good-sized responsibility , Rosey , " he said ; " and I m inclined to think , my child , that you re going to make a mess of it . I should advise you , if you are lucky enough to get out of this scrape with a whole skin , to take it as a sort of solemn warning that in future you will save yourself a good deal of trouble if you will let other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , my dear I do n't see how you can do anything but go ahead and try to bring Smith out all right on the other side . " Rose would not admit , of course , that she felt at all overpowered by the weight of her responsibility ; but she did feel it , at least a little , and consequently hailed with a very lively satisfaction every act on Cftrmen 's part that possibly could be construed as supporting the hopeful view of the situation that she so energetically avowed . She went into the fight with all the more vigor now that victory was necessary not only to the happiness of her ally , but to the vindication of her own reputation as the projector of heart-winning campaigns . Rose was encouraged by the fact that the tactics of the enemy were distinctively defensive . She argued that this betrayed a consciousness , possibly only instinctive , but none the less real , of forces insufficient to risk a general engagement ; and she further argued that the most effective plan of attack would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , Carmen herself- from her reserves ,  - -  that is to say , from the protection of her aunt and other relatives ,  --  - and then to force a decisive battle . Before the car reached San Mateo she had communicated this plan to Pem , and he had agreed to it . But it is one thing to plan a campaign in the cabinet , and it is quite another thing to carry on the campaign in the field . The allies presently had this fact in military science pointedly brought home to them . From where the car was stopped , near the little old parish church of San Mateo ,  --  closed now and falling into ruin , for the near-by conventual church has been used in its stead , - the party walked a short half-mile along a lane bordered by magueys , and then came out upon a plazuela whereon the main gate of the convent opened . In the middle of the plazuela Pem saw , much to his disgust , another pyramidal battle monument , inscribed , like the one at Molino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shown in the gallant but futile resistance offered to the invading armies of the Americans of the North . It was very unlucky , he thought , that their expeditions should be directed so persistently to the old battle-fields of that wretched war . Since Carmen s pointed reference to the war he had bought a Mexican school history and had read up on it ; and , even allowing for the natural bias of the historian , the more that he read about the part played by his own country the more was he ashamed of his own countrymen . Yet he could not but think also that it was rather hard that he should have to bear such a lot of responsibility for an event that occurred before he was born . It was n't fair in Cftrmen , he thought , to liven up a dead issue like that and make it so confoundedly personal . A couple of Mexican soldiers , in rather draggled linen uniforms , were sitting sentry lazily at the convent gate ; and Don Antonio explained that the convent proper was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close in front of it , remained devoted to religious purposes , he said ; and that portion of the old convent which inclosed the inner quadrangle had been reserved as a dwellingplace for the parish priest . Passing to the left and turning the angle in the wall , they came to an arched gateway approached by a short flight of stone steps ; and through this stately entrance , albeit somewhat shorn of its stateliness by the ruinous condition of its great wooden doors , they entered , and descended another short flight of steps into the close . " Where are your Italian convents now ? " Brown asked , turning to Rowney Mauve , who // that morning had been talking rather airily about Italian convents . " You admitted as we came along how good this place was in mass - not scattered a bit , but all the lines well worked together - and how well the gray and brown of the walls , and the green of the trees , and the blue and white tiling of the dome , come together . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy better than this great high-walled close , with its heavy shadows from these stunning trees and from the church and the convent , and its bits of color from these stations of the cross in colored tiles ? The church might be better , but it has at least a certain heavy grandeur , and the little tower up there is capital . And look , how well those black arches close beside it bring out that perfectly beautiful little chapel - I suppose it is a chapel - completely covered with blue and yellow tiles ! There are , no doubt , grander churches than this in Italy , and in several other places ; but I 11 be shot if I believe that there are any more perfectly picturesque or more entirely beautiful . Smith , just tell Don Antonio that I shall be grateful to him to the end of my days for having shown me this lovely place . " " He says that the cloister is finer , " Pem translated , while Don Antonio 's face beamed thanks upon the party at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic expression of opinion . " And he says that the finest tile-work is in the choir . I must say I do n't remember anything in Spain better than this . It s the rich , subdued color of it all , and the light and shade , I suppose , that does the business . I do n't think it would paint , though ; do you , Orpiment ? " " No , I do n't . You could make a pretty good picture of it ; but the picture would n't go for much with anybody who had seen the original . You ca n't paint a place that goes all around you , the way that this does ; and you ca n't paint the spirit and the feeling of it - at least I ca n't ; and that s what you d have to get here if you got anything at all . No , this is one of the places that we d better let alone . " The decision , which was a wise one , having been arrived at , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so entered the inner quadrangle , surrounded by an arched cloister two stories high , the walls wainscoted with blue and white tiles . In the open , sunny center was a little garden , and in the midst of the garden a curious old stone fountain in which purely transparent water bubbled up from a spring with such force as to make a jet three or four inches high above the center of the large pool . The bubbling water glittered in the sunlight , and little waves that seemed half water and half sunshine constantly went out from the throbbing center of the pool and fell away lightly upon its inclosing quaintly carved walls of stone . Here there was another outburst of admiration on the part of the Americans , and xvhile they were in the midst of it the parish priest , attracted by the sound of so many voices in this usually silent and forgotten place , came forth from a low archway and stared about him wonderingly . He was a little round man , with a kindly , gentle face , and a simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustful heart . Mrs. Gamboge , who entertained tolerably strong convictions in regard to the Scarlet Woman , and who heretofore had held as a cardinal matter of faith that every Roman Catholic priest was a duly authorized agent of the Evil One , found some difficulty in reconciling with these sound Protestant views the look and manner , and such of the talk as was translated to her , of this simple-minded , single-hearted man . When it was made clear to the little padre that this distinguished company , including even Americans from the infinitely remote city of New York , had come to look at his church because it was beautiful , his expression of mingled amazement and delight was a joy to behold . It had never occurred to him , he said , that anybody but himself should think of his poor church as beautiful . He had thought it so for a long while , ever since he had been brought to this parish from his former parish of Los Reyes , where the church was very small and very shabby , and , moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feeling for the beauty of his church was only because he loved it so well ; for in all the years that he had been there no one ever had even hinted that it was anything more than churches usually are . Yet it had seemed to him , he said modestly , that there was something about the way the shadows fell in the morning in the close , and something at that time about the colors of the walls and the richer color of the tiles , the like of which he had not seen elsewhere . In the stillness and quiet , amidst these soft shadows and soft colors , somehow he found that his heart became so full that often , without at all meaning to pray , he would find his thoughts shaping themselves in prayer . " Good for the padre , " said Orpiment when Pem translated this to him . " That 's the part of that picture that I said could n't be painted . He does n't look it a bit , but that little round man is an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful things , not because he was an artist but because he had a simple mind and a pure soul . Under the padre 's guidance the party entered the church - commonplace within , for // reformation had destroyed its seventeenthcentury quaintness - and thence passed up through the convent to the choir . This beautiful place , rich in elaborate tile-work , remained intact ; and even the great choir-books , wrought on parchment in colored inks , still rested on the faldstool , waiting for the brothers to cluster around them once again in song . And there were the benches whereon the brothers once had rested ; the central chair , in which Father Saint Francis had sat in effigy ; and to the right of this the chair of the father guardian . But the brothers had departed forever , legislated out of existence by the Laws of the Reform . Rose gave a little shudder as she looked about her in this solemn , deserted place , and with her customary clearness of expression declared that it was " something like being in an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " said Mr. Mangan Brown , who was a martyr to sea-sickness , " that Americans constantly are crossing that beastly Atlantic Ocean in search of the picturesque when things like this are to be seen dry-shod almost at their doors . Let us have our breakfast at once . " There was a lack of consecutiveness about Mr. Brown 's remark , but its abstract comment and concrete suggestion were equally well received . Even Rowney Mauve , who was disposed to be critical , admitted that there were " several things worth looking at in Miexico , " and added , by way of practical comment upon Mr. Brown 's practical proposal , that he was as hungry as a bear . All this while Rose had been endeavoring to bring about the fete-*-I6/e between Pem and Carmen that she believed would tend to the accomplishment of their mutual happiness . But her efforts had been unsuccessful . C*rmen s defensive tactics no longer admitted of doubt , and even Rose was beginning to think that her sanguine interpretation of their meaning might be open to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her supports . She determined now to attempt the more difficult task of drawing off these supports , and so leaving Carmen isolated . The breakfast , a very lively meal eaten in the lower cloister to the accompaniment of the tinkling of water falling from the fountain , gave her the desired opportunity for organizing her forces . With the intelligent assistance of Violet , who was taken into partial confidence because her knowledge of Spanish made her a valuable auxiliary , Rose contrived to break up the party , when breakfast was ended , so that she , Doi*a Catalina , C6xmen , and Pem remained together , while the others scattered to explore the convent . Then , Pem serving as 745 interpreter , she asked the ladies if it would be possible to walk in the tangled old garden that they had seen from a window in the sacristy . Dofia Catalina , being devoted to gardens , as Mexican women usually are , accepted the proposition immediately and heartily ; and Cftrinen  --  a little uneasily , Rose thoughtfell in with the plan . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guide them through a long , dark corridor and so into his domain of trees and flowers . He was full of enthusiasm about the garden . It had been restored to the church only a month before , he said , after belonging to the hospital ever since the property had been confiscated . The soldiers had done nothing with it . The ladies could see for themselves its neglected state . They must come again in a year 's time , and then they would see one of the finest gardens in the world . And full of delight , the little man explained with great volubility his plans for pruning and training , for clearing away weeds and rubbish , and for making his wilderness once more to blossom like the rose . Dofia Catalina , having her own notions about gardens , entered with much animation into his plans , and they talked away at a great rate . So Rose and Pem and Cfirmen walked through the shady alleys slbwly , while Dofia Catalina and the priest , walking still more slowly , and stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explained , dropped a long way behind . It was a perfect Mexican day . Overhead was a clear , very dark-blue sky ; liquid sunshine fell warmly through the cool , crisp air ; a gentle wind idled along easily among the branches of the trees . The garden was very still . The only sound was a low buzzing of bees among the blossoms , and the faint gurgle of the flowing water in conduits unseen amidst the trees . Rose stepped aside to pluck a spray of peach blossoms . Cfirmen half stopped , but Pem , with admirable presence of mind , walked slowly on without pausing in the rather commonplace remark that he happened to be making in regard to the advantages of irrigation . A few steps farther on they came to a half-ruined arbor . They turned here and looked back along the alley , but Rose was not in sight . " She will join us in a moment , " said Pem . " She is looking for flowers - she is very fond of flowers . Shall we wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade ? " C6rmen stood for a moment irresolute . As the result of what she believed to be a series of small accidents , she found herself now in precisely the situation that she had determined to avoid - alone with this Americano whom // she had decided in her own mind to keep at a safe distance . Yet now that the situation that she had tried hard to render impossible actually had been brought about she found in it a certain excitement in which pleasure was blended curiously with pain . Her position certainly was weakened , for Pem observed , and counted the sign a good one , that her color had increased and that her eyes were brighter even than usual . She herself was conscious that the attack now had passed inside of the skirmish line , and made an effort - not a very vigorous one - to rally her forces . " Sefiorita ! Sefiorita ! " she called , but not very loudly , and her voice lacked firmness . There was no answer . " She will be here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant in this shady place . Will not the Sefiorita seat herself ? And will she answer me one question ? " Pem 's own heart was getting up into his throat in an awkward sort of way , and his voice was not nearly so steady as he wished it to be . But the chance had come that he had been waiting for , and he was determined to make the most of it . C6rmen gave a hurried glance around her . Rose still remained invisible . It was very lonely there in the old garden , and the stillness seemed to be intensified by the low , soft buzzing of the bees . There was a tightness about her heart , and she felt a little faint . Her color had left her face , and she was quite pale . She seated herself with a little sigh . But she realized that another rally was necessary , for the shakiness of Pem 's voice had an unmistakable meaning . She could guess pretty well , no matter what his one question might be , in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must check him before it was spoken . Her wits , however , were not in very good working order , and she presented the first thought that came into her mind  --  the thought , indeed , that had been uppermost in her mind all that day : " The Sei*ior soon will leave Mexico ? " she said . She was aware even as these words were spoken that they served her purpose badly . Pem perceived this too , and hastened to avail himself of the opening . " And the SeiXorita will be glad when I am gone ? " " Glad ? No . But things must end , and the Sefior no doubt now is tired of this land and will have pleasure in returning to his own . He will have many lively stories to tell his friends about the savages whom he has seen in Mexico ; and then presently he will forget Mexico and the savages , and will be busied again with his own concerns . Is it not so ? " " Is it the custom of Mexicans thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or does the SeiTiorita argue by contraries and declare that , because Mexicans are grateful , there is no such virtue as gratitude among Americans ? Does the Sefiorita truly in her heart believe that I shall forget the kindness that has been shown to me here , and the -- and those who have shown it ? " " Ah , well , it is a little matter , not worth talking about , " C6rmen replied , uneasily . " No doubt some Americans have feelings of gratitude , and other virtues as well . But , as the Seflor knows , I am not fond of Americans . I know too well the story of my own country . Yes , I know that I should not have spoken of this again , " C*rmen went on , answering the pained look on Pem 's face , " but it is not my fault . The Sefior should not have made me talk about Americans . " This with a little air of defiance . " And least of all in this place . The SeiTior knows that this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he remember that after the surrender , when he was asked to give up his ammunition , the General Anaya replied , Had I any ammunition , you would not be here ' ? Is not that the whole story of the war , told in a single word ? Does the Sefior wonder that I hate the Americans with all my heart ? " Pem was less disconcerted by this sally than he had been by the similar revival of dead issues at Molino del Rey . He was fairly well convinced in his own mind that C6rmen was saying not more than she meant in the abstract , perhaps ; but , certainly , a good deal more than she meant in the concrete as applied to himself . It was his belief that she was forcing ' this new fighting of the old war as a rather desperate means of delivering herself from engaging in a new and more personal conflict . He also inferred from her adoption of a line of defense that he knew was distasteful to her that , like General Anaya , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disposed to press the attack vigorously . " Let us not talk about Americans , " he said . " Let us talk about one single American . Does the Sefiorita hate me ? " This sudden and very pointed question produced much the same effect as that of the unmasking of a heavy mortar battery . It threw the enemy into great confusion , and for a moment completely silenced the defending guns . C*trmen was not prepared for so sharp a shifting of the conversation from general to exceedingly personal grounds . She flushed again , and then again grew pale . She was silent for a very long while-at least so it seemed to Pem . Her head was reclining backward against the trellis-work of the arbor in a way that showed the beautiful lines of her throat . Her eyes were nearly closed , and almost wholly veiled // by her long black lashes- that seemed still blacker by contrast with her pale cheeks . Her mouth was open a little , and her breath came and went irregularly . Her face was very still ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , he saw an expression of resolve come into it . Then at last she spoke : " I do hate you , " she said slowly and firmly . But as she spoke the words there was a drawing of the muscles of her face , as though she suffered bodily pain . " Unearthed at last ! By Jove , Smith , I had begun to think that you and the Sefiorita and Rose had fitted yourselves out with wings and flown away somewhere . I ye been looking for you high and low , literally ; for I ye been up on the roof of the convent , and now I m down here . Where is Rose ? Dofia Catalina said that you all three were here in the garden . Oh ! there she comes now . Come ! We re all waiting for you ; it s time to start back to town . " Brown was of the opinion that he did not at all deserve the rating that Rose gave him , on the first convenient opportunity , for perpetrating this most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were spooning by themselves ? " he asked . " I thought that you all three were together , of course . " And although Rose , who took the matter a good deal to heart , replied that this " was just like him , " she could not but accept this reasonable excuse . On Pem and C6rmen the effects of the interruption were different . Whatever her more considerate opinion might be , C6rmen 's first feeling certainly was that of relief . She had fired the shot that she had nerved herself to fire , and the diversion had come just in time to check the reply of the enemy and to cover her orderly retreat . Pem , realizing that the situation was critical , was thoroughly indignant . He wanted to punch Brown 's head . Fortunately no opportunity offered for this practical expression of his wrath , and by the time that he got back to town he had cooled down a little . But he was so grumpy on the return journey , and looked so thoroughly uncomfortable , that the motherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frankly asked him- with the freedom that is permissible in Spanish- if anything that he had eaten at breakfast had disagreed with him ? And being only half-convinced by his disclaimer , she advised him to take promptly a tumblerful of hot water strengthened with a little tequila . ( To be concluded in the next number. ) 74ornas A.
