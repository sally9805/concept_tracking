txt Attorney-General Youmans obtained leave to-day in the United States Circuit Court to preseut , arguments against the District Attorney 's motion to replenish petit juries at this term . John F. Breland and David Williams , State Constables , and David C. Bradley testified for the defense , in the Buford 's Bridge Precinct case , that there was no intimidation ; the colored men came to the poll at daylight in squads of 100 , as was supposed , to overawe the Democrats and capture the ballot-box ; they told the colored men they could vote after the white men were through voting ; the colored men had pistols in their pockets and clubs and hatchets in their hands , and the Democrats . though similarly armed , were exenedingly tolerant in their behavior toward the Republicans on election day . District Attorney Melton 's searching and rapid cross-examination bewildered the witnesses , and in their efforts to clear the defendants they proved too much . They showed their presence at more than one place at the same time , and otherwise stultified themselves . Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Township , with 30 or 40 neighbors , in red shirts . only three of whom he said he knew , and instead of going to Allendale , the nearest polling precinct , they went to Buford 's Bridge , three miles further , where they arrived at midnight and camped until the next morning , to vote and return home before the colored voters came on the ground , though he reluctantly admitted that ho and his friends remained at the precinct until the poll closed the next evening . John A. Connelly , a very respectable and intelligent colored witness for the prosecution , said after the court adjourned : " If I had told such Iles as these men told on the witness stand to-day , under oath , I would be afraid God would strike me dead . "
