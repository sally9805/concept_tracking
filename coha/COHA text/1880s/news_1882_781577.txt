txt This is the time of year when the struggling newspaper endeavors to bribe people to become its subscribers . The custom is an old one , but in the absence of any readily accessible records one can but wonder what bribes were offered in the days when sewing-machines , ; chromes , and big dictionaries were unknown . Perhaps the past generation was lured into subscribing for undesirable newspapers by gifts of Thanksgiving turkeys and well-filled Christmas stockings .. Certainly bribery of some sort must have been used or an enormous mortality among country papers would have happened . The chromo was an admirable newspaper bribe while it was a novelty . The offer of the Sheboygan Bugle of Freedom for one year and a superb chromo of " Washington Crossing the Delaware , " all for $1 50 , was very tempting to thrifty and ingenuous people who could be induced to believe that the market price of the chromo in question was $6 . The subscriber hung up his chromo in his front parlor and left his newspaper in the Post Office , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for art and saved $4 50 at one stroke . The chromo business was , however , soon ? overdone . Nearly every man , woman , and child was presented with a chromo , and there was not a kitchen , a barn , or a stable in the whole country  --  to say nothing of parlors and bedrooms  --  that was not ornamented with chromos . The public discovered that the six-dollar chromos offered by the newspapers could be bought at wholesale at about 50 cents per dozen , and it was soon rumored that Boston art critics had decided that a chrome was not a picture , and had nothing whatever to do with art . Thereupon a reaction against the chromo set in , and no newspaper with any self-respect dared to offer the despised article as a bribe . Then came the turn of the sewing-machine . The trouble with the sewing-ma chine , regarded as a bribe , was the fact that it was costly . No newspaper publisher could buy a sewing-machine of good quality for less than $30 , and he obviously could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's subscription to his paper , for $1 50 . Thus it became necessary to saddle the offer of a sewing-machine with the condition of subscribing for fifty copies of the newspaper . It was all very well to inform people that whoever would subscribe for fifty copies of the Oshkosh Bird of Freedom would receive a splendid sewing-machine , with hemming , button-holing , brushing , and boot-blacking attachments , but a man who was unwilling - to take even one copy of the Bird of Freedom could not for a moment entertain the idea of taking fifty copies . An enterprising individual here and there contrived to gather fifty innocent subscribers and to thus secure a sewing-machine for himself without the complicating newspapers ; but the number of such men was small , and before very long the sewing-machine bribe was recognized as a failure . The Tribune has endeavored to improve its circulation by offers of books . This was , in the circumstances , an admirable bribe .. People did not like to accept a newspaper , even in connection with the most attractive bribes , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of books of absorbing interest  --  such as big dictionaries and treatises on farming  --  it was so evident that these books could be read , even if the Tribune was unreadable , that the bribe proved more or less successful . It has remained for a Western journalist to devise a new and brilliant scheme for obtaining subscriptions . It is obvious to the dullest mind that there is nothing in nature so valuable and attractive as a pretty and estimable girl . Girls of this nature are  --  according to SoLcorox , who had exceptional advantages for forming an opinion  --  worth their weight not merely in gold but in rubies . The offer of a desirable girl as a reward for subscribing to a country newspaper would be infinitely the most attractive offer that could be made , but unfortunately it is an impracticable offer . No newspaper publisher could provide himself with a sufficient number of girls for the purpose , inasmuch as no girl would be willing to permit herself to be offered indiscriminately to any subscriber . Nevertheless , the ingenuity of the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has by this time secured every marriageable man in his neighborhood as a subscriber . Nothing is more feasible and more unobjectionable than to induce the girls of a given town to agree not to marry any man who is not a subscriber to a given newspaper . This is what the Western publisher has done . By means of a comparatively small outlay on caramels and ice-cream ho has induced every girl in what he would call his " section of country " to take a solemn pledge never to marry any man who is not a paid-up subscriber to the Smithstown Flag of Universal Freedom , price $1 50 per year . Now , it is obvious that a man who will riot expend $1 50 in order to make himself eligible for marriage is not worth marrying . If the publisher can hold the girls to their pledge  --  as ho undoubtedly can  --  the future of his newspaper is secured , and his example will be followed by every other enterprising country newspaper publisher throughout the country . The advertising columns of each paper will contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and the rush of subscribers will he like a mighty and universal flood .
