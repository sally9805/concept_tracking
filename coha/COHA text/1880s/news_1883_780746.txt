txt Now that the New-London Navy-yard has been abandoned by the Government . the old naval junk that has been lying for years at its wharves is to be disposed of by proposals , to be opened on Sept. 24 . The gunboat Florida . whose tattered , dull lead-colored sides , and monstrous chimneys have been an object of euriosity to tourists riding up the Thames River Valley , has been appraised at $64,000 , It is probably all that she is worth . She was built at an expense of $1,750,000 by the Government and was designed to be the fastest war vessel afloat . The intention was to send her out to catch the pirate Alabama . She made pne trip South , came North , and went to the Brooklyn Navy-yard . After rotting there for several years she was sent to the NewLondon yard , where she has since lain . It is said that her engines are the most powerful ever introdubed into a vessel . On her first trip she made 22 knots an hour ; but it was discovered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could supply her ravenous furnaces with fuel for a long voyage . The wood-work of the old hulk is in extreme dilapidation and ready to fall Into the sea . Her companion at the yard , the Blue Light . a small steam vessel , has been appraised at $5,000 . The New-London yard was never a successful Government venture . It is a mile or more above New-London , on the east shore of the Thames , on a dead level plain of sand and gravel that sweeps from the river back to the stony huckleberry ridge of a poor cow-pasture . In the centre or the space are two or three dead-looking brick Government buildings , with blinded windows and sealed doors . In the weedy waste of sand and gravel around a form endowed with life is seen only at intervals of weeks . Activity ceased and time has been at a stand-still since the workmen on the buildings pulled down their ladders and scaffolding and went away .

The story is in New-London that at times on cloudy afternoons a figure in faded blue , and capped by a Panama hat , with ruddy face turning grayish , and with white whiskers tinged with tobacco stains , has been seen to come out through the hatchway of one of the buildings , stroll down to the wharf , and strain his eyes seaward . Then it was noticed that he took a bite of plug and strolled back , closing the hatch snugly behind him . It was supposed to be the form of Capt . Sam Huntoon , of Norwich . who is said to be the.appointed keeper of the station . The yard has lacked even the still-lifo features that at times enliven " sailors ' snug harbors " or " seamen 's retreats . " For years Congressman Stark-weather , and afterhim Congressman John T.
