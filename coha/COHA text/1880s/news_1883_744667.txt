txt Considerable excitement was created in this city to-day by the announcement that the steel manufacturing firm of Hussey , Howe &; Co. , one of the most extensive in the district , had acceded to the terms of the Amalgamated Association and signed the scale of wages as submitted at the recent meeting of the conference committee . A call at Amalgamated Association head-quarters confirmed the truth of the announcement , as the book containing the signatures of the firm and the mill committee of three was in the hands of Secretary Martin and submitted for inspection . When asked what effect , if any , the action of Hussey . Howe &; Co. would have on the situation between the manufacturers and their employes , Mr. Martin replied that the amalgamated association was not inclined to boast , and that he would prefer to await further developments before expressing an opinion . It was evident , however , that the signature was a surprise , and that it ware considered an important matter . Manufacturers are somewhat surprised , but only because the scale had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Weeks . said that it had been expected from the first that all the steel mines in the country would:sign the scale at once . They have no interests in common with iron manufacturers , and their action will not influence the determination of the latter one way or tho other . Secretary Martin , of the Amalgamated Association . let out a secret to-day that will have an important bearing on the strike . In reply to a question concerning the situation in the Ohio district he said the men in that section would demand as advance in puddler 's wages to $6 per ton , and a corresponding advance all around , to take effeet after the 1st of June . This was the rate naid until two years ago and Mr. Martin says the men are determined to have the old order of things restored . This move , it is said , has been orieinated within the nest week . It is intended to get the men of the Cincinnati district so thoroughly interested in the strike that they will not resume work on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brunt of the strike , as they did last year . If the move is successful it will prolong the strike considerably . Congressman Bayne , in an interview on the situation , reiterated an assertion made by him a few days ago that the new tariff did not make necessary so large a reduction of wages as is proposed by the manufacturers , and also asserts that he was advised to vote for the Compromise Tariff bill by H. W. Oliver , Jr. , a member of the Tariff Commission , and one of the most extensive iron manufactUrers in the country . Of this , Coneressman Bayne says : " I do n't know what reasons Mr. Oliver had or gave for advising Cougressmen to vote for the bill . I have heard motives attributed to him both before and since the passage of the bill that do not coincide with the one given by D. B. Oliver . One statement was that Blaine was opposed to the bill and that the anti-Blaine element in the Republican Party did not wish to see the bill defeated under such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement was that , although the rates of duty on some classes of iron and most classes of steel were considerably reduced by the new tariff , there were steel wire rods which pay 30 per cent . ad valorem under the old law and which will pay six-tenths of a cent per pound , or $13 44 per ton , under the new . It was said that one Pittsburg establisment had contracted in December last for the entire product of the two largest German mills up to July 1 , proximo , when the next tariff was expected to go into operation . You ' can easily investigate this statement and whom it affects . " As the firm with which Mr. Oliver is connected is the only one in Pittsburg consuming wire rods in large quantities , the only inference to be drawn from the statement quoted was that Col. Bayne believed Mr. Oliver 's anxiety for the passage of the bill was on account of selfish motives . When this was mentioned to Mr. Oliver to-day he said : " I decline to be interviewed on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last Congress . I devoted nearly the whole of my time for a year to tariff work , and am satisfied to let the country judge of my motives from the results . "
