txt The week 's adjournment of the Legislature on account of the centennial in New-York has lurnished the railroad corporations an opportunity for massing their forces for the great encounter which is to take place on the floor of the House next week over the Housatonic Road . The petition of that road for charter amendment and power to increase its capital stock has been made the special order for Wednesday , May 15 . The representatives of the Consolidated Road were anxious that the majority report of the Railroad Committee , denying the petitioners the rights asked for , should be disposed of last week . This course was opposed by the friends of the Housatonic Road in the House , and was defeated . So far as the House members of the Railroad Committee are concerned , they are equally divided on the Housatonic question , with the Chairman , Col. Brown , in favor of the petitioners . It has come to be a question now whether the general railroad law or the state shall be supplanted or net by a statute that places for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the Railroad Commissioners . There has been a general outcry in the state against the bill reported by the majority of the committee , which proposes a most radical departure from public policy heretofore in regard to the building of branch lines of railways . Violent assaults have been made by the attorneys of the Consolidated Road . on the legality of the Housatonle'e transactions in spite of the fact that the transactions were in accordance with the advice of lawyers like the Hoe . Simeon E. Baldwin of New-Haven , Sullivan &; Cromwell of New-York , and the late Sidney Bartlett of Boston . The contest is the bitterest one in tee annals of railroad warfare In Connecticut , and no doubt greater interests are involved in it than in any other that has taken place since the consolidation of railroad systems in the State .
