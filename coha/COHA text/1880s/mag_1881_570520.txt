ARTICLE IV. - THE SUNDAY SCHOOL LIBRARY . THE Annual Report of the Maine Sunday School Union , in 1827 , spoke of it as a subject for congratulation that Sunday school libraries were becoming popular . The report used this language : " We Consider them among the most interesting and useful means of religous instruction now employed ; and probably , as a stimulus to induce the poor classes of children to come to the schools and to continue in them , they will be more powerful than anything else . And , further , as the children become interested in this kind of reading , it will , in many instances , extend its happy influences to the parents . Parents not given to religious reading , are not unfrequently induced to read the books which the children carry home . " If the matter were put to vote to-day in all our religious corninanities , a very large majority would be found ready to reassert , in substance , this utterance of a half a century ago . That the Sunday school library is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers agree . That there are evils - real evils to be guarded against-connected with it , every one who knows any thing of the matter , is free to confess . That there may be improvements , some radical , some as to details , introduccd into the whole system , is clear . That all concerned ought to work toward a continually advancing standard , is evident . But that on the whole , in spite of all deficiencies and drawbacks , both theoretically and practically the Sunday school library is a means of good , and may be made still more useful , we take to be demonstrated . The strong words quoted from the Maine report , it should be borne in mind , were uttered concerning the library of fifty years ago . The range of choice then was very limited , for children 's literature was just beginning to be . Some of us whose memories do not go back as far as that by a good deal , can still remember the character of some of the books which had drifted down into our later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday // school literature , books at which the ragamuffins of our mission schools would now turn up their noses . But if those words of the Maine report were true then , as no doubt they were , much more will their equivalent be true to-day , when the range of suitable literature for this purpose is very wide , when a judicious system of selection can secure a large library of really choice and valuable books . There is one argument for the existence of the Sunday school library that , apart from every other consideration , is the sufficient justification of its being . This is the antidote it presents to a pernicious juvenile literature . Granted that the Sunday school library may be far from being the ideal . Granted that there may be in it books that are sadly deficient in literary power , or that fall below the highest religious standard . Granted that many a book may be weak-there is still too great a proportion of skim-milk to the cream in our Sunday school libraries . Still the library as a whole is pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dime novel , it is something surely , that an hundred thousand such libraries , more or less , are scattered all over the land , and are in the hands of the children who are exposed to the evil influences of these concoctions from the devil 's laboratory . These libraries are lending their aid to overcome evil-an enormous and rampant but too little comprehended evil-with good . " Much trash in these libraries , " is it said ? Be it so . Trash is better than poison any time and every time . The trash of the Sunday school book is better than the trash of the juvenile weekly ; there is at least more morality in it . If there is much chaff there is at least some wheat , and what there is , is nutritious . There is no food in the devil 's literature . Fuel there is , to inflame and destroy . Food there is not ; so , even at the lowest estimate , the Sunday school literature is better than very much of periodical juvenile literature . It serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . That would be a sad day for our children which should see the Sunday school library given up , and those who had been supplied from it left to find all their mental food , as would be the case with most of them , from the news stands . By no means all of our children are reached by the Sunday school library , to be sure . But a very great many of them are . For all such // the argument for the continuance of the Sunday school library is convincing . There is equal argument for the improvement of the library  --  a point to which further reference will be made . The existence of the library in the Sunday school is , as it would seem , amply justified . Indeed the library has now become so much a part and parcel of the Sunday school that , except in possible isolated cases , it can not be abandoned . It has grown up with the Sabbath school system . The demand has created the supply , and the supply has reacted to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school literature has grown are something enormous . There is no reason to expect that this literature will not continue to increase . There are publishing societies and private houses that give themselves largely , if not wholly , to the issuing of this class of books . There are two regular crops every year and a good many special products between times , and there is no prospect of any limit to the production . The prospect is , on the contrary , that there will be a continual increase . It goes without saying that the quality should be improved at least as fast as the quantity is enlarged . But the point to be observed here is that we have this great and constantly growing mass of Sunday school literature . We may seek to improve its character , but we can not do away with it even if we wanted to do so . But ought we to want to do away with it ? Should we not rather , seek to make it more and more serviceable for the inculcation of truth , and so for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that the Sunday school library will exist , let us ask-what shall be its character ? This is here the all-important question ; for manifestly upon its character it depends whether it will be a bane , or at least a very mixed good , or a blessing . The question of the character of the library is to be determined in the light of the larger question of the object of the Sunday school itself . That object is the building up of Christian character in those who come under its influence . Its main instrument in this work is the inculcation of scripture truth . Wisely do some of the foremost of those interested in Sunday school work among us think it would be far better could we change the name of this institution to " Bible School . " It is // really a place for the study of the Bible , with the prime view to its results in character . Every thing that interferes with this should have no place in the true Sabbath school . Even an only tolerably rigid application of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery and all of our Sunday school gimeracks . But a study of the Bible in the school is not an end in itself . The Sabbath school is not a professional school . The Bible is studied , not that its antiquities and geography and history , or even its theology may be mastered . It is simply a means to the higher end of the formation of a Christian character . The true Sabbath school teacher devoutly echoes the words of his Lord , and prays for his pupils , " Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth ? ' The Sabbath school is a supplementary institution . It should never for a moment be allowed to take the place of the home or the Christian Church . This remark , of course , is not fully applicable to distinctively mission schools . But it is a vital thought as concerns the average Sunday school , and it has its application to the question before us . The object of the Sunday school then is , with the divine blessing upon its work , to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this end is divine truth . To teach the Bible , not in the letter that killeth , but in the spirit which giveth life , should be the great aim of every Sunday school instructor . But while this is the great instrument it is not the only instrument . Among the adjuncts to this instruction in divine truth , with its aim to produce a Christian character , not the least efficient is the Sabbath school library . The teacher has the scholar under his instruction in fact only about a half hour in the week . The scholar takes home a book from the library that may serve to occupy all his leisure hours till the next Sabbath . It is of the first importance that the silent teacher shall not contradict nor counteract the utterances of the living teacher . What then shall be the character of the library that shall serve as a useful adjunct to the instruction of the Sunday school session ? In answering this question , two views may be taken-a a narrower and a broader one . They shade off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the boundary lines , while not rigid , are practically marked with sufficient clearness . According to the narrower view only books of a distinctively and professedly religious character should be admitted into the Sunday school library . The children , it is claimed , will read all they can in their books on the Sabbath , and hence secular reading must , as far as possible , be put out of their way . Besides , it is asked , is it not a contradiction in terms to introduce secular books into a Sabbath school library ? Must not those only which are , at least , technically religious be invariably associated with the Sabbath school ? The opposite extreme to this is that broadest view which would make the Sunday school library little else than a smaller counterpart of the common circulating library . It would not run quite so much to novels , perhaps , as the latter , but it would not vei-y materially differ from that , except in the fact that its books were on the whole niore juvenile . It would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would be read largely on week days . Between these there is a medium course . It would not confine the library to nominally religious books , but it would make its selections judiciously and with much care . The aim of the Sabbath school , as has been said , is to build up Christian character . It is not simply-certainly it ought not to be-to get the children converted . That of course . But that is only the beginning . Character should be based upon love to God , but from that as a root should grow all that is excellent and beautiful . The Christian parent , the Christian teacher , longs with the utmost intensity that the children should be Christians . But these parents and teachers want them also to grow into perfect ones in Christ Jesus . We all of us want the children of the coming generation to grow up , broad in their views of truth , comprehensive in their sympathies , strong in manliness and womanliness , their whole characters permeated with " sweetness and light . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they may not fear the opposition of false science ; so that the temptations to rest character upon anything but divine truth , as upon bed-rock , may not avail against them ; so that vagaries of religious emotions and currents // of feeling may not swerve them out of the true channel and strand them upon shoals or involve them in treacherous quicksands . Now a library wisely gathered from a wide range of suitable literature is a first-class help in this direction . It will not take the place of the instruction in the Word of God : it is not a substitute for the personal influence of the teacher . But books have a pervasive power all their own . Reading is a continually growing force among our children and young people , its influence already utterly past all computation . For the purpose just now indicated , of informing the mind , quickening the intelligence , broadening the sympathies , presenting high ideals , good books are invaluable . But when we say " good books " we do not need to mean distinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many books received without question on the shelves even of libraries constituted on the narrower method mentioned above , which are religious , in a technical sense , without being good . They are wishy-washy , or they are untrue to nature , or they are exaggerated , or they are one-sided . An exceedingly thin film of religious-teaching , we were about to say , twaddle would be the better word-serves to set afloat in the Sunday school an improbable or a silly story . And the book goes without question because , forsooth , it is a " religious book . " Parents who would shrink from permitting their children to read a book on natural science , for example , on Sunday , will never question the suitableness for reading on that day of one of these regulation Sunday school library books , though it may be like one we had occasion to read only the other day , a story of a lad who helps another out of prison , steals money out of a missionary box , nearly sells his soul for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any clear signs of true repentance after it all . Of course we do not mean to say that all of our Sunday school literature is of this character for silliness or worse . There will be something to be said on this point farther on . The point made here is that all so-called religious books are not necessarily good books for the purpose now in view-the helping in the rounding out and perfecting of noble , worthy , alluring Christian character . // 357 For example there is a series of books written by one who shall be nameless here , which are admitted without question into some Sunday school libraries on the ground that they are distinctively religious stories . We need not doubt for a moment the honesty of aim of the author . He asserts that he writes them with the distinct purpose of teaching , through this medium , religious truth . Bat they are in reality mere novels - from a literary point of view exceedingly poor ones at that . They are forced and unnatural in their characters , improbable in their situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be upon the Sunday school library shelves , and such a book say , as " Young Mrs. Jardine " be excluded because it makes no pretension to be anything but a novel ? The book2 of the one author are ostensibly-we had almost said ostentatiously-religious ; but the religion is patched on , and the story reader will know very well how to skip it . In Mrs. Craik 's books , however , the religious sentiment and spirit is woven into the very warp and woof of the story ; it is the atmosphere in which the characters move . The literary style of that wellknown author is pure and simple and good . The point to be observed here is that we should not be deceived by mere names . Whether a book is professedly religious or not , is really of no consequence . Whether it holds up a true and high ideal of character , is of immense consequence . Whether it is a professedly religious biography or not , is of little consequence . That it depicts a true man who feared God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way , level to the youth 's apprehension , some branch of science-astronomy , geology , physiology-of course from the Christian point of view , and in a Christain spirit , may be a better book by far than many a so-called religious story . The principle now being set forth , it remains to apply it . It will be found a sufficiently comprehensive principle to suit various circumstances . Circumstances , we must admit , do alter cases . The special wants of each school must form the main criterion of judgment . We have before us , for example , the catalogue of the library of a school with which we arc person . ally acquainted . It is a church school , that is to say the children who attend it come from the families that form the church . // This church would not be called wealthy as compared with some of the metropolitan churches ; but , it is a strong , active , well-to-do organization . The children in the school then , come from comfortable and intelligent homes ; many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library are all of a distinctively religious character . There is connected with the church a fairly good parish library , which takes a wider range than that of the Sunday school . There is , therefore , under the circumstances , no need that the latter should broaden its limits beyond the carefully chosen circle to which it is now restricted . A contrast to that catalogue is that of " The Pilgrim Chapel , " Brooklyn , connected with the church to which Dr. iR . S. Storrs ministers . In it are to be found , besides many of the general class just named , such books as " A Life for a Life , " Abbott 's histories , some of George Macdonald 's works , Edward Eggleston 's stories , Miss Alcott 's books , some even of the " Oliver Optic " series , and one or two of Charles Dickens ' novels . We may not coincide with each individual selection ; but it is pretty evident that a library constituted on this broader principle is practically more helpful with the class among whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on a more rigid basis . And this from the simple fact that it is more likely to be read than is the other . We know of a mission-school in New York whose library is constituted on a broad basis , many of th' volumes being suited to circulation among adults . It is really a small circulating library ; but in order that it may not interfere with the regular work of the Sabbath school , the books are distributed on a week-day evening . This library , as we are informed , is in great demand , and is doing a good work among its patrons . The fact is , that children , even among our mission-school population , will read ; but they will despise and reject a literature that has nothing but its religion to commend it . If they are not supplied with morally wholesome reading , which yet may not be distinctively religious , they will read the dime novels , or what our English friends have well dubbed the " penny awfuls . " It would be folly indeed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting a theoretically perfect library in circulation . The library is of no account as an end . The real object is , by // The Sun day School Li6rary. 359 its aid , to put into the minds of the children helpful truths , as concerns their relations to both God and their fellow-men . It is the application in this sphere of the principle of the great apostle , when he said he became all things to all men , that he might by all means save some . There should be then , we may rightly conclude , no procrustean rule applicable indifferently to all schools alike . Is the school in a city , or a town , or in a purely rural community ? That has something to do with determining the question , for it makes some difference as to the accessibility of books from other sources . Is there a parish or a town library available ? That is another element to enter into the consideration . Is the school one constituted from the families of a church , or does it partake more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the consideration in determining the exact character of the books that shall be put upon the library shelves . The application of the principle should be a matter of fact rather than of name . A book may be written for the Sunday school library , and yet be a very poor thing-as many of them are . It may be written with no thought of Sunday school circulation , and yet be the very thing for such a library . The tendency heretofore has been to be far too much governed by mere names . We have asked , " is it a Sunday school book ? " not , " is it a book fit for the Sunday school ? " When a volume has been put forward as a " Sunday-school book , " we have asked no further questions . Hence has arisen no small part of the evils which , as all agree , do attach themselves to a greater or less degree to our Sunday school library system . But there is , after all , a wide'range of selection . That there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in the chai-acter of what we call Sunday school literature , any one acquainted with the facts , will , we think , be ready to admit . How meagre the supply , how unsatisfactory , as we would now deem it , the character of the books forming such libraries as won the warm commendation of the Maine Sunday school Union , fifty years ago ! Child-nature is now far better understood than it was then , the methods of reaching and moving it , far better comprehended . Not only has it come to be considered worth while to work for both the pleasure and the profit // of children , but the idea has almost been pushed to the extreme of thinking that the children are about the only ones worth working for . A single illustration of this is the fact that the recurring holiday times see ten books issued for children where there is one for adults . In their mechanical execution , as well as in their contents , children 's books have vastly improved . There are unquestionably many poor books issued still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to push out that which will sell , without being over particular as to its quality . There are many goodish books-almost as much an abomination as are irreligious books , for their practical tendency is not a little in the same direction . There are , beyond doubt , too many books such as they are , while there is room for an indefinite number more of books of a really first-rate character . And yet , after all , there are a great many excellent and helpful books among those of a distinctively Sunday school character . And if the principle maintained in this paper is true , there is a circle of books outside of this-tales , history , biography , travel , natural science-which may be judiciously drawn from for the purpose in hand . But while we are ready to admit that there has been an advance on the whole in the character of the books written for our Sunday schools , certainly in literary style and in wholesomeness of the views of life presented , there is , nevertheless , still much room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison with other kinds of literature . Nine-tenths , or more ; of the contents of our Sunday school libraries are " story books . " Not a few of them are simple novelettes ; lacking the literary power and intellectual stimulus of a first class novel , introducing enough religion to make them pass a library committee , but read by the children for the sake of the story . It is certainly bad for a child 's intellectual development to absorb these tales week after week . There are in them , in spite of the fact that they are written for Sunday schools , some of the elements we condemn in what we rightly style " pernicious literature . " There are some of the same false views of life , some of the same experiences of success obtained by luck rather than by hard struggle . rfhere is an unnaturalness often in the characters and the situations ; // 361 and there is error , by defect or excess , in even the religious teaching , which is the sole reason for being of this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless one of the gravest objections that can be urged against the Sunday school library system . That a child may read-unquestioned , because they are " library books " - from twenty-five to fifty such books each year , and keep up the practice for years together , is no small evil . It is the great evil of the whole system , and it is to be deeply deprecated . But the remedy is patent . Improve the character of the library . We need not do away with all the story books , even with all the religious novelettes . Such a book , for instance , as the late Mrs. Prentiss ' " Stepping Heavenward , " is in every way wholesome and helpful as well as attractive . There is abundant room for more such works . But there is also need for a different class still . Good biographies are excellent , and command readers . We need more than we have of the lives of eminent men and women , in comparatively small volumes , in readable style , adapted to children , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnecessary and futile . It is no wonder that they resent it . We need compact but graphic histories of the great epochs of the church . If rightly done such books will enchain the children 's attention . There is a field from which large harvests of interesting matei-ial may be gleaned in the annals of missionary work and in the lives of missionaries . What the Almighty has done in nature-in earth and sky and sea-might be unfolded so that the child can understand . Such books he might i-ead , even on the Sabbath , with more intellectual and probably more moral advantage than the story of some little boy who was too puny to be naughty , who loved to sing hymns better than to play marbles , who in his precocious piety died at a tender age , and was followed to his grave by a weeping Sunday school . Livingston 's and Stanley 's travels are too bulky , except for the oldest scholars . But skillful condensations of such works would make excellent reading for Sunday school scholars , and there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come from getting rid of the idea that a Sunday school library book must necessarily be a // religious story . Why should we walk in so narrow a circle when just outside of it are such rich fields ? It is no more essentially sacred inside the arbitrary fence we have reared than outside . What we need is to secure for the young readers nutritious moral food . Such food-some of the best of it indeed-cannot be all gathered within the palings of what is te6hnically known as Sunday school literature . A grave responsibility rests upon the publishers of the Sun . day school books . Some of them are entirely trustworthy . You can take up their catalogues with the assurance that nothing hurtful is embraced there . But you can not be so sure that some , even of their books , are not simply goodish . This is one of the points that demands the attention of those who have the making of children 's books . Better be weak than wicked , undoubtedly . But it is a sin to be weak when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers they will be written , bu , t the publishers can crush out the weak writers if they will . The number of women is legion who want to live by what they deem the lady-like employment of writing wishy-washy stories with a mild-very mild-religious flavor , when they ought to be nursing the sick , or attending a counter , or cooking in a kitchen . And there are some m*n who had better throw down the pen for the plough or the plane . If the publishers would set their faces as a flint against all merely goodish books , the nuisance would soon be abated . They should , too , limit the " output " of mere stories . There is certainly no objection , so far as the theory is concerned , to the endeavor to teach truth through the story form . The danger is that in practice the story will crowd out other forms of literature . No one of us will object to our children reading some good stories , whether religious or merely secular . But we do not want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishers is to crowd the shelves of the Sunday school libraries with story books to the exclusion of other things . At this point there is need of reformation . But the publishers are bound by the laws of trade . They are not to be expected to make books for fun , or for pure benevolence . Even the Sunday School Union and the Tract Society must make their books pay . They all must make // 363 books that will sell . So we can not , at least in the first instance , ask too much from the publishers . The responsibility for the character of the library largely rests then upon the Sunday School authorities . The selection of a library is a work of grave trust . Too often those having the matter in charge take no pains whatsoever about it . Sometimes the whole selection is left to the publisher , who , however honestand many of them are entirely so-cannot know the special needs of the school . Even this slipshod way may not intro. duce any positively deleterious book into the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be a power working harmoniously with the other machinery of the school toward the production of symmetrical and strong religious character . A more excellent way is one adopted in a school of which we happened to have some knowledge . Here no book is admitted which is not unanimously approved by two or three judicious readers from among the congregation . The distinctively religious test is applied in this library , as it is taken for granted that the children , coming from prosperous and Christian homes , will have access to other reading matter elsewhere , while a parish library is accessible to the older scholars and teachers and the congregation generally . The librarian of another prosperous school has kindly furnished us specimen copies of reports to the library committee of his school on the character of books examined . These reports give particulars and analyses of the books in question , and suggest their classification and the like . Kept on file , they become a directory to the whole library , a charac. terization of all the books , of great value to the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading . It is for the authorities of each school to determine whether they shall make a broader or a narrower application of the principle advanced in this paper . Within any limits they may set there is still range enough as to the choice of individual books . It is a high demand that is put upon the discernment , the taste , the knowledge , the piety of the Sunday school librarian and his associates . But they can have the satisfaction of knowing that a thoroughly good library is an immense // power for helping the children forward in the development of worthy character . There is a further responsibility that rests upon parents in this mattel ' . They should not take it for granted that the Sunday school library book is necessarily the book that is good for their children . They certainly should not permit their children 's minds and hearts to be under the unintermitting wash of stories , even though such are called religious , are bound in showy covers , are adorned ( ? ) with execrable illustrations , are heavily leaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class Sunday-school literature . It is the parents ' province to determine whether any book shall be read upon the Lord 's Day , or remanded to week-day time . Only if a parent forbids the Sunday reading of the library book he ought to provide something to take its place . It does not seem to us that , for example , " Tom Brown at Rugby** is precisely the book for Sabbath reading , healthful and helpful book as it is . But there is many a so-called religions story on our Sunday-school library shelves that is positively injurious compared with " Tom Brown . " Certainly any boy will be better for being put , even on the Sabbath , in the companionship of " Tom " and under the teachings of Dr. Arnold , than left to his own idle thoughts , or to his plannings for to-morrow s sport . We must overcome evil with good ; and if it be evila matter for each parent to determine for his own family-to read certain books on the Sabbath , he must give his children other suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be added to the librarian 's vigilance . However good a library may be as a whole , it is left for the parent to determine whether each individual book is such as his child ought to read . Because it comes out of the library he must not take it for granted that it is suited to be of service to his child , any more than the librarian must take it for granted that because it bears the imprimatur of a religious publishing house it is of necessity a good book-good for helping the development of character . But when all concerAed-writers , publishers , librarians , teachers , parents-fee and exercise their responsibility , we shall have in the Sunday school library a far greater power for // good than is now the case . The current is setting in the right direction . But in this matter , as in every other of a similar character , the price of growing excellence is ceaseless vigilance . The object is worth the effort . To have our children and their children grow up strong , vertebrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does not lie in the power of the Sunday school library alone to make them all this . But the right kind of a Sunday school library is an immense help in this direction .
