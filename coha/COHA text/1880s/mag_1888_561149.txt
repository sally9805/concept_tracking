THIS exegesis involves the examination of parties and candidates , of recorded facts and prevailing tendencies . Keeping the past in view it interrogates the future . It invites the application of conscience and of common sense to reach a conclusion upon which depends an act-an act which no voter has a right either to leave unperformed or to perform carelessly , but which thousands will not perform at all and to which thousands more will give no more thought than is necessary to direct their steps toward the voting booths on election day . The sixth of November is near at hand , but it can not be said at any moment before the polLs close that it is too late to discuss the obligations of the suffrage . It is hard for ardent partisans to acknowledge the significant and more or less disquieting fact that , to a multitude of their fellow countrymen , curiosity about the result is the strongest emotion connected with the electoral contest . The newspapers which have gone late to press daily for four or five months in the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished speakers who have // gone late to bed in the same cause , are not flattered by the conviction that their arguments and appeals , their allurements and denunciations , have made absolutely no impression upon hundreds of their readers and hearers beyond a gentle and pleasurable excitement ; but they know the fact . To use the homely phrase , thousands are waiting in the mildly stimulating hope of seeing which way the cat is about to jump . It has been said that the purpose of a public journal should be to follow popular opinion so closely as to seem to lead it . There are journals in the United States , possibly in New York city , which are always a trifle too slow in their pursuit of this purpose , and whose columns now from day to day bear witness to the existence of a large unattached and waiting vote . Moreover , the party that wins an election before election day is in some danger . There can be no doubt that Mr. Blame was elected-barring the formality of casting the votes-four years ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it was subsequently lost is conclusive proof that it is never too late to avoid accidents , and therefore never too late to make converts . The capacity of a suddenly engendered current of distrust , doubt or aversion to spread itself instantaneously and universally , is a strange phenomenon . It conquers time and space like electricity , and resembles the magical intercommunication of the Orient . The Democracy have been accustomed since the war to express a bland surprise that voters should care to peer into the dim and dusty records of the past before deciding how to act in the living present . They deprecate such a waste of time and confusion of criterions . We have nothing to do , they say , with yesterday ; our business is with to-day and to-morrow . A majority of the people have seldom agreed with them on this point . In reality , the record of a party has a vital connection wth practical politics , for it indicates the tendencies which are struggling for supremacy and the preferences which will surely find expression if success is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquish their past by any swift process of reversion . A doubtful hypothesis assumes that the physical organism is renewed every seven years , but neither the structure nor the spirit ever loses its identity . As with individuals , so with the political organizations which they compose . // The Republican party is content to stand by its record . It is not necessary for every speaker and writer to recapit ulate this record on all occasions , but it is none the less an inherent part of his argument . The fervid phrase of Webster applies as perfectly to the Republican party as it ever did to the State of Massachusetts : " The world knows its history by heart , the past at least is secure . " And its aspirations are worthy of its record . It has never shown a symptom of structural or spiritual decay . The splendid vigor with which it responded to the tremendous demands of an earlier period is not dead nor dying . In these piping times of peace a summons to ineffaceable glory is not an everyday occurrence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new duties are as sure a test of vitality and of consistency as men or angels need exact . The overshadowing moral issue of to-dayemploying the word moral in a narrower sense than it ought to carry , except for the purposes of argument-is the temperance question . No man of sane intelligence , would think of denying that the abuse of alcohol is competent to destroy civilization . There is no sense in blinking the truth . Unhindered , that is its potentiality , and there is no better measure by which to determine the Republican party 's right to control the country than its practical recognition of this fact . As fast as it was possible to embody convictions in legislation the Republican party has demonstrated its determination to throttle the destroyer . Its opponents would have been rejoiced to see it wasting its time and energy in useless rhodomontade and fanciful experiments . They have not experienced that satisfaction . But New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , Illinois and Minnesota , not to complete the list of examples , are fixed and visible milestones on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly and wisely and courageously entered . If the Republican past is secure , the Democratic past is not less so ; but in the latter case the security is one that is negotiable neither in Heaven nor on earth . Democrats are forever betraying a frantic anxiety to escape from their record , and yet , so curiously constructed are some minds , they have never seemed to regret the exposure of the mournful truth , that they have learned not a single lesson from adversity and disgrace . After twenty-four years of fasting , and of what passed for prayer with the // Mugwumps of 1884 , they came into the promised land . The one transcendant marvel of the political situation to-day is that there should be a doubt of their remaining in possession . The mere fact that there is more than a possibility  --  the betting men say an even chance and other discriminating judges a hopeful prospect-of their being cast out after only three and a half years of squatter sovereignty , is in itself a stupendous arraignment of Democracy and a sound plea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this election  --  a monfl issue too , to make a wider application of the term than I gave it a moment ago . The American protective tariff is a national institution . It was born almost at the same birth with the funda - mental law , and yet modern Democracy pretends that it is an upstart , and defaced by a bar-sinister at that . This is at least the pretence when such a pretence is thought prudent . But what a farce the Democrats are willing and even apparently happy to play in the eyes of the world ! Fearful , spasmodic , contradictory ; forever denying at home their records in Congress and in Congress their records at home ; forever willing to sell a soul to make a vote ; forever swallowing their own words when it is more convenient to conceal than to exploit them-like Senator Vest , with his " confidential " avowal of a " fight to death , " and a " war of extermination against our protected industries , " addressed of course with shrinking modesty and in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with his patronymic  --  the Democrats now stand on the threshold of defeat , naked , but not ashamed . In comparison with this dark and gloomy exhibition of every detestable quality which the exigencies of party warfare are capable of evoking , the Republican rec*ird on this question is more than lucid-it is luminous . A fundamental principle of the party which defends the American system , is that the tariff must be adjusted to varying conditions . Since the campaign entered on its last month , a suspicion has gone abroad which , under the circumstances , possesses every element to convulse an Augur . Having nursed that darling surplus with the tenderest solicitude for more than three years . having fattened it for slaughter as a cannibal does his victim , having first laughed a Democratic Secretary out of the Democratic House for doubting that he was authorized to buy bonds with it , and then glorified him for loaning it free gratis to // the banks instead , the party in power is now apparently on the verge of discovering that its own wanton and mischievous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surplus . Alas , for " the condition that confronts us ! " There doubtless is at present a surplus income beyond all reasonable expenditures , and this fact has served a most useful public purpose in enabling the Republican Senate to show that the Protective system does not imply excessive taxation . The Senate tariff bill is a thorough , discriminating and comprehensive defense of American industries , and it cuts off seventy-five millions of revenue ! The legislation of the last twenty years does not afford a more striking illustration of the inherent Republican capacity for constructive statesmanship . I do not intend to enter here upon an elaboration of economic principles , nor make a formal plea for the system under which this country has arrived at the industrial eminence it triumphantly holds . The superb fact is apparent to every one who has eyes , and the inference to every one who , having eyes , has brains behind them . The argument is like the supreme argument from design , from the creature to the creator . But there is another argument allied to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . It is contained in the character of the vote upon which the Democratic party cheerfully relies now and at every election , from Alderman to President . Without the help of that element in society which it is the chief aim of society to eradicate ; the element that , casts a ballot it can not read ; the element that clings to vice from the love of it , and that finds its sharpest contrast in the selfrespecting poor ; the element that menaces public order and civilization the year through , and never so fearfully as when it goes to the polls ; the element from which prisons , and drunkards ' graves , and hell itself are forever recruited without competition-without this element of support the Democratic party would be nothing more than a reminiscence . In crises which are not political , honest men like to be found on the side of the prudent , sagacious , instructed , clean-handed majority . Why , in the name of a decent consistency , should such men make an exception when they are about to delegate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Whatever the Democratic party may be , the Republican party is not an organized appetite , nor an organized prejudice . It is rather an organized preference for // what is fundamentably sound and honest . It welcomes criticism and stimulation within its ranks , and thinks that it has no better guarantee of stability than the fact that men like Dr. Storrs can find no other foothold from which to operate against some details of the superstructure . It is not dismayed , moreover , when other men , not at all like Dr. Storrs , but nameless here , seek to obscure the issue and complicate the result by enrolling their dupes under a third party banner , and in defiance of such an earnest , fearless , whole-souled , upright and downright crusade for temperance as Warner Miller is making in this State , push Republican principles outside the field of their practical application , and combine with Satan to enlarge his dominions . There is one more consideration which properly comes under the head of party comparisons and contrasts , and to which allusion ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . It was stated eight years ago by a great man in words which when taken as a text will never need additions or subtractions . " There is not a precinct in this vast nation , " wrote General Grant in 1880 , with that extraordinary force and compactness to which he gave occasional expression , and which was , perhaps , the offspring of his habitual silence , " There is not a precinct in this vast nation where a Democrat can not cast his ballot and have it countedas cast , no matter what the predorninance of the opposite party . He can proclaim his political opinions , even if he is one among thousands , without fear and without proscription on account of his opinions . There are fourteen States , and localities in some others , where Republicans have not this privilege . This is one reason why I am a Republican . " There are men blind enough , or far-seeing enough -J am not averse to letting the reader make his own choice between these conditions  --  to proclaim that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose his text without interference , even in frontier communities ; it is only when his application becomes too careless that the six-shooters begin to get in their work . I am in no wise a preacher , but I claim benefit of clergy , so far as my text is concerned , and will leave the application to apply itself ; venturing only to remark that the text is of tremendous import , and that a sermon will have to be preached from it-if not in this campaign , then in some other . Early in the campaign the Democrats informed the country , // with great frequency and contentment , that this was to be a campaign of intellect ; but when they made the inevitable discovery that they had gone into the fight with not more than a dozen rounds of this new-fangled ammunition , they fell cheerfully to work reloading the old cartridges from their never-failing supply of ignorance and vituperation . For the most part they have confined their fire to the Republican cause and the Republican ranks , but they have taken just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faithful comparison . Moreover , it is never unprofitable , when the old antagonists are matched , to contrast their leaders . Four years ago those sanguine prophets , who would be without an occupation if a good-natured public squelched their divinations , may have felt themselves justified in announcing that they had discovered in Mr. Cleveland an administrative genius We all know that occasionally a phenomenon , youthful or otherwise , does emerge out of obscurity and take mankind captive . The odds are ten thousand to one that the apparition will turn out to be disgustingly human , but the first inclination is to give him a chance . The American people were singularly hospitable and magnanimous four years ago , for the mortal f railties of Mr. Cleveland had been pretty well established in the estimation of all but the prophets by his repeated failures to materialize in the form in which he was desired to appear by good citizens . But now it is simply amazing that the dupes will consent to be duped again . The men who guaranteed Mr. Cleveland to be a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model spoilsman . There was never such a record of hypocritical juggling with the principles that ought to control appointments , such a stolid , unblushing , unflinching distribution of patronage where it would produce the greatest public loss and the greatest personal gain , as the record drawn from Democratic archives and up to this moment uncontradicted by the officious sponsors of this administration . In private life , the man who has broken faith deliberately and without excuse is contemptuously discarded by the friends whom he has betrayed . Other alleged virtues have nothing to do with the case . A decent self-respect makes further intercourse impossible . But the placid individuals whom the President has made most conspicuously ridiculous ( with a few exceptions , which stand out like lighthouses ) , are all begging to be spat upon again . The political world has strange denizens ! // Furthermore , these singular performers on the Democratic trapeze assured the universe that their phenomenon without opinions or experience or instruction , the man who had never recorded a conviction on a single one of the overwhelming issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be possessed of sufficient courage , firmness , penetration and zeal to overcome single-handed that " conspiracy against human rights , " that " conspiracy for plunder and spoils* " which answers to the name of the Democratic party ; and that he would accomplish it with such a felicitous combination of grace and dexterity that the rascals would all perceive at a glance that they were blighted , and the saints that their dearest hopes were destined to fructify . Three years and a half of opportunity have gone by , and what is the result ? The knaves are all falling in love with the President for the friends he has made , and his respectable associates in power regard him with an aversion which embitters their existence , and which not all of them have been able to conceal even in public . The heroic fibre has proved to be a selfish and calculating disdain . The colossal intelligence has dwindled into a perverse and obstinate vanity . The genius for administration is seen in its real proportions in corrupt and disorganized departments of government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a splenetic and resentful reversal of policy on a question involving the national honor and interest , between two dawns . Both candidates have taken part in the campaign . The President 's participation in the effort to inflict upon the country " the most serious danger " of a second term comprises a number of stump speeches in the guise of messages to Congress ; an undignified and even ludicuons somersault on the Fisheries dispute by way of beguiling the Irish vote ; an authoritative encouragement of pernicious activity on the part of his partisan appointees by the detail of his official family for campaign oratory , intrigue and wire-pulling ; and a summons to all office hold'ers to stand and deliver , in the form of a contribution of *1O , OOO to the Democratic campaign fund in violation of the law . G*eneral Harrison 's work in the canvass has been done with quiet and impressive dignity at his own home . Day after day for nearly five months he has received with simple cordiality the // greetings of his fellow citizens from all parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exercise of an unobtrusive hospitality , but his visitors have demanded to hear him speak . And so without fear or restraint he has expounded the issues of the compaign in a series of speeches which for clearness of thought and force and felicity of phrase have never been surpassed in the annals of American elections . General Harrison enjoys the distinction of not having two sets of opinions - one for private use and the other for public dissemination . He has spoken without guidance or special preparation , and , so far from committing the slightest blunder , he has not said a word which even malice could distort into an indiscretion. lie has not touched a topic without illuminating it . Through every sentence has shone the light of a clear conscience , a keen intelligence and a firm conviction that honor and truth are the only authentic test and guarantee of progress . A long succession of such spontaneous and unchecked utterances , invariably making converts and never losing a single vote , would be nothing less than miraculous in the case of many candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple . The speeches express the man . I have not thought it necessary , in formulating some of the considerations which make me eager to deposit a Republican ballot on November 6th , to offer a categorical arraignment of the opposition or a categorical justification of my own party . I have framed a frank confession of faith , and others may add new articles to suit themselves . I hope , however , that loyal Republicans will find in the pages thus unconventially filled an intelligible statement of the permanent influences that have determined their political choice , and that occupy the most conspicuous place in their thoughts as the campaign draws to a close . For it is certain that no new principles of action will be discovered before the election , and those which now , after a laborious and instructive contest , are uppermost in their minds , are those which ought to be carried to the polls with personal confidence and satisfaction , and which ought still to be effective in winning recruits for the party which has rendered great services to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union in the war , and afterwards its financial honor ; which stands for a free vote , honestly counted ; which will surely // defend the national prosperity whose foundations it laid ; which is American to the core ; which represents the intelligence and progress of the people , and which embodies the spirit of genuine reform . A REPUBLICAN . II . THE DEMOCRATIC ANSWER . IT may not be improbable that the vote of the State of New York may be determined by the ballots of those upon whom party ties sit comparatively lightly , and who , in casting their ballots , vote as much for the man who is a candidate for the august office of President as for the policies which he represents . There are so many duties which the President must perform , which are not political in the sense of being partisan , and yet which are vital to the prosperity of the country , that many good and patriotic voters are led to cast their ballot for the man who , they believe , will best perform these duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prefer . To all this class of voters an appeal can confidently be made for the re-election of Mr. Cleveland . He has demonstrated his uncommon capacity for the performance of the ordinary and daily duties imposed upon the executive . It is not too much to say that no President has surpassed him in devotion , in industry , and inflexible courage . The daily routine of the administration of public affairs has never been more diligently , more honestly , or more courageously performed than under his administration . In every department of government the rule of clear common sense and unwavering fidelity to the letter of the law have dominated in the administration of public affairs . No jobberies , no private advantages , no prostitution of public office to partisan purposes , no peculations have been permitted during the past three years and a half . Simpler , less expensive , and more faithful methods have been introduced in all the branches of the public service , as far as it was possible with a hostile Senate and with so many not only incompetent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues of the government have not only been honestly but more inexpensively collected than ever before . The public expenditures have been more carefully watched , and wherever they could be reduced by a stricter economy consistent with a proper regard to the necessities of the public service , there has been this reduction . That this has not been the result of the pe // culiar talent or watchfulness of a single cabinet officer is demonstrated by the fact that it has occurred in every department of the public service and in almost all of the bureaus subordinate to the respective departments . This same fidelity to duty and this same regular , constant and daily devotion has been as eminent in the conduct of our foreign affairs as in the administration of our internal affairs . Had it not been for the partisan opposition of the Senate , we would have seen a fair , honorable and reasonable adjustment of all the controversies growing out of our relations to Canada , which for so many years have annoyed and vexed us , and but for the same spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaterial amendments , we would have had settled by negotiation , instead of by legislation , the troublesome questions arising out of Chinese immigration . There has been no attempt at sensationalism in our foreign relations . Under the supervision of the President , and the direct control of the distinguished Secretary of State , all our negotiations have been frank , simple and sincere . This is the precise attitude which becomes a great , powerful , and free country , anxious to preserve proper relations with all the world , and to prevent , by honorable adjustment , the continuance of unnecessary and vexatious controversies . Not only has this same domination of good sense and of fidelity to the public service been demonstrated in the ordinary routine of departmental work , and of the conduct of our foreign affairs , but also in the probably more important department of the management of our fiscal affairs . The Treasury of the United States is no longer the mere fiscal department of the government for the collection and expenditure of the public revenues , but the vast expenditures required by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large public debt have made this great department so related to all the financial operations of the country that it can produce at any time financial embarrassment , and it may by mere negation cause fatal stringency in the money market . During the administration of Secretaries Manning and Fairchild this department has been so managed as to make commerce stable , to prevent any panic , and to relieve from alarm when there was real cause for anticipating stringency in the money market , so that all the business interests of the country have been absolutely safe under this management . // It is impossible to estimate the value of such an administration to such a country as ours . With interests so diversified , and with our systems as developed in the last twenty-five years , it is hardly too much to say that such an administration is of incalculable advantage to the healthy growth and the natural development of all the industries of the country . An honest , courageous , sensible and wise administration of public affairs in all the departments of the public service is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are . This , Mr. Cleveland has given to the country ; this , his re-election will insure for four more years . It is to the interest of all the country , in possibly equal proportions , that there shall be no sectional question . The country needs a cessation of sectionalism . Not merely that the animosities which the late war produced shall end , and the bitternesses of past memories be set aside , but that sectional questions shall be removed from politics . As every section of the country prospers , as every State in the union is contented , so the whole country prospers and the aggregate wealth increases . We ought , if it is possible , to so manage our public affairs as to have no " Southern question , and as to eliminate from the dissensions of parties all race questions . This has almost been accomplished by Mr. Cleveland . His re-election and continuance in power for four years will put an end , during this generation , to all sectional questions , and will render the solution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser solution because it will be undertaken without party passion , and it will be removed from the domain of sectional hate . The mere money value of such a result is inestimable . The manufacturing sections of the North are as much interested in the peace , content and development of the Southern States as the Southern States themselves can be . Each desires a market for its respective products ; and the more contented each is , and the more intimate the relations of both are , not only will the product be larger , but the means of purchase will be increased . All nobler and more patriotic motives concur with this pecuniary interest in urging upon the country such a policy as will render the solidity of the South no longer necessary , and will obliterate sectional lines . This is possible only by the re-election of Mr. Cleveland . The resolution of the Hon. Mr. Chandler in the Senate , to investigate // the election of the Louisiana Senators ; the resolution of the Hon. Mr. Spooner to investigate certain alleged violations of law in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished Republican Senators upon these resolutions , and the clause in the Republican platform " That the present administration and the Democratic majority in Congress owe their existence to the suppression of the ballot by criminal nullification of the Constitution and laws of the United States , " are understood by the South to mean that the Republican party threatens unconstitutional and unfriendly interference by the Federal Government , to reverse the decisions given by her people at the polls , to set aside the solemn elections made by her legislatures of the Senators they desire to represent them in the Senate , and , if necessary , such other hostile measures as may seem to a non-resident majority requisite to give to the Republican party national supremacy and to maintain that party in a supremacy thus obtained . It is no answer to this alarm of the South that these resolutions , speeches and platforms are not meant ; that they are purely electioneering thunder to arouse sectional animosity in the North and bring out a fuller vote , and that when the election is over , they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightly parades are ; for those who are willing to play a game so false and so cruel , for the sake of political power , are capable of carrying that game to the extremity which their ambition , their avarice and their unscrupulousness may find necessary . The bill reported by the Republican Committee of Finance to the Senate , as a substitute for the Mills bill , demonstrates that whatever may have been the objects or purposes of the Republican party heretofore , it is now intent upon the preservation of such system of taxation as shall secure prohibitory rates to such interests as combine to perpetuate its power , and that it will use the taxing power of the government , not only to reward its friends , but to punish its enemies . In the Forty-ninth Congress , a distinct proposition was made by leading Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee of the House , to the State of Lonisana , that Louisiana should not be troubled by questions connected With the duty on sugar , if the Representatives from Louisiana would unite with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Means Committee a Protection Committee instead of a Democratic Committee . In the Fiftieth Congress , the Republican // Members of the Ways and Means Committee of the House voted in committee to strike out from the Mills bill the sugar schedule , the result of which would have been , if it had carried , to restore the full duty on sugar and to prevent the reduction of the rates on sugar . When the Louisiana delegation solidly adhered , in the Democratic caucus , to the Mills bill , then the crusade on the sugar duty began , and it was discovered that the reduction of the sugar duty by fifty per cent . might be used as the means not only of saving the enormously high duties on other articles , but of actually increasing those duties . And so the Senate bill rewards its friends by the increase of numerous rates , and punishes its enemies by the reduction of the sugar duty . There are fourteen schedules in our present tariff law . Of these , the rates are increased in eleven ; and these increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of moderate means must purchase . * For the first time in the history of American legislation , this bill proposes to reduce the revenues of the government by increasing the duties upon imported articles . That is , that the public revenues may be reduced by the increase of the private revenues obtained by legislation . I do not desire to discuss this bill in this article , for I have neither the space , nor is it within the scope of what I have been asked to do ; but I desire to suggest that such a policy means continual agitation of the rates * The rates are really increased on twelve schedules-they are apparently reduced on the schedules " chemicals , " " sugar , " and " earthenware and glassware ; " but the provisions taxing cartons , boxes , etc. , and repealing allowances for damages increase the protection offered to china , earthenware and glassware considerably more than the slight reduction in rates diminishes it . And the proposed change in the rates on sugar and molasses increases the margin of profits for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-six degrees saccharine strength on the free list , the importation of raw sugars may cease and the refiner then would have the whole duty on refined sugars as a margin ; the revenues from imported sugar would be transferred from the Treasury to the refiner .

The electoral commission declared that the certificates of the States of Louisiana , South carolina and Florida to the Hayes electors should be counted ; and thus Mr. Hayes was counted in by one vote ;  --  the Senate bill seems to have a spit ' * at these three States ; - it strikes at Louisiana sugar , Carolina rice , and Florida frults and sponges .

Expede Hercukm. // of taxation , and that this agitation is in the highest degree detrimental to the business interests of the country . There can be no stability nor peace to our industrial interests under a prohibitory tariff . In 1846 the Walker tariff was enacted . After an experiment of eleven years , in 1857 the tariff was amended , and party lines were practically forgotten in the Senate and House in the discussion and votes upon the amended tariff bill ; so much so , that an eminent Senator said that he did not believe that a single vote would be cast in the Senate on that bill from political reasons . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher tariffs which we have had for a quarter of a century , there was and has been continual agitation , and this must occur in the very nature of the case . A tariff must be arranged to suit the condition of industrial affairs at the time of its adoption . A high tariff can have no flexibility ; it has no extra-territorial power ; it ignores all possible inventions and improvements which lessen the cost of production ; it takes no account of the inevitable changes which are produced by new inveutions , by new conditions , by new and powerful combinations , and in addition , no class privileges cau be made stable by legislation . The election of Mr. Harrison , and the postponement of tariff revision , mean continual and fiercer agitation . The only hope of industrial stability in America is the re-election of Mr. Cleveland and of a Congress who will revise the tariff in the spirit of the message and letter of Mr. Cleveland , who will frame a system of taxation so as to put as few obstructions in the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the public expenditures will permit ; which will render possible the gradual reduction of the public revenue , and yet the increase of domestic manufactures by the removal of duties from the crude material which the American workman must use , and the consequent increase of wages . The pledge in the Republican platform of liberal appropriations , coupled with the promise contained in the same platform that the protective system shall be retained , and the demonstration of what is meant by that section of the platform by the Senate substitute , must require of that party , if it be successful , enormously increased public expenditures , and necessarily increased taxation . It has pledged itself that it will grant liberal appropriations for pensions , for the early rebuilding of a navy , for the construction of coast fQrtjfi*tio*1s *pxI rnodern ordnance and Qthe* // improved modern means of defense , for the improvement of harbors , rivers and channels , for subsidies to shipping interests , and for free schools . These six distinct classes are capable of almost innumerable subdivisions . We expend over eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure to over two hundred and fifty millions annually . With our immense coast line , coast fortifications could easily swallow up the larger part of our present income ; and as these fortifications would require ordnance to defend them , and soldiers to man them , the increased expenditure incidental to the erection of the fortifications would more than quadruple the present appropriation for the maintenance of the army and ordnance . And how much more than twenty-two millions a year for rivers and harbors may be considered " liberal appropriations , " would be left to the log rolling of the members of Congress in whose districts these rivers and harbors happen to be . The return to power of a party of whom Mr. Blame is the recognized and idolized leader , and whose leaders in the Senate have reported the late bill increasing taxation on eleven out of fourteen schedules , under a pledge of liberal appropriations to these objects , means an era of incalculable extravagance . As against this , the Democratic party offers the record made by Mr. Cleveland during the three and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House of Representatives to so reduce the income of the Government that there will be no surplus revenues to be . squandered . The common people of America above all things desire an honest , industrious and courageous administration , under which economy and competency characterize the collection and expenditure of the public revenues , and fidelity to duty , and thorough competency mark the administration of public affairs ; their interest is in the harmonious and cordial union of all sections under an administration which makes each section feel that it is fairly , justly and equitably regarded . They want their relations with foreign powers preserved upon just and honorable grounds , and they do not desire a return of an era when private interests controlled legislation and personal greed dominated the executive departments of the Government . It is because of the clear common sense of the American voters that the Democratic party believe the re-election of Mr. Cleveland is a certainty . Wm C. P. BR*CI*T*TRIDGE*                    @
