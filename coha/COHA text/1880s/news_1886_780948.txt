The federation has engaged St. Andrew 's Hall , the largest in Glasgow , for a mass meeting on June 28 , at which Mr. Gladstone will deliver an address and Lord Rosebery will preside . Mr. Parnell has requested the publication of the following : " I positively deny that I sought the interview with Earl Carnarvon . I also differ with the Earl as to two conditions upon which he alleges was based the interview , namely , that he was acting entirely on his own responsibility , and that he declined to hear or say one word to the detriment of the union . Earl Carnarvon did not lay down any conditions previously . I admit that there was foundation for the third condition mentioned  --  that is , that he hoped it was understood that he was not engaged in making any treaty or b. rgain . Earl Carnarvon said he sought the interview to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon obvious that he wished to give his own views . Replying to an inquiry in regard to the proposal to establish a central legislature , founded upon county boards , I said that I did not think Ireland would accept that as a settlement ; that the central body ought to be a Parliament in name and in fact . having power to deal with the local government of counties . Earl Carnarvou stated that this was his own view , adding greatly to the Weight of Irish opinions . He also suggested basing the Parliament at Dublin upon the colonial model . His opinions upon this point struck me as being the result of much thought and study , I remarked that the Protection of certain Irish industries from English and foreign competition would be absolutely necessary . The Earl replied : ' I entirely agree with you , but what a row there will be in England . ' I then left , believing that we were in complete accord upon the main outlines of a Plan for the settlement of the question of the Government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed his views upon the Cabinet and that many of his colleagues shared his views ; also that the Earl resigned the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland because we did not give the Conservatives a majority at the pulls . I spoke at Wicklow and acted during the elections under the impression that I had gained from that interview . " Mr. Parnell , in au interview this evening . said he did not intend to issue a manifesto yet , but after the dissolution of Parliament he would deliver addresses at Dublin and Cork , in which he would fully enunciate his views : Mr. Justin McCarthy has furnished for publication a letter in which he says : " A friend of Lord Carnarvon 's came to me and told me that Lord Carnarvon was anxious to learn Mr. Parrnell 's views on the subject of the government of Ireland . He asked if I would see the Earl first . A t his instance I saw and had a long interchange of ideas with Lord Carnarvon . It would not do him the slightest injury with any class of Englishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace yard . The result was that I promised to ask Mr. Parnell to meet Lord Carnarvon . Mr. Parnell preferred not to meet him at an intermediary 's house . The Earl readily assented to Mr. Parnell 's wishes and a meeting followed at the former 's residence . I was absent , but Mr. Parnell 's description of the interview exactly corresponded with my clear recollection of the conversation which I myself had had with the Earl . I explained to him clearly that Ireland did not desire the repeal of the union , but would not be satisfied unless she was granted her own Parliament . Lord Carnarvon replied , speaking only for himself , that he was prepared to go as far in the direction of home rule as Parnell or myself desired to go . The Earl asked for a second interview with Mr. Parnell , but I learn that they did not meet again . " .

The Gladstone Ministers seemed to be ashamed to converse with Mr. Parnell unless closeted secretly with him . " Mr. Gladstone was asked in the House of Commons this evening by Mr. William Johnston ( Conservative ) if it was true , as reported , that the Earl of Aberdeen , Irish Viceroy , during his recent visit to Cork , had knelt at the altar of the Catholic cathedral in that city . Mr. Gladstone replied that it the Earl of Aberdeen had done the kneeling of which he was accused he ( Mr. Gladstone ) was not aware of it . He added : We must decline to institute an inquiry into such a question . It lights the fire of religious discord . I can say , however , that I have never known a better Christian nor a more perfect Protestant than the Earl of Aberdeen . " The House agreed to give the Government business precedence during the remainder of the session . Mr. Gladstone , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the reassembling of Parliament , said : " I wish to restate clearly what I said yesterday respecting the reassembling of Parliament . If , when the elections are over , it be found that the country does not approve of the policy of the Government respecting the future government of Ireland , or if there remains room tor doubt on the question , then the new Parliament will be assembled forthwith . " Mr. Chamberlain 's electoral manifesto was made public this evening . It declares that the Government 's Irish proposals have been condemned in advance by every Liberal statesman of tile century . " What the Liberal leaders last November solemnly and seriously declared unsafe , " continues the manifesto , " the . Premier has now undertaken . * * * The Irish landlords , of all the classes affected , are alone subjected to exceptional consideration . * * * Englishmen are told that the act of union was due to shameful corruption . It is to he hoped that the act of separation is not to be purchased by the most gigantic bribe ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The alternative proposals increase the number of occupying owners of land , establish a complete system of popular local government , alike in its main features for England , Scotland . Ireland , and Wales , enabling each to exercise greater influence in its local administration and in legislation for their special needs and requirements , with the . Imperial Parliament supreme over all . This will satisfy the national aspirations of England and Scotland ; Ireland 's national aspirations are not stronger , nor are they entitled to any more sympathy . " Mr. Chamberlain dwells upon the fact that the Government has made no attempt to deal with Matters which Mr. Gladstone 's election manifesto declared were rine for legislation . " The Government , " Mr. Chamberlain continues , " came into office upon a resolution that immediate legislation would be enacted for the benefit of agricultural laborers.but it has not tried to fulfill its pledge ; and Parliament is to Gs dismissed because a majority of the English and Scotch members refuse to accept proposals which are not supported by any section iu the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gladstone recently described as marching through rapine to the disintegration of the empire .

Referring to the Irish question , he says that he believes the choice lies between coercion and a large measure of autonomy for Ireland , and that be prefers the latter policy , " Although , " he says . " I supported the second reading of the Home Rule bill , 1 do not agree with the home detail* or Mr. Gladstone 's scheme , Still , I believe that the Irish are entitled to elective control of Irish affairs . Until the Irish question has been settled , progress in the direction of local government reform will be impossible . " Lord Iddesleigh has issued a manifesto in which he says : " The coming general elections will be of supreme importance . If a home rule and radical majority be returned , bound hand and rout to Gladstone and Parnell , the results to the empire may be very serious , perhaps irreparable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he summarily handled . It behooves Conservatives to do their utmost to prevent Gladstone from getting 250 seats In addition to the 86 Parnellites .
