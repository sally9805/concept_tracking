txt The danger of losing Republican Congressmen and members of the Legislature , in close districts , Is seriously aggravated by the Dian upon which Mr. Cameron 's Chairman , Mr. Cooper , is directing the canvass . Mr. Cooper 's anxiety is simply to serve Mr. Cameron , and therefore to accomplish the election of Gen. Beaver . In pursuit of this object , the enormous fund derived from assessments is being freely poured out for the subsidizing : of the county newspapers throughout the State . Those who will print the matter sent them from Cooper 's " literary bureau " ale paid for its insertion , if necessary , and scores of them will make something neat in this way . Loaded up , however , with extreme statements in behalf of Beaver and bitter attacks upon Senator Stewart and Independent Republicans generally , the effect is to widen the breach in the party and endanger the local tickets . There are sonic htgeny honorable exceptions to the rule , but as a general thing the county papers have permitted themselves to he used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are now feeding the flame of distraction with all the fuel they can carry . Several of them are in the control of Postmasters or other Federal officers ; the " regular " organs in Lehigh , Franklin , Cambria . Crawford , Somerset , and other counties are of this sort , and their vehemence is especially notable . At Johnstown a few days ago the Postmaster 's newspaper refused to even allow its " , job offire ' to print hand bills for an Independent Republican meeting . The consequences of this extreme policy are not hard to predict , and they will he exhibited in a division on local tickets in many eases where harmony might have been had . But Senator Cameron 's anxiety Is all on account of his candidate for Governor and the Senators who are now to ho chosen , and his State Committee therefore takes little account of anything else . A great deal of Republican wreckage is likely to follow this desperate method of procedure .                @ @ @ @ @
