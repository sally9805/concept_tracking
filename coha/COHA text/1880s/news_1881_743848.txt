txt There is certainly something wrong in the condition of the country when so great a man as Senator CONXLING can resign and be beaten for re-election and things go on just as though nothing had happened . Mr. CONKLING 'S resignation was a bolt out of a clear sky . It was the most portentous event of the nineteenth century . For a moment of time , as it seemed to Mr. CONKLING 'S friends , the World stood still . Undoubtedly , the resignation of a Senatorial seat is an uncommon think . Mr. EUGENE CASSERLY , a Senator from California , resigned his place , but he had not long been in Congress , and the cares of office sat heavily upon him . Other Senators have given up their seats to accept Cabinet positions or foreign appointments . But here was a man who was in the midst of a third term of Senatorial duty , strong in his position , and a leader in the party which was about to take command of the Senate . No wonder there were presages of commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personage stepped down and out of the Senate . It is not surprising that his adherents prophesied strange things as about to happen when the great man threw down his commission . They rushed into the markets to see what turn stocks would take , and they were ready to profit by the panic which was sure to follow . It was immediately proclaimed that this decisive and sensational action of the great Senator would involve the Government in chaos and political ruin . The resignation of Mr. CONKLING was to be followed by those of Postmaster  --  General JAMES and Vice-President ARTHUR . This would necessitate the reconstruction of the Cabinet , as its homogeneity would be thus destroyed and its harmony forever broken . It was even possible that the President , dismayed by the confusion and turmoil which his tyranny had precipitated , would throw down his staff of office and go back to Ohio . None of these things have come to pass . To the astonishment of thinking men , that sensitive barometer of public affairs , the stock market , did not show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise as ever , and as if no such man as ROSCOE CONKLING had ever been heard of . One sage of the stock market , when asked what effect the great event would have on the state of the market , said that he did not see why it should have any effect , as nobody , so far as he knew , knew anything about the financial opinions of Mr. CONKLING . The Senate of the United States did not adjourn out of respect to the marvelous deed of the departed Senator , - but finished its work , confirmed the appointments which had caused the row , and then went decorously home to its farms and local politics . The President 's Cabinet did not fall to pieces , but , with a stolidity which aroused the indignation of many able politicians , held fast to its integrity and serenely proceeded to business . The VicePresident , to quote the word of Mr. Senator SUMNER to Secretary STANTON , " stuck . " The stars did not shoot madly from their spheres , nor did the suu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate occasions . There was no strange commotion in the streets of this great City . The village life of the interior portions of the State flowed on with characteristic sluggishness ; and when the nights grew warm , James Augustus leaned over the front gate and whispered soft nonsense to Maria , just as though ROSCOE CONKLING had not resigned his seat in the Senate , and the place which had known him knew him still . But worse remained behind . The world had revolved on its axis , and the tides of ocean had ebbed and flowed . as of yore , when the great man left his seat . The political earthquake so confidently predicted did not arrive . The explosion did not take place . The upheaval did not upheave to any perceptible extent . What was the matter ? Had the great man made a miscalculation ? An experiment would ' determine this . He condescended to go to Albany and show himself to his expectant people . He would stand on the balcony and beckon with his august finger . He went , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left behind . It was bad enough that there should be no convulsion . natural or political . when the resignation burst upon us like a thunderbolt ; but that the great man should be told that he need not trouble himself any further about the Senatorship seemed a truly monstrous thing . What were the great man 's feelings when this awful information broke into his long-sealed egotism can never be known . But , according to all predictions , humanity should have shuddered , and Nature from her seat give signs of woe that all was lost when impious men told Mr. CONKLING that he might stay out of the Senate . When this brief turmoil is over , men will begin to gather up such lessons as may be learned therefrom . But one that lies on the surface and in the easy reach of every man is this : No man is indispensable to his country or his party . We might go further and say that no man is indispensable to anybody or anything . Widows console themselves and marry again . Fatherless children find new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopped twig will grow again . And even maidens who have attempted felt ' de se when bereft of a faithless lover have speedily forgotten the recreant one and have married and lived as happily all their days as if he had never been born . To pass from small things to great , the Russian Empire stands just as firmly as it did before the Czar was taken from it by death . There was a perceptible jar of the Governmental machinery when ABRAHAM LINCOLN fell at the shot of the assassin , and timid people thought that the end of all things was at hand . But , in a few hours , the wheels revolved again , a new President sat in the seat of power , and , to some sensitive souls , it really seemed as if the great political system of the Republic moved on with indecent haste . It is a sad thing for a great man to find out how small he relatively is . It is humiliating for any of us to discover how immaterial our activities are to the general sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man must learn this lesson for himself . Unfortunately for Mr. CONSLING , he is taking his bitter lesson in that " keen light of publicity " in which he has delighted to air himself .
