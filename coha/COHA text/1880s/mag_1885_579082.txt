PRINCIPLES OF CRITICISM . THE value that men have set upon art and literature proves that these have ministered to some deep-seated and permanent human desire . What is this desire ? Or if there be more than one , which is the deepest seated and most permanent - in other words , the paramount-desire ? The true answer to this question , if we can discover it , must furnish us with a much-needed test for literary and art values . It must , in short , furnish a basis , and the only correct basis , for the criticism of all literary and art products . For , obviously , before we are in a position to determine the worth of a thing , or the relative worth of any two or three things of the same general sort , we have to inquire , What purpose is this thing intended to serve ? What is it expected to do ? Now it is precisely on this point that there seem to have been very confused ideas among critics , and by this is not meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either for themselves or for others , to form correct estimates of the value , or comparative values , of works of literature and art . Professional critics , especially ( for it is they , especially , who have seemed to feel that they must not trust to their instincts , which would often have done better for them , but must make at least a show of having some well-understood basis of critical principles ) , have apparently been in a position not unlike that of a layman at some mechanics ' fair , who undertakes to pass judgment on a machine of whose purpose and uses he has next to no idea . Perhaps the novel and the poem have been the most conspicuous exampl*s of this failure , on the part of ordinary criticism , to base itself on any clear understanding of what these forms of the literary art are essentially for . One novel will be praised on the ground that it has a moral purpose , another on the ground ( as by that distinguished critic , // November , M. Tame ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground that it paints actual facts from the life , another on the ground that it depicts an ideal world ; one on the ground that it gives pleasure , another on the ground that it gives information : and so on . If the novel has not all these objects in view ( and some of them are a little inconsistent with each other ) , which of them has it ? And if several of them , which object is the essential one , - the one which being accomplished , the novel can not be a thoroughly poor one , or which being unaccomplished , it can not be a thoroughly good one ? So with the poem . The reason that the critics have , through all time , been so ludicrously incapable of making an estimate of any given work of poetry ( except in the case of an imitation , where a verdict on the original had already been furnished them ) that should be corroborated , unless through accident , by the test of time is that there has been no clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Is it to move us to " pity and terror , " and at the same time do to these feelings some ambiguous thing which Greek scholars never have been exactly able to make out , as Aristotle said ; or , is it to " please , " as everybody else has always said , till De Quincey blew one of his withering blasts at that shallow notion , but as the average critic apparently still continues to believe ? Is its true function best fulfilled by being so intelligible that everybody can understand it , or by being so unintelligible that nobody can , except the poet himself , and he only before it gets cold ? Is it true that a poem can not be a true poem unless it is " short ; " or are we still permitted to believe that the Iliad is , after all , a sort of poem ? In seeking for reliable principles on which just criticism may be based , we must , if possible , find those which are broad enough to include all art . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For literature is , in fact , one of the fine arts . Not everything that is written , of course , belongs to literature proper ; but when a written product becomes a part of what has well enough been called belleslettres , - as a poem , for example , in contradistinction from a Patent Office Report , - it belongs to the art of literature , and is closely allied to the other fine arts ; giving us , like them , that immediate and direct satisfaction of a high order which we call aesthetic pleasure , or delight . Literature , as we shall see , gives us much more than this , but this it gives us in common with the other arts . If , then , we ask for a test or criterion for art in general , the reply may be made , The true test is that it shall be beautiful . But the underlying question is , What is " beauty , " and what things are " beautiful " ? Evidently beauty is not a simple quality , apprehended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " though it has sometimes crudely been so considered . It is plain enough , on reflection , that beauty is a complex thing , and requires analysis . All great works of art , and especially of the literary art , are more than merely beautiful , but we may first of all investigate this quality . Let us take , to begin with , as the simplest of the arts , that of visible form . Its simplest element is the line ; then the curved line , as of the mountain or wave outline . Its highest and most complex product is the statue , or group of statuary . The writers on *sthetics , in their attempt to furnish an analysis of the beautiful , have seemed to hover at a greater or less distance around a central idea , none - unless it be Mr. Herbert Spencer , whose views have been expressed only in scattered suggestions - precisely hitting it , and yet few being far away from it . We mean the idea // that beauty gives us activity of mind and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variety in lines as an element of their beauty . The waving line , or undulating curve , he calls especially the " line of beauty , " because it gives the eye much variety of direction without displeasing it ( without hindering it , we should prefer to say ) by sudden changes of direction , Sir William Hamilton , in likewise attributing the effect of beauty to the union of variety with unity , explains our delight in it by the fact of its giving full play at once to the imagination through variety , and to the understanding through unity . Alison , att1*ibuting the entire effect to the association of ideas , makes beauty to consist in the power of giving active emotions , as of cheerfulness or sadness , and of awakening trains of corresponding ideas in the mind . Mr. James Sully points out the imperfection of this theory in its exclusion of the element of direct aesthetic pleasure derived from color , form , or tone . Mr. Herbert Spencer , following a hint derived from Schiller , considers the authetic activities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic pleasures according to the number of powers called into activity : the lowest being the-pleasure of mere sensation , as from tone or color ; next , the pleasure of perception , as from combinations of color , or symmetries of form ; and highest , the pleasure of the aesthetic sentiments proper , composed of multitudinous emotions excited in the mind by associations , some of them reaching far back in the race experience of man . The central idea , round which these and other theories cluster , is that of increased activity as the essential effect of beauty on the mind . In the two arts of form and of tone , the simplest elements - the straight line and the single tone - may be considered as correspondent . For the tone differs from mere noise in being produced by periodic vibrations , so that in its apprehension our consciousness is continuous ; whereas in hearing a mere noise , owing to the interferences of the jumbled vibrations , our consciousness is interrupted and intermittent . Precisely so , an irregular and confused multitude of dots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in visible form ; while a continuous row of dots , that is to say a straight line , would be a tone in form . In the tone as in the line the consciousness is unhindered and continuous . Again , just as we may have a noise of tones which , although musical tones separately , are clashed together in discord , so we may have a noise , so to speak , of lines clean and straight in themselves , but thrown into a tangled mass which the eye can not follow . Rising a step higher , we have the curve in form , answering to the melody in music . In either case , its effect is a succession of changes of impression , but of such a nature that the consciousness may be continuous in apprehending them . A jagged and irregularly angular line , on the other hand , would correspond to a haphazard succession of tones , regardless of the conditions of melodious arrangement , since both produce checks and interruptions of the flowing continuity of consciousness . Hogarth 's line of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , because it gives to conscious apprehension the greatest total of sight activity without check . But a harmony , whether of audible tones or of visible forms , is still more delightful than a melody . Such a harmony of forms we get in the symmetry of two curves above and below a horizontal line , as in the arch of a bridge reflected in a stream , or on the two sides of a vertical line , as in the shapely tree . Its simplest elements might be represented thus : - ( : ) // 668 More graceful still is the symmetry of two undulating curves , answer ( ) ing to each other , and thus furnishing both melody and harmony . And this brings us to the elements of one of the beautiful forms of ancient art . For , joining the extremities of the two curves , we have the , J7 vase . If now we add to each ( ) side another answering pair of such curves , we have it with the double arms of the Greek *Y amphora . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have reached a hint of the very outlines of that which we consider the most graceful of all forms , the 0 human figure . For it would require but slight touches to suggest the head and the IF veritable arms and limbs of the statue . No doubt there is much in the beauty of the human form besides the mere symmetry of graceful lines ; much that depends on the association of ideas , as , for example , the suggestion of force and activity in muscular curves , " Those lines That sweeping downward breathe , in rest , of motion . " The important thing to notice is that just as the simple grace of the mere outlines is explicable through their ministering to sight activity , so the complex beauty is woven of a thousand threads of vague suggestion , all linked with ideas of health and strength and mysterious life-functions , and so all centring in the satisfaction of the one desire for full existence . But complex as the quality of beauty is in the actual human figure , it is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue which was merely an exact copy of life - a photograph in marble - would not by any means give us all the iesthetic delight of which art is capable . November , . In fact , it would not be art at all . It is only when the artist bodies forth some conception of his own mind that we are greatly stirred . Then , besides the immediate beauty of the melodies and harmonies of lines , and the mediate beauty , through associated ideas , of the supple and forceful forms , we have in some pathetic or heroic group in marble a world of quickened thoughts and feelings . In one of Wilhelm von Humboldt 's Letters to a Lady , he says , - " The beauty of a work of art is , for the very reason that it is a work of art , much freer from imperfections than nature , and never excites selfish emotions . We observe it attentively , we wonder at it more and more , but we do not form any connection between it and ourselves . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so finely of the stars : We never desire the stars , although we take such pleasure in their ' light . ' Now the explanation of this superiority of art to nature , aesthetically , is to be found in the fact that any personal relation to self narrows and lessens the spiritual activity . And the same explanation is applicable to the connection of testhetic pleasures with the play impulse . For the compelling of any impulse toward the accomplishment of some set purpose must confine its force . The stream of spiritual activity is controlled into some single channel , and there is no longer that free swing of all the powers which is the essence both of " play " and of testhetic delight . In other words , if we enjoy play more than work , and art more than nature , it is because we have through their means a greater total of conscious life . The art of tone has this advantage over the arts of painting and sculpture as the direct source of power upon the spirit , that music is a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " symphonies of color , " as has been imagined , for the reason that nowhere // in the world is color naturally ( as distinguished from artistically ) employed to express anything . Tone , on the contrary , is universally so employed . Mr. Spencer , in his Essay on the Origin of Music , and elsewhere , has admirably shown how this expressive use of tone runs through all the higher grades of the animal kingdom . When the dog barks or howls , and the bird pipes or complains , and the child sings or cries , it is the beginning of music . For it is the beginning of the use of tones to express feeling . Ordinary human speech is not speech alone , conveying ideas , but music as well , conveying feeling . If we listen to an animated conversation from an adjoining room , where the articulation of words is not quite audible , we shall find that it is song , rather than speech , that we hear . The voices go up and down the gamut , the intervals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The staccctto , highkeyed utterances of pleasure ; the slow , minor cadences of sorrow ; the deep monotone of determination ; the tremolo of passion , - all these are nothing but the song within the speech . Whenever speech ceases to convey merely cold intellectual ideas , and becomes emotional , the voice tends more and more toward song , ranging more widely through the gamut , and taking on the cadences of music proper . Perhaps even among the very elements of speech , in the vowels , namely , we have the beginnings of music as expressive of feeling . For while the consonants seem to be mere checks or interruptions of the breath , expressing the limitation of our consciousness to definite ideas , the vowels are pure tones , each having a natural pitch of its own ( which one may readily detect by whispering them loudly ) , and expressing the play of feeling upon these ideas . This may possibJy help to explain the ablaut , or change of vowel to express tense in the verb ; as , sing , sang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hy the effect of the ancient reduplication ; but it sometimes happens in philology , as in society , that one cause gives rise to a form , and another makes it permanent . At any rate , the present fact is that , while the consonants remain the same in the different tenses in this example , as expressing the unchanged idea of the action , the vowels change , as the attitude or feeling of the mind toward the action changes , whether present , or just finished , or wholly past . The reason , then , that music has a much greater direct power over the feelings than any other art is that mu*ic alone is based on a natural means of emotional expression . But its power of expression does not stop with the feelings . Inextricably bound up with every human feeling is a host of ideas associated with it in the mind , - for every feeling a host of ideas , for the reason that the possible feelings are few , while ideas are innumerable . Accordingly , music , whose power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresse different ideas to different persons , or to ourselves at different times , - according as the particular emotion is associated in experience with one set of ideas or another . The sonata which to an Alpine goatherd would express a thunder-storm among rocky peaks to a sailor might with equal distinctness express a tempest at sea . The larger and deeper the life experience of the listener , the more a symphony will mean to him in ideas ; or the fuller his emotional endowment , the more it will mean to him in feeling , - always provided that it is a great work , a work of genius , to which he listens . Of course much can some out of a symphony only if much originally went into it . The secret of all art is then within the reach of our hand when we have realized one single fact concerning man . As we look out upon life we see its myriad activities all springing from certain desires . But there is one desire // among them which is permanent , and paramount to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it often overrides that ; it is not the desire for mere happiness , even , for it often overrides that . It is the desire for life : not the poor negative desire to escape death and cling to existence , merely , but the aspiration for full and abounding life . To be alive in every faculty ; to have the greatest possible total of conscious being , in physical impression and effect , in intellectual force and grasp , in emotional glow , in the out-stream of the active will ; in short , completely to be and live , this is the one paramount human desire . There is only one thing we really dread : it is death . There is only one thing we really desire : it is life . And now where is there to be found a perpetual source of this power and activity that we perpetually desire ? Nowhere but in the expressed power and activity of other human spirits , - and that is art . We have seen that in their very elements the arts are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form consists in giving the sense of sight its greatest total of unchecked apprehension ; and the beauty of tone , both in those consecutive harmonies which we call melodies and in massed harmonies , in giving the sense of hearing its greatest total of uninterrupted impression . And when we pass beyond mere sensuous delight we find the same essential effect - but on the mind now , and the whole soul - from the ideas and feelings expressed by the artist . The test , then , for all art is that , expressing much life , it shall give much life . That painting , statue , symphony , is the greatest which adds the greatest total to our conscious existence . But we must mark well a distinction here . There are higher and lower grades or planes of existence . But by what test ? By no other than this same test , - their tendency for or against renewed and in-November , creased life in the whole nature . That pleasure is low which tends to belittle the nature ; that one is high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which only stimulates feelings and ideas most apt to brutalize ; that is to say , to restrict and narrow ( for that is the distinction between brute and man , - the one little , the other large , in powers and possibilities ) . That art is high which awakens feelings and ideas that are vital with tendencies toward more and still more of attainment and being . And here we see the distinction between mere prettiness and genuine beauty . A patch of color on the wall may be called pretty , as pleasing the color sense alone ; still more so , if it gratifies also the form sense by its outline . But it falls short of beauty because it fails to awaken in us any of the higher activities of our inner nature . Decorative art is only pretty ; it touches but the surface of the mind . Decorative poetry , in the same way , suggests only pretty images of color or form . We pass along a picture gallery , or we turn the leaves of a volume of verse . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question is , What does this give me ? It may be that it gives the imagination some pretty image of nature . This is something . It may be that it gives the feeling , also , some touch of suggested peace or tranquillity . That is more . But if it be a great picture , or a great poem , the whole spirit in us is quickened to renewed life . Not only our sense of color and form , our perception of harmonious relations , but our interest in some crisis of human destiny , our thought concerning this , a hundred mingled streams of fancy and reflection and will impulse , are set flowing in us ; because all this was present in the man of genius who produced the work , and because his " expression " of it there means the carrying of it over from his spirit into ours . If it is a work of the very greatest rank , we are more , from // that moment and forever . For out of the life the artist or the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life perpetually . The art of literature is the highest of the arts because its power of expression is greatest . The effect of music may be more intense , at a given moment , but its range is not so wide , nor its effect so enduring . And poetry is the highest form of the literary art , by our test , as having the fullest expressive power ; since it not only expresses thought , like prose , but feeling also . That poetry contains in itself the elements of the lower arts a moment 's reflection will show . In the first place , it contains the elements of the arts of form , of which sculpture is the purest example . For it conveys a troop of images , appealing to the inner eye , instead of the outer . In the second place , poetry contains the elements of music . For in its rhythm , its rhyme , its music of many sorts , a succession of melodies and harmonies are heard ; by the inner ear , when read silently , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most fitly used , therefore , when it is used for the expression of thought and feeling together ; of thought , in other words , which is aglow with feeling , and feeling which is illuminated by thought . It is equally an impertinence to use the verse form - that is , the musical form - for dry , cold ideas , or for mere vague feeling , unlighted by thought . The former is for speech unaccompanied by music ; the latter is for music unaccompanied by speech . A man may say - not sing - a mathematical demonstration ; he may sing - not say - an outburst of emotion . For this reason , instruments are better than voices for great music . Or if the voice must be used , it is best if the words are in a foreign tongue which is unfamiliar to the listener . In this way the speech element of an opera , nearly always foolish , is concealed ; and the music element , when really good , has its opportunity . It is conceivable , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed and seemed on the verge of accomplishing ) an action so high , expressed in speech so noble and significant , that it would not belittle its accompanying music in making it limited and definite in its suggestion . A good deal of our modern verse errs in the reverse direction ; that is to say , it is mere music , - flowing rhythm , and sounding rhymes , and a pretty babble of insignificant " words , words , words , " - expressive , thus , of some vague atmosphere of feeling , without any thought . But this would have been more fitly expressed in music proper ; it is only a part , and the lesser part , of the requirement in poetry . In illustration of the statement that poetry contains in itself the elements of the arts of form , as giving a succession of beautiful images , we may take a single passage from Longfellow 's Evangeline . Here , close together ( using the poet 's own words ) , we have the morning of June with its music and sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusky arch and trailing mosses of the cypress , the moonlight indistinctly gleaming through the ruined cedars , the pendulous stairs of the grape-vines with humming-birds rising and descending , the measureless prairie at night with the fireflies floating above it , the southward rivers running to the sea side by side like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations . Moreover , each idea brings with it to the mind a complex of associated thought and emotion ; and not merely from onr own individual life experience . The human race has come a long way . As we read the line in the Lady of the Lake , " When danced the moon on Monan 's rjll , " it is not alone the intrinsic beauty of the scene that interests us . We could imitate the effect , so far as the bodily eye is concerned , by a candle glancing on a scrap of crinkled tin . Nor is it // any definite association of our own past enjoyment in connection with such a scene . There are associations - as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define ; faint reverberations of whole *nons of human , and perhaps of animal , experience . The deep forest was once full of the dread of unknown dangers and the expectancy of unknown delights ; the shadow of the mountain had for man the chill of supernatural visitations ; by the moonlit rill the savage - and , ages before , the wilder creature of the woods - sought and slew his prey , or sought and won his mate . To illustrate the inclusion of the elements of the art of tone , also , in poetry , we may take the same poem , Evangeline . To begin with , the metre is music . The accents , following each other in rhythmical order , give us not only the element of time , such as a metronome would give , but a veritable tune , as well . If we recite the line , - " When she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music , ** we find not only that it is capable of being written in bars of j time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the accented tones are given on a different pitch , each dactyl making a cadence , or phrase , of three different tones . These lines of English hexameter ( that is , accent hexameter ) seem to follow each other like ocean waves on the shore . rhe first half of the line is the wave rolling in ; then it pauses , toppling into a crest , and crumbles down into foam in the last half . As we might represent it , - iRolling , then rearing its crest , and foaming and falling in thunder . So wave after wave of the sonorous verse rolls in , timing itself ( as Dr. Holmes suggests of another metre ) to the very ebb and flow of our blood and our breathing : a phrase to each pulsebeat , and a line to each breath . INovember , The rhyme system of verse , again , is entirely music . There are three sets of rhymes , in reality : the initial , or consonant rhyme ( or alliteration ) ; the medial rhyme , or chime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the final rhyme . We may note , first of all , that as in rhythm , so in rhyme , we have the principle that lies at the foundation of music , - unity in variety ; the greatest total of conscious impression being received through chords , - that is , through a variety of tones made possible to apprehend by their relations of agreement , or unity . If we take the old couplet ( which is truly poetry , too , as being wise as well as musical ) , " Love me little , love me long , Is the burden of my song , " we notice first , as most obvious , the final rhyme . The books define rhyme badly , as being the agreement between two sounds . That really makes but half a rhyme . We must have the difference , as well as the agreement ; the variety , as well as the unity . In other words , ong and ong , in this example , are not rhymes : they are identical sounds ; they constitute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rhymes , since now a different consonant precedes each . The initial rhyme involves the same principle , only reversed ; the unity being now in the consonants , the variety in the following sounds . The important part which this initial rhyme plays in verse is often overlooked , from the circumstance that the alliteration is so commonly concealed ; as in this line - " He was already at rest , and she longed to slumber beside him . " The r of rest rhymes with the r of already , the I of slumber with the 1 of longed , and the s of beside with the s of slumber , though all these are concealed to the eye by not being visibly initial letters . This consonant rhyme , by the way , addresses the mind as well as the ear ( as might be expected from the more intellectual character of the consonants ) ; // the alliteration in good verse always striking the emphatic syllable , and ( as Mr. John Earle neatly expresses it ) marking out to the mind " the crests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted . The medial rhyme , or chime of interior vowels , also plays a concealed part in the music of the best verse . Taking again the couplet , " Love me little , " etc. , if we utter the vowels alone we shall hear their chime . Moreover , since each vowel has a natural pitch of its own , by whispering the vowels in these lines vigorously , we shall hear a distinct tune of different notes , which might be written upon a staff in musical notation . The best verse in which to study these various musical elements is that of Mother Goose . And this for two reasons : first , because it is a kind of profanation to make a corpus vilum of good poetry for dissection ; and secondly , because the lines of Mother Goose have been preserved purely on account of this very perfection of musical form , having had no other , or little other , raison d ' *tre . Out of thousands of jingles repeated to children , the fittest only have survived , and these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer shell of poetry is concerned . A college class , for example , in studying verse with a thoroughly scientific analysis , could not do better than to provide themselves with copies of this immortal bard for class-room use . If one were to exhaust completely the possibilities of analysis of , say , this quatrain , " Old King Cole was a jolly old soul , And a jolly old soul was he He called for his pipe , and he called for his bowl , And he called for his fiddlers three , " he would know a great deal about the very imperfectly understood science of English verse.1 1 The work of Sidney Lanier on English verse may be recommended as the only one that has ever made any approach to a rational view of the But a genuine poem , while containing ( by its images to the inner eye , and its music to the inner ear ) these elements of the lower arts , goes beyond them in expressing more fully than any other form has been found able to do the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way it stands as the highest species of its own - which is the highest - genus , the art of liter. ature . And the other - the prose - forms of literature must be ranked precisely according to this power of expressiveness . We might draw off in a tabular scheme the different forms of literature , classified on this basis . At the bottom we should have those written works which are books , indeed , but not yet literature ; as the almanac , the arithmetic , the receipt-book , the text-book on natural science . These , and a vast number of others , do not belong to the art of literature , or to literature prop- - er , simply because they do not express the writer , and therefore have no power ( to come back to our test of criticism ) to stir or quicken the reader . They are merely fact-books . Rising a little higher in our table of forms , we may put down certain books which , though still fact-books , begin to convey something also of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel , or of the higher natural science . They begin to be literature , because they begin to be humanly expressive . A little higher in our tabular scheme will come books of human science , wherein the writer is more apt to give something of himself ( not narrowly , as an individual , but as one representing universal human nature ) together with his objective results . Especially is this true as we rise into the region of the profounder human problems , where our books are fact-books , to be sure , but the " facts " are now of subject . Nor are the standard ones overlooked in making this assertion . // such breadth and importance that we indine rather to call them " truths . " More and more fitly may those works be called truth-books as we rise to the region of litentture proper . Here , also , we classify and rank according to expressive power . The essay expresses more than the history , because the writer is more free to reveal his own inner life in his work ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to what it takes from him . The more life goes in , the more life comes out . And above the essay ranks fiction , on this same ground . And among the different forms of fiction the novel stands the highest , as being the epitome , not only of what the writer has seen , but of what the writer has lived , and been , and now is . Highest of all , as we have said , is the poem ; because here the writer felt the most freedom , and could therefore exert the most power . Keble was perhaps the first to point out that the verse form is not only a concealer , but a revealer . That is to say , it reveals just because the writer felt that he was concealed . The mask becomes itself the most transparent sort of window . And which form of poetry shall we set highest , by our test , - the narrative , the dramatic , or the lyric ? We may be helped to answer this by observing a fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corroborate our view of the true basis of our valuation of literature . It is the fact that just in proportion with the increase of expressive power , in our tabulated scheme of literary forms , goes also an increase in permanence of value in the world . The mere fact-books are superseded , and become valueless . The truthbooks become more and more of permanent value as we rise to their higher regions . And we are most apt to find 1 This bears on the question of the comparative values of natural science and the humanities in education . A fish in a book can be expected to go no farther toward educating a mind than a fish in a pool . It can stimulate observation , and atthat the thing that has survived time and storm in the world 's shifting history is some frail bit of a lyric poem ; because this holds in its crystalline heart the life of a man ; and when we are dead - or half dead - spiritually , out breaks again from the heart of the crystal that spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others we desire . When a mind expresses in a book its mere perception of some external object , it is not yet literature . Before the same object every one 's perception , if normal , would be the same . The expression of it in writing can add nothing to our inner life beyond what the object itself would add . ' It is only when the writer , like the coral insect , builds himself into his work , expressing inner states of thought , feeling , or purpose , either of his own individuality , or , best of all , of the universal human being , that the book becomes literature . Literature , for this reason , always has a " style : " an expression characteristic of the man , the reflex of something his own ; through which , at least , the truth - however universal - had to pass . As in other arts , if a painter exactly represented an actual laughing child , or if a musician exactly copied the wailing of a hurt child , it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us beyond what the external object itself would convey , so in literature , if a poet exactly paints in words a white rose , it may be very pretty , but it is not yet a genuine poem . But let him give us the rose , plus his feeling and thought about it , - sincerely his , but based on what is ours also , and many s universally , - and it is a poem . Or let it be a fact instead of an object , - say , the falling of an apple to the ground in a garden . When a writer describes it just tract a dormant attention , and reveal many interesting facts about the nou-human world , but that is all . Whereas a man 's life in a book can renew and increase the whole intellectual and spiritual life . // as it is , and nothing beyond it , we say it is a " fact " that the apple falls . When he gives it to us plus some activity of his reason which links it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we say it is a great " truth . " And if , in its expression , he adds also the free play of his own mind and feeling upon it , he may give us a work of pure literature ; perhaps - most likely , in this case - a lyric poem . The secret of all art , then , is simply this open secret : that it is the giver of what we most of all desire , abounding life . It draws upon an inexhaustible supply . For it is not merely the artist 's own individual spirit which is imparted to us ; the greater the genius , the more deeply his fountain drinks of the tides of the common humanity . And it is genius alone that knows to stir in us those truths , emotions , impulses , that are wrought into our inmost being by the long race experience . We are seldom thoroughly awake and alive . Like the little fitful spire of violet flame that we sometimes see hovering and playing over the surface of a coal fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise dormant mind : now here , now there ; now sensation , now memory , now one or another of the emotions , starts for the instant into fluttering life , then darkens back into unconsciousness . What we desire is the glow and illumination of the whole spirit ; and it is art , and especially the literary art , that best ministers to this desire . It is not enough that a picture , or a novel , or a poem , should move us : the question is , What does it move in us ? flow much of the whole possible range of our inner life does it awaken ? Nor is mere intensity of impression any sufficient test . For one must inquire , Whither does this tend , - toward further renewal of full existence , or toward reaction and stagnation ? Some feelings 675 are kindled only to smoulder away and leave dead ashes on an empty hearth within the spirit ; others tend to kindle on and on , awakening thought , rousing to vigorous action . Nor are the most easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art and literature . Laughter and tears lie on the surface of the mind : the gleam and the dusk may interchange quickly at any passing cloud . It is the great motive powers down deep in the soul that most contribute to abounding life , and whose awakening most surely proves the presence of genius : the sense of right and justice ; the feelings of pity , awe , aspiration ; love , too , - not the sodden sort of love , which is dear to the decorative poets in their maudlin moods , but mother-love , and father-love , and menschen-liebe , and kfve of friend , and lover 's love , that desires not selfish possession , but the infinite welfare of its object , and for this will die or will live . The test , then , for literature , as for all art , is its life-giving power . In the essay , for example , perfection would consist in giving us , through that free and unpremeditated play of* the whole bevy of spiritual faculties ( which is the characteristic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind 's lighter and leisure hours . In the novel , it would consist in imparting to us profound life-truths , pure emotions , noble intentions , in connection with the opportunity to r&amp;live , or live in imagination , the most significant experiences of human existence . In the poem , the requirement is that it shall be full of lovely images , that it shall he in every way musical , that it shall bring about us troops of high and pure associations , the very words so chosen that they come " trailing clouds of glory " in their suggestiveness ; and in its matter , that it shall bring us both thought and feeling , for whose intermingling the musical form of speech alone is fitted ; and that , //
