txt Last week Friday a detective arrested in this city a young man named Griffin Forwood on a charge of conspiring to murder a farmer named Thomas S. Elder . The local papers at the time devoted a large amount of space to Elder 's story , as it was sensational in the extreme . His statement was substantially as follows : Young Forwood , impelled , by a strong infatuation for Elder 's wife , had , in order to get him out of the way , not only attempted to assassinate him on three different occasions , but had tried to hire a negro named Tomlin to aid him in killing Elder and kidnaping his wife . The negro , Tomlin , asserted that orwood approached him and offered him money to aid him in his plot , that he , ( Tomlin , ) with a desire to expose the crime , pretended to enter heartily into the conspiracy , and that Forwood then instructed him to meet him at a railway station , whence they were to proceed to Eastwood , the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that on leaving Forwood he immediately placed the story iu the hands of the Police , and in consequence of his and Elder 's charges young Forwood was arrested as he was about to take the train . When Forwood was presented to court he was put under $5,000 bonds , and the case was continued until today . He is a young man of excellent breeding , and belongs to one of the wealthiest families in Jefferson County . Forwood , immediately after his arrest , ergaged counsel , and the latter set to work to make up the defense . In the brief period of a week he has succeeded in unearthing evidence which not only clears his client , but which shows that the only conspirator in the case is Elder himself , and that the charges against Forwood are trumped up as a cloak to conceal the machinations of the accuser . It eppears that some years ago Samuel F. Tucker , the father of Thomas S. Elder 's wife , died , and by his will left his large and valuable estate to his four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were to die without issue , their portion was to go to the other children . Two of them , Hiram Tucker and another , died without children and their property , under the provisions of the will . went to the two remaining , Mrs. Thomas Elder and Clarence Tucker , a young lad then at school . Before his death Hiram Tucker sold his interest in the estate to a man namea Forsyth , giving the latter a fee simpie title , and invested the proceeds in other lands . After Hiram died Thomas S. Elder brought suit affainst Clarence to obtain control of the latter 's property , but failed . On leaving school Clarence sold his life interest in the property to W. H. Forwood , father of Griffin . If Clarence were to die his entire interest in the estate would revert to his sister , Mrs. Elder . Evidence was produced showing that during the past two years persistent attempts have been made upon Clarence Tucker 's life . He has been shot at in his bedroom , and witnesses testified to the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed a gun was firs d at him , the bullet penetrating the bed-clothing. but , fortunately , doing him no injury . Another time he was waylaid at night and tired upon . Finally , believing his life to be in imminent danger , he left his home in this county and went to Nelson County . While there , the family with which he was stopping was aroused in the middle of the night by a loud knocking at the door , and on opening it a man was found who asked to see Clarence . The latter went to the door and found it was Elder . The latter tried to induce him to go out doors . but Tucker refused , and Elder went away cursing . Since that time Clarence has been hiding , in constant feat ' of assassination . The story of Forwood 's infatuation for Mrs. Elder will be disproved by showing that the accused was but five years and six months old at the time of her marriage . So all apparent cause on Forwood 's part for putting Elder out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show very conclusively that Elder 's motive in accusing Forwood was to divert suspicion from himself as the would-be assassin of young Tucker .
