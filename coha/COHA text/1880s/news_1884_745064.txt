txt The House continues to turn out tariff " copy " for the Congressional Record in regular and large installments , and of the usual character  --  not interesting nor valuable to the student of the subject , but worth something to the readers whom it ultimately reaches . Mr. MCKncLEY. of Ohio , Republican , and the highest of high protectionists , made a long speech against the Morrison bill yesterday . It contained the usual stale attack on those who wish to reform the war tariff  --  that they are working in the interest of England . This species of abuse has ceased to be offensive . If Mr. still clings to the notion that the average American , whether manufacturer , workman , or consumer , can not hold his own in dealing with Englishmen , but must be restrained by the superior wisdom and experience of Mr. MCKINLEY and his friends , no argument will enlighten him . But he must not himself take offense if we say that members of Congress are the last men to whom the public would be likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not reputed to be of a higher grade of intelligence or business capacity or personal disinterestedness than their fellow-citizens . If any business firm in the country were to intrust its affairs to them , judging by the way in which they deal with the questions before them , it would go to the bad in a very short time . There is not a bank in the Union that would not be broken in six months by the Committee on Banking and Currency or the Committee on Coinage of any House these last halfdozen years , if those committees acted on the principles they have adopted in public business . The pretension of the politicians that the people of the United States require to be held in leading-strings by Congress , to avert disaster to either their purses or their credit , is very insolent and very absurd . Another point made by Mr. MCKMLEY against the Morrison bill is that it is not a careful revision and adjustment of the tariff , but is ? an arbitrary reduction of 20 per cent . in everything but the schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S idea is of scientific adjustment . He showed it in his attempt to get special favors for the steel manufacturers in the last House . The charge of arbitrary reduction comes with ill grace from the advocates of the revision of last year . If the relative rates of taxation were , as was then claimed , properly adjusted by that measure , they are not less so under the Morrison bill , for the relation of the rates is not changed except by the fixing of maximum rates for cottons , woolens , and metals . As a matter of fact , the adjustment is bad , but it was bad before last year , and was made more complex and mischievous by the bill of that year . The whole work of the commission and of Congress regarding it was delusive and , in a sense , fraudulent . Undoubtedly it ought to be done away with ; but if that had been attempted , the cry would have gone up from the extreme protectionists , and Mr. ** voice would have made the loudest contribution to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own cowardice and stupidity , the Democrats are not upsetting even the most obvious and odious evils of the tariff , but Mr. MCKINLEY and the little clique he represents should for very decency refrain from blaming them for not doing so . The criticism of this clique is , in a sense , worthless , but it at least serves to attract attention to their ridiculous inconsistency .
